      <P>The Taoiseach has done me the courtesy of explaining that he does not intend to make a statement this morning.  Perhaps it would be as well if he so informed the House.  When will the Minister for Justice make a statement to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I had hoped to make a statement to the House before the Recess on the Government's position in regard to the hunger strike in the Maze Prison. I have decided that it would not be wise to make a public statement at this time lest anything said might adversly affect any settlement hopes, however slight.  It is with regret that I have taken that decision. I would have wished to say something in this House before the Recess but I feel there are dangers involved and so long as there is a possibility of settlement it would be wrong to say anything.  With regard to the Minister for Justice, it is proposed to make a statement later today, the time and arrangements to be agreed by the Whips, possibly at 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very agreeable rumour circulating around the House that we are adjourning until 20 October. <Col N="982" /> Perhaps the Taoiseach would confirm or deny that.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1981. - Financial Resolution No. 9: General (Resumed):</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to Customs and Inland Revenue (including Excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say while the Taoiseach is still in the House that it is well known that he gives in to pressure.  This Taoiseach will change direction almost daily in pursuit of policy, giving in to one pressure or another.  He reminds me of the hare at a coursing meeting&mdash;I am glad to say I have never attended one but I understand the hare changes direction at every stop.  If I were to call the Taoiseach &ldquo;Garret The Hare&rdquo; I might be summing up the way he will be behaving as leader of this country.</P>
      <P>During the recent election campaign the Taoiseach promised benefits which, according to our figures, would cost between £800 million and £1,000 million. While the Taoiseach denied these figures he never once stated what it would cost to implement those promises.  At the same time he was saying that the financial situation was very bad and he would have to wait to see what he could do when he got into office.</P>
      <P>Last night I referred to the Fine Gael advertisement which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday, 9 June, in which Fine Gael nailed the first lie.  The first lie with a nail through it was &ldquo;Huge increases on petrol, beer and spirits.  Fine Gael will strictly control the price of these items&rdquo;.  That was the first lie, but who was lying?  One of the first actions of this Government was to hit these items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> There is no doubt that the people will see through the integrity of the promises of this Taoiseach.  He was very fond of using the word &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; when in opposition. The way the nation's finances have been criticised must have undermined foreign investment.  Later in the year, possibly around September or October, it would be interesting to find out how many projects which were before the IDA had been held up as a result of these criticisms.</P>
    <P>I heard on the radio this morning that through the IDA there are 11 electronic industries starting here.  Everybody knows that over the last four years foreign investment in the electronics industry has been enormous and many others industries are also affected.  It would be interesting to know whether people who had been in contact with the IDA have held up their plans due to the lack of confidence in the country expressed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Regarding public service staffing, we are all aware of the great increase in our population which resulted in the necessity for 18 extra Deputies in this House. We will need more teachers and more schools to cater for our young people and considerable increases will be necessary in certain sectors of the public service. We are still waiting to hear whether the Government intend to proceed with the recruitment of 2,000 extra garda which Fianna Fáil had given a commitment to recruit.  In the announcement of cut-backs the Government have not been specific.  They speak of vacancies occurring in the public service through natural wastage, but in reality this means a cut-back because the increasing needs of our growing population must be catered for by the public service.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of some of the Independent Members of this House leaves a lot to be desired.  From the point of view of those who elected them, they are trying to have it both ways.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of Tuesday, 21 July carried an article on Deputies Sherlock and Kemmy.  Regarding Deputy Sherlock it stated as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> The mini-budget to be introduced today has been termed a &ldquo;class budget&rdquo; by Mr. Joe Sherlock, T.D., of Sinn Fein, The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>Already, he said, the policies behind the budget had been condemned by the ICTU and the trade union movement. His party was opposed to these anti-working class measures in the Dáil, the factory and their affect on working-class people.</P>
    <P>The mini-budget was about taking money from some people and not taking it from others.  The working class would pay the bulk of the money the Coalition now wanted.  Once again, the accumulators of wealth in our society would get off lightly.</P>
    <P>Mr. Sherlock said that media speculation had failed to pin point the only fair way of raising the money needed &mdash;and that was to tax the wealth, property and idle agricultural land. The Labour Party's silence on the issue of direct versus indirect taxation was a scandal.</P>
    <P>There were alternatives to taxing the working class.  These were a direct tax system with employers, farmers, and self-employed being taxed at the same rate as PAYE workers, and with taxes on wealth and property.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock is quite right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil ran away from the implementation of such policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He told his supporters that he was against the Government's proposals but nevertheless he supported them by abstaining.  Deputy Sherlock is much more an Independent than Deputy Kemmy, who makes no apology for walking through the lobby in support of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Briscoe is all that Fianna Fáil can provide to speak on this issue, is it any wonder that people would not vote for Fianna Fáil?</P>

    <Col N="985" />
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard Deputy Kemmy as a member of the Labour Party and I predict that before the end of this Dáil he will formally join that party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put my prediction on record.</P>
      <P>One of the points made by the leader of Fianna Fáil during the election campaign in regard to the payment of £9.60 to the wives of taxpayers was that this would be a very clumsy scheme to administer. I understand that wives will qualify for this payment only if they opt for it.  I see the Taoiseach shaking his head.  Am I then to understand that it will be compulsory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The option is the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the husband opts to give it to the wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the option is the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the wife opts for this £9.60&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have made himself aware of the facts before standing up to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the wife had to opt for this £9.60 but the Taoiseach shook his head to indicate that this was not so.  When I said that if the husband opted for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is totally confused.  The money is payable unless the wife opts not to take it.  If the Deputy had read anything about our proposals he would know this.  Obviously he has not read them.  He has already stated that we have not given costings, but the costings are set out in full.  I will send him a copy of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked one of the <Col N="986" /> Ministers of State about costings he was not able to answer.  I will be interested to compare projected costings with actual costings if and when the promises are implemented.  The average two-monthly electricity bill will be increased by between £16 and £24 for most families. The average family now receive a bill of between £60 and £80 every two months and many bills are much higher than that.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil greatly improved the equity of the taxation system.  We reduced income tax by £500 million in the past three years and abolished residential rates and motor taxation.  We provided a special PAYE allowance of £600 for 750,000 PAYE tax payers and we intended to retain this.  These new charges, the health charges, the levy, plus the 3.75 increase, plus VAT will bring in £340 million from the PAYE sector as against £17.9 million from the self-employed and £15.2 million from the farmers.  The PAYE sector will have to pay most of the increases.  A person earning about £5,000 will have to pay an extra £11 per week, a person on £10,000 will pay an extra £14.80 per week and so on. There is no question but that this is a deflationary budget which will increase unemployment and will reduce incentives and growth.  The Taoiseach will further aggravate matters.  As his policies fail to take hold he will switch from one track to another.  I have seen the Taoiseach at close quarters over a number of years and he will not be able to take the pressures.</P>
      <P>The supposed reduction of £116 million in the budget deficit has been bought at a high price.  We were well on the way towards having a 2 to 2½ per cent growth rate this year but this will be stopped.  We will have stagnation in the first six months of Coalition Government.  I understand that normally half year measures can be and are taken by various Departments in holding up further expenditure but the kind of tax measures introduced have far exceeded what is necessary.  It does not matter what we say here, ultimately what counts is how these measures will affect people.  Governments are not elected they are rejected.  Unfortunately there will be a lot of suffering before this Government are rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> As winter approaches, I am deeply concerned about the high cost of heating and I appeal to the Taoiseach to have a look at the fuel voucher system in order to help the people at the lower end of the scale.  We should operate some sort of a means test for old people living alone. They need more heat than younger people and even on a day like this old people are using their fires.  These people should be aided as heating is necessary to sustain life.</P>
    <P>We may score political points off each other here but the important things are employment prospects and how lives are affected.  So that young people will not become completely disillusioned with the democratic process we have a responsibility to provide job opportunities for them.  Initially we may have to borrow in excess of our means to procure employment and to build up industries and we should do so.  Years ago we could educate our young people for export and they could find jobs in other countries.  That is no longer the case as other countries have their own problems and highly educated young people cannot find jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Taoiseach, through the Minister for Justice, will say whether or not the former Minister's announcement of May of this year in relation to an extra 2,000 gardaí will be implemented and these gardaí recruited.  Judging by the number of gardaí I see outside of Leinster House the Taoiseach believes in the security of the State and I applaud him for that.  It is the basic right of any citizen to walk the streets in freedom without fear of attack.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have trotted out the usual comments about the increases in the price of beer and spirits but the aspect of the budget with which I am unhappy is the increase from 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the duty on motor vehicles.  Quite a number of people engaged in the car assembly industry and in the servicing of vehicles will be affected.  The extra cost for spare parts and so on will make people reluctant to have their cars serviced regularly <Col N="988" /> and they will try to cut down on servicing.  For instance, people might use tyres longer than they should because of the cost factor so there is a danger not only to life and limb but to employment in that sector.  When one looks at our streets today jammed with cars, on roads inadequate to carry them, one realises the massive employment content of the car industry, far beyond what it might appear on the face of it.  The growth of little backstreet garages is enormous, garages where one finds two or three mechanics working.  But when one totals up all these little back street garages and the people employed in them one realises there is a vast number.  I would estimate that they would amount to thousands.</P>
    <P>We feel very strongly about social welfare benefits.  We have never apologised for increasing those benefits even when people accused us of increasing them beyond our ability to pay for them.  We make no apology for making the lives of the elderly and the less well off in our community somewhat easier.  That is our philosophy and has always been our policy. We have stated in this House many times that the old age pensioners and social welfare recipients have always done better under Fianna Fáil.  What we say now is, at a minimum, please preserve their standards of living because, as a result of this budget their standard of living will fall substantially.  We say please keep it at least on a level with inflation.</P>
    <P>We await with interest details of the cutback in investment in semi-State bodies to the tune of £135 million.  I understand that investment is to be held up. Perhaps the Minister for Finance could tell us something about that.  I see the Minister for Finance putting his hand to his head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the unintended emission that came from the Deputy's back pocket that caused me to put my hand to my head rather than the quality of his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister for Finance will tell us also when the 1 per cent employment levy is to be imposed, <Col N="989" /> for example, whether it will be imposed this year.  He says there will not be much of an income yield from it in 1981 so I would assume he plans imposing it this year.  Then there is the 2½ per cent health contribution.  I do not know whether he announced when that would be levied.  I know he said something about introducing legislation after the summer so I would imagine that that would be in October or November.  However, it is interesting to note that if these taxes, which they are, are levied the other famous taxes which &ldquo;the socialists&rdquo; on the other benches were seeking will have to wait until next April.  There are many people dependent on this State to keep the wheels turning in education and employment.  In his budget speech the Minister said a fraud was being committed on our young people by incurring debt that would have to be repaid by workers in the future.  At present we have a very high number of dependents and it must be remembered that they need housing as well as the education and employment about which I have spoken.</P>
      <P>Deficit financing is needed now, particularly during the recession.  I do not think young people will thank this Government if, as a result of their financial measures, they are denied employment opportunities simply because the Government were unwilling to borrow the necessary money.  I do not think any young person would resent repaying the State by tax in the years ahead when he is working for having given him that education and employment opportunity.  Indeed, in communist countries they will not allow people out of the country once they have got their education at the expense of the State because they recoup their investment directly in that way.  I do not think there is any harm at all in borrowing money to secure employment opportunities for young people in the future. Therefore, in certain circumstances, we have said that one can borrow to work one's way through a recession.  Those are the ABCs of economics many people understand and the practicalities are evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within a very short period of time &mdash; I mean within 18 months &mdash; the practical <Col N="990" /> policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government just gone out of office will be evident for the people to see.  Subsequently at the next general election they will make their decision and we shall abide by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a crisis situation and anyone who pretends we are not or seeks to evade the fact betrays those who gave them their mandate to sit in this House.</P>
      <P>This Government are determined to resolve that crisis.  For crisis it is and it is no less.  It must be faced with resolution and with the courage required to overcome it.  This resolution must include the determination to sweep away make-believe, pretence and evasion.  The crisis will go away only if we drive it away.  As Taoiseach I am placing confidence in the people.  I am placing confidence too in the people's elected representatives to do their duty on the people's behalf.</P>
      <P>The issues before us should be faced and discussed without party political rancour and we have endeavoured, both in my broadcast and in the Minister's budget speech, to do this &mdash; to an extent that has indeed evoked some surprise from people who had expected us to deploy on these occasions the very live political ammunition available to us.  We understand that the vast majority of people are fair-minded, sensible people who look to us for honest analysis and action in respect of our economic and social problems, and not for political point-scoring however attractive that may be to us within the walls of this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put the simple, stark facts before the people.  They are unpleasant and unpopular facts but they must be faced.  There is no political advantage to any Government in coming to the House with unpopular measures.  There is no political profit for the Government in what they are doing.  We have proposed this supplementary budget only because we are satisfied that our economy is in a crisis and that the urgent corrective measures it contains are necessary, and we have staked the life of this Government, <Col N="991" /> within three weeks of its formation on this conviction.</P>
    <P>Today I am not going to speak about the question of responsibility for the position we are now in.  I will leave the history books to be written some time in the future by the economic historians. This is no time, in my view, for indulging in the luxury of irrelevant party political debate about who did what or when or what they should have done.  I know there are people on the benches opposite who share the Government's view of the seriousness of our situation.  There are people outside this House who want to destroy this House.  If parliamentary democracy here fails to respond to its challenges and solve its problems it will fail here as it has failed elsewhere.  Nature abhors a vacuum and there are forces here very ready and willing to fill that vacuum, as we all know.  And if we fail to act we will be permitting that to happen and those who have persistently plotted to subjugate to their wills the free institutions of this State will finally have had their way.  The truth is &mdash; and we must all face it on all sides of this House &mdash; that Governments of all parties have been losing credibility.  That credibility must be built up again.  We can pass our resolutions and enact our legislation here but we cannot get things right unless we in this House have the support of the people. We cannot get to where we all want to go unless the people understand the measures necessary to get there.  If we are to restore credibility we must begin by stating the position as we see it, the truth as we see it.</P>
    <P>In 1970 after nearly 50 years of self-government our national debt was £1,000 million &mdash; as against £8,000 million by the end of last year.  During that first 50 years we &mdash; and in using &ldquo;we&rdquo; in what I am about to say I am using it in relation to the parties on both sides of this House, to our democratic system as a whole &mdash; during those first 50 years we, together, had established the State, come through a civil war, through the depression of the thirties, and the Economic War; we had survived an international war; we had built from the ground up our industry, so <Col N="992" /> that by 1969 our industrial exports exceeded our agricultural exports; we had opened up our economy to free trade with the United Kingdom; we had maintained our parity with sterling; we had moved towards the elimination of emigration, our current deficit had been kept at zero; our balance of payments with the world was in order.  We had brought our international credit to the first rank, where it could withstand questions from any source.  All of this was done over 50 years at an average annual borrowing rate at home and abroad of about £20 million.</P>
    <P>Between 1970 and 1980, over a mere ten years compared to the previous 50, we&mdash;again I make no distinction of parties&mdash;multiplied that debt eightfold so that at the end of 1980 it stood at £8,000 million.  The average annual borrowing of £20 million of the first 50 years had increased in these ten years to an annual average figure of £700 million, or by a multiplier of 35, a figure far transcending the relative inflation rates of these two periods.</P>
    <P>More than that.  During that first 50 years we, the democratic parties who alternated in Government in this House kept our foreign national debt down to a moderate figure.  In 1974 such foreign debt was £312 million.  At the end of 1980 it was more than seven times greater and the gross foreign debt was over £2,000 million.  This year even after the budget measures it will be over £3,000 million and we will have added to our foreign debt an amount three times the amount we borrowed abroad over the first 50 years.  The annual cost of servicing the foreign debt is now equal to the entire official foreign debt in 1974, seven years ago.</P>
    <P>How is this cost borne?  Who pays for it?  It must be paid for by the Government out of taxes.  Resources which otherwise would be available to the taxpayer for investment or expenditure or to the Government for improved services have to be transferred abroad; by the end of this year almost one-ninth of our taxes will be going straight to foreign bankers who pay no taxes into our Exchequer in return.</P>
    <P>We are in a crisis situation.  Our excess <Col N="993" /> Government expenditure is now flowing over into excess national expenditure on goods and services abroad on a massive scale as an estimated deficit of £1,500 million on our balance of payments for this year indicates.  As Senator Whitaker has pointed out in a recent speech, even allowing for the productive use of some of the extra resources being imported in excess of the value of our exports &ldquo;we are living about 10 per cent beyond our means&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This country needs development and needs growth.  In no other way can we provide for the future of our young people. It is equally evident that out of our own domestic savings we cannot generate the growth we need.  We can tolerate&mdash;indeed we require for finance&mdash;moderate deficits in our balance of payments, something perhaps of the order of £300 to £400 million at present values.  The difference between such figures and what we are experiencing at the moment is a measure of the present excess.  As Senator Whitaker said, we are indeed living about 10 per cent beyond our means and we must all ponder on the significance of this judgement.  That 10 per cent has to be eliminated and our consumption and production brought more nearly into balance. The fault must be corrected where the fault began&mdash;in the Government's own finances, the imbalance in which is the root cause of this external over-spending. The current deficit in the public figures must go&mdash;in a planned way over a four-year period.  Inexorably, reality must be brought home to all our people who have been carefully sheltered from the truth for so long.  All whose duty it is to know the facts must do the further duty of making the rest of our people aware of them.  That duty falls to all of us, the Opposition as well as the Government. We have to do this in a calm and firm way and in the national interest with as little political point-scoring as possible.</P>
    <P>One of these facts which has to be brought home is that our incomes have been rising much faster than in other countries with whom we compete in producing goods and services.  As a result in Ireland unit wage costs in manufacturing industry have risen by 74 per cent <Col N="994" /> between 1975 and 1980 compared with 13 per cent in Germany, 30 per cent in the Netherlands, 37 per cent in Belgium and 41 per cent in Denmark.  There is no need for me to spell out that we are pricing ourselves out of our markets with consequent loss of jobs which in the past year has been on a massive scale.  This reality has to be faced, by all who have any responsibility for determining income levels.</P>
    <P>Our population is rising, with 73,000 births each year exceeding the number of deaths by almost two-and-a-half times. With that increase there is an evident need to provide for these new citizens. We are not facing that duty.  In failing to do so, we betray them&mdash;the children of the nation.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the terms of our international trade are worsening and are likely to continue worsening; that is to say we are having to pay more in exports each year for the imports we need.  This has been more than absorbing the limited increase in the volume of our domestic output, leaving us with a net reduction in real purchasing power.  Even if we were to accept no increase whatever in our real disposable incomes per head, namely our living standards, and so far there is no sign of this being accepted, we would need more production, more growth, to meet the needs of our increased population and to cover the increased cost of imports relative to exports.</P>
    <P>For some time past we have been maintaining our external reserves only by borrowing to replace these reserves as we have used them up&mdash;at heavy cost, as we try to keep the show on the road by borrowing billions abroad.  Without decisive action the show will not remain on the road much longer.  Without action the performance would soon be ended and the performers would lose their jobs.  It is here in this House we must take this decisive action while we begin to put things right.</P>
    <P>Something has been made of our growth rate being 2 per cent at a time when it is less elsewhere.  This is true in itself but the Central Bank today suggests a slightly lower figure.  I still think it will be about 2 per cent but if our present <Col N="995" /> borrowing was used productively this growth should not be 2 per cent but 5 per cent to 6 per cent, on any normal return on investment at national level, comparing ourselves with countries nearby.  This contrast between what is and what should be in relation to the return on national investment is a striking measure of our failures, perhaps in many ways the most striking and points to one of the areas we must tackle, securing that our national investment, above all our public investment, yields adequate return to us.</P>
    <P>A 2 per cent growth rate is not only inadequate to meet our population growth of 1½ per cent per annum.  It is even less adequate to meet the need for increased employment &mdash; a need which in Ireland is currently three times the Community average.  For in addition to our population increase, more young people are entering the employment market, more married women are seeking employment, and emigration has stopped.  Recession in other countries has been a factor in this and has indeed with other factors led to net immigration.  The outflow from the education sector into the labour force is now in excess of 50,000 per annum.  Even allowing for vacancies occurring through death and retirement, in order to provide viable jobs for these young people, we need policies yielding growth several times higher than that being achieved at present.  The kind of growth we ought to be getting with the level of national investment presently undertaken but are not getting.  In fact our real growth, taking into account the worsening of trading conditions &mdash; terms of trade &mdash; of 1.8 per cent a year over the years 1973-80 gave a <i>per capita</i> growth rate of .3 per cent.  You might reasonably say that during this period we had stagnation hidden and camouflaged by foreign monetary borrowings.  The borrowed money went down the drain through holes in the pockets of the people. We have had mounting debts abroad; stagnation, conflict and discontent at home.  Can anyone doubt there is a crisis, the need for recognising a national emergency?</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to refer to <Col N="996" /> the comments made by international agencies on the state of our finances and our economy.  The OECD in their July 1981 Economic Outlook made it clear that where public sector deficits are persistently high, resolute measures are called for to curtail such deficits.</P>
    <P>This budget has balanced the need to reduce a public sector deficit that was clearly persistently high with the need to avoid reducing it too quickly and, thereby, risking the danger of a self-defeating rise in unemployment.</P>
    <P>While talking about OECD views on policy action I must mention the OECD attitude to raising the growth potential of the economy and reducing unemployment. They state emphatically that &ldquo;boosting investment in physical and human capital must be the key objective of economic policy in most countries to assure both the more vigorous expansion of productive potential and the creation of adequate new employment opportunities&rdquo;. They recognise the difficulties of achieving such an expansion in current circumstances of relatively weak demand growth and limited pressure on existing productive capacity.</P>
    <P>They recommend as positive steps, changes in the relative price of energy to enterprises, a restructuring of fiscal systems to aid investment by firms, and measures to improve the quality of training, and responsiveness of labour markets. Translated to Irish conditions this budget responds to these three requirements. It has reduced the price of energy by the cut in fuel oil tax to manufacturing industry, it has shown that restructuring of the tax system will take place as quickly as possible, especially for the manufacturing and tourism industries and has shown the Government commitment to providing employment and training for young people through the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency and the funding of its effects work on an enormously expanded scale by additional tax.  These show the Government's concern to increase investment and employment by positive, innovative, action in conditions where our room for manoeuvre is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> The EEC Commission in their report to the last European Council singled out for special mention the particular risks that &ldquo;follow from the failure so far of several Member States to progress with urgently required public finance and income stabilisation measures&rdquo;.  In a related section of the report the countries are identified by name and include ourselves. They stated that &ldquo;these failures weaken the cohesion of the European Monetary System&rdquo; and none of us is so naive as not to know what those words signify.  They recommended &ldquo;to these countries accelerated programmes of economic adjustment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The message for Ireland is clear.  The EEC has seen our public finances as being out of control.  They have seen wage increases here as being out of line with those of our EMS partners and have scarcely disguised their recognition of the possibility of a devaluation of the Irish pound if corrective action were not taken.</P>
    <P>The Government would have been irresponsible had they not responded to this advice.  The budget represents the first step.  Its essential objective of bringing control into our public finances will be clear to our European partners and to international financial markets.  We have set a firm basis for a solid economic adjustment that will preserve our international financial standing.  We must, however, recognise that while the measures taken will be seen as a step towards fiscal control we must now tackle urgently the problem of income stabilisation.  I will return later in my speech to this critical subject of incomes increases.</P>
    <P>The advice I have quoted from OECD and EEC is supplemented by that which was received from our own National Economic and Social Council.</P>
    <P>In the NESC Report, &ldquo;Economic and Social Policy 1980-1983; Aims and Recommendations&rdquo;, the council stressed that it is not possible for the time being to maintain the rate of improvement in living standards that has been achieved in recent years.  They also stated that there must be an equitable sharing of the burden of this economic setback until the <Col N="998" /> recession eases and the economy improves.  They recommended specifically that priority should be given to safeguarding and improving economic competitiveness; that progressively more of Government expenditure should be financed from current revenue with a view to elimination over a fixed period of the current budget deficit and that the current balance of payments deficit should be reduced to a supportable level. In reviewing particular policy possibilities in relation to these aims, the council recommended that the growth in real incomes per person employed should reflect more closely the growth in output per person.  I cite this report as indicating a broad support for the view which the Government have put forward as to the necessity to bring the public finances into order.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the strategic objectives of this budget.  But first, I want to clarify once and for all one matter that has come up in this debate.</P>
    <P>The allegation has been made repeatedly&mdash;one morning paper reports it as having been made ten times by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;that this is a monetarist budget.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  As those who have used the term must know the central tenet of monetarism is that the way to reduce inflation is through control of the money supply and that fiscal policy should be geared to that end.  This budget is not geared to the production of a particular money supply figure and this Government rejects the monetarist approach to the reduction of inflation.  Indeed the approach as set out in our programme, with its emphasis on price norms and the voluntary co-operation of the social partners in arriving at moderate pay increases, is profoundly non-monetarist; I could even say anti-monetarist.  It is, and always has been, accepted by all economic schools, including the Keynesian, that when the balance of payments deficit and the current budget deficit become excessive, corrective fiscal action is appropriate.  That is what this budget has done.  The principal objective of this budget is to bring the public finances under control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> That they are out of control is clear from the fact that a planned £515 million current budget deficit became a potential £950 million deficit, the figure presented to us when we came into office; that potential capital spending would increase by £240 million over planned expenditure; and that the planned Exchequer borrowing requirement would rise from 13 per cent of the last budget to an actual 20 per cent.  These figures speak for themselves, particularly when we realise that these excesses on the planned figures emerged in the five months between the last budget and the change of Government.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Opposition should oppose what we are now doing to bring the public finances under control.  We are essentially engaged in bringing expenditure back towards the course they originally planned&mdash;we cannot go all the way back because of the deflationary effect&mdash;as appropriate for our current economic and social circumstances. I have no doubt that if they were in Government&mdash;and a number of Opposition Deputies have already said this &mdash;they would have had to take measures to bring order and control to expenditure programmes which were clearly exceeding the limits they had originally decided were the limits we could sensibly and safely afford.  I would emphasise that it is this Government's view that even if these limits had been adhered to the country could not have sensibly and safely afforded them.</P>
    <P>Our economic approach is not a deflationary, monetarist one.  Under our proposals, the current budget deficit will still exceed by nearly £300 million the deficit our predecessors fixed only six months ago.  When the current deficit of £515 million was fixed in the January budget it was stated to be part of a policy to reduce the deficit annually until it is finally eliminated.  There is, therefore, on the record no difference in principle between the Government and the Opposition on the undesirability of a large and increasing current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, doing what the Opposition, when in Government, <Col N="1000" /> wished to do and stated they wanted to do in the best interests of the economy. They stressed six months ago that it was important that the borrowing requirement for capital productive purposes should not be eaten into by excesses on the budget limits set for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have acted to restrain the uncontrolled growth in the current deficit.  We have not cut it back recklessly and ruthlessly but have reduced it carefully and selectively by some £160 million of potential expenditure.  On any objective economic analysis&mdash;including the analysis made by the Opposition in their own January budget&mdash;the deficit should be reduced to nearer the original planned figure of £515 million.  The Opposition might have criticised us for not going far enough in bringing things back to what they said was proper six months ago, but the Government's approach has been to balance the need for a reduction in the current deficit with the need to maintain employment and essential services.</P>
    <P>We think we have got the balance about right, despite some criticism from economists that we should have gone further. The reduction in the potential deficit this year and the measures we are introducing to bring greater control over future expenditure will enable us to bring about the steady curtailment and eventual elimination of the current budget deficit which all Deputies over the years, in Government and Opposition, have agreed is essential for the fastest possible rate of economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to capital expenditure. Here again we have not adopted a deflationary stance.  In fact, we are proposing to spend some £64 million more than was planned six months ago under the January budget.  That budget provided for what was described as an unprecedented investment expenditure representing an increase of 36 per cent on the 1980 level.  I think everyone realised that in undertaking an investment programme of that size and the borrowing it entailed we were moving close to the limits of what we could financially and physically undertake in a single year. We have now left that investment programme <Col N="1001" /> £64 million above the level proposed in the January Budget.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, therefore, that we are not merely spending as much as that proposed to be spent on the original investment programme of our predecessors but are adding certain essential items to it.  In particular we are adding another £30 million to local authority housing and I am sure this is an addition which every Deputy will agree with.  I have heard no dissent to this point.  In examining the capital budget, we discovered that inadequate provision had been made to maintain the level of local authority housing which was falling sharply and we have acted promptly and decisively to remedy that omission which could be so damaging economically and socially.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy of the budget, therefore, has been to lay the foundations of greater economic and social growth by bringing wasteful Government expenditure trends under control and by redirecting available resources into productive investment and the creation of permanent employment and earnings.</P>
    <P>We have struck a balance in our expenditure measures which ensures that the forward momentum of the economy will be ensured and given a sounder basis. In striking this balance we have held to what is still a dangerously high level for the Exchequer borrowing requirement. The Exchequer will still have to borrow this year 16½ per cent of GNP, which is the highest borrowing requirement it has ever undertaken.  This dangerously high level of borrowing is acceptable only because it is a substantial reduction on the 20 per cent of GNP we were faced with before the measures taken in this budget.  It is as substantial a reduction as can be tolerated without risking deflationary effects that would run counter to our growth policy.</P>
    <P>No permanent and sustained economic growth was possible when we were faced with the crisis in the public finances and in the mounting external deficit which threatened the stability and solvency of our economy.  The order we have now started to impose on the public finances for the remainder of this year will enable us in 1982 to redirect our limited <Col N="1002" /> resources further into the expansion of our economic capacity and employment.</P>
    <P>Already the measures we have taken will have beneficial effects on employment. The additional capital expenditure we have authorised, and in particular the additional £30 million for local authority housing, will give increased employment, where employment was disappearing under the previous Government.  The 50 per cent relief for manufacturing industry of the excise duty on industrial fuel oil will reduce annual manufacturing costs by £6 million.  This, taken with the measures we will introduce to reduce the PRSI contributions by the manufacturing and tourist industries by £28 million, will start the process of making these industries more competitive &mdash; the sure and only basis for increased output and employment.</P>
    <P>We will also establish the Youth Employment Agency through necessary legislation which will be introduced at the outset of the next session of the Dáil. Work has already begun on this.  This is another step in our concerted attack on unemployment, particularly unemployment among the young.  For this Government employment is the primary objective of economic policy and the measures taken in this budget and the other measures to be taken under the Government's programme form a comprehensive and coherent programme to attain that objective.</P>
    <P>The budget also provides increased incentives and aid for the farming sector. There has been an exceptional squeeze on farm incomes over the past two to three years which has shaken the confidence of many farmers in the future of their industry.  In the two-year period up to the end of 1980 farm incomes fell in real terms by some 40 per cent as farmers were caught between the moderate price increases agreed in Brussels &mdash; and even negligible price increases &mdash; and escalating input costs caused by the inflation which was allowed to become rampant in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Government have given priority to the restoration of the confidence of farmers in their industry.  The Minister for Agriculture has this week secured the <Col N="1003" /> agreement of the EEC Council of Ministers for an aid programme of over £65 million for Irish farmers, covering interest rebates for development farmers and an extended drainage programme in the west.  The budget also provides that farmers will be shielded from the increase in the 10 per cent VAT rate by raising the VAT refund for farmers to 1.5 per cent and by reducing the effective VAT rate on agricultural contractor charges to 3 per cent.  Additional funding for the Farm Modernisation Scheme is also being provided, as well as for the new grant scheme.</P>
    <P>These are the initial steps in the Government's programme for agriculture. We will be moving at the earliest possible stage to implement the other elements of the programme.  The Government are determined to provide the conditions in which our most important industry can achieve increased production and prosperity.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to a critical element in any Government's approach to economic management, the question of sustainable incomes increases.  This budget has been criticised as leading to a higher rate of inflation and thereby jeopardizing the prospects for future reasonable pay settlements.  Now is not the time to dwell in detail on future pay talks, but I believe it is essential for me to spell out clearly the Government's view of the interaction between the impact of this budget on inflation and the scale of future pay increases.  I have stressed the limited room for manoeuvre available to the Government in increasing revenue and this has undoubtedly led to a higher impact on prices than might otherwise have been possible or desirable.  More important is the Government's view of where they will go from here in reducing the rate of inflation, in achieving greater equity in the tax system and in securing an acceptable rate of pay increases.</P>
    <P>The Government's joint programme spelled out the approach to our second major task of reducing inflation and this approach was reiterated by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech remarks on incomes policy.  I want to underline <Col N="1004" /> here the reality, which few people can now doubt, that the biggest and most permanent reduction in unemployment is through a reduction in our inflation rate to EEC levels as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This reduction in inflation involves two elements: greater equity in the tax system to bring about a distribution of income that is not only fair but is seen clearly by all our people to be so, and a process of bringing realism into pay negotiations such that we concentrate not on a linking of wages to prices now, which simply leads to a spiralling inflation as has been proved over and over, but on a view of the rate of inflation that will exist when the pay increases to be negotiated are actually coming into pay packets.</P>
    <P>Turning first to tax equity, I want to reiterate that the direct tax improvements promised by this Government will be made at the earliest possible date, namely, with effect from the start of the next tax year in April.  I also want to make it clear that I intend to ensure that the other measures such as capital taxation mentioned by the Minister will be introduced by this Government as soon as the complex provisions to do so equitably can be framed.  I believe very firmly that discussions on pay must take place in a climate where both workers and employers accept that the Government are undertaking a restructuring of the tax system that is acceptable to both sides and I intend to see that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>The pay negotiations I speak about must take place in a new and different climate of expectations.  If we look back, money income per employee in the non-agricultural sector of the economy in the 1973-80 period rose by almost 18 per cent a year as compared to the <i>per capita</i> growth figure of real purchasing power per head of 0.3 per cent.  We simply cannot sustain the enormous disparity between these developments in output and in incomes.  Essentially this disparity has stemmed from a level of expectations fuelled both by a false conception of the real rate of growth that was taking place and a false belief that we can compensate ourselves for externally-generated price increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> Another dimension of expectations is the link between actual or past inflation and future pay increases.  This does not make sense either for the country or, more important, for prospects of creating new jobs or preserving existing jobs.</P>
    <P>This budget, then, is the first of the Government measures to set an economy on its feet again, back to a growth rate than can provide employment for those who seek it.  There will be other measures and each will have its cost.  The need for bearing that cost in the national interest will have to be widely understood by the nation if in the end the national aim is to be achieved.  Without the nation's support, no Government can achieve their aim.</P>
    <P>I do not ask for political quarter nor do I offer political quarter and I do not propose to reduce the political heat.  I ask for a redirection of that heat to the usefulness, the timing, the appropriateness of measures or to the absence of such measures. I am sure our debates will remain robust and this is as it should be.  Robust and relevant debate which does not hark back unnecessarily to the past&mdash;and we have endeavoured to set some examples in that&mdash;should serve to improve our decisions and to strengthen the significance of this Dáil, and the significance, standing and credibility of the public representives in the Dáil.  At its best politics is a noble profession of service and we must seek to the best of our ability, without lessening the understandable sense of loyalty to our respective traditions which animate us, together to inspire our people to increase their commitment of service through our free institutions.</P>
    <P>I cannot feel there is any real disagreement among the parties forming this Government, Fianna Fáil or the Independent Members present in the House as to our aim to achieve in this State a just and free society in which the full human potentialities of all can be fully realised, the dignity of the individual recognised and the concern and care of the majority institutionally mustered and encouraged by just laws to supply the needs of the disadvantaged minority among us.  Such a society sould be a true community and <Col N="1006" /> might rationally be expected to recognise the claims of the State on behalf of the people upon it as a necessary part of the whole structure of justice.  Such a society was what our fathers worked and fought for&mdash;and which we have not yet got&mdash;and we must not falter in continuing the pursuit of their aim.  If we move towards its attainment we honour not merely their memories; we commit ourselves and this nation afresh to the values to which they committed their lives.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Taoiseach's references just now to the Dáil, Parliament and parliamentary democracy, it was borne in on me that he appeared to have missed altogether the frightening significance of the election we have just fought.  I will simply give my reasons for not supporting either side in this very important debate.  It is not very important whether I support either side or vote against either side.  What is important is the message the Taoiseach has completely missed or failed to understand, and that applies to Deputy Haughey too.  It is that the electorate voted for neither side.  Neither side, the Coalition &mdash; of course we now must accept Labour's disappearance, something outrageous, alas &mdash; nor Fianna Fáil have been trusted by the electorate in a free, open election.  The electorate decided that neither of them have policies worthy of support.  After 60 years of independent Government, it is most distressing. It is the daunting conclusion that must be taken out of the result of the election.</P>
      <P>The Irish electorate are very mature, very sophisticated.  We have seen that on a number of occasions when they have been faced with difficult choices.  They operate under what seems to be a very complex system, PR, but they have succeeded on a number of occasions in operating that system with extraordinary precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What they have told the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition this time is that they are in despair about both policies. They do not believe that either side can solve their problems.  It is serious that this very conscious, mature, literate electorate &mdash; now, fortunately, much more <Col N="1008" /> literate than they ever were &mdash; have decided not to trust either side; &ldquo;A pox on both your houses&rdquo;.  This is the despairing conclusion both sides must arrive at if they give it serious thought.</P>
    <P>But there is something much more serious.  There have been comments on the age of the electorate, 50 per cent of them younger than 25 years.  That is the most frightening statistic of all.  We see an electorate much more literate than in my generation or my parents' generation. Now there are no British Isles, Britain and Ireland, North and South.  Now there is Western Europe.  We have seen representatives of seven Western capitalist countries in Ottawa at last run out of alibis.  Here is the Marxist analysis that at last they would end up tearing each others' eyes out.  That is what they are at in Ottawa.</P>
    <P>What is happening here is a microcosm of what is happening in the capitalist world: the Government are turning on the working class telling them they can have this system: &ldquo;We will have this system at your expense.  You must accept shattering cost of living standards&rdquo;.  That is what is being offered to our people.  I am sorry to say that the youngsters in Liverpool and London in Brixton, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Belfast, Derry and Dublin are telling them they have overstepped the limit and that they will not get away with it.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is one of the most consciously class discriminatory budgets introduced in my time.  The youngsters are in the streets.  In Dublin they have been on the H-Blocks issue.  The H-Blocks are not the real reason.  That is an excuse for them to try to discharge their terrible sense of disappointment, frustration, disillusionment, anger, resentment, hatred of the kind of system which subjects them to the humiliation of having spent years going through an educational system which has promised them a brave, bright new world, but when they have spent their years going through the system all that is being offered to them is the humiliation and degradation of the dole queue and rejection by society.  We do not need them.  This budget will increase <Col N="1009" /> the number of people unemployed. There is no doubt about that.  Under the rule of the Opposition we had 120,000 or so unemployed and, without a doubt, that figure will go up.  You cannot take the kind of money the Government are taking out of the economy and ensure that employment will go up.  It must fall. When will they learn?</P>
    <P>I have to compliment the young man who produced this budget, Deputy Bruton, on the clear and convincing way he did it.  All credit to him.  I have listened to variations on the same budget from McGilligan, McEntee, Ryan, Sweetman, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Haughey in their different periods in office as Ministers for Finance.  Time after time after time, these budgets offered nothing except a sense of security to the haves and a sense of rejection and desolation to the have nots.  Was it Mr. de Valera who first said Labour must wait?  Was it ever more clearly demonstrated than in this budget that Labour agreed yet once again in a Coalition Government to wait and wait?</P>
    <P>I have an awful feeling that there is a generation of young Irish men and young Irish women who will not wait, who are in the streets.  I have the greatest sympathy for the Garda who will now stand between them and you people and suffer in consequence because of the deprivation and the humiliation to which you have subjected them and which they will no longer put up with.  It is later than five minutes to midnight.  It is very close to midnight.  Most people watching the situation out there, and in Britain, and in the North of Ireland, and in western Europe, must recognise that we are on the edge of some kind of cataclysmic change in the structures of society.  The great dangers are the ending of whatever real democracy there is in this kind of Parliament and the awful possibilities of another phase.  I watched the rise of the Nazis and the Fascists, and most of Franco's time as a student and later as a young man.  There is the possibility of the development of either right wing fascism expressed, in my view, by the Provisional IRA manipulating the H Blocks marches <Col N="1010" /> in the most cynical way as they are manipulating the poor youngsters dying on hunger strike, or a left wing brand of fascism.</P>
    <P>Unless you people who now lead what are the vestiges of parliamentary democracy succeed in listening to the sounds from the streets and the cries for change, the changes will be forced upon you.  I do not think my charge is unfair when I say this is a discriminatory, class budget. Year after year I have listened to the problems of the less able.  In this budget there is a 5 per cent increase for old age pensioners.  When will the socially dependent classes get justice under your system?  Why should they wait?  They have waited 60 years.  Is it to be another 60 years?  They are getting 5 per cent and 3 per cent.  None of you has the capacity to change places with these people or with the unemployed.  The other day I heard the Minister for Finance say that in this budget an unemployed man with three children will get an increase of £2.50, I think it is.  He seemed to be very pleased.  What the hell use is £2.50 to anyone in the present crisis?</P>
    <P>I talked to a little woman last night at one of my clinics.  Her husband is unemployed. She lives in Cromcastle Flats. She cannot afford electricity to warm her flat and she has an 11-weeks old baby. The corporation say they have not got the money to heat the flats.  This is the kind of society our people are living in, and you offer them 5 per cent having increased VAT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  What makes you think the old age pensioner and the socially dependent classes will not suffer as a result of the increase in VAT which involves increases on virtually every kind of consumer goods?  Why should they be exempted from the right to buy the kind of things we all accept as necessary for everyday living, and particularly in the declining years of one's life?  It appears to me that they are expected by you people to live in a sort of ghetto of despair, neglect and rejection by the rest of society.  It is shameful that you people can accept this kind of two nations or two kinds of society. You have done it for 60 years.  I guarantee that you will not do it for another 60 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I went to the trouble of looking up some figures.  First let me deal with the Opposition.  The general impression is being created by the Leader of the Opposition that there is no need for this kind of change or any kind of change, and that he had no intention of bringing in this kind of punitive legislation, which it certainly is.  I should like to ask the Leader of the Opposition to explain this.  He went for a personal mandate and did not get it.  He subjected his party to the rigours of a general election and they were defeated.  He lost his majority of 20. He lost his party the election and they now find themselves over there in Opposition as a greatly depleted party.  A number of men who were on the backbenches are no longer in this House.  He made this decision to go the the country, without any need whatsoever to do so, because he had another 12 or 18 months or what-ever it was to go.  Will he explain &mdash; not to me; I am still here &mdash; to the men who were here and to his own former Ministers who are over there beside him now, why he took that decision to risk his party, to risk his Government, his own position, his fellow Ministers' positions and those of backbenchers who are around the House touting for seats in the Seanad?  There must be some explanation why he took that decision.  There was no need for it.</P>
    <P>Nobody can tell me that if Deputy Haughey had got back we would not be facing much the same situation with exactly the same conservative attitude to the very serious problems of society.  He would deal with them in much the same way as he did when he was Minister for Finance.  Why should he suddenly become as radical as he protests he has now that he is in Opposition and totally impotent with little power to change society?  Let him riddle us that.</P>
    <P>I make a present of this to the Government. I know the delicate state of support in the Dáil but I cannot see myself, even if there was not the case I have made for not supporting Fianna Fáil on this occasion, supporting a Government led by a man so greatly over-rated as I have <Col N="1012" /> always said he was and capable of making such disastrous misjudgements as he has made in relation to the economy and in his whole political outlook.  This is a matter for his party so long as he stays where he is.</P>
    <P>This is a two-nation society.  There is a very wealthy sector and that sector is represented by the powers on both sides, the powers who control government whether in opposition or in power.  There has been the increase in VAT in respect of ordinary items.  It is 10 to 15 per cent of an increase.  No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I understand this is on everyday items of necessity.  Yet there is no increase whatever on luxury goods, the luxury VAT.</P>

      <P>The trade union movement issued a very useful information book.  In this manual one will get a picture of the other side of the fence from the lady in Cromcastle with the nine-week old baby.  As regards companies, 78 in 1979, profits after tax increased by 32 per cent in 1979 and by 25 per cent in 1980. Dividends in 1979 increased by 31 per cent and in 1980 by 27 per cent.  Profits retained in 1979 was 32 per cent and in 1980, 23 per cent.  Directors' remuneration in 1979 was plus 14 per cent and in 1980 plus 20 per cent.  There is a list of public companies in the second quarter of 1980.  ACEC Ireland, profits after tax £320,000; directors' remuneration £6,000; dividends £151,000.  Arnotts, profits after tax £1,621,000, directors' <Col N="1013" /> remuneration £65,000, dividends £535,000.  Brooks Watson, profits after tax £1,277,000; directors' remuneration £187,000; dividends £447,000.  Brown Thomas, profits after tax £265,000; directors' remuneration £26,000; dividends £74,000 and so on.</P>
      <P>There are also bank profits and the derisive £5 million taken from them.  It would have been better to have ignored it than to have drawn attention to this miserable £5 million taken from them. The pre-tax profits of the two main Irish bank groups for the year ending March 1980 amounted to £82.6 million and the current Irish corporation tax payable was £8.6 million, equivalent to a rate of 10.4 per cent.  I should like to have an income tax rate of 10.4 per cent.  One of the greatest scandals of all is the misuse of our mineral resources.  Tara Exploration and Development Company Limited own 75 per cent of the lead-zinc mine at Navan.  It earned $86.4 million from the sale of concentrates.  This is a raw material which we make little or no attempt to deal with in order to create wealth.</P>
      <P>The great failing of this and previous budgets is that no serious attempt was made by any Government, by their dependence on private enterprise capital, to create the kind of wealth needed to provide the facilities that are required in education, health, housing, the provision of jobs and the protection of the social welfare classes.  This budget does nothing except to protect the have's against the have not's.  There is no attempt to change the policy of the IDA in order to deal with the enormous unemployment figures. There was a time when the late Mr. Lemass talked about being prepared to be judged by his performance in employment. It is very rarely that we hear anything now about full employment. Despite continuous support for agriculture the industry remains one of the most inefficient agricultural industries in western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the very depressing features of political life today is the absence of a serious labour movement.  This trade union information journal dealt with a totally different approach to our social and economic problems from that put <Col N="1014" /> forward not only by this Government but by their predecessors.  The failure of such approach is evident in all of the western European countries in which there is a total of 10 million unemployed.  These are predominantly young people and there is no prospect whatever for them with the exception possibly of those in France under Mitterand.  There is no prospect of any serious inroad being made in the employment situation as a result of the pre-occupation with monopoly capitalism, with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>All of the people mentioned here, Arnotts, Brown Thomas's, Smurfitts, Guinnesses and so on, are concerned only with making enough money to meet the personal needs of their directors. They are not concerned with the creation of wealth to provide for the needs of the mass of the people.  It is evident from reports emanating from Ottawa that these Governments are coming up against the final conflict in which there are shrinking markets with all competing for the same markets.  This is leading to the final terrible conflict.  In the past such problems were solved by wars but one can only hope that the horrific prospect of a nuclear war will prevent that being used as a solution.</P>
    <P>The ICTU have put forward certain proposals for bringing about the kind of society that they would like.  Among these proposals is much greater State involvement, public ownership of the banks, public ownership of the means of production and distribution and exchange together with serious concern for the repercussions of technical development and the necessity to prepare for the need for the acceptance of much greater leisure.  This extra leisure would be brought about by a shortening of the working week to 35 hours, by retirement at 55 with adequate pensions and by longer holidays.  How different is this concern for people by comparison with this book-keeper's budget in which there is no evidence of concern for humanity, as if people were just there to be manipulated and to provide the Taoiseach, who appears to have this obsession with figures without any great pre-occupation <Col N="1015" /> with the repercussions of that obsession on society, with some sort of play thing?</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any realisation on the part of this Government that their function is not only the provision of new jobs but the protection of existing jobs. There is no serious attempt to extend the programme of public works.  At a time of such reduction in consumption and of the difficulties being experienced by Irish industry there is no reason for there not being some form of selective import controls. This budget does not in any way solve the problems of industry.  Neither does it do anything to solve the problems of the people who elected me to this House, though it may solve the problems of those who, I think, elected the Minister for Finance and most of the other members of his party.</P>
    <P>I have been saying all of this for a long time.  I have said it to successive Governments but I have always been ignored. Perhaps, the Minister can afford to ignore me, too, but my feeling is that regardless of whether he may wish to ignore me, that is what he must do.  There are very radical changes taking place in our society and if the conservative parties&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and, I regret to say, Labour, behave as they have been behaving and simply treat this place as a chummy sort of talking shop with pleasant working hours whose real function they appear to ignore completely&mdash;that is the creation of justice within our society&mdash;then they are in for a very rough awakening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution on the educational aspects on this hard and severe budget introduced by the new Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.  It is our contention that this was an unnecessary budget and that the public were conditioned to think that various Departments had been over-spending, that there was to be a colossal deficit on current account, that it was endangering growth in the community and endangering our currency.  Like the famous Goya paintings all the black strokes were in, yet we find the punt at 80p maintaining itself steadily in the EMS <Col N="1016" /> and even the Minister for Finance surfaces like Proteus out of his dark sea and says that there will be a growth of 2 per cent in 1981.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech that the numbers employed in the public sector would be pegged at the numbers obtaining on 21 July 1981.  Education is an area where it is impossible to do that.  One cannot as a responsible Minister for Education say that in regard to any one year, particularly in our circumstances where uniquely in Europe we have a growing population.  A meeting of Ministers for Education of the EEC took place a short time ago and one of the major matters for discussion at this meeting &mdash; and the meetings are rare in education because of the difficulties some countries have with regard to the Treaty of Rome &mdash; was that the big problem for all the members of the EEC with the exception of Ireland is that of falling population, declining population, schools being empty and teachers becoming redundant.  We have the exact opposite position here and consequently no Minister for Finance or Minister for Education can say with any kind of credibility that he can peg those employed in the teaching area at the numbers obtaining at any date, unless he wants to throw the whole education scene into confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our case the numbers are increasing at primary, post-primary and third levels, and I am very glad that the Minister for Education has accepted my commitment. I had 300 teachers trained so that new schedules of employment could be introduced for primary schools to absorb 300 extra teachers in the academic year 1981-82.  Those 300 are above the numbers of people retiring and they are above the numbers necessary for ordinary staffing under the old rules.  They are above the depleted numbers when people opt out of teaching for one reason or another. I am glad to see reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of today that &ldquo;Minister Boland has made a statement that the Government had decided to proceed with the creation of extra posts already announced by his predecessor Mr. Wilson who improved the pupil-teacher ratio and strengthened the remedial teaching service&rdquo;.  This, as <Col N="1017" /> the House knows, has been a continuing process for the last four years.  I inherited a situation in 1977 where there were 3,260 classes of forty plus in ordinary primary schools.  By making provision for the training of teachers and the rejigging of schedules this was reduced to 2,160 in 1978-79, to 980 in 1979-80 and for this year it stands at about 650.  Therefore, the employment of the 300 teachers as announced by me some time ago should eliminate this problem of the 40 plus classes altogether.  If progress is to be made beyond that and the classes are to be reduced more, there will have to be a commitment by the Minister to train more teachers and to re-order the schedules so that the class numbers can be brought down to the middle thirties as I had ambitioned.</P>
    <P>I know that all of this is expensive.  I am speaking of it here in the context of the statement of the Minister for Finance that the numbers employed in the public sector were to be pegged as on 21 July 1981.  As I said, we have increasing numbers in primary post-primary and third level education and we must provide the teachers for them.  Of course, we must also provide the school buildings.  The House knows already that we provided a capital budget of £79.3 million this year to cover all the areas of education.  In particular £30 million, a colossal figure by previous standards, was provided for the development of the primary school system for the building of new schools in green field areas.  We are proud to announce that in some areas in the suburbs of Dublin we were ahead of the gynaecologist because we had large schools of eight teachers, 16 teachers and 32 teachers in some areas where we had not yet the children.  These areas were developing areas where we had one, two or three classes and we had the schools ready for the reception of others later.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister should have a commitment from the Minister for Finance that there will be no interference, even though capital moneys have to be borrowed, with the programme for primary school building.  It is important because it is an area in which <Col N="1018" /> it is difficult to get up speed.  There are two Departments responsible.  Unlike the post primary area, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education are responsible for the primary area. They are both catering for different aspects of the capital programme and primary sector.  This sometimes causes delay.</P>
    <P>One thing that cannot and will not cause delay this year is the provision of finance if the present Minister for Finance backs the decision of his predecessor to make that kind of money available for the building of primary schools. Perhaps it might be advisable to proceed with the suggestion I made to set up, in the Department of Education, a primary school building unit &mdash;I know it has to await the consideration by the Department of the Public Service of re-organisation and so on &mdash; corresponding to the building unit at post primary level in that Department.  The post primary unit in the Department of Education could be regarded as a model of efficiency in that field.  I had occasion to mention in the House that their costings are better than the costings outlined by the surveyors. Their index is lower and has been consistently lower than the surveyors' index, which is the general index for the building industry here.</P>
    <P>The post primary area, divided almost equally, with a little bias in favour of vocational schools, has an allocation of £31 million this year.  We hope that the Minister for Finance will back his colleague, the Minister for Education, in providing for that development.  It is difficult to have an injunction against any extra spending.</P>
    <P>We had the good fortune, comparatively recently, to purchase Carriglea. We could not envisage this golden opportunity arising when the budget was put together.  Consequently, a decision has to be taken to provide extra finance in that situation.  The purchase of Carriglea for £2 million was a very good one for the Department of Education.  We were looking for a site for a regional technical college in the general area of Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire or Bray and we got this <Col N="1019" /> at a bargain price.  If there is an inflexible approach to finance you cannot deal with a situation like that.  In the previous year we succeeded in purchasing the Masonic school for use by University College, Dublin.  It was for fortuitous that it came on the market.  There should be flexibility in finances to enable the Department of Education to do that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Alarm has spread around the country with regard to another expenditure this year by the Department of Education.  I have been informed that sponsors of projects that were sanctioned have now been told that the money will not be available to them and that the matter has to be re-considered.  A letter has gone out to them from the secretary of the Department of Education cancelling any further advance.  I have not got the exact details.  This should be resisted by the people in charge of the projects and by anybody who has the social well-being of the areas concerned at heart.  I am sure the Minister for Education will be able to impress on his colleagues the necessity for this expenditure, both for the social advantage that it confers on the area and for the employment content.  We have heard a lot of caterwauling about increasing unemployment and if the expenditure of this money can help in the creation of employment in the various areas, then the logical position seems to be that they should go ahead.</P>
    <P>The question of VAT on school books has been a bone of contention for some time.  There has been general discussion about it.  Our Government did not succeed in zero rating school books.  It stood at 10 per cent.  There have been appeals from parents' organisations and trade unions to remove it altogether. Now we find that VAT has been increased by 5 per cent on school and college text books.  Books have increased in price, admittedly probably not as steeply as the consumer price index, but there have been complaints from parents with regard to this.  It was inconsiderate, to say the very least, of the Minister for Finance to put 5 per cent extra on to the price of school and college textbooks, in <Col N="1020" /> view of a commitment in the Fine Gael and Gaiety Theatre programme to provide free school books.  I will come to that later.  There is a commitment in that respect and it is part of my duty, as spokesman for Education, to see that the Minister for Education stands up to what was in the Fine Gael programme and carried on into the Gaiety Theatre programme document.</P>
    <P>Heating of schools has become a heavy burden for school management boards. Energy costs have risen very steeply.  As Minister, I had to add to the capitation grant by way of special and exceptional addition a sum of money to help the boards in this regard in the very recent past.  I cannot see how the Minister for Education can now allow the Minister for Finance to increase the cost of fuel without asking him to take into account the necessity for increasing heating grants in schools as a result.  The additional taxation on petrol and diesel will mean an increase in the cost of school transport and I draw this to the attention of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has increased the education grants for third level.  Tá moladh tuillte aige mar geall ar sin.  There are a couple of aspects of the increase which I want to call to the attention of the House.  Firstly, it is generally believed, &mdash; and statements have been made by responsible parents' associations and others &mdash; that Fine Gael canvassers during the election campaign stated that the eligibility limit increase and grant increase would be fully retrospective. I was not told that by any canvasser but so many people are on record now as saying that this was told to them that there is a question to be answered by the Government and by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Accompanying the grant increase is a very steep cost of living increases directly caused by this budget introduced by the Minister for Finance.  This takes something of the gloss off the increase in third level grants.  The rise of fees, of course, does not affect grant holders because the fees are paid for the grant holder and, even in the limited case where the full <Col N="1021" /> grant is not available in some instances, it is the fee which is actually paid.</P>
    <P>We had been in discussion with the Higher Education Authority and with the heads of the university colleges.  We wrote to these people &mdash; sometime in May, I believe &mdash; indicating that we accepted in principle that more money should be made available to them.  They had already in some cases, if not all, made a decision to increase the fees by 20 per cent.  It was in that universal discourse in that area that we were thinking of the extra money which was to be made available to the universities.  We see now that the increase has been of the order of 30 per cent.  That was the decision reached by the heads of the universities, having met the Minister for Education and having been told what money they would get.  Obviously, the 10 per cent extra increase in fees was imposed because the Minister did not make available the money which they were expecting from discussions with the previous Government and from their own submissions.</P>
    <P>Salary increases are relevant to a budget and I must refer here to something which I raised last night on the Adjournment about the officials of the Department of Education who are in dispute with the Minister.  The result of this dispute, of course, is that there are about 343,000 examination answer books lying unattended in Athlone.  I do not intend to go into the details of this dispute now. However, I do not think that the Minister for Education should slough off, as a snake does its skin, responsibility for what is happening in one of his offices in Athlone and which has such dire consequences for so many young people in our community.  I do not intend to expand on that.  The Minister should face up to his responsibility in the matter and try to get things moving.  There are ways of doing things.  I told the Minister last night that I was in total agreement with him that the agreed procedures should be adhered to, but it is his responsibility to get the agreed procedures working.  That is all I want to say on that subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech contained a statement which caused the alarm bells to start ringing from Cork to Donegal, <Col N="1022" /> from Dublin to Galway and other important areas in between.  This was:</P>
    <P>Substantial savings will also be achieved by the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Defence and others.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the Department of Education was what caused alarm in educational circles.  In today's <i>The Irish Times</i> there is a joint statement from the Teachers' Union of Ireland, the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation which says that &ldquo;cuts in educational expenditure would constitute an act of national folly&rdquo;.  I agree with that.</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Contrary to the budget statement by Mr. John Bruton, Minister for finance, there is no scope for substantial savings in the educational services budget,&rdquo; the unions declared.  The suggestion of a review of educational services to find ways of reducing expenditure &ldquo;would be contrary to the stated aims in the Coalition's published &ldquo;Programme for government 1981-86&rdquo;, the statement said.  In a separate statement, INTO said that in a survey carried out by them before the election, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties had committed themselves to:</P>
    <P>a.  Reducing the size of classes in national schools.</P>
    <P>b.  Taking the necessary steps to provide adequate school premises and equipment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see, as already stated in the House, that the Minister has accepted my scheme for reducing the size of classes.</P>
    <P>I have provided the where withal, provided that the Minister for Education will see to it that the Minister for Finance does not welsh on that.  There are £30 million available for the development of primary school buildings in this year.  This is to be used for extensions to schools, for building new schools in green field areas and, very importantly, to be made available for quick, fire brigade type expenditure on schools to improve the various facilities in them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> The INTO statement continued:</P>
    <P>c.  Pursuing a programme of positive discrimination in favour of socially and educationally disadvantaged pupils;</P>
    <P>d.  Expanding the provision of special educational facilities.</P>
    <P>The union warned that it &ldquo;will oppose any attempt to cut expenditure on the educational services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>INTO, however, welcomed the statement by the Minister for Education, Mr. Boland, confirming the increased staffing in national schools announced by the previous Minister, Mr. Wilson.</P>
    <P>The decision represented a further step in the slow progression towards the reduction in size of primary school classes to an acceptable level, &ldquo;It is the view of the INTO that this issue should continue to be an educational priority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the increased staffing the number of pupils required for the appointment of an additional assistant has been reduced by five in most cases.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be further committed to improving on the schedules in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Where are those substantial savings to be made, which caused such alarm to parent associations and teachers unions since the Minister made his statement? There is no room for such savings, as I indicated.  There are rumours of a pay freeze and that the Minister for Education is being pressed to raise the age of entry to primary schools and save 1,700 teaching posts.  I hope the Minister will give me a commitment that he will not entertain such a suggestion.</P>
    <P>Almost uniquely in Europe we have a very large percentage of our pupils in the ordinary primary schools at ages of four and five while the compulsory age is six. This means we have fully trained teachers available for those pupils in our primary schools.  If there are to be substantial savings, and I do not see how this is possible nor do I believe it is possible, I hope this proposal will be killed straight away.</P>
    <P>Are the capitation grants to be frozen or cut? I increased the capitation grants <Col N="1024" /> for primary schools this year, and the grants in lieu of fees to secondary schools have been increased from 1 September. I hope the Minister for Finance will assure me that he has no intention of casting a greedy eye on those grants in lieu of fees.</P>
    <P>One of the most hopeful recent developments has been a scheme I put forward for the development of distance learning. I sanctioned the provision of staff in the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, to get this scheme under way.  I envisaged the plan as being something new and exciting in our education system. I envisaged co-operation between NIHE, Dublin, the RTE Authority and the adult education officers acting as liaison officers in this concerted well planned scheme.  Again I am warning the Minister of that area.  As a member of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee he has considerable experience in this area and realises the value of that initiative.  I am sure he will support it by providing the necessary finance.  I had already approved the staffing requirements and meetings had been held with the RTE Authority and the adult education officers who are, by definition committed to that kind of work.  I am sure the Minister will not disappoint us in this area.</P>
    <P>The regional technical colleges were also uniquely placed for bringing in students for tuition and guidance throughout the period of the course.  The first course was to be a general foundation course in computer science, to be followed by a course properly validated by the National Council for Educational Awards, and awarding a national certificate. The second course was in the area of agricultural education.  I hope there is no truth in the belief held in some circles that the distance learning project will suffer in the interest of the substantial savings mentioned by the Minister in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>I come to another canard which has raised its head on numerous occasions, that is, the charge for school transport The idea of a charge for school transport has to be resisted by the Minister for Education.  The provision of free school transport will be more expensive because <Col N="1025" /> of the increase in duty on petrol and diesel granted in this supplementary budget.  I would be pleased if the Minister told us free school transport would be maintained and that he was prepared to defend that position.</P>
    <P>It is rumoured that in an attempt to save money the Department will charge for post-primary education after the compulsory age limit.  The House and the Government parties, particularly the Labour Party, should be wary of this suggestion which would cut across the developments in our educational system which have taken place over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the joint programme for the provision of free school books.  I am very pleased to see that.  Nobody would be satisfied with a scheme unless it was adequate, but at least the Government commitment to free books should kill the rumour that there was an attempt to abolish the scheme.</P>
    <P>The increase in third level fees beyond the 20 per cent limit decided on by the universities would seem to be a device to save money in this area.  I want to call the attention of the House to a suggestion that the subvention for board and accommodation for student teachers should be abolished.  This is one point I would like the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance to clarify.  The statement that accompanied the new grants scheme was a little ambiguous in one area.  Is it the intention to eliminate subventions for board and accommodation for student teacher? These students are in a unique position because the colleges developed their own spirit over a long number of years and have accommodation, dining halls, libraries and so on.  The existing system is ideally suited for their purposes. If it is the intention to introduce a grants scheme in such a way that the student teacher will be in the same position as the university student grant-holder, then it should be resisted.</P>

      <P>I hope it is not the intention <Col N="1026" /> to attempt to save money where no money can be saved.  I agree fully with the statement on this matter made by the three unions involved.</P>
      <P>It has been said that my commitment for the provision of computers in post primary schools at the beginning of the academic year 1981-82 is not to be adhered to by the Minister.  I cannot emphasise too much the importance I attach to this development.  Deputy Browne talked about problems which might arise as a result of the development and use of micro-processors and computers in general.  Our young people must know the enemy, so to speak, so that they will be able to cope with a society where it will become more and more important.  I would welcome an assurance that this worthwhile scheme will not be interfered with.  Although there is only about a month left, the necessary courses could take place, although people waiting to mark examination scripts would not be able to attend.  I appeal to the Ministers for Finance and Education not to interfere with courses for teachers.  We had courses for teachers this year and more of them are needed in order to familiarise teachers with computers and also with the pedagogic aspects.</P>
      <P>I have dealt already to a certain extent with the primary school building programme. I will constitute myself as a watchdog, with all due apologies to official watchdogs, with regard to primary education spending to see to it that there is no slowdown in primary school building. The money and the plans are there and we had a large number of projects in mind.  As of now there is a general air of confidence and euphoria in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my introductory remarks I said that we were hearing much about irresponsibility with regard to finances and expenditure. I took the precaution of finding out the exact financial position in my Department at 31 May 1981.  The amount spent was roughly on target and I was pressing very hard to make sure we would be able to spend the £79.3 million which had been allocated in the capital area.  The amount of expenditure over that provided in the Book of Estimates would have been <Col N="1027" /> smaller than in 1980.  There is no evidence of irresponsibility.  Naturally in a Department which is labour intensive and where new salary scales cause extra expenditure during the year there will have to be some supplementary budget.  We were certainly on target.  Perhaps we had not spent enough on the capital programme by 31 May, even though we were pushing hard.  Let the Minister for Finance know that I intend implacably to oppose any attempt to reduce expenditure in the Department of Education.  I will also call upon people in the Fine Gael Party and particularly in the Labour Party who have been urging increasing expenditure over the years to put their feet in the lobby where their mouths have been during the past four years.</P>

      <P>Before making some comments on my Department and the problems I found there on assuming office, I wish to comment on the speech made this morning by Deputy Browne.  He is a man for whom I have a lot of regard.  He made an emotional attack on the system in this House and on Members on both sides and also attacked the system under which the country is governed.  He was particularly trenchant in his remarks about the unemployment situation and the effects on our society now and in future years if something is not done to relieve the problem. He related it to the riot which took place on Merrion Road last Saturday. That was dangerous talk from a respected parliamentarian.  If we let ourselves be led down that alley and do not identify precisely what took place on Saturday last we are in danger of finding excuses for a problem which does not exist.  I will speak later about the cost of the riot to the taxpayer and the community.  I would like to believe that some fairly sincere people, for humanitarian reasons, have associated themselves with the H-Blocks campaign, but we must clearly identify that what happened last Saturday was a deliberate attempt by certain elements to score a victory over the defenders of our society.  For Deputy Browne to say in his speech that these evil men should be protected <Col N="1028" /> from the thin blue line, from the Members of the House and society as we know it, and to infer that people who attacked the Gardai last Saturday were merely young people venting their frustrations, and that they were a symptom of the society in which they were reared, is misleading and dangerous in the extreme.  The people who attacked the Gardai last Saturday did so quite deliberately in a confrontation with this State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne should not set himself up here as being holier than anybody else in the House or as being more concerned about the young and the unemployed. Deputy Browne is entitled to say that in this House, and every other elected Deputy will have personal views as to how effective are the State in coping with unemployment, education, housing, poor roads, telecommunications and so on-and we all have our ideas on how they can be coped with.  Some of us group ourselves into parties because we believe this to be the most effective way of tackling those problems, a phalanx of like minded Deputies presenting themselves to the people with a programme.  That applies to all parties.  Neither Deputies Kemmy nor Browne believe this to be the way, and that is their democratic right.  During the last Dáil I resented Deputy Browne being here, not because I did not think he had something to contribute but because he took a Fine Gael seat.  I do not mind him being here this time because he took a Fianna Fáil seat. Outside of the politics of it, a voice like Deputy Browne's is a good thing in any society because we can become apathetic and we need occasional proddings.  However I do not accept that Deputy Ray Burke, Deputy Loughnane, myself or Deputy Fergus O'Brien or anyone else are less concerned with the problems than is Deputy Noel Browne.</P>

      <P>The line, which, to the best of my knowledge, Deputy Browne was not corrected for pursuing by the Chair this morning, is extremely dangerous. The Deputy proposed to try to equate what happened last Saturday with young peoples' frustration about being unemployed.  Does anybody inside or outside this House think that if the unemployment level was 30,000 rather than 130,000, what happened last Saturday would not have taken place?  The Deputy then extended his remarks to say that what was happening here was akin to and parallel with what is happening in the riots in Liverpool, Manchester, London and so on.  The Deputy is trying to make what happened fit his own theory.  One of the most distressing things I read, which should be a warning to all of us, in relation to the riots which took place in England was about an Asian woman recounting what had happened on the day the riots broke out.  She said that she went into her shop and that skinheads had come in and started to wreck it.  She said that she picked up the phone and rang her friends.  She did not mean the police.  She rang people of her own nationality.  She was a coloured person, and these people had evidently formed some sort of a vigilante group to protect coloured people from attacks by white people.  To pretend that that was not precisely what was behind the riots in England is dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne's solution to this is that capitalism, or society as we know it, should be dismantled and socialism should take its place as the answer to all our problems.  Our financial problems, according to Deputy Browne, are because of a capitalist society and he quoted Marxists as saying that they should not claw the eyes from one another as in a capitalist society.  I saw more clawing of eyes being done between Poland and Russia than between the capitalist nations.  Capitalism is not a perfect system, nor is socialism or communism. They all have their faults.  To get backed in to any &ldquo;ism&rdquo; and pretend it has all the answers for all time will not help the young people about whom Deputy Browne is so concerned.  Deputy Browne <Col N="1030" /> is older than I.  But even in my time under this very imperfect system, which Deputy Browne criticises so eloquently and so often, during which, due to the span of years, we were mostly governed by Fianna Fáil, I have seen children without shoes.  I do not see that nowadays.</P>
    <P>In my city of Cork and, I am sure, in Limerick and in Dublin, people lived in appalling slum conditions.  People are still living in bad conditions but nobody lives in the conditions in which people lived in the thirties.  Indeed I remember quite clearly that when I discarded my shoes they were given to the children of farming relations out the country.  If you will excuse the pun, the boot would be on the other foot nowadays.  There is no doubt about that.  At the same time those conditions are within my living memory.  I am sure every Deputy in this House, if he is honest with himself, will admit that things are better for more people now than they were when they were growing up.  That is evolution and progress; it is not fast enough and it is not far enough but it is not meaningless and should not be wiped off in a ten-minute, eloquent address by one Deputy out of 166 in this Parliament as if nothing had happened in 60 years.  It has; we should be proud of it, build on it and not try to scrap the whole lot for some &ldquo;ism&rdquo; which patently, when practised in other parts of the world, is not answering their problems.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Browne is wrong, very wrong.  Nobody should be foolish enough to believe that putting people into work will prevent a repetition of what happened in Dublin last Saturday, because the people who organised and manipulated that crowd will just as easily organise, manipulate and be equally destructive with a crowd of employed people as with a crowd of unemployed people. Indeed if one were to judge by the people on the television screens over the weekend, who knows what percentage of them were employed or unemployed.  But it is very dangerous to this country if we allow ourselves be codded into believing that there was not a sinister force behind what happened last Saturday.  Apart from the social cost, the cost to society in an ideological, fundamental sense, there was <Col N="1031" /> another cost involved about which I shall say a few words later.</P>
    <P>First of all I want to say something about my Department which is what I really stood up to say but I think the diversion was worthwhile.  I was very concerned, on arriving in my Department at the very serious financial position&mdash;unlike what Deputy Wilson said a few moments ago- I saw facing my Department and particularly local authourites who report to and are responsible to my Department.  I found it necessary to provide for very substantial additions for a very large number of services for which I am responsible.  The provision already fixed for these in the Estimates seriously under-estimated what would be the requirements.  Additional sums of £16½ million for housing subsidy, £3 million for sanitary services subsidy, £5.2 million for rates grant and £3 million for malicious injuries claims have now been provided. These additional sums alone amount to almost £28 million.  That is a very substantial sum.  Regretably I find that these additional amounts are required to meet on-going and very predictable commitments rather than provide for expansion and new services.  In other words, they could have been foreseen last December but they were cut out of the Estimates for my Department.</P>
    <P>The House and the public generally will appreciate that the Government could not but face up to the absolute necessity of providing for the essential additional financial aid which will be falling due to local authorities.  The alternative would be to leave local authorities short of this amount which would lead in the autumn to a major crisis for the finances of local authorities with the direct consequences for the economy and in particular for employment.  Of course the consequences for the public generally arising from the supplementary budget are unpalatable but all must agree that they are necessary in the interests of good Government and reversing the very serious position of our national finances.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the waste of the resources of the State and local authorities caused by wanton damage <Col N="1032" /> to property which gives rise to malicious injuries payments.  Disturbances arising from demonstrations such as that in Dublin on Saturday last can affect the society in which we live and our economic wellbeing in ways which extend beyond the events themselves.  One of the more direct and obvious effects is the cost of damage to property which cannot be ignored in any consideration of local finance.  Unfortunately it is one which in recent times has become a good deal more serious.  The type of damage to property which in recent times has followed demonstrations such as that of last Saturday usually results in massive claims against local authorities under the malicious injuries code.</P>
    <P>Where malicious injury claims against the local authorities are successful in the courts the local authorities have to raise the money to pay the decrees.  There are arrangements under which the amount of the decrees is shared between the Exchequer and local authorities.  The details of the arrangements for sharing the cost may be important in the context of the finances of individual local authorities but what should concern all of us here is that the entire cost comes from public funds.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside altogether the events of last Saturday and the claims which may arise from them, local authorities, up to early June, were faced already with claims for damage caused within the previous few months or so which were the result of activities which I can only describe as subversive.  These activities have left our community facing claims for damage totalling about £7.5 million.  The claims included damage by fire to houses, public buildings, vehicles and other property in a number of areas throughout the country.  I cannot say what the final cost of the direct damage, as measured by the courts in these cases, will turn out to be. The amounts claimed, however, give an indication of the type of cost involved for the community.  I might say that the £7.5 million does not include anything that happened in the last week the claims for which must be lodged, I think, within seven days.  It may perhaps help to put this in perspective if I were to say that <Col N="1033" /> £7.5 million would build, say, 325 local authority houses &mdash; and anybody here who is a member of a local authority knows how badly they are needed &mdash; or provide employment &mdash; which was of so much concern to Deputy Browne a minute ago &mdash; for 500 men for a year on national road maintenance.  This is just one way of measuring the cost to the community and the loss to local services of this type of mindless damage to property.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are faced with enough problems in continuing and improving the services for which they have responsibility without having to dissipate their finances and their other resources in dealing with claims in respect of damage to property which need not and should not arise.</P>
    <P>As regards local authorities' overall finances, they have not, of course, been able to escape the difficulties which have beset the public sector generally. Although the position varied from place to place there was a marked deterioration in the overall financial position of local authorities generally during 1980.  One way in which this deterioration manifested itself was in increased reliance on bank overdraft to keep the capital services going and to pay for the ordinary day-to-day running costs of local authority services.</P>
    <P>The additional £30 million, which I will refer to later, being provided in respect of the local authority housing programme, should be of help in this respect in the current year.  Apart from wider considerations related to the level of borrowing, undue reliance on overdraft can be costly for local authorities and can thereby effectively reduce the amount available for expenditure on local services.</P>
    <P>In the current year local authorities have been able to budget for the spending of £603 million on non-capital services.  I realise that in relation to any year a substantial part of the revenue of local authorities effectively must be committed by decisions taken in previous years.  This is a feature of the finances of nearly all public bodies.  Nevertheless, within their <Col N="1034" /> overall current budget of £603 million for 1981 local authorities can no more ignore the need for restraint which current circumstances require than can the rest of the public sector.  This is the theme that will be repeated very frequently from these benches by myself and other Ministers in this Government, the necessity for all units and arms of Government to watch carefully their expenditures in all fields.  We will be concerned to see that as much as possible of the money voted by this House goes to the people for whom it was intended rather than being creamed off in administration en route. It is up to the local authorities to make the best use they can of the financial resources available to them.  This will involve a conscious and sustained effort on their part to direct their expenditures towards those services most urgently needed.  At the same time they should be wary of entering into commitments which, though costing little in the current year, may unduly pre-empt local revenues in future years, thus limiting their freedom.  The members and management of local authorities alike should be constantly on the alert for ways and means of improving the efficiency of their organisations to ensure the maximum return for their expenditure.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of the annual expenditure on the capital programmes of local authorities gives rise to continuing increases in the demands of their current budgets.  This arises both from the growth in net loan charges to service the capital debt and from the extra maintenance and management costs of new houses, water supply schemes and so on.  There is also the added burden arising from the increased pressure on the other services which are so often taken for granted when new houses are built and occupied.  Services like street lighting and cleaning, domestic refuse collection and so on all cost money. While I would repeat that local authorities need to be constantly vigilant on this question of achieving the maximum economy in the provision of these services, I am not at all unmindful of the burdens these and the increasing cost of other services place on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> I am fully sympathetic to the idea of allowing local authorities as much freedom as possible in managing their own affairs and in deciding on their priorities. Various people involved in local government either as members of councils or as officers of local authorities have from time to time made suggestions as to ways in which the local authorities might be assisted to have a more meaningful role in our society.  So far as finance is concerned there seems to be a wide measure of agreement that local authorities should themselves have the necessary freedom of action to raise their direct charges for services where they feel it is appropriate that they should do so and that they should have the necessary power to charge directly for certain services where they do not at present have that power. It has also been suggested that additional sources of revenue other than rates should be available to them.</P>
    <P>I think everybody associated with our system of local government realises that there is no magic formula which will lead to the discovery of major and hitherto untapped sources of local finance.  But what is important is that local authorities should within reason have the necessary freedom to raise additional finance for purposes which they consider of importance locally.  I am fully in sympathy with that view.  I feel that there should be no unnecessary obstacles placed in the way of local authorities who are genuinely concerned with improving their own localities.  If they are prepared to take on themselves the responsibility of raising the necessary funds, even if that means new or increased direct charges, I do not think they should be prevented from doing so.  A local authority should be in the best position to judge what local services or amenities are most needed in their own area and to gauge the extent to which the community will be prepared to pay the cost.  I hope to be able to help in bringing about that situation in so far as it may be within my control.</P>
    <P>In my approach to this question of new or improved sources of revenue I will look closely, over the months ahead, at the many specific suggestions which have <Col N="1036" /> already been made.  I will also look at the scope for improvement there may be within the system of local finance as it at present operates.  I hope to bring forward my own specific proposals in this area very shortly.</P>
    <P>One of my early priorities as Minister will be to look seriously at local government structures.  Many of us in this House are or have been members of local authorities.  Our background in local government enables us to appreciate the excellent work being done by elected members of local authorities throughout the country.  They give generously of their time and talents in that tradition of voluntary service which is so much a feature of our local government system.  We can appreciate too the work and dedication of the people employed in the local service.  We owe it to these men and women, elected members and officials alike, who operate the local government system, and, in particular, to the communities served by that system, to ensure that the structures continue to meet efficiently the increasing demands made on them.</P>
    <P>The need for a thorough examination is most acute in the major urban areas. Here the local government system has come under considerable pressure arising from a vastly increased population and an ever-growing demand for services.  It is evident, especially in Dublin, that there are serious problems; problems of inner city decline; problems in the provi-infrastructure to support social and economic progress, problems in the provision and management of housing and, perhaps, particular problems arising from a certain lack of a distinctive community identity in large new housing developments where the existing local government organisation may appear rather remote.</P>
    <P>I feel it is necessary to give serious consideration to the apparent lack of a local focus in some newly developed areas.  This is bad for local democracy and leads to apathy and even to disaffection. In an ideal situation there should be a local community spirit in each local area.  There should be a clear appreciation of the existence and identity of the <Col N="1037" /> local authority which should be close enough to the people to be real to them.</P>
    <P>I will be seeking ways and means of fostering local government and local authorities so that they will be more a reality in the lives of ordinary people.  I am having various suggestions on these lines examined and I hope to develop more specific proposals in due course.</P>
    <P>In approaching this review of local government structures, in addition to the proposals published in the Government's programme I will take into account the various suggestions for reform which have been made from time to time together with the views put forward by local authorities themselves as well as by interested organisations and individuals.</P>
    <P>It would be my intention to approach this review in a pragmatic manner.  We must remember that some of our local authority structures were established about a century ago.  I will be looking for the things that need changing so as to establish a system tailored for the eighties rather than the nineties.  My aim will be to ensure that any changes proposed will bring about real improvements in the standard of the local government services and at the same time preserve and improve the local and democratic aspects of the system.</P>
    <P>One of the most important and sensitive areas of the economy in terms of investment, growth expectations and jobs which all Governments must constantly monitor is of course the building industry.  As Minister for the Environment I have responsibility at Government level for overseeing the state of the industry.  This vital sector of the economy was noticeably depressed in 1980, with output falling by over 6 per cent.  This was caused by the economic recession and in particular by a severe drop in private sector investment in the industry. Consequently, the level of direct employment in the industry declined by 5,000 between April and December last year. Overall, I expect output to increase by 5 per cent this year and employment to increase by about 2,000 by the end of the year.  The main growth areas in 1981 will be telecommunications and industrial and educational buildings.  The Government <Col N="1038" /> have increased by £30 million the provision for local authority housing to counteract the sharp decline in activity in this sector; I will refer to this aspect in greater detail later on in my speech.</P>
    <P>In tackling the overall problems of the industry, I am anxious to plan on the basis of orderly growth in output and employment.  In developing plans, I intend to have close consultation with representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, the Building Materials Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Building Industry Council.  In all our interests, working in co-operation it should be possible for us to devise ways and means of smoothening out the peaks and valleys in the industry and ensuring that the levels of apprenticeship intake are satisfactory.  Our housing programme must be adequate to meet the requirements of our growing population and priority must be given to the provision of infrastructural services such as roads, telecommunications and sanitary services.  To this end, our overall building programme is being closely monitored.</P>
    <P>I would now like to speak on housing, which is a vital sector of the building industry.  The management of a national housing programme by a Government requires skill, vision, compassion and, perhaps, a little luck.  I say skill because housing is a complex area with many competing and interacting demands for available resources.  Decisions have to be taken which affect the supply of financial resources for the various types of housing need.  The job of good government is to ensure that those whose degree of need is greatest are given priority.  Government also needs to have an ability to identify quickly the problem areas in housing whether they arise in the area of direct building or in improvement of the housing stock and to provide or create the climate for the provision of the necessary incentives, financial and otherwise, to ensure that the housing needs so identified can be dealt with quickly and effectively.  It is obvious to me in the short time since I became Minister for the Environment that there is room for improvement in the management of the <Col N="1039" /> national housing programme and I am confident that measures already taken and to be taken in the months ahead by the Government will secure that improvement.</P>
    <P>In the short-term it will be important to inject sufficient capital into the housing programme to ensure that the anticipated completion of 25,500 or so houses this year is improved on immediately.  The assessment of national housing requirements will indicate the nature and extent of need in the years ahead and the Government will ensure that the required comprehensive range of aids and incentives will be available to ensure that housing targets are met.</P>
    <P>A very important factor in determining the success of a housing strategy is the Government commitment to financing the national housing programme in a comprehensive and common sense fashion. Since assuming office the Government have seen the problems affecting housing and already have taken significant steps to combat the rot and the mis-use of resources which were beginning to set in.  I want to outline now the major problem areas and the steps which have been taken already by the Government to attempt to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>In the housing area the most immediate problem is the rescue of the local authority housing programme.  I use the word rescue deliberately because the programme was on the verge of a complete collapse arising from the lack of adequate central funds.  It is no exaggeration to say that in the absence of additional capital being provided by the Government work on many local authority housing sites would come to a complete half within weeks.  In fact, many local authorities would not have re-employed their direct labour force after the builders' holiday fortnight.</P>
    <P>The 1981 public capital programme provided £108.5 million for local authority house building.  A further £2.5 million was allocated at the end of May bringing the total provision for the year to £111 million.  This provision was grossly inadequate compared with the expenditure of <Col N="1040" /> £114 million last year.  The situation in 1981 was aggravated by the fact that since 1978 there were a series of cuts in real terms in the capital provided annually for local authority housing, the previous administration are most guilty in that sphere.  While the wholesale price index for building and construction rose by 39.2 per cent between 1978 and 1980, capital provided in that period rose by only 25.7 per cent; the disparity was even greater in practice as the index does not take account of certain special increases which were substantial during the period.  In this connection it is interesting to note that during 1980 building prices generally increased by 20 per cent but average tender prices for the bigger local authority schemes increased over that year by over 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>While these cuts in real terms were taking place it appears miraculous that the programme was being maintained at about the same level.  But, of course, there was no miracle involved; the plain fact of the matter is that by the end of 1980 debit balances on local authority accounts totalling about £28 million had been built up.  What this meant was that more than a quarter of the public capital programme provision for 1981 had to be used to pay off debts already incurred in 1980.  The consequence was that less than three-quarters of the £108.5 million provided in the Estimates was available for actual building purposes; the other quarter had to be used to pay off overdrafts that had been previously built up. It was not possible to meet the demands of local authorities for what they considered was necessary to meet their commitments on existing schemes and, of course, the normal practice of making separate allocations for new works programmes had to be abandones.  By the middle of this year over 80 per cent of the total capital available had been drawn from the Local Loans Fund and a number of authorities had fully drawn their total allocations for the year.  Many local authority managers were faced with the bleak prospect of putting contractors off sites; the alternative was the accumulation of even more crippling debit balances but this was not a viable choice in <Col N="1041" /> view of the critical state of local authority and Government finances.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the programme itself, by mid-year it was obvious that there was no prospect of achieving the 6,000 completions announced earlier in the year. The prospects now are that completions will not be much above 5,000 and possibly lower.  Completions up to 30 April were already down 183 on the same period in 1980 while units in progress were down by a massive 728 on the corresponding date last year.  When I became Minister I found that schemes involving 2,200 houses and over 200 sites for private housing were being held up in the Department or were not being started by local authorities because of lack of funds. These and other schemes planned to start later in the year would not have got under way unless extra capital which we provided was provided and the net result of this would be that the number of houses in progress at the end of the year would have fallen to 4,500.  This could mean that completions would be as low as 3,000 in 1982.</P>
    <P>This then was the daunting prospect that faced me when I took up office. Obviously remedial action was necessary and that action could not be delayed.  I immediately put a case to the Government for a substantial extra capital provision to save the programme and I am glad to say that, despite the grave financial crisis, they decided to allocate a further £30 million necessary to keep the schemes going to the end of the year.  The Government have authorised a further £16½ million in housing subsidy bringing the total provision for this item in 1981 to over £79 million.  This subsidy meets the cost of borrowings by local authorities to provide houses for renting.  The need for the extra allocation arises primarily from a regrettable decision in the context of the 1981 budget to under-provide for this item in 1981.  The scale of the shortfall was such that it would have placed local authorities in intolerable financial difficulties later this year.</P>
    <P>This was in spite of the fact that it was an assessable sum that could be estimated &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash; to the last penny on 1 January how much was to be <Col N="1042" /> paid out during 1981.  Yet, it was deliberately omitted from the Book of Estimates, even though it was known that local authorities would have to get their money, so as to try to present a better picture of the finances at the beginning of this year.  No wonder the Government changed.  In formulating housing policy, it is important to take a critical look at developments which have a significant bearing on our overall housing scheme. Between 1971 and 1979, the total population increased by 13.1 per cent which was the fastest rate of population growth in Europe apart from Turkey and Iceland. But perhaps, even more startling is the fact that the total number of households in Ireland increased by 21.1 per cent during this period.</P>
    <P>A very large proportion of the increase in the numbers of households in Ireland can be attributed to a change in the rate of formation of households by the younger age groups rather that to changes in the size and structure of the population.  Information to be published by my Department later today shows that 22 per cent of new house borrowers from all agencies in 1980 were single persons not about to marry compared to 19 per cent in 1979, 19 per cent in 1978 and 20 per cent in 1977.  A high incidence of single persons not about to marry but who can afford to purchase secondhand houses is also apparent from the statistics.</P>
    <P>This development has serious implications for the Exchequer.  Clearly, some single persons could readily postpone the purchase of a house because they are adequately housed at present.  In the normal course the housing needs of families must take priority.  The Government have reviewed the position and have decided that there should be no change in the position relating to the special loans and mortgage subsidies available to categories such as tenants and tenant-purchasers of local authority houses who surrender their premises to the authority and one-parent families.  In future, however, in other cases, eligibility for the mortgage subsidy and ordinary local authority house purchase loans will be restricted to married persons and persons <Col N="1043" /> about to marry.  Single purchasers may obtain approval to the payment of a loan and mortgage subsidy but these payments will not be made until evidence of marriage is available.</P>
    <P>I have talked up to now about the role of the Government in the provision of finance for new housing.  At this stage it would be remiss of me to let this occasion pass without an acknowledgement of the tremendous achievements in the provision of mortgage finance by the building societies over the years.  The societies play a vital role in the Government's housing programme by providing 74 per cent of mortgage finance for private houses.  In 1980 they provided 16,900 house loans valued at £269 million consisting of £126 million in respect of 7,800 new houses and £143 million in respect of 9,100 other houses.  It is estimated that societies will provide about £300 million in mortgage finance in the current year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the level at which societies pitch their investment rate is of the utmost importance in attracting new funds to enable them to continue to supply such high levels of mortgage finance.  In setting their investment rate, societies are conscious of other competitive rates and, for instance, have normally maintained a differential over the minimum deposit rate offered by the associated banks.</P>
    <P>Building societies reduced their investment rate from 9 per cent to 8.25 per cent with effect from 1 January 1981 when the minimum bank deposit rate stood at 7.5 per cent.  In the event there was a sharp fall in the net inflow of funds to societies from January to April.  On 12 May 1981 the associated banks increased their investment and lending rates.</P>
    <P>To restore the inflow of money to a level necessary to meet the demand for mortgages, building societies increased their investment rates by 1 per cent from 1 June 1981 until further notice, without increasing their existing mortgage interest rate of 13.15 per cent on the basis of payment of a Government interest subsidy of 1 per cent from that date.  The societies decision in the matter arose from a commitment given by the former <Col N="1044" /> Minister for the Environment at a meeting on 20 May 1981 with representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association.</P>
    <P>Because of the present difficult financial situation which the present Government has been left, we have no alternative but to take measures in order to commence rectifying the situation.  It has accordingly been necessary to terminate the subsidy on the building society investment interest rates with effect from 1 September 1981.  My Department will be in touch with the societies in this matter without delay.  Deputies and indeed the general public will realise that scarce resources must be devoted to areas where there is most need, for example, those who must depend on the local authority for a house.  It is for this reason that we have decided to allocate £30 million extra for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I should say that the subsidy was originally introduced about ten years ago and discontinued in 1976.  It was reintroduced last year, I think, and operated then for four months.  It is operating for only three months this year.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the fact that the present overall system of house purchase loans has certain short-comings. This applies particularly to the needs of low to moderate income purchasers and the extent to which finance is provided from public funds.  We must not lose sight of the need to tackle the problem of high deposits in some cases, the need to top up loans and the question of trying to establish a better relationship between amounts of loan repayments and total incomes during the repayment periods.  For these reasons my Department are having discussions with interested parties with a view to formulating proposals for legislation which would provide for the setting up of a housing finance agency.  I hope to have these proposals before the Dáil before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Earlier I indicated it was not enough for the Government to arrange merely for the building of new houses.  We must ensure that the existing stock of houses does not deteriorate.  For that reason we pointed out in our programme that we <Col N="1045" /> will introduce shortly some home improvement schemes.  Details will be announced by the Minister of State shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, I am keenly aware of the difficulties being faced by industrialists and others dependent on transport facilities through chronic traffic congestion in cities and towns.  A road network that is adequate for the needs of the community also makes a positive contribution towards our costs and helps our export competitiveness.  An investment in roads is an essential part of any Government's programme.  I am satisfied that we will continue investment in roads at a high level.</P>
    <P>Despite the present economic difficulties and the financial problems inherited by the Government, we are determined to do all we can to sustain investment in sanitary services.  The lack of adequate piped water and sewerage facilities has for far too long inhibited economic physical development at national and local level.  Planning permissions for worthwhile developments are delayed or refused because of insufficient sanitary services.  The ability of the IDA to attract industrial investment, particularly water-using and effluent generating industries, is dependent on the existence of adequate water supplies and sewage disposal facilities.  The drive to modernise farming must be matched by the continuing progress of the rural piped water supply programmes since water is essential for farm hygiene, livestock production and quality milk production.  On my recommendation, the Government have agreed to an additional £3 million to finance the shortfall in the provision made to finance the payment of State subsidies due to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The sanitary services programme has an important impact on employment both directly and indirectly.  About 85 per cent of the materials and equipment required for the programme is manufactured in Ireland so that the import content is relatively low.  The programme plays an important part in maintaining off-site employment in firms producing pipes and treatment plant for the programme. Other direct employment programmes, <Col N="1046" /> including the IDA advance factory programme and the housing programme, follow on from the servicing of land for development purposes.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning, I am conscious of the necessity of ensuring that development is not inhibited by planning laws while, at the same time, ensuring that the population and the environment are protected.  It is accepted by all that snags have arisen from time to time.  It will be a priority on my part to see that any wrinkles in the planning laws are ironed out so that development can go ahead but not at the expense of the Environment.</P>
    <P>My final comment is with regard to unfinished estates that are causing so much trouble to local authority members and, more especially, to residents of the estates.  The Minister of State and I will tackle this as a matter of priority to ensure that people who buy houses in such estates get what they have paid for, namely, a finished estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways the people are fortunate that we are sitting for only three days this week because on each of those days we have had a budget. On Tuesday the Minister for Finance made his budget statement with all its inflationary implications so far as the economy and prices were concerned. One of the side effects of that will be the unemployment that will be created.  In the newspapers this morning there were announcements regarding increased charges by the ESB and CIE consequent on the budget decisions made on Tuesday. Today we had a further budget statement read out by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not be under any illusions. We have heard from the Minister the disgraceful decision to remove the mortgage subsidy Fianna Fáil had provided when they were in office to cushion householders from the worst effects of inflation and the decision of the building societies on 1 January to increase their rates.  What we have heard today from the Minister means that the Government will terminate their subsidy to the building societies as from 1 September.  As a result, every person who has a building society mortgage <Col N="1047" /> will be faced with additional costs. This is a disgraceful reneging on a commitment given to the people.  Yet, we have had to wait until today to hear about it because the Government did not have the courage to include it in their budget statement on Tuesday.  The decision was slipped into the speech of the Minister for the Environment in an effort to hide the effect it will have on mortgage holders. I shall quote from the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>Building societies reduced their investment rate from 9 per cent to 8.25 per cent with effect from 1 January 1981 when the minimum bank deposit rate stood at 7.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reality behind that short sentence is that I had a series of negotiations with the building societies when I had the honour to hold the post of Minister for the Environment and, following Government pressure at that time, the building societies reduced their interest rates.  In his statement the Minister also made the following comment:</P>
    <P>To restore the inflow of money to a level necessary to meet the demand for mortgages, building societies increased their investment rates by 1 per cent from 1 June 1981 until further notice, without increasing their existing mortgage interest rate of 13.15 per cent on the basis of payment of a Government interest subsidy of 1 per cent from that date.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil met that interest subsidy. As a Government we were committed to keeping down the cost of living and to helping the already over-taxed house-holders. In his statement today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It has accordingly been necessary to terminate the subsidy...</P>
    <P>What is the necessity to terminate the subsidy? It is the decision of a callous Government who have no interest in householders.  It was not mentioned in the policy documents of Fine Gael or the Labour Party that the subsidy would go and it certainly was not included in the <Col N="1048" />&ldquo;Gaiety Theatre document&rdquo;.  Today we are supposed to be discussing the budget statement as announced on Tuesday but in reality there have been other increases since then and they have also to be voted on.  By their action today the Government have stabbed the householders in the back.  The pages in the Minister's statement from which the above extracts have been quoted are a classic example of reneging on their commitments by an uncaring Government.  Throughout the statement of the Minister for the Environment there is a total reneging on commitments given to the electorate at the time of the general election.</P>
    <P>On page 33 of their election programme Fine Gael gave a pledge to implement the £4,000 arrangement for first-time house buyers, and the Gaiety Theatre document issued by Labour included that promise.  Now both parties are reneging and welching on those commitments.  The Minister for the Environment today told us about their proposals for the young population.  We should be proud of our young population.  We an asset to the community and not a weight around our necks as suggested by the Minister for the Environment.  He told us that figures to be published later today will show that 22 per cent of new house borrowers from all agencies in 1980 were single persons.  However, he qualified that by saying that a high incidence of single persons not about to marry but who can afford to purchase secondhand houses also will be apparent from the statistics.  They are now to lose out on mortgage subsidies.  They are young people, and one-quarter of the new house purchasers have been young people investing in the future.  They are not to be eligible for mortgage subsidies, according to the Minister for the Environment this morning.</P>
    <P>Is it not incredible that a Government should so blatantly renege on commitments to young people? That was not only a pledge by Fine Gael in their election programme but by Labour in the document issued from the Gaiety Theatre.</P>
    <P>All this means that there will be an increase in the amount of mortgage <Col N="1049" /> repayments. After the enormous impositions in the budget on Tuesday, on the third day of the debate on the budget we have been told of new savage impositions on the taxpayers, further massive increases in ESB charges, 25 per cent, and house mortgage repayments being increased for young people buying houses for the first time.</P>
    <P>In their election programme document, Labour promised that they would assist house purchasers through a variety of schemes, including the £4,000 grant scheme on houses up to a value of £40,000.  That document was issued less than a month ago, but today we have had the third budget in a week reneging on that.  As well, we have clear indications from the Minister for the Environment that new charges will be imposed in the form of domestic taxation.  He said a short time ago that in so far as finance is concerned there seems to be a wide measure of agreement that local authorities should themselves have the necessary freedom of action to raise their direct charges for services where they feel it is appropriate that they should do so, and that they should have the necessary power to charge directly for certain services where they do not have that power. Later the Minister said that he is fully in sympathy with the view that local authorities should have that freedom.  He said, &ldquo;If they are prepared to take on themselves the responsibility of raising the necessary funds, even if that means new or increased direct charges, I do not think they should be prevented from doing so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What are the necessary funds? What-ever they are they will be raised as a percentage of the value of a house, and what is that but rates by another name? The Minister should have told people before the general election that he would encourage the re-introduction of domestic property taxes.  His statement here this morning indicates that there is to be a re-introduction of rates and other domestic property taxes because the speech of the Minister for the Environment indicates a clear commitment to the re-introduction of all sorts of domestic property charges which, as I have said, is another name for rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> The Minister stated clearly that the subsidy on mortgages being paid to 22 per cent of young people buying their homes will be abolished.  That means, of course, a tax on repayments.  These subsidies were introduced to enable building societies to provide the necesary funds to finance home loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry will have an opportunity to make a contribution. When he is doing so will he tell me where in the Fine Gael programme or in the Gaiety Theatre document I will find a statement to the effect that mortgages would be increased and that there would not be a welching on Fine Gael's home loans commitment? I am sorry the Minister has left the House, but I am sure he will answer those points when he makes his contribution to this debate.  The Irish people would like information on them.</P>
      <P>The whole tone of the debate on this budget has been deflationary, which will cause unemployment.  There is no incentive for employment.  There is no incentive for young people.  There is not even compensation for the less well-off sections of the community.  I want to talk about social welfare for a moment.  This blue document entitled Principal Features of Budget presented to Dáil Eireann in Tuesday, 21 July 1981, by Mr. John Bruton, T. D., Minister for Finance, was handed out by the Minister after his budget speech. It is the all-time classic document of a cynical Government, an uncaring, unfeeling Government. Increases in social welfare benefits are announced in this document.  They are the goodies under the heading Government Programme, Social Welfare Improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the social welfare improvements included in the document.  For example, there is the supplementary allowance payable to blind persons in receipt of a blind pension. Each of the first two children of a <Col N="1051" /> blind pensioner over 21 will get an increase of 0.05p.  The blind pensioner over 21 will get an increase of 0.25p.  I know the Minister of State who is sitting in the House.  He is a former Lord Mayor. I know him from his constituency work and his work as a member of the local authority.  When he was Lord Mayor he showed concern for the less well-off sections of the community.  I should like to ask him what will 25p purchase today?</P>
    <P>Each of the first two children of that blind pensioner will get the magnificent sum, absolute wealth untold and unknown, of 0.05p.  This increase will be given from October, not from today when the charges are going on and not from 1 September when we have a 50 per cent increase in VAT.  They are getting this princely sum.  It is like the arrival of the three wise men bearing gifts from the cast except that gifts are coming from Meath.  Each subsequent child &mdash; so that they can get together and put down a deposit on an ice cream &mdash; will get another 0.05p.  It would not buy an ice cream.  It would not buy a lollipop.  It is the original Meath version of a deposit on an ice-cream.</P>
    <P>This comes from a caring Government of which the Labour Party are members. When they were in Opposition &mdash; and they will be in Opposition for a long time when the Irish people get a chance at them again &mdash; last January when we were debating the budget brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government and giving a 25 per cent increase in social welfare benefits, they criticised that as not being enough and as not being adequate.  Now they are giving a deposit on an ice cream to the children of blind pensioners as and from 1 October.</P>
    <P>That is not the only ludicrous increase. Under the infectious diseases maintenance allowance the increase for dependants other than the spouse is 0.20p.  Each of the children of recipients of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowances will get 0.15p to compensate for the increase in inflation of over 6 per cent envisaged in this budget.  There will be joy throughout the land on 1 October when they get that <Col N="1052" /> 0.15p from Santa Clause in the person of the Minister from Meath.  They would have the good grace to blush if they had any feeling for the Irish people.  I could go on about the increases of 5p, 15p and 25p but I think I have said enough.</P>
    <P>Talking about a caring Government I want to refer to the Minister's statement last Tuesday.  He said:</P>
    <P>Substantial savings will also be achieved by the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Defence and others.</P>
    <P>Every Government, every businessman, and we in our own lives should cut out unnecessary expenditure.  From my experience in the Department of the Environment I know there was no unnecessary expenditure there.  Probably there was room for improvement in some areas but not of the type we have heard of today. One area on which I thought this Government would not renege was the Bundoran fire inquiry.  After the tragedy in Artane in February last, as Minister for the Environment, on behalf of the Government, I announced before lunch of the day of the tragedy the setting up of a public inquiry.  The terms of reference were debated in the Dáil on the Tuesday. They were questioned here together with other matters relating to the tragedy.</P>
    <P>In that debate the tragedy that had occurred at the Central Hotel in Bundoran on 8 August last was also mentioned, and the need for an inquiry into it.  At that time that tragedy was being investigated by the police and documents were being forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Government felt that, pending the decision of the director with regard to possible prosecutions, they should take no action.  As soon as the director made his decision on the papers before him, a decision which said there was no grounds for prosecution, Fianna Fáil immediately said there would be a public inquiry.  The terms of reference were published and were on the Order Paper before the last day of the sitting.  There was a great cry for that inquiry from Deputy FitzGerald.  The then spokesman on behalf of Fine Gael called for the inquiry.  Deputy White, a <Col N="1053" /> man whom I felt was entitled to some recognition by the Taoiseach for the work he put in on behalf of his party and who should have got a State car but who like others, was let down very badly, made demands for a public inquiry.  Spokesmen on behalf of the Labour Party demanded an inquiry, as did Deputy Browne.  We said that as soon as the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions was made known we would decide whether or not to hold an inquiry.  We decided to have one.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday of this week I asked the Minister for the Environment if he intended to proceed with the holding of the public inquiry into the fire at the Central Hotel in Bundoran on 8 August 1980 and, if so, its terms of reference and when he expected the first sitting to take place.  The Minister answered a number of other questions I had put down.  He finished with the files and immediately propped out of the front row and left his very competent Minister of State to reply on his behalf.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State, but, since it was an issue his party had shown such condern for when in Opposition, I thought he would have felt himself bound to reply.  Much to my amazement the reply I received was that the matter was presently under consideration and a decision would be announced in due course.  I hope it is only my suspicious mind, but I have a feeling that that refers to what the Minister stated on Tuesday &mdash;&ldquo;substantial savings will also be achieved by the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Defence and others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Finance to clarify that the inquiry is not being dropped because of financial constraints and that the inquiry, which we in Government made a commitment to proceed with and announced the terms of reference of, will be proceeded with.  He should also clarify that the substantial savings do not include a saving by reneging &mdash; it is something they are doing on all fronts &mdash; on holding this inquiry.  That would be sinking to a level which would be shocking even for this administration.</P>
    <P>We had an announcement today &mdash; the <Col N="1054" /> third budget in a week &mdash; by the Minister for the Environment that, as and from 1 September, the 1 per cent subsidy on mortgages will be removed and they will increase immediately.  We had the reneging on the £3,000 subsidy to be paid to first-time house purchasers who are single people.  About 22 per cent of all new houses bought would be eligible for the mortgage subsidy.  I assume this applies also to the £1,000 grant.</P>
    <P>We had a clear indication from the Minister for the Environment that he will gladly encourage the imposition of domestic rates or charges of some kind or other.  These budgetary decisions we did not get from the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach but from the Minister for the Environment.  They are major decisions which will affect every building society mortgage holder.  The House deserves a clear explanation of the reneging by the administration on the commitments in their policy document and the Gaiety Theatre programme.  Great play was made by the Minister in regard to the position of unfinished estates.  He waxed eloquent about the need to improve the condition of these.  All the Minister has to do is implement the scheme which is already there.  I introduced it a number of months ago and it will meet this problem. I agree that there is a need to tackle the problem of unfinished estates.  He does not have to come into the House and announce it as if it were a new idea of his.  It has been on the cards for some time.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the present position of the decentralisation programme which we were pushing so hard.  The Minister for the Environment should clarify the clear policy decision made by Fianna Fáil that An Foras Forbartha should be transferred to Cork as a major boost not only to the policy of decentralisation but to the revitalisation of the inner Cork city area which is in need of improvement.  I should like the Minister for the Environment to clarify this position for us by way of public statement since he will not have the opportunity during the remaining stages of this debate of letting us know the position.  I should like him to clarify the position regarding the commitment <Col N="1055" /> we had to the decentralisation programme and in particular to the transfer as soon as possible to Cork of An Foras Forbartha and to the building that was earmarked by us for that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when the British contributory pensions are increased those people here who are in receipt of a British pension but who are not getting the full amount and who, consequently, are in receipt of and old age pension here but which is reduced on foot of an increase in the British pension, are visited by an officer of the Department for the purpose of an investigation and that since some weeks or even months may elapse before the situation is rectified, considerable inconvenience is caused to those concerned? This is something that should be corrected and there should be a better <Col N="1056" /> approach on the part of the Department to the manner in which these pensioners are treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's area has a higher than average incidence of recipients of British pensions. In the past these people could find themselves less well off financially because of changes in the British pension but there is an agreement which ensures that a person in receipt of an old age pension will not suffer any reduction that would be greater than the value of the increase.  On the occasion of an increase in the British pension investigations are necessary and this procedure may cause undue hardship.  However, I will investigate the question of the speed with which these matters are being dealt with a view to ascertaining if any inconvenience can be lessened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the assessment of the yearly value of free or partially-free board and lodgings in the case of applications for unemployment assistance from single persons residing in their parents' homes.  Deciding officers and appeals officers are obliged by law to take this factor into account in the assessment of means in such cases.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not specify the method by which the value of board and lodgings should be calculated.  Each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household in which the applicant resides and also the number of persons residing in the household. The system is kept under constant review and changes are made from time to time with a view to improvement.  I intend to continue this process of periodic review and to make whatever changes are warranted from time to time.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it could be very embarrassing to a person of, say, 20 or 23 years of age, to find, on applying for unemployment assistance, that he is not eligible because of his having board and lodgings with his parents? This is something that should be corrected immediately.  I have had one case of a young chap who lost his employment. He did not have sufficient stamps to qualify him for benefit and he was allowed only 35p per week assistance by reason of his having board and lodgings at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>One's sympathy is with any such individual but there is a statutory basis of assessment in such cases and legislative change would be necessary to alter that process.  The assessment of the value of board and lodgings is something that is open to a certain amount of review and control.  In the type of case the Deputy cities, that is, of somebody being awarded 33p per week, obviously the <Col N="1058" /> quality of the lodgings and the amount of income in the home were the factors in arriving at that figure. A whole study of this system, of the concept of poverty and of the methods used in determining it, is being carried out by an analyst attached to the Department of Finance.  It is expected that a report will be available shortly and that the means of assessment will be reviewed in the light of that report.  When that happens it may be possible to consider the kind of matter raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>It would be much more acceptable if that sort of situation did not arise but we are not living in an ideal society.  If it were possible financially to move away from such a situation it would be desirable to do so but under the present system those who it has been determined are living in the poorest circumstances and who are suffering physical deprivation by way of lack of adequate food or clothes are entitled to the full amount of assistance.  The wider question of a person's dignity is one which is not perhaps sufficiently covered by the present situation.  The direct basic needs of welfare and of maintaining life and limb are being considered under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the present position in regard to social welfare payments arising out of the industrial action taken by the Civil and Public Services Staff Association; the payments that are effected; the approximate length of delays in those payments; and the special arrangements being made to ensure that beneficiaries receive the payments due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Monday 29 June the staff of some sections of my Department who are members of the Civil and Public Services' Staff Association have resumed their industrial action.  They have placed a ban on overtime working and are refusing to operate computer equipment which provides the insurance record for 1979-80 on which entitlement to benefit in 1981 is based.  This action is being taken in support of a civil service-wide pay claim for the staff concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> The main effect of this action is that new claims to disability, maternity and injury benefits cannot be processed in the absence of the relevant insurance records. Payments to existing claimants, however, continue to be made although there may be some delay in the issue of such payments.  The processing of claims to other benefits and pensions where an insurance record is required may also be delayed.</P>
    <P>My Department are concerned about any situation where delays arise in making payments to claimants and I would sincerely hope that the existing difficulties will be resolved before very long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>How many new claims are held up?  How many new claims for disability benefit, injury benefit and maternity benefit are held up?  Are claims for unemployment benefit held up?  Are the Department now refusing to pay supplementary welfare?  I quoted yesterday a notice which was printed to the effect that those refused unemployment benefit will not get supplementary welfare.  This notice was placed in one of the centres on Tuesday this week.  Further, is the Minister of State aware that the 3,600 busmen, who are not involved in the CIE dispute but who were laid off by CIE on 9 July, are entitled to full unemployment benefit but they have got nothing so far and the labour exchanges have refused to pay them?  They then went for supplementary welfare which they were also refused.  Today they are standing in to get money at Cumberland Street and Gardiner Street exchanges.  Tomorrow it seems that 750 more will be standing in in Gardiner Street.  These are men and families who are entitled to the benefit and can get no money.  Is this a new departure in the Government's hard-line industrial relations policy which will have a very severe effect on workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the numbers affected, the situation is extremely serious and could potentially become more serious.  Regarding the effect on disability benefit claims, the number of new claims on hands which have not been authorised amount to 9,400 &mdash; at least that was the figure I had and I am told they are now <Col N="1062" /> up to about 12,000.  From now on the number of unauthorised claims will increase by about 1,000 a day.  In the case of current claims, approximately 3,000 cheques a week are not issued where claimants quote incorrect numbers. Many current claims are going ahead but where there is any difficulty about incorrect information these are not being processed.</P>
      <P>However, despite this industrial action taken, the bulk of disability benefits, about 90 per cent, are still being issued. This proportion will decline as current claims expire and as no new claims are being authorised.  The effect on the unemployment benefit claims is that claims already in payment will continue to be paid both at employment exchanges and branch employment offices.  The claims which will be affected are new claims which amount to approximately 4,000 a week countrywide.  Unless an applicant has an old insurance number and he or she qualified for unemployment benefit on the basis of his or her 1978-79 contribution record, it will not be possible to determine entitlement until details of the 1978-79 record extracted from the manual records will be supplied by central records section.  It is understood, however, that some exchanges are now blacking the authorisation of claims on such records.  Heretofore this difficulty was overcome at the employment exchanges by utilising income tax forms or employers' statements to determine entitlement.  However, under an instruction issued by the CPSSA to their members the use of these sources of information has been blacked from 18 July 1981. Indications from employment exchanges suggest that eligibility in a high proportion of the 4,000 new claims received each week could not be determined because of this action.  It is known that the P60 action has been put into operation in the Dublin employment exchanges.  Information is not yet available as to the extent to which provincial offices are affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, in the normal course any claimant who could not immediately establish entitlement to benefit could have recourse to the supplementary welfare <Col N="1063" /> allowance scheme.  The Eastern Health Board have, however, indicated strongly to the Department that the community welfare officers will be unable to deal with claimants who might claim supplementary welfare allowance by reason of industrial action at the Department of Social Welfare.  Their organisation is geared to dealing with between 5,000 and 6,000 and as they are at present operating at maximum capacity they have neither the personnel nor the space to deal with additional numbers.</P>
    <P>There are indications also &mdash; and this would refer to the matter of the CIE bus drivers and busmen &mdash; that the unions representing the community welfare officers have instructed their members not to operate any scheme designed to pay persons eligible for social welfare benefits where payment is not made as a result of industrial action in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this has anything to do with Government policy.  These are the details of an industrial action the ramifications of which are most serious and this seriousness is understood fully by the Department.  The negotiations on this are at an extremely sensitive stage, and nobody should know better then the questioner in this case the nature and sensitivity of this dispute and the whole area and its implications.  I assure the Deputy that the full seriousness of this is understood by the Minister and the Department and that every effort is being made to prepare contingency plans for further breakdowns and to respond to the existing extremely difficult situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that this is a complete shutdown bringing about a gravely serious situation which has not existed at any time before?  The fact that supplementary welfare should be closed down entirely as well is very grave.  What special measures are the Minister of State herself or the Government taking to make sure that people get some money in this situation? I appreciate the difficulties.  After the lapse of a certain amount of time, and with the problem growing at the rate of <Col N="1064" /> 4,000 a week on unemployment benefit and 1,000 a day on disability benefit it has reached crisis proportions.  What measures do the Minister and the Government propose to take to remedy the situation and to ensure that people get some money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the claim that the system is effectively at a standstill. Ninety per cent of disability claims are still being paid.  The only unemployment benefit and supplementary welfare schemes affected in employment exchanges are those which relate to another industrial dispute.  The effects are serious and very worrying but not as extensive as the Deputy is suggesting.  I am not in a position to say what measures are being taken.  Obviously the Deputy, with his knowledge of the Department will understand that given the number of persons involved in this dispute, and the fact that the supplementary welfare scheme will not operate claims rejected by the Department of Social Welfare on the basis of an industrial dispute, the major avenue of support has now been closed. We are looking into alternative measures, the nature of which cannot be disclosed at this stage.  They are being energetically pursued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister correct when she says 90 per cent of the payments are being made and that there is only a 10 per cent hold-up at the moment?  My information is that no payments are being made.  It almost calls for an emergency service to be set up by the Department to alleviate current hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go into details of the dispute but to suggest that a Department which is in industrial dispute, and support it within itself, could set up an emergency service is an indication of a failure to understand the complexities of industrial relations within the Department.  I assured the Deputy that per cent of disability claims were being dealt with.  Some but not all new claims are affected.  New claims which need recourse to certain information on computers which are not being operated, new <Col N="1065" /> claims which relate to the industrial dispute in one section are not being dealt with by another section.  I admit the figure we are talking about can only increase, as more of the continuing payments on a regular basis come up for reconfirmation and the necessary information will not be available.  The situation is serious and, if the dispute continues, the implications will be even more serious.  I cannot deny that.  We understand its seriousness.  Given the numbers involved and the fact that so many of the avenues normally available for supplementary welfare are closed, the options for contingency action are fairly limited but, such as they are, we are examining them and hope to have proposals in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may recall that on a similar previous occasion when there was industrial action, there was a danger that old age pensioners would not be paid.  I, as Minister for Social Welfare, invoked the assistance of voluntary organisations and succeeded in overcoming the difficulties. I succeeded in ensuring that old age pensions were paid despite very serious industrial action.  Would the Minister consider something along these lines in the present emergency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible avenue will be explored and such a course will be considered.  I accept that the reference which the Deputy is making referred to a situation which was less complex because in that case the persons operating the Social Welfare Department schemes were willing to supply all the necessary information, pension books, clerical assistance and so on.  In these circumstances, with no possibility of departmental involvement, given the current dispute the problems are more difficult but we will investigate every avenue to prevent genuine cases of need, or hardship or suffering obviously inflicted on social welfare recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said in relation to supplementary welfare, in view of the industrial <Col N="1066" /> action and the burden it will put on officers dealing with supplementary welfare in the various counties, is the Minister aware that very often the figure allocated by the health boards is substantially lower than that which would normally be arrived at by the Department of Social Welfare?  This is causing a further burden to those in need.  Would she be prepared to state if there is a regular figure or accepted criteria in relation to the amount that can be allocated in the interim measure by the health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the supplementary welfare scheme can in no way equal the payments that will be made from the normal social welfare channels. The use of the supplementary welfare scheme will be limited as an answer to this because already the indications are that the staff are unable physically to cope with much more and are unwilling to do so because of the industrial dispute. We will attempt to take into consideration in making emergency arrangements what the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as there is a section of the Social Welfare Act which provides for the payment to wives and dependants of people who are on strike that the same would apply in this instance even though it is slightly different from people being on strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that those who are operating the supplementary welfare scheme are not willing to handle claims which have been held up by their strike-bound Departments. The possibilities of a supplementary welfare scheme and its extension do not enter into it because those who are working the supplementary welfare scheme will not, in effect, deal with claims that have been rejected by other members of their unions from other sections.  It is because of the original dispute that we need to have recourse to supplementary welfare schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned, who had been deserted by her husband in England, claimed deserted wife`s allowance in July 1971.  In support of her application she submitted a copy of the divorce <i>decree nisi</i> obtained by her husband on 9 July 1971.  She was awarded the allowance with effect from 29 July 1971.</P>
      <P>She subsequently claimed widow`s pension on the death of her late husband on 15 August 1972, but her application was refused after legal advice had been obtained in the matter.  She appealed against the decision and the appeals officer upheld the decision refusing a widow's pension.  She has however continued to be paid a deserted wife`s allowance at the maximum rate from the original date.  The rate of the allowance payable is the same as the rate of widow's pension which would otherwise have been payable in her case.</P>
      <P>As explained previously to the Deputy in reply to a question on 18 May 1976, the legal advice available to my Department is to the effect that a divorce properly obtained by a person domiciled in another jurisdiction must be recognised as valid in this country.</P>
      <P>The problem of divorce is a complex one which affects matters other than widow's pension &mdash; for example, the validity of subsequent marriages, devolution of property, etc.  The Minister for Social Welfare has always been guided by the general law of the country as interpreted by the Attorney General and the courts.  If there should be a change in that law or in its interpretation, I will give effect to such change in relation to widows` pensions, but action to bring about a change would not be a matter for my Department.</P>

She should be <Col N="1069" /> entitled to the designation of widow, in the light of our attitude.  Irish law recognises foreign divorces but does not allow divorces here.

      <P>The current situation is one which needs a lot of clarification but which is not strictly the responsibility of this Department.  The person involved is not deprived in any way financially because of the situation.  The designation of her as a widow or deserted wife relates to the law of the land.  That law recognises foreign divorces and has recognised them for some time.  Any outraged comments at this stage would be equally hypocritical of the Deputy, as would any criticism generally of the situation here.  There is a commitment, as the Deputy knows, although it is not strictly relevant, by the Department of Social Welfare to attempt to set up an all-party committee.

      <P>A woman who would <Col N="1070" /> obviously like to be designated a widow rather than a deserted wife would get my sympathy.  However, in terms of the operation of a system, clearly in this country a totally anomalous situation has developed in relation to the marriage situation where there are many difficulties and problems.  I may make any comment I like in this area.  But in reality, until there is a legal change, these anomalies will exist and persons such as this lady will suffer from certain indignities to which they object.  It is a fact that marriages and divorces obtained legally in foreign countries, the jurisdiction of which is recognised, are recognised here. As mentioned in my reply, the implications of doing otherwise are extensive. They relate to areas of subsequent marriages and if we were to designate this lady&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Payment has now been made from 30 June 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 24 July 1981 at the maximum appropriate rate.  Pay-related benefit has also been paid.  The delay in payment of benefit was due to <Col N="1073" /> industrial action by some members of the staff of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions are <Col N="1074" /> related and I propose to take them together.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State at my Department stated in this House on the Second Stage of the Employment Guarantee Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1981, no commitments have yet been made by the Government on the disbursement of the additional £10 million accruing to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the second national understanding.  It is proposed to consult with employer and trade union representatives about the disbursement of this additional money prior to making any decisions.</P>
      <P>A sum of £3.5 million was allocated from the Employment Guarantee Fund, as financed under the first national understanding, for the provision of sports and recreational facilities, following consultations in the Tripartite Standing Committee on Employment and, of course, this decision will stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that his and other Departments are fully informed of commitments on the three areas mentioned in these questions? Is he not further aware that agreement was reached by the Government on those three allocations forming part of the allocations under the Employment Guarantee Fund, in consultation with the social partners? Is he now telling the House that these three areas will not get an allocation and that the Government will not follow on the commitments made by their predecessors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Applications in respect of all these areas can be made and if they are, they will be considered in the course of consultations which, in the view of this Government, must take place with the social partners.  This fund was established as an instrument of the national understanding, an agreement to which the Government are only one of the parties. It would be inappropriate therefore for any Government to disburse funds which are supposed to be the subject of consultation with the other social partners without such consultation taking place.  That procedure does not seem to have been followed by the previous Government <Col N="1075" /> and that was a matter of some surprise to the incoming Government.</P>
      <P>In the case of the application from CTT, there was a decision by the previous Government on 29 June, approximately 24 hours before the Government left office, to allocate £1.381 million to CTT. In view of the present Government`s conviction that all applications of this nature should first be discussed on a general basis with the social partners, this decision, which was not in accord with that general principle, has since been rescinded, but an application from that quarter can be considered once the consultations I referred to have been completed. There was no Government decision on the other subjects &mdash; the Irish Productivity Centre or the sports facilities.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Finance may realise that there was some unexpended money in the old fund and I understand an allocation was made from that money on 29 June.  In respect of the new fund no allocation has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 May 1981 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, advised the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Tunney, by telephone that the allocation of £3.7 million should be made available by him for the provision of recreational facilities from the Employment Guarantee Fund, a fund which at that time was not even in existence because the relevant legislation had not been passed by this House.  Following the telephone call Deputy Tunney instructed the youth and sports section of his Department to prepare a second phase of the national programme for many applications for recreational facilities which had been received.  Information on this second allocation from a fund which did not exist was disseminated by the Minister of State through various public representatives all of whom, I understand, were candidates at the general election and members of one party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> The approval of the Minister for Finance or the Government was not sought for any of these allocations which were made from a fund which did not exist.  It would be an understatement if I were to say that the incoming Government were surprised that such a procedure had been followed by any government in the course of an election campaign in respect of public money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister for Finance accept that in this area of responsibility he is in a very sensitive position? Does he recall that he was the junior Minister at the Department of Education responsible for this area?  Does he acknowledge that it is a well known fact that he sat in that office for a considerable time without a penny to his name?  Would he now, having regard to this, consider for his own reputation that he should be a little less hard-faced with regard to these grants for sporting and recreational facilities?  Would he further acknowledge that the allocation by the Government of £10 million from the Employment Guarantee Fund was decided upon at budget time in January 1981?  Would he accept that any delay was due to ascertaining the agreement of Brussels and the employers to the completion of a fund?  Would he accept that the previous year the Fianna Fáil Government had secured the agreement of the social partners in principle to the allocation from the employment guarantee fund, somewhere in the region of £3.5 million, and that that principle could be safely assumed to be followed through in 1981 because, whatever this Government may think, the trade union and employer representatives were fully behind the Government in allocating this money for sporting and recreational facilities for our youth from that fund?</P>

The view of the present Government in respect of this new fund, which has not even been authorised by this House &mdash; and the concerns of this House should be taken into account before money is allocated &mdash; is that the money was purportedly authorised by the outgoing Taoiseach and his Minister of State without the House having an opportunity to sanction the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>The lack of care as to how the money should be spent is evident in the case of a centre in County Cork.  We all appreciate that money should be spent after due examination, the relevant documentation having been collected so as to ensure that the money is being properly spent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 14 to 20, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The replacement of the existing income tax personal allowances by income tax credits, including the direct payment to the spouse working in the family home, is an integral part of the Programme for Government.  It will be implemented as part of the overall restructuring of the tax system envisaged in that programme.  The precise details and scope of the proposed scheme of credits have yet to be finalised by the Government and I will be announcing these details in due course.  The scheme will come into operation with effect from the beginning of the next income tax year.</P>

      <P>On the previous group of questions I rose to ask a supplementary. The Chair looked in my direction and saw that three people were offering. You offered two members of the Fianna Fail front bench the opportunity to ask supplementary questions.  I was the third person offering.  Do I have an equal right, in your opinion?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Fine Gael manifesto gave a very definite impression that women working in the home would receive £9.60?  Does he not agree that widows and deserted wives work in the home and will he tell us why they are being discriminated against under this scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of application of this payment has yet to be worked out in detail.  The categories to which the Deputy has referred will be borne in mind when these details are being worked out. <Col N="1081" /> This scheme is part of the largest ever overhaul of the income tax system.  It is a major change in the method of operation. It is, therefore, understandable that the precise details must be worked out with great care.  If the Deputy wishes to make representations or submissions in respect of the group whom she feels are not adequately covered by the proposals as published to date, such representations will be very carefully considered.</P>

The same applies to question No. 17.  The PAYE worker there at £6,000 per annum is now paying out £12 per week and can now only hope to lose a tax credit later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking earlier about the third budget we have had this week.  I referred particularly to the statement of the Minister for the Environment &mdash; and I regret to see him leaving the House &mdash; when he produced the information for this House telling unfortunate building society mortgage holders that on and from 1 September next there is to be an increase in their mortgages because he and the Government <Col N="1124" /> have decided to remove the subsidy granted by the Fianna Fail administration in May of this year.  Furthermore, in the budget announced by the Minister for the Environment today we learned of the starting reneging on commitments given to the electorate, both in the Fine Gael Programme and in the Gaiety Theatre document.  We learned that the mortgage subsidy introduced by the Fianna Fail Government and announced by me in April of this year is being watered down to the extent that 22 per cent &mdash; nearly one quarter &mdash; of those buying houses for the first time, single people buying houses, will no longer be eligible for the mortgage subsidy.  That startling piece of information was given to the people today.  It is no wonder that I describe it as the third budget of this week.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there was the clear indication in the speech of the Minister for the Environment of the intention to reintroduce rates by whatever name; he spoke about particular charges to be introduced.  The words he used were:</P>
      <P>If they &mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&ldquo;they&rdquo; being local authorities</P>
      <P>are prepared to take on themselves the responsibility of raising the necessary funds, even if that means new or increased direct charges, I do not think they should be prevented from doing so.</P>
      <P>This statement of the Minister for the Environment is a clear indication of domestic rates being levied under another name.  Whether they be rates, domestic taxes or domestic charges, no matter how they are described, they amount to taxation under another name.</P>
      <P>Therefore there is the increase in mortgages for houseowners, the reneging on the mortgage subsidy scheme and now this clear indication of domestic taxation of some order or another.  It is important that the Government state their position with regard to the decentralisation programme and particularly important that the Minister for the Environment should do so, he having responsibility for An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to yet another <Col N="1125" /> announcement here today at Question Time, that is the decision of the Government with regard to the Employment Guarantee Fund.  This is very relevant to the environmental area, to local communities and the whole of the Department of the Environment because so much of our Government's policy was the encouragement of local endeavour amongst local communities.  Now we are informed there is a reneging by this Government with regard to the allocation to the Employment Guarantee Fund.  It is important that local organisations and sports clubs who entered into contracts on foot of commitments given them with regard to allocations from the Employment Guarantee Fund should have their position clarified in this House.  I am interested to see a Deputy from my constituency in the House because in her own town in Malahide the GAA sports and leisure complex was given an allocation of £30,000 from that fund.  What is to be their position now?  They have entered into binding contractual arrangements on foot of that allocation.  What is their position from today as a result of the announcement by the Minister for Finance?  The people of north County Dublin, in particular the people of Malahide, will be affected very much by this.  They raised funds on a voluntary basis; a magnificent effort through local involvement in raising funds for this sports centre for the GAA, for St. Sylvester's. They are being let down totally by this announcement today, as are two other boy scout organisations in north County Dublin, one in Swords in regard to a new centre for the scouts there and another for the Donabate scout troop.</P>
    <P>What we have seen this week has been one continuous procession of broken promises, reneging on promises, one further element of taxation after another as each Minister contributes.  We had the Minister for Finance on Tuesday with his part of the budget.  This morning we had the announcement with regard to the clarification of the ESB and CIE charges. I notice it was announced that ESB charges were going up 25 per cent but I will be interested to see the final figure. Then we have had the savage imposition <Col N="1126" /> on householders and mortgage holders announced today by the Minister for the Environment.  Without doubt it is the quickest and most disgraceful example of any Government in the history of this State, in a short period of three weeks, breaking so many firm commitments and promises to the people, promises given the electorate during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>Finally I should refer to the £9.60 to be paid to housewives.  The Minister for Finance said a few moments ago that it was never intended to be paid until next April.  I can say to Fine Gael canvassers &mdash; and there is one Deputy sitting in this House at present &mdash; that that was not the impression given by them when they knocked on doors all over north County Dublin.  The people of north County Dublin will await their opportunity at the next election, sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, I have been assigned special responsibilities for housing, sanitary services and the fire services.</P>
      <P>As regards the housing sector, I was completely baffled by statements made by Fianna Fail during the first half of this year about the housing scene.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, I found it hard to appreciate statements from the former Government that a record 27,800 houses were completed last year, that over 30,000 houses would be completed this year, that the level of 6,000 local authority houses a year would be maintained and that the provision for local authority housing subsidy was increased from £62.067 million in 1980 to only £62.193 million in 1981.  This assessment of the situation did not tally with my experience on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts? While there was a record level of housing completions last year, there was an estimated drop of 16 per cent in the level of private housing activity.  Turning to 1981, nobody except Fianna Fáil expects completions to reach the 30,000 figure which was bandied about during the recent election campaign. Even the official estimate is only <Col N="1127" /> 25,500 and completions for the first six months of this year are already down 2,400 compared with the same period last year.  That is why it is rather ominous that Deputy Burke spoke about many things in his speech, but he never mentioned housing.  I can see why he would not want to mention housing.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk about the local authority housing programme, Similarily, one of the most serious and depressing problems which confronted the Government on assuming office was the serious financial crisis which the previous administration allowed to develop in the local authority housing programme.  It is no exaggeration to say that the programme was in a complete shambles.  On coming into office I knew things were reasonably bad but I was not aware they were so bad.  In my own local authority area by the end of this month there would have been a standstill.  There would have been unemployment and closing down of housing developments because of the lack of finance.  Up to the time I went into office there was no indication from the previous administration that money would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder I say that it is a shambles. Housing programmes have been awaiting sanction from as far back as last January and no action was taken.  Apparently no action was contemplated and I have no doubt that no action would have been taken.  It was a very depressing scene.  One can well understand why it was not mentioned when Deputy Burke was talking because obviously it depressed him also.  We have not left it at that.  In our short time in office £30 million has been made available for local authority housing.  That was not spoken of nor will it be spoken of.  If that money was not forthcoming there would have been serious unemployment and a serious depression in the public sector housing programme.</P>
    <P>The CIF mentioned last weekend that there were hold-ups.  There certainly were for the last six months and they were not very hopeful of being able to criticise.  We were in office less than two weeks when they criticised us.  However, <Col N="1128" /> I am happy to say now that these housing programmes all over the county can get under way and that we can get our public housing programme moving.</P>
    <P>Net expenditure on the programme last year was £114 million.  When I took up office, net expenditure was being limited to £100 million on the basis of aggregate debit balances on local authority accounts not exceeding 15 per cent.  This would represent a drop of 36 per cent in expenditure in real terms.</P>
    <P>With over 80 per cent of the available capital provision in 1981 for the programme drawn by mid-year, local authorities, in addition to not being able to commence new schemes which are urgently required, were faced with the unhappy prospect of having to cease operations on their existing schemes and lay off workers at a time when national unemployment figures had already reached record levels, under the previous Administration.  My colleague, the Minister, has already outlined in detail the background to the development of the financial crisis and general rundown of the local authority housing programme and the measures which the Government have taken to restore the programme to the level necessary to meet the existing need in the country.  As the Minister pointed out, the rundown of the programme has been a gradual process rather than an overnight development. As I indicated, I have in my office programmes awaiting approval since last January.</P>
    <P>The crisis which had been building up since 1978 is now beginning to show in the figures, the latest of which reveal that completions are already down on last year.  More alarmingly, the number of new starts commenced in the first five months of this year has fallen by 558 or 24 per cent on the same period last year and the average monthly number of dwellings at planning over the period has fallen from 17,984 to 15,222.  That is a startling drop.  The target of 6,000 house completions in 1981 set by the previous Government cannot possibly be attained. Indeed, completions may be as low as 5,000 to 5,500 this year, the lowest figure since the early seventies.  That is a clear <Col N="1129" /> indication of the commitment the previous Government had in the whole local authority area.  Yet as late as June of this year they were stating in their elaborate press advertisements that completions would exceed 6,000 this year.  This type of irresponsible cynicism designed to mislead the public should have no place among those who are charged with the responsibility of managing the programme. Over the last couple of days we had to listen to some ranting and raving from the far side of the House about irresponsibility and to all sorts of other charges.  We are laying before the House the facts of the local authority housing programme.  Any member of a local authority throughout the country is only too well aware of the terrible problem.</P>
    <P>The failure of the previous Government to increase investment in the local authority housing programme to keep pace with increases in costs placed an almost intolerable burden on local authorities who were being asked to maintain the level of their programmes. Of course, with grossly inadequate capital the local authorities found themselves in dire financial difficulties.  Despite their pleas for help, the Government refused to bail them out while at the same time proclaiming their commitment to local authority housing programmes.  It must have been galling for local authorities to be carrying the can while the Government were claiming the credit.</P>
    <P>I am not naive enough, however, not to realise that it is simply not enough to pump endless amounts of money into the local authority housing programme. Equally important is the necessity to ensure value for money.  In this connection I am somewhat perturbed at the high cost of building local authority houses and I propose to have a re-appraisal of present policies in this area carried out in order to eliminate waste and achieve economies in the programme.  This should be possible without reducing standards of construction which would have implications for maintenance costs in the long-term.  It is important that from time to time we examine housing costs so as to ensure that at all times the high <Col N="1130" /> standard set by the last Coalition Government will be maintained when we eliminate low cost housing for all time. That is not saying that we must spend money foolishly or wastefully; we must ensure that we get value for every £1 especially now more than ever.  My Department have in operation at present cost control procedures designed to produce a data bank of information on local authority housing costs from which it will be possible to identify areas where economies can and should be effected.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the necessity for the Government to authorise a further £16.5 million in local authority housing subsidy which brings the total provision in 1981 to £79 million.  As he has said, the need for the extra allocation arose primarily from a decision by the previous Government in the context of the 1981 budget to under-provide for this item in 1981 and postpone payments until 1982.  This was a regrettable decision and one which again would have placed local authorities in an intolerable financial straitjacket at the end of next November. I am glad to say that the present Government will honour their liabilities to local authorities in respect of subsidies in full in accordance with established practice.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Fianna Fail swept the problem of the local authority housing programme under the carpet.  Instead, they announced a housing package at their Ard-Fheis.  To finance the package in 1981 they proposed to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of £1 million for the mortgage subsidy but no provision was made for the general increase in the SDA loan and income limits which would cost about £9 million this year.</P>
    <P>That is a clear indication of the attitude of the previous Government and their total irresponsibility in the whole area of public housing.  They did not want to know about it.  They were interested in announcing cosmetic exercises and plans without ever making adequate provision for them.  When we talk about a £950 million deficit their mouths are wide open in astonishment and they doubt the figure. There is no reason to doubt it.  The figures are compiled by civil servants who served them also; they should know the <Col N="1131" /> figures as well as this Government know them now.  There is no point in them crying &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.  They hid the facts because of the election.  These facts are out now and this Government are saddled with the job of having to do something about the situation.  Otherwise our credibility as a nation would be reduced as would our ability to borrow in future. Any responsible Government assuming office would have to take immediate action.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to take the action we have taken but when you come up against something as dramatic as what we have seen this week and since coming into office, a legacy of debt heaped upon more debt by a previous Government who had no concern about and showed no awareness of our finances, you must act.  The only motivation they had was towards remaining on the Government side of the House.  They did not achieve that even with their irresponsible spending.  Thank God we now have a Government prepared to do something to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>To recognise the scale and the nature of housing problems the Government must have available to them as much information as they reasonably can assemble.  Recognition of the nature and the extent of the need for housing is of fundamental importance and in this connection I am very glad to see that the analysis of an assessment of overall national housing needs which was initiated by the then Minister for the Environment in January 1980 and carried out by local authorities since then is now nearing completion.  This exercise will reveal much useful information on the extent and the type of need which has accumulated and what we can expect in the years ahead.  I am confident that the ensuing report, when it has been examined by the Government and published, will provide the basis for a realistic housing programme and for the adaptation of existing housing policies to meet the nation's requirements.</P>
    <P>In the interim, however, there are positive steps which can be taken to expand the range of facilities to ensure <Col N="1132" /> that existing resources for the provision of housing are used to the fullest advantage. There may be hitherto unexplored sources of finance for housing which I wish to see tapped.  As an avenue for channelling these resources into housing, I have been examining the question of the establishment of a Housing Finance Agency and I hope to be in a position to put forward specific proposals for the establishment of such an agency during the next few months.  At present, I am arranging discussions on this subject with all possible haste with a large number of interested parties.</P>
    <P>I believe that we must at all times look to see where we can raise the necessary finance in various areas to find other sources independent of local authorities, building societies and other agencies.  I believe that the Housing Finance Agency will be the ideal basis for this and I look forward to working on it in the next few months with a view to having some tangible information in the early autumn.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the area of non-profit housing I shall be having discussions shortly with the representative group of people involved in co-operative and voluntary housing with the object of exchanging views on how this third arm of housing activity can be expanded to cater for specific types of housing need. Certainly, non-profit housing groups have the ability to produce houses; this has been demonstrated in some parts of the country.  Arising from the proposed discussions I would hope that the energy generated by their philanthropic motives can be translated into houses on the ground.  If we can get the voluntary housing bodies and co-operatives together under a tight umbrella, properly registered, with finance and with incentives, I think we can do a great deal.  There has always been a great spirit in the area of co-operatives in this country.  If we examine and come to grips with the problem and establish that third housing area properly we could be starting something which would be lasting and have a very great impact on the whole housing area.</P>
    <P>In the private housing sector I am well aware of the extent to which persons who are not catered for by commercial agencies <Col N="1133" /> depend on the local authority house purchase loan scheme to enable them to house themselves.  In this context it is, of course, important that the local authority loan and income limits should be kept at realistic levels.  However it must be borne in mind that increased demand inevitably follows each increase in the limits.  This increased demand, while gratifying, naturally increases the burden on scarce capital resources.</P>
    <P>The position this year is that the amount available for house purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants is just over £100 million.  While this amount is substantially greater than the amount provided last year, because of the expanding demand, it is still not sufficient to enable authorities to pay loans as promptly as I would wish.</P>
    <P>In an effort to ease the situation, as already announced the Government have decided to restrict the availability of ordinary local authority loans to married persons and persons about to be married. The underlying reasons for this decision have already been outlined by the Minister and there is no reason for me to repeat them.  This step will help to ensure that the limited funds available are deployed to the best advantage and will go to the categories of persons most in need of them.</P>
    <P>In my view, we cannot continue to ignore the extreme importance of adequate maintenance and improvement of the housing stock.  We have an old housing stock.  Schemes of grants and loans for improvement works operated by successive Governments ensured the adaptation of much old housing to meet modern needs and reduced the level of replacement building that otherwise would have been required.  The improvement grants scheme in particular was a distinct incentive to people to carry out works to their houses.  This incentive was removed more or less overnight by the Fianna Fail Government last year and Deputies will be only too aware of the general dismay at that bad decision.</P>
    <P>I feel that, without a shadow of doubt, there is a real need and a pressing demand for a scheme which aids the provision of basic amenities.  When I mention <Col N="1134" /> that the most recent survey of the housing stock which was carried out last year by local authorities revealed that, for instance, 185,000 houses lacked a fixed bathroom or shower, that 98,000 lacked sewerage facilities, that 87,000 houses lacked an internal water supply and that 32,000 houses were unfit but capable of economic repair, Deputies will appreciate the extent of the problem and the pressing need for Government assistance. Indeed, I find it impossible to understand why grants are not available for individual water and toilet facilities at a time when we provide a colour television service on two channels.</P>
    <P>It is clear that our priorities have been wrong.  We know it is important that we continue to build houses, but if we neglect our present housing stock we do so at our peril.  If that happens we will have a waste of a valuable resource.  The improvement grants hitherto available were not of a princely character but at least they encouraged people to carry out work in their homes.  I am happy to announce that reasonable home improvement grants will be introduced very shortly.  They will give people an incentive to extend their homes, to install bathrooms and to carry out improvements. The investment necessary will not be so large when one considers the return.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the scheme was abolished by the previous Government.  I think it was included with another scheme and when the Government lost their nerve and panicked they withdrew both schemes.  It was a bad decision and it worked to the detriment of our housing stock.  As I have told the House, I will be announcing the details of the new scheme very shortly.</P>
    <P>Immediately on taking office, the Government were faced with a particularly grave social problem relating to private rented housing.  The Government's intention to tackle these problems is amply demonstrated by the manner and speed with which I introduced and had passed in the Dáil and Seanad the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1981.  It provides an important measure of protection for many private rented <Col N="1135" /> tenants who were adversely affected by a recent Supreme Court decision declaring unconstitutional parts of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  This Act is a temporary measure to run for six months from the date of its enactment.  Within this six months the Government will introduce, as promised in the Dáil during discussions on the Bill, further legislation to provide more permanent safeguards for the tenants involved and to ensure their security of tenure.  In addition, where tenants face hardship as a consequence of higher rents arising out of the Supreme Court decision, assistance will be provided to aid the tenants concerned. I will have the necessary legislation before the House in the next session.</P>
    <P>The private rented sector provides a source of housing for many groups within our community.  It is important that the Government should encourage investment in this area.  It is essential, there-fore, that the legislation introduced and the reforms made should be fair to all the parties concerned, the landlords as well as the tenants.  People investing in this area must expect a fair return on their money.  At the same time, every effort must be made to improve conditions and standards and to ensure that the rents charged are reasonable.  Our programme for Government sets out measures which will go a long way towards creating the right atmosphere for continued improvement of this important part of the housing market.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few short words about the sanitary services programme, which is an extremely important sector because of the influence it exerts on economic development generally and physical planning in particular as well as employment farming, tourism, and so on. Capital provided for sanitary services in 1981 by the previous Government totalled almost £75 million, comprising £67.3 million for expenditure on public sanitary services schemes and £7.4 million on private group water schemes.  While the Government have been under considerable pressure to achieve economies at present, they have very wisely decided that the provision for sanitary services <Col N="1136" /> should not be cut back.  However, I am afraid that the existing 1981 provision represents a drop in real terms over 1980. There is nothing that I can do about that but the Government, however, have made an additional £3 million available to finance the shortfall in the provision made to finance the payment of State subsidies due to local authorities and arising from the expanded programme of sanitary services works now in progress.</P>
    <P>Recent tragic events have brought home to us all the necessity for increased vigilance in the area of fire safety.  We have seen the disastrous consequences of fire both in terms of human misery and economic loss to individuals and to the community.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the fire services, I would like to place on record my commitment to the sustained development and improvement of these most essential services.  I intend to ensure that fire prevention will be given the priority it deserves and that fire services training, which is of fundamental importance to the effectiveness of the services, will be developed and expanded.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the passage of legislation at the earliest possible date which will not only strengthen the provisions governing fire safety, rationalise the organisation of the service, strengthen the powers of inspection and provide for an overall higher standard of safety for persons and property, but will also place increasing emphasis on the vital area of fire prevention.  Forty years have elapsed since the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, became law and a new measure is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Legislation, however, provides only a framework for action.  I believe that the frustration and dissatisfaction in the fire service today is due, in part at least, to past neglect and under-development. Modern fire station facilities are urgently needed in many areas and fire brigades must be adequately equipped to deal with the many and complex demands placed on them by the growth of urban areas, increasing industrialisation and the greater use of hazardous substances. These needs should have been foreseen earlier.  This Government are now faced <Col N="1137" /> with a legacy of deficiencies which will have to be made up as quickly as possible despite the fact that it will be more costly and difficult because of the appalling financial situation which we have inherited.</P>
    <P>Even in the short space of three weeks we are beginning to come to grips with problems in the environment area.  I have already outlined a number of areas where important policy changes have been made since 1 July and I am determined that we will develop a satisfactory programme of work during the next few months.</P>
    <P>It has become necessary for us to make every effort to maintain the number of houses in existence and to provide new houses as required.  I am working with the various agencies towards the development and the strengthening of co-operatives so that we will have a sustained local authority and private enterprise housing programme.  I will be meeting the interested parties, including the CIF and other groups, to determine the role of the Government and private industry in this area.  We must determine how incentives can be provided for further developments.  Particularly we must examine the possibility of attracting more private capital into housing, the building of flats and houses.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in participation by private interests in urban renewal.  Local authorities are doing their share in this respect but the private side tends to opt for development for the more affluent sector outside urban centres.  In order to meet the needs of society in general we must encourage private builders and developers.  As well as building houses we must also concentrate on desirable environmental changes in inner city areas.  If we are to get urban societies properly balanced, we must get the right type of economic development in urban areas.  The climate is right for that kind of development, and when I meet interested parties I hope we will succeed in coming up with the right kind of schemes, involving, as far as possible, outside interests.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered my brief in relation to the matters with which I am concerned <Col N="1138" /> as Minister of State &mdash; housing, sanitary and fire services, and urban renewal.  It is a big challenge particularly because of the neglect of local authority housing in the past two years.  The £30 million being injected now will not provide any great impetus.  It will only keep the show on the road, as it were.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the authority I know most about is Dublin Corporation. At the end of July, or early August, or after the holidays a number of schemes would have closed down because of a lack of capital.  Because of a lack of confidence, in the local authority areas there has been a complete slowing down and it will now require a great deal of revamping and pressure to get this programme moving again.  It is easy to slow things down, but it is often hard to get them moving again.  I sincerely hope we are not too late.  Now that I have this additional money, I am having the local authorities notified as soon as possible to give them confidence to go ahead and get the housing programme churned up and moving again.</P>
    <P>Instead of the 6,000 houses promised this year, I think the figure will be of the order of 5,000 or less.  Over the coming months I will put on the pressure to ensure that we keep the figure up.  Given the neglect and the disgraceful indifference of the former administration I do not know whether I can do that.  Everything that can be done will be done, now that I have got a commitment and the finance to ensure that our public housing programme will move smoothly.  I hope we can get the private sector moving through our finance agencies and by having the proper dialogue with the industry to see what they can offer and what we can offer.  Let us have a working partnership to ensure that the whole building industry is buzzing again.  That is a barometer of the way our economy is ticking over.  Unfortunately it has been tottering for some time.  Now, with the change of Government, we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal in the main with the agricultural aspects of this budget.  I intend to confine my remarks <Col N="1139" /> to three areas: our approach in Government; the Government's programme as outlined by them during the campaign; this budget and its implications for agriculture. Over the past year everybody realised and accepted that the farming sector had been going through very difficult times in 1979 and 1980.  The Government of which I was a member fully understood those difficulties and, and in the closest co-operation and consultation with the farming organisations, tried to see what steps could be taken here and in Brussels to overcome them.</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance of the agricultural sector to the Irish economy as the biggest sector in the economy, the Government must give it top priority.  I hope to show clearly that the former Fianna Fáil Government gave it top priority and provided the necessary schemes and resources and new measures where necessary at home and in the EEC to help the agricultural community to overcome the difficulties which were created by a number of factors.</P>
      <P>One in particular was the low level of price increases coming from Brussels in 1979 and 1980 because of the general attitude in the Community to expenditure on agriculture.  Many member states complained that too much money was being provided for the common agricultural policy.  In 1979 and 1980 &mdash; and this year has not been much better &mdash; the weather conditions were deplorable.  This contributed enormously to the very serious drop in income in the combined years of 1979 and 1980 of 40 per cent.  Against that background the former Government approached the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm for the House to recall the situation in agriculture having regard to what has been said on numerous occasions in the past number of weeks by various Government spoksmen, including the Taoiseach, more or less implying that all that was done by the previous Government was their own doing in the three or four weeks they have been in office.  I want to show exactly what this Government have done notwithstanding some of the things in their programme which I will come to later.  They said they <Col N="1140" /> would introduce some items almost immediately.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that many of the difficulties facing the agricultural community were compounded by the difficulties in Europe.  I should like to mention one factor apart from the percentage price increases and availability of money on the EEC scene over the past number of years, with the exception of this year arising from the efforts we made over the past 18 months.  One item of enormous concern to the farming community and the Government was the super levy, which was eliminated this year.  We fought a lone battle last year, but this year we had come support, and it has been taken out of the discussions in the Community.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the steps taken by the Government over the past nine or ten months one can see that, in the closest consultation with the farming organisations and all interested groups, the Government moved in and provided new measures or expanded existing ones wherever possible.  We provided enormous sums of money, starting last September when upwards of £40 million was provided to help the farmers to overcome the very grave difficulties which arose at that time mainly because of the very severe weather and the general squeeze which arose in the previous year.</P>
    <P>At that time we said it was only a start, and that is all it was.  In this year's budget the Fianna Fáil Government provided another £35 million.  I do not propose to delay the House by going into detailed items which have been put on the record already.  I want to make it clear that the new Government cannot take on board what was done by the former Government. They will not be allowed to ignore the proposals they put forward to the electorate and which misled most of the community, not only the farming sector. They have already begun to discover that many of their proposals were not adequately costed and that it might not be possible to get EEC sanction for them without jeopardising greater support for agriculture from the EEC.</P>
    <P>We moved on then to the price negotiations, the main element of support for <Col N="1141" /> the agricultural community under the common agricultural policy of the EEC. In the course of these discussions not only did we succeed in achieving what was the highest single price increase ever for the farming community, which amounted to additional sums of £215 million being earmarked for the agricultural sector this year, but, in addition because of the serious decline in incomes, we succeeded in getting agreed a special package of measures which amounted to £51 million over two years.  These are enormous sums of money in any man's terms.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall the amounts made available for the agricultural community. In addition to the price proposals for 1981, and the first special package of measures which were agreed at that time, we had the firm commitment of not only the Commission but the Council of Ministers that there would be a second package of measures for Irish farmers.  Happily those were concluded on the first day of the new Minister for Agriculture and at his first Council meeting.  I listened to various commentators and Government spokesmen suggest that one's first day one can walk into a Council of Ministers meeting and get a package of measures amounting to £50 million or £60 million. These measures were discussed for some time by me in the Community.  It was only a question of having the necessary technical details worked out between various schemes that operate in the EEC through the Special Committee of the Council of Ministers.  I am glad that the second package of measures has been concluded because that is what we set out to achieve and it was only a question of the Council of Ministers agreeing to it in the end.</P>
    <P>We always had the emphasis on the Community contributing to the full extent of the cost, if possible, rather than the Exchequer.  The scheme we proposed and pursued in Brussels is to cost £3 million or £4 million more to the Exchequer. These sums, between the various measures I have outlined, amounted to a staggering £400 million.  When I say &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; I do not mean in the sense that the Irish agricultural community were not entitled to have that support, <Col N="1142" /> bearing in mind the drop in income they had for two years and the fact that agriculture is such an important sector of our economy.  If this administration are to claim any credit for any part of that £400 million, it amounts to £6 million.  Of the £400 million a total of £6 million has been provided by this administration for a scheme that we were committed to and which was outlined by the parties standing for election.</P>
    <P>New expenditure, which I am not counting in the £400 million, is £2½ million for the increase in the ewe subsidy.  All these measures combined brought about a situation, not by my admission or that of any member of this party but by independent economists and all concerned with the agricultural sector, that we had for the first time in three years a real increase in farmers' income and were back on the road to increased productivity. Cattle, sheep and pig prices were at record levels.  This year they are 15 per cent up on last year.  I am concerned that the action taken by the Government could put this in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Government must be on their guard and watch very carefully the documents and proposals that will come forward from various member states and the Commission in relation to the EEC mandate for restructuring the budget.  As far as we are concerned, we will be fully supportive of the Government as long as their attitude is to fully protect the fundamental principles and mechanisms of the CAP, which is basically the reason we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Government programme for the farming and agricultural sectors, this is basically the Fine Gael election document with the addition &mdash; because in the preparation of a 21-point plan they forgot it &mdash; of the land policy question out of the Labour Party policy. These measures were put forward on the basis of, as described by the Deputy opposite, Deputy D'Arcy, items that would be required urgently because of the drastic fall in incomes and production. I should like to take this opportunity to compliment the Minister of State and wish him well in a very difficult task.  He should be wary about the promises he <Col N="1143" /> will make and has made.  I also congratulate my successor, Deputy Dukes, and wish him well in the very difficult job ahead.  I offer him support in any way I can in the interests of the agricultural community and the economy.  I also congratulate my colleague, Deputy Nealon from Sligo, as Minister of State in the Department.  As I am congratulating people, I should not let this opportunity pass without paying, from the bottom of my heart, a tremendous tribute to the staff with whom I had the honour to work in the Department of Agriculture.  I was concerned about some statements made by the Minister in relation to productivity, efficiency and so on which suggested to me that in some cases there was a lack of productivity or efficiency in the Department.  All I can say is that the staff with whom I had the opportunity of working at all levels, both here and in Brussels, were second to none in terms of commitment and dedication and of working hours above and beyond the call of duty of any public servant.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Government programme for the agricultural sector we find a promise to pay £100 for additional cows up to a maximum of 40 extra cows in any one herd.  That proposal is now, apparently, no more than a pious aspiration. The next proposal is ignored too in the budget despite the fact that it would have been easy to do something about it since there are similar type schemes in operation.  This second proposal was to secure expansion of the national herds of cows, ewes and sows by way of assistance based on an interest rate subsidy of 5 per cent for a five-year period for capital expenditure involving the addition of extra numbers to the basic herds.  When they were introducing the national subsidy scheme for farmers in financial difficulties with the banks or with the ACC this proposal could quite easily have been included.  That scheme of interest subsidies was prepared, negotiated, agreed and presented to the Commission for approval by the Council of Ministers by this party in Government.</P>
    <P>The next proposal in the area of agriculture is perhaps the most interesting of <Col N="1144" /> all.  This concerns a scheme like the Italian calf subsidy scheme which would take the form of a subsidy of £22 per calf which would be payable in respect of calves up to a year old and to a limit of 50 calves in any one herd.  In recent weeks the Government have tried to stay under the umbrella of having to have EEC sanction for any such scheme but in regard to the one I am talking of, Fine Gael stated clearly that pending agreement in office they would introduce a special calf rearing subsidy scheme whereby the amount concerned would be paid in respect of herds not covered by the two preceding proposals.  Nothing has been done about these proposals either in the budget.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that we in Government had earmarked upwards of £400 million by way of assistance for Irish agriculture in the form of national and EEC measures, Fine Gael went around the country complaining because we bartered the calf subsidy &mdash; worth about £30 million &mdash; for what now turns out to be more than £100 million, combining the two special aid packages from Brussels. The way in which the Government have misled the people and the agricultural community in particular will become clearer in the months ahead: I will not say in the years ahead because I cannot foresee this administration lasting for longer than months.</P>
    <P>However, the Government have agreed on their fourth proposal though there is a sting in the tail in that regard. The proposal was that Fine Gael would introduce a ewe subsidy equivalent to £10 per ewe in the disadvantaged areas but there was nothing then to indicate that there would be a limit to the number of ewes in respect of which this grant would be paid.  In effect what the Government are doing is paying more to some but taking from others.  The mountain sheep men must be told clearly what is being done.  There was a proposal for a breeding stock allowance at the rate of 110 per cent on all additional breeding by way of an incentive to increase herd sizes but there is no mention of that in the budget either.</P>
    <P>The next two proposals shocked me because already I have listened to interviews <Col N="1145" /> with and read statements made by both the Minister and his Minister of State suggesting that these items were already in operation.  They are referring to an increase from £2.50 to £4 in the lime subsidy.  There was no difficulty for the Government in bringing in that subsidy since the schemes are already in operation. Members of the Government have been implying that this scheme was included in the budget this week but that is not so.  The second of these two proposals referred to increasing from £3 to £4 per tonne the subsidy in respect of silage up to a maximum of £50.  That was not done in the budget either whereas a simple statement from the Minister for Finance or from the Minister for Agriculture would have brought those two items of the programme into operation.</P>
    <P>Proposal No. 8 related to interest subsidies. As I have said, the interest subsidies as negotiated, prepared and agreed by us and presented to the Council by the Commission were rubber-stamped by the Council of Ministers.  Let the Government not try to take credit for that scheme.  We had agreement for it from as far back as 1 April last from both the Commission and the Council.</P>
    <P>Proposal No. 10 in the programme related to all reclamation in the 12 western counties qualifying for grants to the extent of 70 per cent of the cost and to include drainage, levelling, ploughing, fertilisation, stone picking and re-seeding. The costings in the Department in this regard were upwards of £70 million but people opposite once again misled the farming community by telling them that there would be no problem in making the moneys available should Fine Gael be returned to office.  However, nothing has been done about that and there is not even a suggestion of updating the existing costings.</P>
    <P>Then, there were the changes outlined for the disadvantaged areas.  The impression was created that in Government Fine Gael would revolutionise the schemes under the disadvantaged areas headings.  All the farmers and their families in the disadvantaged areas are entitled to be told that so far nothing has <Col N="1146" /> been done in this regard.  There have been no details announced in regard to any such scheme either by the Minister for Finance or by the Minister for Agriculture. Details were not given by the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture about the re-arrangement of disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1981. - Dublin Riots: Statement by the Minister for Justice</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity of making this statement to the House. Members on all sides of the House will have made their own observations of the extremely serious riots which took place in the vicinity of the British Embassy on Saturday last.  The House no doubt will wish to join me in strongly censuring all those among the marchers &mdash; constituting a substantial minority &mdash; who clearly set out, from the very beginning, to cause serious personal injuries to members of the Garda Síochána and extensive damage to public and private property.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the House I would like to recall the events of last Saturday.</P>
      <P>As I have said it is clear beyond doubt that many of those taking part had come prepared to carry out serious attacks on the Garda.  This is underlined by the fact that the Garda are now aware that passengers on some of the buses from the North actually purchased pick-axe handles in at least one town on their way. The violence had started long before the marchers reached the vicinity of the British Embassy.  Even in the very early stages of the march, some of the marchers threw stones at or otherwise assaulted gardai.  For instance, outside Leinster House shortly after the march moved off a garda was struck on the head with a heavy stick or pole, as a result of which he had to receive hospital treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the marchers were seen to be carrying weapons such as pick-axe handles, either full length or half length, some of them disguised as flagpoles.  As the march proceeded through the Balls-bridge area, all the bollards in the centre of the road were ripped apart and some <Col N="1147" /> of the debris was carried on by the marchers for use in the subsequent assault on gardai in the vicinity of the British Embassy.  I emphasise these points not only to illustrate the intentions of those concerned but to question the claims that only those at the very front of the march knew anything about the violence until the Garda made the baton charge.</P>
    <P>When the march reached the Garda barrier at the junction of Simmonscourt Road and Merrion Road a small deputation was allowed through the barrier on asking to be permitted to hand in a letter at the British Embassy.  I am informed that when the Embassy door was opened an attempt was made by some members of the deputation to rush into the Embassy, with one of their members saying: &ldquo;We're in, lie down&rdquo;.  I think it right to balance that by saying that I am also informed that when another member of the deputation, whose name is well known in another sphere, saw what was happening, he informed the Garda that he wanted to dissociate himself from such activity, and that he considered that he had been &ldquo;used&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of the marchers were at this stage involved in a violent attack on members of the Garda.  The attackers were using bricks, bottles, petrol bombs, golf balls, pick-axe handles and a variety of poles, some with steel-pointed tops.  The bricks were obtained from nearby garden walls, and sledge-hammers that had been used to break down the walls were subsequently found by the Garda.  Two cars were also removed from the gardens of houses and set on fire and six other cars were severely damaged.  Additionally, I am informed by the Garda authorities that a white powder which burns the skin and which is similar to a substance which has been used in attacks on policemen in Belfast was used by some of Saturday's demonstrators.</P>
    <P>The one redeeming feature was the restraint, forbearance and courage shown by the Garda in the face of sustained and unprovoked attacks of the most vicious character.  The House will join me in paying them a special tribute <Col N="1148" /> for their performance.  Despite their restraint, the attacks continued for 25 minutes during which time almost 150 gardaí suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment.  It is a matter of great concern to the Government that any garda or any civilians should have been injured.</P>
    <P>From what I have said I think there can remain little doubt as to what at least a significant section of the demonstrators had planned.  The use of violence on this scale against the Garda was clearly designed to break through the Garda cordon and to enable those concerned to march on to the British Embassy.  What a group who had behaved in that way to the Garda Síochána intended to do &mdash; and what they would, if allowed, have done &mdash; to the Embassy does not need to be spelled out.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made that the demonstration planned for next Saturday should be banned.  The Government have carefully considered the various factors involved and have decided at this stage not to take this course.  The Government's decision is based on a desire to reduce, not increase, tension, to uphold the right of citizens to protest peacefully, while at the same time taking every step open to them to protect the general public.  Some criticism may be levelled at the Government for insisting, despite last Saturday's violence, on defending the right of the citizen to protest. I can understand that criticism but cannot agree with it.  However the right to protest is not an unconditional one, nor can it be superior to the right of citizens at large not to be subjected to serious street violence.  The right to protest is conditional on it being peaceful, and a grave responsibility lies on protest organisers to ensure either that their protest is peaceful or else is not held at all.</P>
    <P>Events not only here but in many cities in many other countries force us to recognise that, if a significant sector of a crowd is bent on violence, a great deal of destruction can take place.  I must there-fore now appeal to members of the public who wish to register their views by way of peaceful protest to think very carefully before they again join protest marches such as that mounted last Saturday.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> The Garda accept, as I do, that some innocent people can be caught up in a baton charge and that is why they issued repeated warnings over loud-hailers on Saturday.  I think it is better that everybody should understand that a baton charge, although recognised everywhere to be both necessary in certain circumstances and effective in its objective, is of its very nature not something that can readily discriminate between those who are leading the violence and others who may be passive or even innocent.  I hope therefore that for their own sake innocent people, if there should be a recurrence, will not make things more difficult for the Garda and more risky for themselves by remaining at the scene after acts of violence have been committed, should this happen again.  The central point is that the Garda are there, on duty, protecting us and our rights.  It is they who are being subjected to assault.  They are entitled to our support.</P>
    <P>I do accept, as the Garda do, that journalists have a particular problem in that their duty may require them to be in a danger area.  On this point, I think it right to read to the House the text of a letter I have sent to the National Union of Journalists:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you with reference to the meeting I had on Monday with a deputation from your Union to discuss matters arising out of the riotous behaviour in the vicinity of the British Embassy on Saturday, 18th July.</P>
    <P>You mentioned in the course of the discussion that a number of Dublin-based journalists, members of your Union, who were on duty covering the march to the Embassy, were assaulted, attacked or harassed by members of the Garda Síochána.  I wish to reiterate the assurance which I gave you at the meeting, and which I understand had separately been given by Garda Headquarters, that any specific complaints your members wish to make in relation to those allegations will be fully investigated by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to say that I accept that the exercise by your members of their role to report the news in <Col N="1150" /> an objective way is essential to the well-being of a democratic society and I would deplore anything that would prevent the Press from carrying out that role.</P>
    <P>In a situation such as that which developed last Saturday it is clear that some innocent bystanders, and some members of the Press, were at risk of being injured and, given the sustained level of unprovoked attacks on members of the Gardaí, the Force themselves would be the first to accept that a few members &mdash; there were almost 2,000 on duty &mdash; possibly did in the heat of the moment go beyond what was necessary.  If it is said from a responsible source that some journalists were hit, the Garda authorities are prepared to accept that as being a regrettable fact.  I have asked the Commissioner to ensure that members of the Force on duty on such occasions will again be made aware of the need for members of the Press to be facilitated in carrying out their work consonant with the needs of security.</P>
    <P>What may not be widely appreciated, because fortunately baton charges are rare in our society, is that the purpose of a baton charge (which is employed only as a last resort) is to clear the street of all persons, and in such a situation the likelihood of Gardaí engaged in this duty being in a position to discriminate in respect of particular individuals is greatly diminished. I therefore now repeat the invitation that I put to you orally that if you have any suggestions as to how these difficulties may be overcome for the future they will be very fully considered.</P>
    <P>The complaint has been made that members of the Garda Síochána were not wearing numbers on their tunics. I believe that that complaint is based on a misunderstanding.  Very many of the Gardaí on duty in the vicinity of the Embassy were drawn from various parts of the country and they do not have numbers on their tunics.  (Outside Dublin, the only Gardaí who have numbers are those in Cork City). <Col N="1151" /> Apart from that, epaulettes were torn from some Garda uniforms by the protestors in Saturday's demonstration.</P>
    <P>I should add that the Government are willing to make arrangements for special methods of identification of journalists assigned by the Irish and foreign press to cover such events.  This offer has been conveyed to the NUJ.</P>
    <P>Another important point which I think the House and the public have a right to know about is what the costs of operations of this kind can be.  The costs of the malicious damage cannot be estimated for some time but clearly they are enormous. What I would emphasise is that the policing of last Saturday's march in Dublin will cost the Irish taxpayer something of the order of £310,000 in Garda overtime, subsistence allowance, etc.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would stress that the Government recognise that there is in international law an absolute obligation on the State to protect the premises of foreign missions against intrusion or damage and further recognise their obligation to protect society from the commission of criminal acts and from public disorder.  I undertake that the Government will take such steps as the exigencies of the situation may require to fulfil these obligations.</P>

      <P>We deplore the violence of the events of last weekend and regret very much indeed that so many people were injured and that so much property was destroyed or damaged.  We regret the great distress caused to many ordinary citizens who were not involved in the protest march, and those who engaged in this violence did no good to their cause.  We owe a deep debt of gratitude to the gardaí for their great efforts in protecting life and property, despite continuous vicious attacks on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Government have decided not to ban the proposed march <Col N="1156" /> this weekend, they must ensure that the Garda have everything they need in the way of equipment, facilities and manpower to deal with any situation which might arise.  It is the duty of the Garda to take all lawful means at their disposal to protect life and property and it is the senior officer on the ground who has the responsibility of deciding on the methods to be used to deal with the situation as it develops.</P>
    <P>The Garda should know that they have our trust and confidence in dealing with any situation which might arise, and of so doing in a fair, reasonable and balanced way, despite any provocation from any individual or group.  It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that all resources necessary are given to the Garda, and we appeal to those involved in protesting to respect the rights of the ordinary citizens and their property and to respect the authority of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going through the litany of promises in the Government programme for the agricultural sector and was coming to No. 12 in the programme as outlined by Fine Gael in their general election campaign.  This was that Fine Gael &mdash; now the Government &mdash; will abolish agricultural rates on all full-time farmers who draw up an agreed programme of expansion over a five-year period with their ACOT advisor, or other authorised agency.  We have heard statements from the Minister for Agriculture and from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture that this would be a matter of priority for them in <Col N="1157" /> the first days of their appointment.  However, in a number of other days they changed their minds.  Like the many other items which I have listed, no action whatsoever was taken in that regard.  We have also heard the Minister for Agriculture speak of the Government's intention to repay the resource tax paid by farmers. There was no mention of that in yesterday's budget speech either.  Pious hopes, pious aspirations.  I am not in any way being critical of the Minister for Agriculture or any of his Ministers of State when I say that.  The intention of the Minister and his Ministers of State is correct.  They are interested and they care.  They will work hard and will have a very difficult time.  However, there are very few others in that Government who know about, or care about, the agricultural sector or the litany of promises which I am reading out.  On farmers' taxation there are a number of items in the Government's programme.  They promise to sympathetically examine the application of the manufacturing tax rate at 10 per cent to farm profits.  Nothing was done about that. They promised to restore the threshold for the capital acquisition tax in respect of the handling on of family farms &mdash; nothing done about that.  There is no suggestion, either, that it will be done, but I shall come to that in a few moments.</P>
      <P>They did something about promise No. 16 &mdash; a reduction of the VAT rate on agricultural contracting.  I am sure many agricultural contractors could welcome that, were it not for the terrible imposition of taxation by yesterday's budget which will ensure that no benefit will accrue to the agricultural contractor or to the farming community because of the enormous increase of input costs and costs generally imposed by the budget. This reduction also comes too late on 1 September, so nobody will benefit from it this year in relation to agricultural activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promise No.17 in their programme was disease eradication.  The Minister commented on this, running immediately under the umbrella of the statement, subject to the overriding need to maintain access to export markets, a period of 30 <Col N="1158" /> days.  The pre-movement test for brucellosis and TB will be extended to 60 days.</P>
    <P>I do not care what any Minister or any member of the parties opposite and the Government want to say about this issue. Let there be no doubt in anybody's mind here, because there is no doubt in any farmer's mind exactly what he was hearing from the chapel gates and the public meetings, from the Taoiseach right down to the newest Member of either Labour or Fine Gael, that that was what the Government would do, regardless of EEC implications.  That is what the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy then said as spokesman for the Fine Gael party. That is just another example, like the many more which I have listed from this outfit of Labour and Fine Gael throughout the general election campaign, of the misleading of the farming community and not only that community but our entire population.  However, our population including the farmers are well aware of that.  They did not have to wait until yesterday to find out the situation.  Yesterday confirmed their suspicions.  They found out yesterday in no uncertain terms, what was being done these days, what would be done in September and what is in store in the January budget &mdash; if they can maintain the support of the six Independent spokesmen who love to speak on everything else but sit there in their seats when the voting comes, to keep this crowd in office.  I do not think they will even last until the introduction of another budget.  Whether they do or not, they have outlined a programme which was prepared for nothing else but to mislead the electorate, during the general election campaign.  It is now becoming abundantly clear, not only in the agricultural sense but in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>Another little item about which somebody in Fine Gael had a bone of contention was legislation on dog control being updated.  That was a very important plank in the Fine Gael election programme and now, I suppose, part of the Government programme.  The Government have searched up and down for three weeks around Government Departments seeing where they could <Col N="1159" /> find a half-penny because they were badly short of money due to the so-called mess created by Fianna Fáil &mdash; all this bunkum which has gone out in recent weeks.  They did not increase the dog licences.  Why did they not tell the Minister for Finance to do that, even by a few pounds?  Anybody who keeps a dog would not have minded.  The Government could have got a few pounds there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is such an important item to have in their election programme. We then come to the committees, the plans and the various other items which the Government outlined.  The Minister for Agriculture last night said that other measures, which he did not describe, would be taken in addition to the two small measures which he announced last night, such as giving a higher sheep subsidy to some farmers but taking it from other farmers because of the limit of 200 ewes and the interest subsidy.  He said: &ldquo;We can only say that it is what the Minister for Finance referred to in his budget speech,&rdquo; which was that modifications would take place in the disadvantaged areas scheme for headage payments, that the farm modernisation grants which the Minister did outline would be limited in certain areas, that other mobile equipment and so forth would be abolished for grant purposes and that the general level of grants would be reduced.</P>
      <P>That is what the Coalition have in store for the farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture said last night he would be taking action on the 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 plans or programmes already announced.  Since ACOT were formed they have been preparing a five-year plan to present to the Minister but, unless it is completed now I doubt if it will ever be finished in view of the measures announced in yesterday's budget to curtail staff levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already congratulated the Minister and wished him well and I do not want to repeat myself.  It is enough to have to repeat all the Government promises which are unlikely to be implemented, <Col N="1160" /> even though the Minister will do his best.  Because of the cutbacks it is impossible to see how ACOT or AFT can give the necessary advice and services to the farming community that everybody agrees are necessary.  The Government hit these institutions hard.  They mentioned only two institutions but there may be more.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the land policy which the Labour Party succeeded in having included in the election programme, because Fine Gael forgot it before and during the election.  I did not hear what the Minister for Agriculture had to say on the radio, but I read a report of it.  He said his special budget would enable the Land Commission to buy thousands of acres, a pool of land, for leasing.  I was prepared to wait until next January's budget to see what the Coalition would do but they introduced a budget yesterday, having considered the finances of the country after many hours of study. There was no mention of this land pool in the budget nor did the Minister mention it in his list of priorities yesterday.  I am prepared to wait.  I know the Minister will try to do something about this because I believe he has the necessary expertise to do it.  There are very few people around him who know or care about the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The 25-point plan &mdash; the manifesto &mdash; can only be described as an exercise in oneupmanship on what the Fianna Fail Administration were doing for the farmers. The Government said they were providing £400 million for the farmers, including the interest subsidies concluded last Monday and additional funds for western drainage.  The Coalition only rubber-stamped these measures.  Let nobody say that these measures were compiled, negotiated or agreed by anybody in the Coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister last night and I have only a few minutes left to say something about his budget.  I want to mention first what appears to be an ongoing exercise to mislead the farming community.  I heard the Taoiseach's broadcast to the nation &mdash; an exercise of manipulating RTE by the present Government without a right of reply by the Opposition; the Independents are not doing much shouting about that, although one has to ask if they are Independents because they have been keeping this Government in office by every vote since we resumed.  He misled the farming community and the country because, until he spoke on television, no aid for agriculture had been announced by any Minister.  The Taoiseach misled the people when he said that all our announcements, of aid amounting to £400 million, would be given by the Coalition.  We will keep the farming community fully informed.  Although the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, has time to dine with the press, he will not be able to prevent them from informing the farming community of what this Government will be doing in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
      <P>We negotiated £400 million additional expenditure at home and in Brussels for the farming community since September, including the interest subsidies and drainage funds agreed by the Council of Ministers last Monday.  The Government are giving this money to the farming community and I support them, because they are applying the interest subsidy for development farmers as agreed by the EEC to commercial farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the election manifesto one got the impression that this Government would do a lot in three days, and they have been in office for three weeks. When in Government we got £400 million in the last nine or ten months for the farming community and this Government are giving £6 million.  To get that amount, what have this Government done?  By their own admission, which is under-estimated, they have added a further 3 per <Col N="1162" /> cent to the consumer price index.  For 18 or 19 months day and night, I had to listen to people telling me that the bug-bear for Irish agriculture was the rate of inflation.  Every 1 per cent increase cost the farming community £15 million.  Taking the Government's figure of 3 per cent, that will cost the farming community £45 million.  This is an under-estimation and when all the budgets are added, the figure will be 6 per cent.  The Government gave the farming community £6 million and took back a potential £90 million.  I am not blaming the Minister for Agriculture or his Minister of State for this, but they allowed the Cabinet to do this to the farming community.</P>
    <P>In his efforts at home or in Brussels to improve the lot of the farmers, the Minister will be fully supported by Fianna Fail because we recognise and have provided funds for the biggest sector in our economy, agriculture, and I want to ensure that the Minister and his Government will give it the same recognition. The start made yesterday is a disaster.</P>
    <P>When we had concluded negotiations which meant an additional £260 million for our farmers, I remember being handed a statement by representatives of farming organisations which described that as a disaster for Irish agriculture. How will those same spokesmen describe the action of this Government who provided an additional £6 million for agriculture on the one hand and on the other hand took back £90 million?  The Minister must bear responsibility for this.</P>
    <P>During his speech yesterday the Minister for Agriculture said, within 24 hours of the introduction of a budget which by their admission will add 3 per cent to the inflation rate, that the Government anti-inflation programme is getting under way.  At the end of the day the real increase in inflation will be 6 per cent.  I am sympathetic about the difficulties which I know exist and I appreciate that this Government have been only three weeks in office.  However, between now and 20 October I will watch the situation closely.</P>
    <P>Arising from the efforts of the Fianna Fail Government, independent economists accepted that following the 40 per <Col N="1163" /> cent drop in farm income there would be a potential increase in real income of between 2 and 6 per cent.  The only thing which can jeopardise that is the action of the Government.</P>
    <P>I had the honour to be in charge of the Department of Agriculture during very difficult times and I have already paid tribute to the staff.  I now pay tribute to those who negotiated on behalf of the farming community.  I knew their difficulties and some of these have spilled over and caused the retirement of the president of the ICMSA, Mr. Anthony Leddy, a very able negotiator.  I am sorry to see his departure from that office because I found him and his colleagues, Mr. Donal Cashman and Mr. Paddy Lane, to be people concerned about the difficulties of farmers and prepared to co-operate with the Government in every possible way.  I know that the Minister has ties with the same people and I wonder how they will react to some of the schemes of which he now speaks.  Certainly they were not mentioned during the election campaign.  The Government have achieved office through the false documents they prepared.  I will ensure that this Government will not do anything to undermine the successes we achieved at home and in Brussels for the farming community.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Nealon, I thank Deputy MacSharry for his good wishes. I accept that ours is a very difficult job. It was interesting to listen to his contribution. He talked about the provision of £400 million but finished by admitting that his Government had managed during the past two years to achieve a drop in farmers' incomes of 40 per cent.  He mentioned an increase of between 2 and 6 per cent and his figures are bound to be somewhat optimistic.  We have done our figures and it is our belief that the majority of farmers will suffer a further loss in 1981 of between 2 and 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of the great work he did for farmers during the past two <Col N="1164" /> years.  However, the real figures are on the record.  During former Deputy Clinton's term as Minister for Agriculture price increase were as follows: milk, 104 per cent; beef, 104 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Allen called for a quorum I was dealing with figures and giving the price increases achieved by the former Minister for Agriculture, Mark Clinton.  The price of milk and beef was increased by 104 per cent and the price of barley by 128 per cent.  During the four years of the Fianna Fail administration price increases were as follows: milk, 30 per cent; beef, 30 per cent; grain 22 per cent.  This includes the 1980-81 negotiations.</P>
      <P>The former Minister spoke of the provision of £400 million for farmers but forgot to tell the House that they introduced a 2 per cent levy which took £16 million from farmers and a disease levy which took £20 million from them.  Rates for three years amounted to £30 million, a resource tax amounted to £7 million, tax off stock relief amounted to £1 million and 36,000 farmers compared to 15,000 farmers were liable for income tax, which brought in £7 million.  There was also a saving on lime and fertiliser subsidies in 1978 which brought in £4 million.  That was a total of £85 million from the farmers' pockets during the four years of Fianna Fail administration.  The former Minister now has the audacity to tell us that this only accounted for 2 per cent of farmers' income.  That £85 million did not relate to profit.  It was taken irrespective of the cost to the farmer.  The former Minister went to great pains to tell us of the commitment of Fianna Fáil to agriculture, but he did not produce the goods.  The former Minister went to the EEC and negotiated a package from December 1980 until the end of April 1981.  When he came back he put it into operation on 20 May as far as lime and the AI services were concerned, a time of the year when the farmers will not require either service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the budget introduced <Col N="1165" /> by the Minister for Finance is to set the economy back on the road to economic growth.  There should be no misunderstanding as to the serious nature of the economy at the present time.  We have more than 125,000 people unemployed, inflation in the first half of this year has been running at an annual rate of over 20 per cent, the Government's current budget deficit before the measures taken by the Minister for Finance would have been £950 million for this year, the total Exchequer borrowing requirement would have reached virtually £2,000 million and the balance of payments deficit would have been £1,500 million.  That is the climate in which we had to take over. I would ask the former administration to look back four years to when their then leader, Deputy Lynch, said the economy was in sound condition and that he hoped that, if they were kicked out in five years' time, they would be able to hand it back in the same condition.</P>
    <P>These figures show the frightening economic position in which we find ourselves today.  We were trying to maintain our living standards artificially through borrowing, much of it in foreign currency, at a level which we have never seen in the history of the State.  If this were to be allowed to go on it would place in jeopardy all that has been done in recent decades to create a just and prosperous society.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech, the choice before us is simple: we must either act now in a planned way to begin to put right the imbalances in our public finances and in our external accounts or we will be faced with enforced and severe economic dislocation and contraction which could arise within a matter of a very short time.</P>
    <P>As a community we have the ability to bring our economy back under control, and the budget shows the determination of the Government to start on this process straight away.  We must do two things. Firstly, we must bring our aspirations and demands into line with the value of what we produce.  Secondly, we must expand our production to provide for the needs of our growing population.  All sectors of the economy must contribute to a growth <Col N="1166" /> in output and the Government must look to the agricultural sector to contribute its full potential in this programme of expansion.</P>
    <P>By the standards of modern developed economies agriculture still plays a crucial role in our national economy.  Agriculture makes a very substantial contribution to the development of the economy through the direct employment of one in every five of the total number in employment. It also provides employment for a further 25,000 people in factories and processing plants dependent on agricultural raw materials.  In addition, employment and output generated in other businesses which service agriculture accounts for a further substantial part of the economy of our rural society.  Over recent years agricultural exports, in conjunction with a growing industrial base, have been responsible for much of the growth of the Irish economy.  Agricultural exports have had a dual effect on the economy.  Firstly, because of their low import content the multiplier effect on income has been higher than for most other industries. Secondly, they earn foreign exchange which provides the means to purchase imports of raw material and oil for further production in the economy as a whole. Furthermore direct agricultural exports generate additional external revenue in the form of the receipts from the guarantee section of FEOGA which are paid in order to support the prices of farm products on external markets.  The total balance of payments contribution from the agriculture sector last year amounted to over £1,600 million or some 35 per cent of our earnings from exports.</P>
    <P>There has been a very serious decline in cattle numbers during the past year, with numbers dropping by almost 350,000.  Cattle numbers are now lower than they were eight years ago in 1972, and farmer confidence earlier this year has not been such as to generate a reversal of this position.  The Government's programme for a four year plan of retocking is designed to reverse the serious position which we find our cattle industry in today.</P>
    <P>A similar situation has occurred in the case of pigs.  The total number of pigs has <Col N="1167" /> declined at an annual rate of 2 per cent over the past two years.  The decline in numbers has been even more serious in the case of the breeding herd where the rate of decline has been in the order of 6 per cent over the past two years.  This now means that the breeding herd in 1980 is now back at the 1972 level in absolute terms.</P>
    <P>A slightly different picture emerges in the case of sheep.  Even though the total number of sheep in the country has declined continuously since 1972, the breeding herd increased slightly in 1980. But again the actual number of sheep in the country is well below the 1972 level, and the breeding herd is over 300,000 below its 1972 level.  These declines in our livestock numbers have had serious repercussions for the processing industries which depend on livestock as their basic raw material.</P>
    <P>The meat processing industry is one of enormous significance to the Irish economy, both in its own right and as a vital component of the most important sectors of the agricultural industry.  In 1980 output, at the farm gate, of cattle was £712 million, sheep £59 million, pigs £133 million and poultry £49 million.  At a time when the European Community places a high value on good quality beef, mutton, lamb and pigmeat, we are basically well placed to supply it.  The opportunity for Ireland to obtain through a dynamic meat processing industry progressively improved returns for a growing supply of meat products means that we can benefit even more in the future than we have in the past from the contribution that this industry makes in the areas of employment, farm incomes and the balance of payments.  Moreover it is quite apparent that, even allowing for its basic function as a distribution medium for Irish meat products, the Irish meat processing sector is of vital economic significance in its own right as an employer in areas where non-farm employment is at a premium, as a foreign exchange earner and as a vital marketing tool for the primary sector.</P>
    <P>The slaughtering, processing and marketing capability of the Irish cattle and <Col N="1168" /> beef industry is of vital importance to future economic development.  The main growth and development of slaughtering plants in Ireland has occurred within the last 30 years and a major advantage of this has been the construction of efficient plants of economic size located in areas containing the highest numbers of finished cattle.  There are now 39 beef slaughtering and processing plants in the country.  Since 1972 eight new plants have been established while a few have ceased operations.</P>
    <P>The majority of plants have the capacity, equipment and expertise for both slaughtering and deboning of carcases. The capacity for downstream processing of beef into highly value-added products is at present limited to a small number of specialist plants each having a relatively small capacity.  It is very much in the interest of the industry to reduce its reliance on the export of beef in carcase form.  At present almost 80 per cent of beef is exported in this form.  While efforts to achieve an increase in the beef cow herd will be of undoubted benefit to the industry as a whole, there is no question but that the real benefits to the long term stability of industry lie in a commitment by suppliers and processors to add further value to the products for export. Next to exports of live cattle, carcase beef has the lowest value added and employment potential.  As already mentioned, most meat plants have at least the ability and expertise to produce boneless beef and this is one area where an effort should be made by all concerned to enhance the value of our exports and, accordingly, our balance of payments.  In so doing they can also be of major benefit in increasing employment in the industry. I may mention also that CBF are at present engaged in promoting Irish beef as a consumer product rather than as a commodity. This is a welcome change.</P>
    <P>When one takes a look at the figures available at present of cattle slaughterings one finds that in 1974, approximately 1,064,000 cattle were slaughtered. This year there were 1,354,000 slaughtered. That increase may seem large but the very heavy slaughterings of cattle in <Col N="1169" /> 1980 may push up that figure somewhat higher than it should be.  The drop in the cow herd particularly in the last year-and-a-half  represents serious figures as far as the national herd is concerned.  We find now that the cow herd has dropped to approximately 1.8 million.  In 1974 and 1975 we had approximately 2.1 million in the cow herd.  The Government must bear a fair share of the responsibility as far as the cow herd is concerned.  While people may find it difficult to believe, the cattle herd is the foundation of our economy, because from that we get the milk and beef so vital to our economy.  It would appear that my predecessor has some doubts as to the intention of this Government to implement the £100 subsidy per cow.  He can take it that I was responsible for drawing up that package which seems to have annoyed him intensely.  Indeed it lost Fianna Fail a lot of seats.</P>
    <P>We were honest with the farming community. We drew up a programme which I believe is the only one that can get us out of the present difficulty.  The former Minister can say what he likes but I was glad to hear him admit in this House that he brought £400 million into it which represents 2 per cent only in incomes that had dropped 40 per cent in the last two years.  How he could stand over there and make that statement is incredible.  That was some performance.  I hope, at the end of our four years in office, we will be saying we improved the farmers' position by 40 per cent and not by 2 per cent and that we did not take 40 per cent from them.</P>
    <P>Over the period 1970 to 1979 the volume of farm materials used by farmers grew dramatically at an annual rate of nearly 7 per cent.  However, the value of farm materials in 1980 declined by almost 5 per cent in value terms and, as prices increased by 9 per cent, this meant a fall of approximately 13 per cent in real terms.  A decline of 13 per cent in the volume of inputs, particularly feed and fertilisers, must inevitably reduce farm output in the subsequent year and we shall see this year the effects of this reduction of inputs on the level of farm output.</P>
    <P>We have seen also a sharp drop in <Col N="1170" /> purchases of new machinery by farmers. Tractor registrations, which had been running at between 11,000 and 12,000 in 1977 and 1978, fell to less than 7,500 last year.  Other machinery sales have fallen similarly.  This has had serious effects not only on farmers' capacity to produce but on employment and output in the farm machinery industry.  We have seen this in a particularly serious way in my constituency, but the Government plans for agricultural expansion should revive our flagging agricultural machinery industry. Government policy will be directed towards reversing this decline in the level of inputs.  We will encourage the greater use of lime in areas where it is required. The production of winter feed in the form of silage must be increased, particularly on smaller farms.  We will also improve the level of grants given for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House &mdash; and it is right that these figures be put on record &mdash; that as far as lime applications were concerned in 1978 they amounted to 1.9 million tons, in 1979 to 2 million tons and in 1980 900,000 tons, in other words, cut in half.  I understand that the present figures for 1981 are around 700,000.  Therefore lime applications have been reduced by 66 per cent. On top of that, tractor sales are down 60 per cent, farm machinery down 50 per cent, farm building materials down 60 per cent, compound feedstuffs down 15 per cent, cattle feedstuffs down 22 per cent, fertilisers down 15 to 25 per cent.  Those are the figures available at present.  I heard the Minister last year blaming the awful weather.  I am prepared to accept that the weather has been a contributory factor as far as yields are concerned for 1980 and 1981.  The greatest problem has been the low levels of inputs for those two years.  The previous Government were directly responsible because the farmer had no income.  The previous Government predicted a 2 per cent to 6 per cent improvement in farm incomes in 1981.  I claim we will be lucky if we get away with line ball as far as 1980 versus 1981 is concerned because I believe there will be a further reduction.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak briefly on some <Col N="1171" /> aspects of our livestock breeding programme by commencing with the pig breeding area.  While numerically our national pig herd has remained fairly stable in recent years the Government are anxious that the ongoing quality improvement measures should not suffer a setback at this time.  The Government are determined to ensure that the national breeding programme is maintained and improved.  To this end my Department will be importing new blood lines from Scandinavia in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>At present the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Finance, are concluding an examination of a recent report on pedigree pig breeding.  This is an area of fundamental importance to our pig industry and one on which I shall have more to say in the very near future when I have had an opportunity of examining in detail the various recommendations in that report.</P>
    <P>My Department's provision for progeny and performance testing of pigs makes a major contribution to the improvement of quality reflected in the high standard of our slaughtered animals. It works out at present at approximately 96 per cent of grade A's or grade A specials.  This is an area to which I attach particular importance.  At this stage I am prepared to say that as far as pigs are concerned we can complete with any of our EEC partners.  As a matter of fact we can compete with anybody worldwide as far as the conversion of feed and pigs are concerned on quality.  It is a happy position to be in.</P>
    <P>Likewise in the area of sheep breeding I believe we are all agreed that we must raise the quality of our national flock if we are to meet the rigid requirements of the more lucrative markets of Europe. Here again arrangements have been made for the importation of high class rams which it is hoped will give progeny which are suited to our rearing and fattening conditions and, at the same time, acceptable to our foreign markets.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Government is to upgrade the standards of our national <Col N="1172" /> flock by pursuing vigorously the breed improvement programme through flock recording and progeny testing.  These measures form the basis of selection of animals for future breeding and at the same time identify genetic improvements in growth rate and carcase quality.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be only too well aware that over the past few years there has been an ever-increasing focus on the so-called butter mountain in Europe.  Communiqués from Brussels have concentrated on the need for restraint in the operation of measures that would result in increased milk surpluses. Given such a background the House will agree it was invitable that the substantial level of price increases for milk &mdash; which was a feature of the seventies &mdash; would taper off somewhat.  It is quite clear to the Government that there will now have to be greater emphasis on such aspects as increased output from every acre and every cow if the income of the dairy farmer is not to be further eroded.</P>
    <P>If I single out two areas &mdash; milk recording and progeny testing &mdash; in which this objective can be pursued, it is because I attach so much importance to them.  The recording of the yield and the composition of the milk of individual dairy cows is a practice which should be widely adopted on Irish dairy farms.  It is no accident that milk recording forms an integral part of the dairying industry in all other countries where dairying is so important.  In Ireland, however, the picture is not good &mdash; approximately 4 per cent only of the national cow herd is recorded.  This compares with over 60 per cent in Holland and Denmark and most of the other European countries at about 40 to 45 per cent.  Therefore, there is scope for a substantial expansion in milk recording.  The dairy farmer who bases his breeding and feeding management decisions on individual cow recordings is sure to improve the genetic quality and yield performance of his herd, thereby attaining a better farm income. The average milk yield in Ireland is somewhere in the region of 700 and 720 gallons per cow while our counterparts are <Col N="1173" /> around the 1,000 mark, and it is considerably higher in some of the more developed countries.  It is a pity that proper progeny testing has not been carried out and that very little encouragement has been given.  Once the programme itself has been put into operation my Department will then tackle the question of milk recording.</P>
    <P>We have the framework to carry out the necessary functions.  I believe the creameries have the staff and that very little expense would be involved.  This whole question was considered recently by a study group representing all the interested organisations.  They have produced the most comprehensive, interesting and stimulating report.  I am at the moment applying myself to an analysis of the many recommendations made by the group.  My initial reaction is that they provide the basis for a greatly expanded and more efficient milk recording service. I will have more to say on this issue after the programme has been put into operation.</P>
    <P>As well as increasing the volume of output and as a consequence of achieving a better farm income it is desirable that the genetic merits of our cattle should be raised.  This can best be done through the identification and selection of superior sires for use in the breeding herd. It is my intention, with this in mind, to expand the existing programme, when the economy permits, for the progeny and performance testing of both dairy and beef bulls.  I will be providing more facilities for the performance testing programme at our area stations and elsewhere.  I also hope to provide grants to the area stations towards meeting the capital costs of expanding the progeny testing programme.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious difficulties which farmers have to face at present is the payment of interest rates on capital and money borrowed from the lending institutions for farm investment purposes. Total lending to agriculture by these institutions has now reached some £1,200 million at the present time.  With farm incomes, before allowing for interest payments, fallen from £836 million in 1978 to £669 million for last year the <Col N="1174" /> burden of repayments has become very severe.</P>
    <P>At the Council of Ministers earlier this week the Minister for Agriculture received agreement on the provision of an interest subsidy for farmers in the development categories who took out loans for farm investment under the farm modernisation scheme.  This subsidy will apply for two years both in the case of loans already incurred in financing eligible expenditure on farm development plans and for a period not exceeding two years in the case of new approved development plans.  At the same time, the Government programme for the agricultural industry provides assistance for farmers not in the official development categories.  A national scheme for farmers in need who do not qualify under the EEC scheme is being drawn up.  Discussions will be undertaken with farm organisations and the financial institutions to work out the details of this scheme.  Only if we can overcome the financial problems facing many of our farmers can we expect them to expand their farm output, an expansion which is the foundation of the Government's objectives for the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out, particularly during the past year, that this has been a very serious impediment as far as agricultural development is concerned. While we were in Opposition when Deputy Bruton, was spokesman for agriculture, we tried to make the Government aware of the difficulties in this area. Shortly before the election the Minister for Agriculture ran over to Brussels and came back with a scheme about four days before the election just because he read it in our programme.  I have had negotiations with the banks and the ACC and I have in my possession figures which were made available to the Government at that time.  It is no credit to them that they did not take any action on this issue.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of talk today about the Minister and all the negotiations he undertook, but he had in his possession last August certain figures and he came here on numerous occasions, misled the House and said there were 3,500 farmers <Col N="1175" /> in difficulties.  The figures I have in my possession today suggest a far higher figure. I suggested that figure to the Minister and I asked him what did he base his figure on.  He said he based it on some report drawn up by ACOT.  When I checked with ACOT I was told they had no figures in regard to that issue.  They said they took samples in certain areas to see what the problem was but they had no genuine figures.  The figures were in the ACC and in the banks but the Minister did not take any action.</P>
    <P>The reason why some of our programme was not announced yesterday is that the Minister and I are currently engaged in consultations with the banks and the ACC.  This is the valve from which can be released the expansion as far as agriculture is concerned in the coming year.  There is no use in releasing that valve next March or April, as the previous Minister did.  Action has to be taken now.  I hope this announcement can be made around the first week in September although I hope it will be a little sooner. There are many problems but the previous Government stand discredited on that issue.  They made no attempt to relieve the situation.  The Minister ran over to Brussels just before the election and when he returned he called the farming organisations together and told them that we had got a great deal.  This only represented 22,000 development farmers. What about the other 150,000, the commercial farmers?  Some said they were well off but I know commercial farmers who have only 60 to 70 acres and have very high commitments.  It is vital to our economy that the people in financial difficulties for the last two years should be relieved because their importance to the economy can never be under-estimated. Fianna Fáil under-estimated it.  It was rather interesting to hear the figure of 3,500 which they bandied around during two debates in this House.  That was the only figure the Minister had but I know if he asked for the reports from the ACC or from the banks he would have the figures.  I hope the announcement can be made by the first week in September. This will be a rather expensive scheme <Col N="1176" /> but I believe we have the commitment from the Minister for Finance and the Government and that is what is important. I do not want to blame the previous Minister for Agriculture because he had no commitment from his Government and that is the reason why the scheme was never put into operation and no steps taken to alleviate the position.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the inflation situation.  The period 1970-78 was the most prosperous in the history of Irish agriculture.  The outstanding factor giving rise to this new prosperity was the unprecedented increase in output prices which took place both immediately prior to and after we joined the EEC.  The rise in agricultural prices over the whole period, 1970-78 was over 280 per cent. This compares with a rise in input prices of 244 per cent, and consumer prices of 169 per cent.  During this period, there-fore, output prices kept ahead both of input prices and of general inflation.  The result was an increase in income from self employment in agriculture in normal terms of 360 per cent.  In real terms this represented an increase of some 70 per cent.  On a per head basis real farm incomes doubled in this period.</P>
    <P>In 1979, however, the tide turned.  The rise in agricultural prices in that year was only 5.9 per cent while the rise in input prices at 12.6 per cent was more than double this rate.  During 1979 the consumer price index rose by 13.3 per cent. The downturn which commenced in the agricultural economy in 1979 continued on into 1980.  Once again, the prices and production environment were not conducive to agricultural expansion.  Product prices actually fell by some 3 per cent compared with 1979, while input costs continued to grow sharply, with energy costs the major factor.  Inflation was considerably higher and interest rates reached very high levels.  These increases in expenses resulted in a drop in family farm income of 9½ per cent in nominal terms.  Adjusting for the increase in the consumer price index, this represented a drop of over 23 per cent in real terms, and after allowing for a change in numbers employed in agriculture the fall in real terms was 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Thus over the two years, 1979 and 1980, there was a decline of almost 40 per cent in farm incomes in real terms.  This substantial fall in the purchasing power of agriculture, which is such a significant sector of the Irish economy, has had serious repercussions on the sectors linked to agriculture.  A depression in farming severely hits local business, including the food industries and industries supplying farm inputs.  Only by getting inflation under control can conditions be created under which agriculture will expand and prosper.</P>
    <P>In connection with the changes in VAT announced on Tuesday by the Minister for Finance in the budget, the Minister has agreed that because of the importance of agriculture to national production and exports the flat rate VAT refund for farmers will be raised to 1.5 per cent to offset any increase in VAT on farm inputs. Further, the Government have also stated their commitment to provide VAT relief for agricultural contractors. The Government wish to encourage and maintain agricultural contractor services throughout rural areas.  The effective VAT rate charged on them will be reduced from 10 per cent to 3 per cent as from 1 September.  The Deputy opposite made a great point about the amount of inflation the Government measures would cause in agriculture but he forgot to state that the clawback to agriculture has been increased to 50 per cent which will offset any extra charges on agriculture. I think he suggested a figure of £40 million in a half year and £90 million in a whole year and so the clawback will be complete.  The question of agricultural contractors is important but Fianna Fáil charged 10 per cent VAT on them.  They are important to the industry and had the 10 per cent remained it would have done serious damage to the contracting sector which is vital to the industry.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to encouraging necessary capital investment in farming.  Emphasis will be placed on promoting investment of the most productive kind.  Many farms still have a fair proportion of land which is not giving a proper return.  Much of this land could be brought to full production by draining <Col N="1178" /> and other forms of reclamation.  When farmers are considering development of their holdings that is where they should first look so as to expand output and improve income.  Proper stocking and utilisation of reclaimed land can bring an almost immediate benefit to farmers.  At any time, but especially when resources are scarce, both at farming and national level it is important that all farm investment should be carefully planned.  Advisers have a special responsibility in this regard.  The end result of the investment in terms of output and income must be carefully worked out so as to determine the nature and scale of the investment that can prudently be undertaken.  The lending agency also must accept an appropriate degree of responsibility in relation to the facilities they provide for farmers.  In the past they have not been as careful as they should be.  When things are going well and farmers can show a very good profit that is all right but unfortunately that does not apply when you get a bad Government.  Let us hope we do not get another bad Government such as we had for the past three years.</P>
    <P>So far as this Government are concerned, farmers are assured that funds will continue to be provided in the future to encourage investment.  Extension of the western drainage scheme to cover an additional 125 acres will ensure the continuity of the scheme for some years. Expenditure under the farm modernisation scheme has reflected the high level of capital investment being undertaken by farmers.  Subject to what I have said about the need for establishing priorities as regards investment and the need for planning, it is expected that grants under the scheme and the other associated capital grant schemes will continue to inject something like £40 million a year into farm development.</P>
    <P>There has been a reduction in the area under potatoes.  In 1960 it was about 70,500 acres; in 1970 it was down to 40,000 acres and in 1980 it was still at 40,000 acres.  Consumption of potatoes, particularly in the fresh state, has also been going down and these are general tendencies I understand in developed countries.  Consumption of processed <Col N="1179" /> potatoes is increasing consistently and this country has been importing appreciable quantities.  In 1980 imports of processed potatoes and potatoes for processing totalled about 20,000 tonnes.  There is a growing market covering many possible products and I would encourage interested persons to look closely at this area now that our national marketing and processing programme for the potato sector has been cleared in Brussels.  I understand there are now no problems regarding the European market.  With the possible exception of the export of seed potatoes I think we have never used the market for consumption.  The import of potatoes for processing should be a pointer to our growers who have now set up a board and I would encourage them to contract with areas of consumption in our own State.  It is regrettable to see imported potatoes coming on our own market.  Since we are ordinarily about self-sufficient for human consumption in the fresh state, imports were confined to our requirements between 20 and 1,500 tonnes from 1975 to 1979 until the EEC trade was opened up with the implementation in May 1980 of Community plant health regulations which also provide for some third country trade.  In the summer of 1980 approximately 12,000 tonnes were imported under the new regime. We in Fine Gael brought to the notice of the then Minister the importation of potatoes where third countries were concerned and, to give credit where it is due, he brought in an order prohibiting the importation of potatoes from third countries. That was a necessary development and one which will be followed up by this Government to ensure that the markets at home are available to our growers.  I accept that as far as EEC countries are concerned we have not authority to stop any imports of potatoes but I appeal to growers to contract with outlets in our own State.  That should not be too difficult because they are an easy product to handle.</P>
    <P>In my limited time, although tempted to go into other areas, I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister some of the <Col N="1180" /> performance that took place, particularly in his last year.</P>

      <P>I meant the previous Minister. In <i>The Irish Times</i> of January 21 last a correspondent, Ella Shanahan, writes: &ldquo;Estimate for agriculture cut by £21 million.&rdquo;  I am prepared to accept that was not the Minister's fault and that it was the Minister for Finance who cut £21 million out of the agriculture Vote.  The farmers must ask: what commitment have Fianna Fáil to the farmers when they took away £21 million in a year when things could not be worse as far as farmers were concerned?  We find, looking through the accounts, that we have to have a Supplementary Estimate after the election of £35 million and we believe that it will be about £30 million short at the end of the year.  The fact is that if the previous Minister had the account in front of him he would be between £50 million and £60 million short.  Yet he saw fit to take £21 million off the Estimate.</P>
      <P>That is what created the uncertainty that now exists in agriculture.  It is our job to remove that uncertainty and create confidence in the agricultural community. That is vital to our economy.  The Minister, Deputy Dukes, has my full support and I know we have the Government's support in ensuring that agriculture will get its fair share due to its importance in the national economy.  We have outlined our policy&mdash;Fianna Fáil have become proficient recently in announcing our policies&mdash;and I have the document on agriculture in which the Minister stated&mdash;I am not sure what he stated&mdash;but in that document is outlined the only way in which our farmers can get back on the expansion road for agriculture. That expansion can improve the entire economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the viewpoint of the Government that it is only from economic strength that jobs can be provided and protected and that it was essential to put the national finances on a sound footing now.  In the national interest I supported this view and, therefore, I supported the first four Financial Resolutions.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the Youth Employment Agency Scheme to integrate and extend youth employment schemes.  I welcomed in particular the decision to give special standing to the National Youth Council and other youth bodies.  I see this as acceptance by the Government of the principle of self-help, which I support. Our youth and their needs, including their educational requirements &mdash; particularly the input of VEC education, the Cinderella of our educational system &mdash; must be recognised by the Government. As regards the College of Technology, Bolton Street, only 10 per cent of the students who apply for third level education can get places there because we have not the resources in the College of Technology.  I should like to remind the Minister that there is a vacant site beside Bolton Street.  I hope he will agree that the VEC may purchase the site and thus expand the College of Technology.  This would be of considerable help to students who wish to get into third level education.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record that I did not vote in support of an across-the-board 50 per cent increase in VAT charges as set out in Financial Resolution No.7.  I realise this 50 per cent increase in VAT charges will take place, but, as an Independent I will be monitoring the effects of the increases, particularly in relation to possible adverse effects on existing jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the January budget is presented I will insist that the Government's medium and long-term plans to provide a just tax system will be incorporated into the budget.  I will insist also that the January budget will include clawbacks on individual items affected by this 50 per cent increase in VAT.  I will insist that there be a clawback to motorists who have been particularly hit by this budget. <Col N="1183" /> I do not own a car but I believe the injustice done to motorists should be rectified in the January budget.  The same should apply to any other category who may have been unjustly treated as a result of the increase in VAT.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed by the FUE that there are many firms who cannot afford to pay wage increases. Equally, I share the concern of trade unions for employees and the protection of their standard of living.  I hope there will not be a confrontation situation of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; but instead that employers and trade unions will adopt an approach that together we will solve the economic problems which are bound to arise as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that price increases <i>in toto</i> must be passed on to the consumer, as was announced in newspapers today by one of the bodies concerned.  All parties from management, distribution, wholesale and retail outlets and the consumers must pay their fair share of the price increases.  This will require goodwill and a co-operative effort from all sides. Frankness and honesty in the interest of the common good will also be required. I do not agree with the decision to permit CIE to increase fares.  The management of CIE should be directed by the Government to manage their economically underutilised land at, over and around their railway stations in Dublin and throughout the country for comprehensive developments, including offices, flats and housing. This should be official planning policy.  This is something I have been advocating since 20 January 1969. Hundreds of CIE railway stations properties would appreciate in value, as happened in Toronto. CIE could use the properties as collateral with the financial institutions who invest in property development. Then CIE could modernise their system, give decent standards and conditions for their employees and actually subsidise the fares.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the Bill dealing with archaeology which I welcome. He spoke in a derogatory way about &ldquo;those who were trying to preserve the <Col N="1184" /> Wood Quay site&rdquo; and he named me.  He implied that saving the Wood Quay site would mean using public moneys.  He then said that what we need, of course, is jobs.  Since being involved with the planning appeal on 6 May 1971 I have never stated I wanted Wood Quay preserved. Wood Quay should have a development on its site in keeping with its tourist and archaeological potential.  A study has been done on this matter by Colin McIvor and Associates.  A sum of £3.6 million per year could be got from the Wood Quay site if we had a development in keeping with its tourist and archaeological potential.  This can still be done.  The civic offices could be relocated on the north side beside the Customs House on the 28 acres of land which the Port and Docks Board no longer require for port purposes.  This would bring jobs to the north inner city, which is supposed to be the stated Government policy.  The saving of Wood Quay would represent a saving of the taxpayers' money and it would also create jobs on the north side of the city.  Professor Lichfield in his report to Irish Life said that it was possible to revitalise the north inner city and create new jobs in the construction industry but this would require bold decisions. I hope the Government will take this into account.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make some comments on the budget.  This is one of the most cruel supplementary budgets that one could imagine any democratic Government rushing through Parliament.  Before I deal with the budget I must comment on the statements of the Minister of State, Mr. D'Arcy &mdash; unfortunately he has left the House now &mdash; and that of his senior Minister, Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He dealt at length with the problems of agriculture and in the course of his speech he seemed to convey to the House that he was still the Opposition spokesman for agriculture and that he blamed Fianna Fáil for all the economic ills associated with agriculture.  Towards the end of his speech he realised suddenly he was now the Minister responsible for agricultural policies, that he was one of the men <Col N="1185" /> of superior intelligence who were screaming to be put into office and who had all the bright ideas about transforming agriculture and industry.  Those people are now in the Government.  We will await anxiously the results of their superior intelligence, their new and bright ideas and all the expertise they propose to introduce into the Government.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the Minister of State will not be able to deliver on any of the new promises.  He will not be able to deliver all he promised to the farming community when he was spokesman for agriculture in the House.  He spoke about Fianna Fail misleading the people.  It is Fine Gael who are now misleading them. He spoke about the &ldquo;Clinton era&rdquo;.  He did not tell us that during that period 10,000 cattle died of starvation.  Cow slaughterings in 1974-75 were the highest on record because of farmer disillusionment. Cows were given away for £60 a head at the time and dropped calves were sold for 50p each to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy conveniently forgot to mention these disadvantages.  He spoke about slaughterings now in the meat factories being very low.  That is correct and the reason is that exports of cattle on the hoof have been increasing.  Deputy D'Arcy was one of the chief advocates of that trade.  He is now in charge of marketing and research in the Department and he has a chance to do something about it.  He has left the House, but I hope he will read the Offical Report and that he will come back to tell us how he has succeeded in his efforts to solve all the problems he has set out to solve.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy and his party came to power by accident, because of the number of Independents who were elected. That is what gave the Government the balance of power.  Fine Gael were able to hammer out an agreement with Labour. I am glad to see Deputy Desmond in the House.  I wish him every success.  I always recognised him as a level headed man and I hope his tenure of office will be successful.  However, he is an urban Deputy and I hope he will not be bored if I continue to deal with rural matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that Deputy D'Arcy addressed Deputy MacSharry as if he and Fianna Fail were still in office. He spoke about the drop in the cow herd and about the low milk yield per unit.  He said he will try to arrange that milk yield per unit will be increased from 750 gallons to 1,000 gallons within 12 months.  I warn him that I will be back here asking him for an account of his stewardship, on how he failed to do that.  He said he would do it for every dairy farmer in the country.  Perhaps he can do it for the privileged few but how will he manage it for all dairy farmers?  All of us would be delighted if that goal could be achieved.</P>
      <P>I remember when the record milk yield was 500 gallons per cow.  We have come a long way since then because of a vast improvement in stock breeding and the introduction of new breeding herds.  All this helped to improve milk yields.  Of course weather plays a significant part in milk production.  When cows have to be kept in in bad weather milk yields drop if the animals are not properly fed.  I hope our farmers will enjoy the benefits of Deputy D'Arcy's superior intelligence. The Minister for Agriculture is a book farmer and Deputy D'Arcy is his senior assistant.  It is problematical whether things would improve if the positions were reversed, but that is not a matter for the Opposition party.  We must wait to see how farming will thrive under this new talent.  Some political commentators have stated that the outlook for agriculture is now bright because of these bright men in control of the shaping of agricultural policy.  Time will tell.</P>
      <P>Those of us who travel to Europe occasionally know all about farming problems because of surpluses and marketing. We know that marketing must be organised properly so that farmers will have guaranteed outlets for their production. Time does not allow me to go into all these matters and the other enormous problems associated with agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy referred to vast concessions to agricultural contractors. He conveniently forgot to refer to the <Col N="1187" /> bills facing farmers because of the new VAT rates.  These will be a serious impediment to expansion.  The Minister of State also forgot to say that farmers must buy new equipment such as milking machines and other small machinery, possibly washing machines for their wives, and that all these things will be subject to the new VAT rates.  He did not tell us what they will be given to compensate for these increases.</P>
    <P>He did not tell us that farmers nowadays find cars indispensable and that cars do not run on air.  Farmers must buy petrol and other oils at the increased prices.  They must pay the increased VAT on cars and they will now be subjected to the re-introduced road tax.  The Minister of State did not say a word about all these things in his 45-minute speech.  Neither did he say that farmers' incomes in 1981 are being eroded savagely by this unnecessary supplementary budget.  Through their propaganda machine the Government succeeded in convincing the people that our economy was in a shambles. They forgot to mention that revenue is always slow in reaching Departments in the first half of the year.  Let me give some reasons why revenue is not as buoyant in the first half of any year as it is in the remainder of the year.  Let us take an example of an employer giving employment of 200 people.  He deducts each week from their pay packets their PAYE contribution, their social welfare contribution and their health contribution.  He uses that money for working capital within his enterprise with the result that the Department do not benefit immediately from the amount of money which has been collected.</P>
    <P>Factories have been doing that for years and they continue to do it.  They wait until the last moment to forward the money to the Department.  They have the use of the money for working capital. This helps them to survive.  It probably helps them to show a profit at the end of the year.  This is not the best type of arrangement.  It is not good business tactics. Revenue should be forwarded the minute it is collected.  This is being done in industry and in the private sector.  It is <Col N="1188" /> one reason for the lack of buoyancy in the first half of the year.  I do not know whether this was mentioned in the House before.  We all know that this money has been retained within enterprises.  The Taoiseach misled the people when he said our finances are in a mess.  He deliberately overlooked the fact that revenue is always slow in reaching the Department in the first half of the year.</P>
    <P>This supplementary budget is unnecessary. It can best be described as a grab-all budget.  Millions of pounds are being extracted from the people.  People will have to deprive themselves of the necessaries of life in order to meet their tax commitments.  That will happen before the end of the year.  This is a disastrous budget.  It will have a detrimental effect on the inflow of revenue to this Government.  People will cut back deliberately.  They will cease spending in areas where normally they would spend because of the cruel and savage increase in VAT and in the price of petroleum and other commodities.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy's speech was political. Conveniently he ignored all the facts which confront the people today.  He ignored the true situation which will arise as a result of this budget.  There is an old saying that the last straw will break the camel's back.  The camel's back has been broken by the introduction of this budget.  It will take many years to restore confidence to the Irish taxpayer.  He sees that so much is being taken and so little given in return.</P>
    <P>It has been said that farmers will benefit to the tune of £6 million, but how many millions will they contribute to the Exchequer this year through the increased price of petrol and the new tax on their cars, their tractors, their pick-ups and their trucks?  They are only one section of the community.  What about the PAYE workers who provide the capital to keep the State going?  They make the finances available to the Government. Are they getting anything they were promised by the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party?  They are not, and they know they are not.</P>
    <P>Their mode of conveyance to and from their place of work has been taxed to the <Col N="1189" /> hilt.  We are all proud of the fact that almost every worker has his own car which enables him to get to his place of work and enables his wife and family to have some little enjoyment at the week-end. That enjoyment has been taken from the worker and his wife and family. He will be lucky if he can purchase the petrol to take him to and from work.  He will have to forget about his week-end trips to the Dublin mountains, the lakes of Killarney, or the lakes of County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>These are serious implications which were not researched before this budget was introduced.  I was surprised last Tuesday when the new Taoiseach said this budget was forced on them.  Nobody in this land was more anxious to be Taoiseach than Deputy FitzGerald.  He is now the Taoiseach.  He is the mastermind behind this budget.  Is this his best?  Is this all he can offer to the Irish people?  He maintains he got a mandate from them.</P>
    <P>What can we expect in 1982 having had this budget foisted upon us now?  Listening to the speeches by the Taoiseach and his Ministers one would think this was the annual budget and not merely a supplementary budget.  They referred to the Fianna Fail budget of last January.  That was the annual budget, the state of the nation budget, which was meant to steer us through until January 1982.  Are we to have two budgets a year while this Government are in office?  We do not know whether that will be long or short.  We do not know how long the Independents will continue to support the Government.  I believe they will support them for a long time irrespective of the consequence.</P>
    <P>How much damage will be done to the economy as a result of this budget?  I talked about agriculture and agricultural machinery.  The increased tax on agricultural machinery will create a further slump in farm machinery sales and create further unemployment in that industry. Roughly 6,000 to 7,000 people are engaged in the sale, distribution, maintenance and repair of farm machinery. How many of those jobs are at risk today because of this budget?  When the real message sinks home to the employers they will have to ask themselves: can I <Col N="1190" /> continue to maintain employment?  Can I continue to pay the national wage agreement as a result of the penal impact of this budget?</P>
    <P>The motor industry, which gives employment to 26,000 people, will also be badly hit.  Recently I met the motor traders from the midlands who told me they were pleased at the fact that car sales had picked up in 1981.  They were satisfied that the future looked bright &mdash; this was before the election &mdash; provided car tax was not introduced and provided there was no further imposition on petrol.  Unfortunately, the worst has happened so far as that industry is concerned. Car tax has been re-introduced and the rates per horse power have been increased.  What this means to the motor industry in the long run is contraction in sales and a slump in the entire industry. I am speaking about those engaged in assembly.  Unfortunately, that seems to be a dying industry due to cheap imports from abroad, but the bulk of employment in the industry is in the servicing and repair of secondhand vehicles.</P>
    <P>People will not be able to travel as much as they did.  The average worker will consider himself lucky if he can afford petrol to take him to and from work.  Professional people and the self-employed can do without a car to a greater extent than an ordinary worker. People are faced with the prospect of not being able to afford to travel to work. The budget is no inducement to anyone to remain in employment because of its cruel and harsh implications.</P>
    <P>I see little future for the 26,000 people engaged in the industry.  There will be mass unemployment.  As I have said, the motor industry was just picking up after the recession which affected all countries. Some people seem to think that the recession only concerned us, but it concerned every other country in Europe as well. We were coming out of it, the economy was beginning to improve and people were satisfied that their future lay here.</P>
    <P>This budget is guaranteed a safe passage through the House because of the Independent Deputies who are more concerned about their positions in the <Col N="1191" /> Dail than they are about the welfare of the community at large.  None of us wants an election, but, if it is in the best interests of the people that it be held, it should be. The Taoiseach is determined to hold on regardless of the consequences and the economic mess which will be left in his trail.</P>
    <P>The motor industry has been dealt a severe body blow.  Another sector will also come a cropper to the VAT increases: it will affect every county council or local authority obliged to pay VAT on certain types of moneys used on road grants.  They will now be obliged to pay 15 per cent VAT and that will mean further redundancies in staff.  It will hit Dublin Corporation in the same way as Westmeath County Council.  More men will be laid off.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to make special provisions in the Finance Bill for the exclusion of local authorities because of the serious situation in which they find themselves.  They must pay that 5 per cent or suffer the consequences of withholding capital grants.</P>
    <P>It is a serious situation for local authorities. It is an area of taxation I did not fully support even during Fianna Fáil's term of office.  I stated that it was a bad system of collection and depleted the amount of money available to them for useful work.  Bad and all as it was, it is 50 per cent worse now because of the increase in VAT.  There will be more potholes and sewer pipes blocked because they will be unable to pay for their repair.  The Government should take corrective measures or ensure that local authorities have a further allocation of money to enable them to run services for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Local authorities operate on a tight schedule and have always done their best to stretch their financial resources.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister for Finance say he was thinking of other forms of revenue for local authorities. Does that mean there is something new on the horizon?  Does the Minister envisage going back to the old rating system? We will wait and see what proposals the Government have.  No matter how one <Col N="1192" /> looks at it, revenue is revenue and must come from one source.  The average tax-payer has only one source of revenue and that is his return from his employment. No matter what taxes are introduced, he only has his pay packet.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there was any need for the stringent measures in the budget.  The buoyancy of revenue in the second half of this year would have taken the Government along.  I am convinced that less petrol will be bought, fewer cars will be purchased, the farming community will buy less materials, farmers' wives will purchase less and people will only buy what they really need.  The old age pensioner, the widow and orphan will buy very little because of the meagre increase granted to them in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been telling us about the substantial increases for social welfare recipients.  What is being given in this area will not make up for the increase in the cost of living as a result of this budget.  In the event of us having a severe winter I would fear for many old age pensioners who are living alone and who will find it very difficult to provide themselves with the necessities of life.  The very substantial increases that we granted in January last in social welfare payments were criticised at the time by both Labour and Fine Gael as being inadequate.  If increases of the magnitude granted then were inadequate how much more inadequate is the 3 per cent being granted now in the wake of the price increase being imposed?  Old age pensioners are facing a severe time but there will be no question of their being out on the streets in protest.  All these people want is the opportunity to live out their lives in peace and comfort and there is an obligation on all of us to ensure that they are able to do so.</P>
    <P>Our society has taken a turn for the worse as the recent disturbances in Dublin and in other parts of the country indicate but how much more serious will be the situation in the future if we do not come to grips now with the problem of unemployment, but how many more people will become unemployed as a direct consequence of this budget?  I have referred to the motor industry and to the <Col N="1193" /> farm machinery industry in which, respectively about 26,000 and about 6,000 people are employed.  It will not be possible to maintain all the jobs in those two areas because of this budget and the same applies to many other areas also. None of us is happy when there is an increase in the unemployment figures. Any such increase means a further drain on the already limited resources available. I wonder how many young people will be able to find employment in September or October.  In the past many of them went straight from school to work. Job opportunities are diminished substantially already because of the budget.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the special youth employment schemes.  One can only ask what was wrong with those schemes already in operation?  What was wrong with a programme which resulted in the retraining of thousands of middle-aged people and of the training of many young people?  The Government in implementing a new scheme in this area are involving the State in all the additional expenditure that this will necessitate in terms of personnel, office accommodation and so on.  There was much emphasis on the unemployment figures in the run up to the election but if one compares them with the huge increase in population they are not all that bad.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the withdrawal of interest subsidy on housing loans is very disappointing.  It is a retrograde step and will make the task of providing oneself with a house very difficult, if not impossible.  This is a step that is likely to lead to much unrest.  It is a measure that will affect most, perhaps, those in the middle income group.  Indeed, I shall be surprised if today's middle class are not the new poor of our society in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another proposal that is very disappointing is the withdrawal of help for such projects as sports complexes, especially at a time when it is more important than ever before to provide proper recreational amenities for our young people. We in Government provided the maximum possible by way of assistance for sports complexes throughout the country. <Col N="1194" /> In that way we were providing places in which young people could come together to relax and enjoy themselves. In the absence of such amenities many young people simply take to the streets with the consequent rise in vandalism that that brings about.  The provision of proper recreational facilities helps also to keep our youth away from the lounge bars.</P>
    <P>Another measure that will have a further impact on employment is the increases in drink and cigarette prices.  I am not in any way an advocate of drinking but we must realise that the industry is one in which many people are employed.  There is nothing wrong with drink so long as it is not abused.  Taken with the other savage increases that are being imposed the increase in the price of this commodity will lead to further redundancies.</P>
    <P>This budget is disastrous.  Unfortunately, it will be passed but the Government and those Independent Members who vote for it will rue the day for the reasons I have outlined.  The budget will be the cause of much suffering in terms of unemployment and of breakdowns in services.</P>

      <P>First of all, I thank Deputy Keegan for his generous comments on my appointment.  I spent many a week with Deputy Keegan representing Ireland in the Council of Europe and I will miss the many occasions when we were together.  I would also like to thank you, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your permission to speak and to congratulate you on your election as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my first contribution to this Dail I propose to make some comments on the past and future roles of economic and social planning in the Government of our country and to refer to some underlying principles which I favour.  At the heart of any serious analysis of the present crisis must be the recognition that under the previous administration all pretence of economic and social planning was abandoned. No coherent strategy existed. <Col N="1195" /> Rather was there a desperate day-to-day application of political expediency.  With the politically-motivated destruction of the central planning structures of the 1977-79 period there was no forum or focus for the planning of any of the key elements of economic and social recovery. This was clearly evident even from my very first week in my Department of Finance.  On the other hand, this Government are committed to the concept and practice of planning.  The programme for Government upon which the administration's work will be based underlines both the necessity for planning and the importance of providing new and truly participative structures for planning.</P>
    <P>The specific programme upon which the Labour Party fought the election campaign was in its totality a direct commitment to planning.  We have always fought election campaigns on the basic political argument that the nation's economy and the social development of the nation must be planned.  From our viewpoint it is self-evident that the reliance upon a mixture of market forces and political pragmatism does not, has not produced and will not produce the economic and social justice for which we yearn.  The Government, therefore, must accept the primary responsibility for national development.  In a national plan which has as its purpose a thriving and expanding economy, a wide range of social services and a high level of welfare, short-term political advantage cannot be used as the sole determinant of investment and decision.  Rather must there be a genuine national strategy for growth, for jobs and for social advancement in which the overall welfare of the vast majority of ordinary men and women in this country and the future welfare of their children are given the first priority over and in the face of any individual or sectional interest.</P>
    <P>The idea of planning has had its ups and downs in the political administration of the country over recent years.  Since the mid-sixties there was a steady drift away from the view that planning in one form or another was crucial for national economic and social development.  The <Col N="1196" /> 1977-79 O'Donoghue experiment, if I may call it that, failed both in technical and institutional terms.  However, the changed circumstances of the last two or three years have led many people to a positive re-appraisal of the role of planning. In the words of Senator Whitaker to an ICTU summer course some years ago, &ldquo;Confronted with the prospect of a steadily rising population, the need for some 30,000 new jobs a year, a growing number of dependants and the present disorder in incomes and public finances, who would rely on <i>laissez-faire</i> or on market forces alone to solve our present problems at least in a way we would tolerate?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Planning, therefore, is essential if we are to identify our national economic and social goals and to translate them into effective programmes of action.  This is even more obvious when one considers the nature of the changes and challenges we face at present.  I would stress that these challenges are very great indeed.  I will point out four changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would indicate the challenges we are facing in trying to plan the economy and I will list four of them at this stage.  They are well known but they need reiteration in a debate of this nature.  We have a continuing high level of unemployment, with all its attendant social effects, which is Ireland's most serious and most deep-rooted problem. We have the impact of inflation on investment, living standards and savings.  We have the question of a balanced and equitable determination of incomes, the question of an equitable system of taxation, and the need to improve the quality and scope of our social provisions.  All of these are very closely related&mdash;there <Col N="1197" /> is no need for me to say this to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, with your considerable experience as Minister of State at the Department of Education&mdash;to perhaps the greatest challenge of all: the changing demographic pattern in the country.  It is clear that the questions raised by the present rate of increase in our population, by the long-term demands of job creation for our young people, who constitute 50 per cent of the population, and by the growing needs of the elderly in our national community are central to all considerations of policy both in the short term and in the long term.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I advance the view that, faced with these problems, we have no option whatsoever but to accept the necessity for a coherent system of economic and social planning into the eighties.  It has to be flexible.  It has to be reviewed on a regular basis and it has to be brought into balance on a regular basis through dialogue with various interested parties, particularly with the social partners. The framework of the objectives of that kind of planning has to be set at the highest political level.  I regret very deeply that that approach was absent in the Fianna Fáil political administrative approach because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that that approach is in sharp contrast to Fianna Fail policy which over the years&mdash;and particularly in recent years with the demise, so to speak, of my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; became little more than a mixture of expedient arithmetic and largely incompetent muddling through.  The present <Col N="1198" /> Leader of the Opposition does not and never did believe in economic and social planning.  He was pragmatic from day to day, more interested in public relations than in what one might call economic reality.  Therefore, in the period ahead we have the problem of evolving and implementing a total strategy for economic and social development.  The basis of that will be set out in the national plan which will be at the centre of this Government's programme as far as I have any influence over the direction of Government policies.</P>
      <P>We have to look at the situation which faced us and certainly faced me when I walked into the Department of Finance and tried to find out what in God's name was happening in the past two or three weeks in terms of Government policy and what the thrust of the policy was.  Even the very fact that this Government have taken some action, however unpalatable that action may be, is to be commended. This budget and the action now taken represent a significant break from the drift and the futile hoping for salvation and for an upturn in the world economy which characterised the previous administration. This budget and this debate is an abandonment of the theme song `Another Day Older and Deeper in Debt&rdquo;.  That is what the previous administration gave us by way of responsible management.</P>
      <P>The difference between the present Government and the previous administration is not the result of different perceptions of the problems facing us.  I think both sides are aware of the problems. There is no doubt about that.  It is a difference between on the one hand solving problems and on the other hand postponing solutions because they are unpalatable and, therefore, making the task ultimately far more difficult.  The national economy cannot get better without remedial treatment.  Postponement of the evil day would simply result in further deterioration. That is not the response which the electorate would want from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost two years ago the previous administration put a planning document before this House entitled &ldquo;Investment and National Development, 1979-1983&rdquo;. <Col N="1199" /> It was an excellent document and it analysed very clearly the problems and the choices facing us.  Paragraph 2.13 stated:</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the international economic climate, the importance of domestic behaviour in determining our future cannot be over-emphasised. The domestic response to future external developments can range from a good, well co-ordinated response by a community with a shared sense of direction to a scramble by various interests groups for short-term gains irrespective of the impact of their actions on other groups or on the overall well-being of the community.</P>
    <P>It was well written, well drafted and approved by the Government of the day. I do not think any objective observer could claim that the required domestic response was achieved by the previous administration.  Admittedly, in a preface to that document, it pointed out that even when that document was finalised the international outlook and the domestic situation worsened but this conclusion should have reinforced the need for an appropriate domestic response.  Instead we have had to scramble for short-term gains irrespective of the impact on the community or on the overall well-being of others, which should have been avoided.</P>
    <P>This is the inevitable result of short-term <i>ad hoc</i> responses to the economic situation.  In a sense, it is almost inevitable that immediate problems have to be met by immediate responses.  I readily concede there is not always time for the formulation of the most thoroughgoing solution.  Nevertheless, it would be at our peril that short-term expediency should become the primary determinant of political action.  We have seen that process at work in the last Cabinet.  Expectations have been raised now and the required discipline, which longer-term goals impose and which are necessary for any community to develop and prosper, have been absent.  Too often Cabinet documentation available to the incoming Government is riddled with attempts being made through measures of expediency to <Col N="1200" /> satisfy simultaneously the competing and conflicting demands of different groups. That is quite obvious, just like the £3.7 million which was spent on the basis of a telephone call from the Taoiseach to the Minister of State in respect of sport and recreational facilities, when the money did not even exist.  That is what happened and that is the kind of nonsense which went on on the previous occasion.  There was no sanction apart from that, no Government decision, nothing.</P>

      <P>That is not administration. The deterioration in the public finances illustrates the situation which this Government face.  In the early seventies the deficits in the current budgets were no more than a few million pounds. In the years since then they have grown to hundreds of millions of pounds and this year, were it not for the action which the Government are now taking, the current deficit would have climbed to nearly a thousand million pounds, just about £20 million or £30 million short of it.  No apologia on the part of Deputy Haughey, who knows the Cabinet documentation, who knows the departmental Estimates, who painstakingly went through them last January and cut them and cut them and cut them into an area of make-believe, simply because he wanted to go to the country in March or April, can change that.  The Stardust disaster prevented him from going to the country. He cooked the books last January to prepare for the prospect of a general election and the Book of Estimates was, literally, a book which had no reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when we took up office we were faced with the current deficit which would have climbed into nearly £1,000 million, just £20 million or £30 million short of that figure.  Resolute measures to bring the deficit under cotrol were promised by the previous administration. We all recall their much publicised target of reducing Exchequer borrowing requirement to 8 per cent of GNP by 1980.  They never came within an ass's roar of reducing Exchequer borrowing to <Col N="1201" /> around 8 per cent.  I am not one who totally decries the concept in operation of budget deficiting; I am not a monetarist and I do not think the Fianna Fail Party even understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;monetarism&rdquo; never mind Keynesian economics.  They have not a clue to judge by the way Deputy Haughey behaved here in his apologia for his economic mismanagement over the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>Had the budget deficits been put to good effect there might have been some justification for them but these deficits were used inexcusably to have transient consumer expenditure, for by-election promises in Donegal, for unsustainable projects, for temporary relief here, there and everywhere.  It was not put to productive capital investment in the community in terms of job creation.  It was also used, of course, to grant a large number of pay increases, whether they were even justified or not.  They were increases which were outside and in excess of the terms of the national understanding. The former Taoiseach even broke the procedures of conciliation and arbitration in his dash to get settlements in certain cases and if he wants to challenge us on that we will document it meeting by meeting.  It is a horrific story. These settlements were awarded outside normal pay settlement procedures in the public sector.  In the public sector, there-fore, such pay awards have increased current public expenditure and they have helped to undermine orderly industrial relations and to set an example which, on imitation, has added to costs and has eroded the job potential of our economy.</P>
    <P>Little real effort was made to bring a realistic appreciation of available resources to bear on demands for more public services.  Increasingly, the soft option of improving or extending services on the basis of borrowing has been taken, rather than raising taxation and/or trimming other less desirable activities.  Generally, a policy of spend now and pay later has been pursued.  Hard but necessary decisions have been deferred because of their political repercussions. Today we are faced with a legacy.  The <Col N="1202" /> legacy is a shaping of actions of attitudes, of processes and of institutions that runs counter to the true interests of the Irish community.  It will be singularly difficult, particularly with a minority Government &mdash; extraordinarily difficult &mdash; to change the community attitudes which have been fostered right through, even from the old manifesto days of 1977, but particularly fostered by none other than Deputy Haughey.  That was not leadership.  It was utter irresponsibility, acting as Taoiseach in this House.</P>
    <P>The proposals now being put before the House by the Government are not simply an <i>ad hoc</i> response to current difficulties.  They are the first, necessary steps towards getting this economy back on its feet and ready to meet the economic and social challenges of the eighties.  The better management of the public finances on which this Government have now embarked must be carried through, not only, I would suggest, into 1982, but to 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.</P>

      <P>Quite seriously, only about then will there be some order and rationality restored to public finances, because one cannot have massive reductions of current budget deficits over a very short number of years.  It has to be phased and it will be well into the middle of the decade before the required remedial action is achieved.  If not, I suggest that the future of each one of us, the future of my children and their children in time, will be put completely at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main areas where corrective action is needed, first of all in public finances.  The control of public finances is a basic requirement of effective planning.  It is pointless to plan action, or to have a national plan and expenditures over the years ahead, if the action this year is not implemented in accordance with the budget agreed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Over the next few years, the ability of the Government to control the public finances, which have deteriorated so alarmingly over the past <Col N="1203" /> few years, must be restored.  Budget overruns which have become the order of the day rather than the exception, must not be tolerated.  That position will have to be reversed.  Apart from the need to be able to control the public finances, there must be the closest examination of the cost effectiveness of existing current and capital expenditures in the interest of reducing the use of borrowed funds to finance consumption.  Programmes which are not making an effective contribution to economic and social objectives in relation to their costs, or which have largely served their purpose or outlived their real usefulness to the community, must be terminated or phased out.  These are harsh words, but we have no option but to face that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. B. Daly Mr. B. Daly">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance-of-payment deficit could reach almost £1,500 million this year, if no corrective action were taken.  This amount exceeds &mdash; going on as we are to the end of the year &mdash; the combined total of the exceptionally high deficits experienced in 1979 and 1980.  As was pointed out in the recent <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i>&ldquo;This is an extremely high deficit by past Irish or current international standards&rdquo;.  Put simply, we as a nation are living alarmingly beyond our means.  When Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach, I recall vividly the television programme, with Deputy Sile de Valera smiling broadly behind the new economic saviour of this country, not only South, but also North.  He then said that that was precisely the diagnosis of the problem.  He spelled it out.  There was only one slight problem, he totally deferred doing anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this were to continue &mdash; and I state this conscious that I now work as a junior Minister in the Department of Finance &mdash; I have not the slightest doubt, with the data which I have seen, that there would be massive devaluation of our currency, and this would be so inevitable that there would be no choice in this House.  I am quite convinced that inflation <Col N="1204" /> would rocket, that economic and social problems would multiply and the loss of confidence in the economy would seriously damage its long-term development potential.  Therefore, we have no option but to bring our balance of payments under control as quickly as possible. The gradual elimination of the current budget deficit will help here, but our export efforts must be intensified and our imports reduced.  I strongly support the previous administration's campaigns for selling Irish and for the Guaranteed Irish campaign.  That should be fully supported, because it helps with our balance of payments and protects jobs.</P>
    <P>Then we have the question of competitiveness. In many ways this is central to our economic future.  Improved competitiveness, particularly cost competitiveness, is imperative, both for the expansion of exports and for encouraging the investment required for future growth. Our major domestic internal cost, of course, is remuneration.  It is vital that pay rates be consistent with the need to improve competitiveness and raise employment.  In effect, increases in pay rates should and must be aligned more closely with those prevailing among our trading partners, and output per worker must be increased towards the levels obtaining in these countries.  Order and rationality must be restored to industrial relations.  Disruptions and stoppages of production damage our reputation as reliable suppliers and have an adverse effect on the job potential of our industries and services.  Were it not for the damage already done, many more people would be employed here in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound entirely negative or harsh.  We must look forward as well to the future.  Corrective action is only one element of what needs to be done in taking a grip on our affairs. Positive constructive action is also a necessary complement.  We have here one of the fastest growing populations in the EEC and a very high proportion of our population is under 25 years of age.  Our young population is a major potential resource.  Most of our younger population are well educated and possess great <Col N="1205" /> energy, initiative and talent.  Good use must be made of these qualities.  Our production and our productive apparatus must be re-orientated to meeting new trading needs, to developing new products and to using the knowledge-based technologies of the future.  Government action will ensure that worthwhile investment is fostered and, while expenditure will be carefully evaluated, the public capital programme will fully support the expansion of the productive capacity and the improvement of the infrastructural facilities to the economy.</P>
    <P>In so far as general measures cannot immediately resolve employment problems, the Government see the Youth Employment Agency as an important vehicle for supplementing these measures with special provisions.  This will require separate legislation.  In addition, the National Development Corporation, which will also require separate legislation, will have an important role to play in ensuring that the potential of the economy for sustainable employment is fully realised.</P>
    <P>Obviously, corrective and developmental action will have to be welded together in a coherent strategy and implemented through effective planning.  As one of the Ministers of State, I have a main concern here.  I am aware that, in the past, planning has run on to the rocks, most often on to the rocks of political expediency, sometimes on to the rocks of events totally outside our control and has not lived up to its promise.  We all know that.  Nevertheless, there is no substitute for a planned approach to enable us to grapple with and solve the economic and social problems which are facing us at present.  My aim will be the creation of a framework within which the aims and activities of the public and private sectors complement and support each other. Within that framework, effective planning will assist the State in managing its own activities in an ordered and systematic way that is consistent with overall national objectives.  I do not see national planning as displacing the normal procedures of Government or the working of the market place, but rather as a far better, a more disciplined and equitable <Col N="1206" /> way of managing the economy.  It must take on board the facts of economic life if it is to contribute to the effective and realistic management of the economy; it must involve the community, if it is to release that national dynamism of which this country is capable.</P>
    <P>The preparation of a national plan, as promised in the Programme for Government, 1981-86, is under way in the Department of Finance.  The central economic concerns of this plan are, first, the restoration of the Exchequer's financial ability to support priority economic and social programmes on which development depends; second, the creation of conditions conducive to the increased competitiveness of the economy; third, the expansion and improved efficiency of the productive capacity of the economy, particularly through the public capital programme; and fourth the promotion of individual enterprise, energy and ability in both the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>In essence, its aim is to create conditions conducive to sustainable economic and social development and to ensure that the opportunities arising from the creation of these conditions are made full use of to generate employment.  I will elaborate on the social planning aspects later.</P>
    <P>In drawing up their plans the Government have undertaken to consult sectoral and other interest groups so that the various programmes can benefit from the experience and expertise available to these groups.  I see such consultations as a means of enabling the longer term national interest to be adequately recognised and no longer be overlooked for the sake of short-term or sectional expediency. If the talks are to be productive, it is essential that they be permeated by a perception of the real and pressing difficulties that we have to overcome in the present decade and the limits of the resources likely to be available to meet them.  Indeed, the clearer and sharper that perception is, the stronger are our prospects of ultimate success.  The programme for government indicates that plan projections will be based on detailed consultations with the different sectors and the organisation of the plan will be <Col N="1207" /> subject to review at stated intervals by a National Planning Board, presided over by the Taoiseach involving key economic and social Ministers and representatives of trade unions, employer organisations, farmers' organisations and others.</P>
    <P>It is in the national interest that the foundation of planning for the development of the economy be put in place as quickly as possible.  With that in mind, I envisage that the initial preparatory work in the Department of Finance and in other Departments will be completed without delay so that consultation with the various sectoral interests will be possible in the autumn.  Following these consultations, I expect that a sound framework of planning for the management of the economy up to the middle of the decade will be available, by the end of the year, and will provide a medium-term perspective for formulating the 1982 budget.</P>
    <P>I will deal with social planning because I have a particular interest and direct responsibility in ensuring the co-ordination of social and economic planning.  I believe there is a very essential link between the economic and social dimensions of planning.  The basic position to which I hold and which will be at the very foundation of all my work in this area in the period ahead is that it is fundamental that no plan for economic recovery and expansion can be successful if it is not also designed to deal with social injustice and with the anomalies of the social, legal and administrative systems as an integral part of the whole exercise.</P>
    <P>A so-called plan that fails to balance economic growth with social advance and reform will entirely lack credibility in the eyes of the people.  Such a plan will be seen as a charter for commercial advantage rather than for people's needs.</P>
    <P>First of all, I must emphasise that it is my view that the term &ldquo;social&rdquo; when applied to the area of public policy should and must have an extremely broad meaning. There are those who see social policy as identical with social welfare policy, with perhaps the inclusion of health and housing.  This is as erroneous a view as the widely-held opinion that the social <Col N="1208" /> welfare system is about unemployment and sickness benefits and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Social policy embraces very many&mdash;&mdash; and an increasing number of the aspects and implications of the work of most of Government Departments.  Surely the best recent definition of social policy is that of Professor Donnison who wrote some years ago now, in the seminal NESC Report on Social Policy, that &ldquo;the social policies of Government are those of their actions which deliberately or accidentally affect the distribution of resources, status, opportunities and life changes among social groups and categories within the country, and thus help to shape the general character and equity of its social relations.  Social policies are thus concerned with fairness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the drawing up of the national plan, social policy in this sense will have to be regarded as being of central importance. It is quite certain that the crucial planning issues of stated goals and agreed programmes of action cannot be thought of in wholly economic terms.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that the major national goal of employment protection and creation will not be attained unless the plans made to acheive it are so designed as to deal effectively with the known anomalies and injustices in our social, legal and administrative system. This emphasis on justice and equity, whether a tax system or any other system, must become an integral part of the national development process.  The fact that we are today discussing the prospect of a plan at a time of recession, inflation and high unemployment must not be allowed to distort our thinking.  As Professor Donnison correctly stated in his NESC paper, such considerations do not mean that &ldquo;the nation cannot afford equalising social policies.  It was precisely in such times, during the last World War, that many countries adopted their most radically equalising policies.  If such times come again Governments may be unable to retain the support and social cohesion of the governed unless they adopt similar policies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The mere pursuit of goals spelled out in terms of economic advance &mdash; more <Col N="1209" /> growth, reduced deficits, a healthy balance of payments, more employment or reduced unemployment levels &mdash; simply cannot be looked to as the basis for the national consensus that we all know to be essential.  The very process of economic growth will be a futile exercise if it has within itself discriminatory elements which sustain and reinforce injustice.  I refer particularly to our taxation system, capital taxation and other major issues in which will have to feature in future Government policy.</P>
    <P>There must be a clear commitment in our planning to the achievement of a genuine balance between acceptable economic criteria and the basis of a more just and equal society.  I hope that this approach will permeate the economic and social strategy of this administration. After 12 years in this House, after being in Opposition, then on the Government backbenches, again in Opposition and now in Government at junior Minister level, I have no illusions about the difficulties of this approach.  In all honesty I think the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, the Tanaiste, Deputy O'Leary, and a number of individuals in the Cabinet are capable of undertaking that exercise. Therefore, the prospect of change can be hoped for because it can succeed.  There is a need for co-ordination of change as well.</P>
    <P>The success and effectiveness of national social policy, particularly in the context of a plan, depends on the extent to which all aspects can be co-ordinated. The whole range of policies with social content must be seen as truly complementary. Over the years there has not been adequate co-ordination of social policy.  The problems which exist in this area arise in large degree because of the <i>ad hoc</i> structures for planning and because of the diffused disposition of Government Departments, which change with successive administrations. We have an arbitrary division of responsibility between different Government Departments, depending almost on the whim of the Taoiseach or the Minister of the day rather than on the need to govern <Col N="1210" /> the country in a more effective way. There is need for detailed examination and analysis of the working of governmental structures and their efficiency in meeting national policy requirements.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a new and coherent framework for the making and carrying out of social policies.  This should be done within the framework of a national planning board and the main goal of change must be to ensure that all social problems are properly dealt with and that resources are concentrated to meet acknowledged community objectives.</P>
    <P>The scale of our current social spending is very considerable.  The 1980 Estimate provided for the outlay of £1.7 billion for social services, approximately 40 per cent of total current Government expenditure or 17 per cent of GNP.  Yet there is no co-ordination or planning in the spending of that vast amount of money.</P>
    <P>Repeated research findings give proof of the existence of this situation.  It is one of the reasons why poverty still exists on a relatively large scale.  The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul published a report last year on the elderly and other reports were issued by the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty. Going back to the days of Sister Stanislaus and the Kilkenny Conference, there is ample evidence that Government expenditure in this area very often is not put to the best possible use.</P>
    <P>The social welfare statistics speak for themselves.  At the end of 1980 the total number of recipients, including members of their families, was no less than 954,000, some 28 per cent of the total population.  Of that number 416,000 were in receipt of social assistance, including almost 40,000 on supplementary welfare allowances.  For the past 12 years I have earned nothing but a Deputy's salary and it horrifies me that some 277,000 child dependants live in families receiving social welfare payments.  This is the problem with which we must deal by ensuring an adequate input to coherent social and economic planning.  It must evolve in a direction which can make a reality of the political rhetoric of full employment and <Col N="1211" /> social justice which we politicians proclaim. Social and economic policy must be rooted in the realities of life in our country.</P>
    <P>We must bring forward policy initiatives which, as stated in the NESC report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;prepare the way for what will later become the dominant theme of social policy: the equalisation of opportunities, living conditions, status and power among the classes of an urban, industrial society.  That will call for the replacement of stigmatising selectivity now operating at the bottom of the social scale by other forms of selectivity concentrated more often at the top of the scale to ensure that those best able to pay bear a larger share of tax burdens and get no exorbitant share of social benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If our social plan can incorporate that sentiment it will have been well worth while assisting in Government.  This House has the essential ingredients to succeed in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  We were both elected to the House on the same day and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that Fianna Fail in Government had cooked the books.  We did not.  The Estimates were there to be seen.  We are now being given projected figures for the likely state of finances at the end of the year, but it is still too early to say what the total deficit will be.</P>
      <P>It is easy now to see why this budget was introduced.  It was to pay for the schemes outlined by Fine Gael during the election campaign.  The budget is now considered necessary to pay for some of these schemes.  Others will not be implemented until April and then we may hear that finances will not allow of their implementation at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were accused of not coming to the aid of hard-pressed mortgage holders by providing a mortgage relief.  On each occasion that the mortgage rate was raised to a high level we paid a subsidy costing millions.  Today it has been <Col N="1212" /> announced that the mortgage subsidy is to cease from 1 September.  That will increase the average mortgage by £20 a month.</P>
    <P>It has also come to my notice that one must now be married to have a loan approved by the local authority.  When I was in the Department of the Environment it was our policy to make loans available to people who were about to get married.  There was a problem in that many people had to go into flats before they could be rehoused by the local authority.  Now I see more people coming onto the local authority housing list.  That will be a disaster and this is a very bad move.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment said that he would seek other ways to raise local authority revenue.  Some members of the Opposition, when they were on this side of the House, were in favour of reintroducing rates on houses.  Will this happen next?  Will rates come in through the back door by the introduction of a levy on garbage collection and other essential services?  I would ask the Minister to spell out the situation in relation to the other ways of raising revenue.  To reintroduce rates on houses or to charge for essential services is not the right way. It would give rise to a further substantial rise in the cost of living.  When I was in the Department of the Environment some of these proposals were put to me but I refused to entertain them because of the consequences they would have.</P>
    <P>Motor taxation has been reintroduced and between that, the VAT on petrol and the increased cost of petrol it will cost the average motorist an extra £10 per week. A car is now an essential item for many people.  To pay for a house and a car an average person will now have to pay £15 a week extra.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare are welcome but what good is 5p per week for a child?  In relation to public sector employment, do the Government's proposals mean that there will be a cutback in the recruitment of gardaí and other personnel? I would like the Minister to explain that.</P>
    <P>We were accused of spending our way <Col N="1213" /> out of our difficult period in Government. There were some options open to us.  We could have cut back on capital investment, on housing, on factories and on roads, but that would have created major unemployment.  Across the water one sees the effect of such measures and nobody would like to see that happening here.  Ours is an open economy and we saw the best way to get us out of the difficulties as being to spend our way, with capital projects to create employment and a base for productive purposes. We are well over the worst of the recession now and when the time came for us to be able to go ahead with our economic plans we had in train the economy would have been well able to take off.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy B. Desmond, stated earlier that we gave way on public sector pay and on many other things.  When the Deputy was on this side of the House he wanted to know what we were doing about numerous disputes and blamed us for the Posts and Telegraphs dispute that went on for a couple of months.  Neither the Labour Party nor the Fine Gael Party agreed with our handling of the disputes but now when they are in Government they see the difficulties. I am glad about that.</P>
    <P>We were often placed in a position where we had to look at the situation in the light of the capital available.  In relation to grants and housing in general, I would have liked to have done what the Minister has done but the capital was not available.  We made the capital available to us available for new house purchasers as we wanted to take them out of the flats and the mobile homes.  I hope that the housing programme we built up will not be neglected and we will keep a close watch on it to that end.  Also close to the Finanna Fail Government's heart was to see the spread of houses throughout rural Ireland so that villages would be built up and not neglected.  That programme was in train when I was in the Department.  I emphasised that aspect to local authorities, that that programme should continue rather than crowding people into major urban areas because it was bad economically and socially.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the overall <Col N="1214" /> effect of this budget on the economy. For example, what effect will it have on jobs?  The PRSI contribution is about to be increased in the near future and there are other levies about to be introduced. VAT on building materials is about to be increased which will have an adverse affect also.  I cannot foresee in the programme outlined in the budget where there will be any increase in employment. In my opinion rather will there be a decrease.  Companies about to engage extra staff will examine the situation more closely because their overheads will increase dramatically, such as telephone charges, postal charges, petrol, diesel and so on.  All of these will increase other costs even further.  Furthermore building costs will rise dramatically.  I cannot foresee anything else because the economy is now being fuelled for a take-off of that nature.</P>
    <P>The real snag will arise in regard to pay because I anticipate that for the average wage earner on £80 a week the measures now being introduced and those to be implemented on 1 September next will mean £20 a week taken from that man's pocket.  Certainly that will be the reality for anybody owning a car, paying off a mortgage and purchasing all the other items being increased in this budget. Therefore, what will be the situation in regard to renegotiation of a national wage agreement?  I hope I am wrong but it is my opinion that it will be very difficult to renegotiate a national wage agreement, this difficulty being occasioned by these increased charges to be imposed on the wage earner.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment states that he will initiate a housing finance agency.  I should like to know what will be the terms of reference of that agency, where the money will come from.  I shall be particularly interested to know, because I also examined this question and was unable to come up with an answer without taking money from other institutions.  That is the reality of the situation. Possibly one could use a pensions fund for that purpose, but then does one take the money from pensions funds or other lending institutions, robbing Peter <Col N="1215" /> to pay Paul?  Those are some of the exercises I played around with.</P>

      <P>I notice that in regard to mortgages there is now a proviso entered with regard to local authority loans to persons contemplating marriage, that they will be unable to get a local authority loan either to build or purchase a house.  I know many people contend that one must have the cage before getting the bird.  One might have the bird now but will have no cage, because that will be the situation if these proposals are implemented.  That was the slogan in the country &mdash; that one had the bird but had not the cage, yet others had the cage but had not the bird. Very few will now have the cage.</P>

      <P>This housing finance agency sounds very interesting but I am afraid it will mean robbing Peter to pay Paul.  I should very much like to know from where the money will emanate.  I estimated the Fine Gael proposals on housing to cost approximately £180 million. Others estimated nearer £220 million. When I was in the Department I should very much have liked to introduce house improvement grants and so on but the money made available to the Government was put into new housing, providing homes for those people getting married and others in need of it.  The situation now will mean that there will be an increase in the waiting lists for local authority housing because it is my information that this proviso is about to be inserted and implemented immediately. <Col N="1216" /> Certainly that will have an adverse effect on housing generally.</P>
      <P>Then we note that the rate of VAT will rise from 10 to 15 per cent, covering all items and especially those used in the building construction industry.  This must increase substantially the cost of houses and there is no point in pretending otherwise. I should have thought that at least those materials would have been excluded because it will create further hardship on people trying to build new houses.</P>
      <P>Another matter also brought to my attention is that sports/community halls and sports complex grants have been abandoned, something that has come as a great shock to the many community projects all over the country.  That was a very bad move on the part of the Government. Indeed nobody did more to help youth organisations and sports complexes than my colleague, Deputy Tunney, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>The carpet has been pulled from beneath Deputy McMahon. He is very annoyed.  I know he has every reason to be.  But that is the situation now confronting people and for which they must pay.  The people were led to believe from the financial package put forward by the Fine Gael Party that these expenses would be met and there would be no increased taxation.  But I am glad to say I warned the people in Laois/Offaly.  I am glad to say also that that constituency accepted my advice when I told them that they would pay and pay for it as they never did before.  The present situation is that the chickens are coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>That is the position at the moment. The people of Laois-Offaly knew the facts of the situation but I regret to say in another constituency they did not believe this was the situation.  They thought they would get a bonanza, that the money would be delivered by the postman through the door and that they had nothing to do but open the envelope.  They find now that everything is different. Everybody now knows that all those promises have to be paid for.  Next January they will get another dose of medicine.</P>

      <P>A lot has been written and a lot has been said over the past two days since the budget was introduced. The public will feel the impact of this budget in the coming weeks, particularly from 1 September next.  I fear next <Col N="1218" /> winter will bring much disappointment and a grave set-back for our economy. Speakers during the past two days and on budget night have dealt with many important aspects of the budget.  They have also dealt with the scenario which led up to the budget and the scene which was painted.  On the opening night of the debate I referred to the balance of payments position and the independent economic forecasters who outlined the great improvement there would be in 1982.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about the budget deficit.  I agree with my colleague who has just spoken that this budget was unnecessary and those measures were unnecessary at this time.  This was done for pure political reasons and, as a consequence, all our people, but especially the young, will suffer during the coming winter.</P>
      <P>I want to dwell at length tonight on inflation and employment and to remind the Government, even at this late stage, how important those factors are.  I want, especially, to remind the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party of their pre-election commitments.  I want to remind the Independents that they now have the opportunity to say that they reject monetarism in this country and they reject inflationary policies such as this budget typifies.</P>
      <P>The budget is a grave set-back for our economy, which was nursed along through a very difficult world recession by Fianna Fail.  Every act of ours was geared towards availing of the improvement in the world recession which we are told will come about in the second half of this year and with greater impact in 1982. All our efforts were designed to ensure that when we reached that recovery our economy would take off as a result of our policies.  We are proud that we succeeded in bringing our economy through that very difficult world recession with far less damage to it than older and more developed states in the European Cummunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious aspect of the budget is the fuelling of inflation.  The Government justified the budget by referring to the deficit and the level of borrowing, but they have completely ignored the impact of the budget on inflation.  Surely, in any <Col N="1219" /> commentator's assessment, in any politicians assessment, that merits serious attention and also does its impact on our economy.  Our inflation rate at present is about 17 per cent, which is for too high, but on the admission of the Minister for Finance &mdash; he said on Tuesday night that the budget would add 3 per cent to it &mdash; this will now go up to 20 per cent.  We believe that with the knock-on effect of VAT and the ESB and CIE charges not included, it could be closer to 22 per cent or 23 per cent.  I read an article in one of this evenings papers which vindicates the figure I am now talking about.  This article was not written by a Fianna Fail person.</P>
    <P>Let us hear from the Government, the economists and all the commentators, who have been complaining about the gravity of our economic situation, how they defend the steep rise in inflation and how this can be good for the economy. The Taoiseach this morning spoke at some length about reducing inflation.  He said the biggest and most permanent reduction in unemployment would be through a reduction in our inflation rate to EEC levels as quickly as posible.  All of that is mere pious chant.  By this budget he put up our inflation rate to almost record levels.  If his reasoning of this morning is correct, this will lead to the biggest and most permanent increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>I want to go back for a moment to the Fine Gael programme for the election, in which they said that rising prices and costs were destroying the livelihood of our people and increasing the cost of our products to a point where they could compete at home against imports.  They also said that this, in turn, was causing employment to drop in Ireland and this inflation was largely caused by Government mismanagement.  They also said that these cost increases had affected farm incomes most of all, because the prices secured for agricultural produce were set by the needs of our EEC partners. I want to remind the Minister for Finance, who, I am sure, was involved, and the whizz kids who prepared that document that that is from the Fine Gael programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> What about the Labour Party?  What did they say before the election?  They predicted the inflation rate would be 18 per cent for 1981, but that is before this budget.  They said in their programme that the results of that 18 per cent inflation rate would be further inevitable cuts in living standards, a further loss of competitiveness and, therefore, more redundancies. Now the Labour Party in Government have added substantially to the inflation rate they forecast.</P>
    <P>The two Government parties have deliberately fuelled this inflation and I believe it to be only the first instalment because, as Deputy Connolly said, we shall have another hugh hike in expenditure taxes or indirect taxation to finance the income tax package next year.  So much for the Taoiseach's broadcast to the nation last Friday when he said that the measures being taken next year to offset the taxes imposed now will help. He was indicating that whatever measures were being taken now would be shortlived and compensatory factors would accrue in January or whenever the budget was introduced.  Of course that is not correct.  Today at Question Time, during some of his evasive answering, the Minister admitted that the cost of introducing the promised packages would be substantial and obviously further indirect taxation will be brought in then.</P>
    <P>What about all the propaganda of the election promises and the deceitful and misleading advertisement of the cheque through the door almost next morning? Instead the people have got an additional average weekly budget of about £12 &mdash; so much for the £9.60 through the door promise.  Instead of the postman delivering it the VAT collector, the indirect taxation and the petrol pump will take away an average of £12 from the average weekly budget.</P>
    <P>The Tanaiste was very vocal in Opposition over the years about the necessity for centralised bargaining and for taking cognisance of industrial relations problems when Finance Ministers are introducing budgets.  I wonder what comments the Tanaiste made on this budget when it was being introduced by the Minister <Col N="1221" /> for Finance.  It would be interesting to know.  Centralised bargaining has been a feature of our economy for more than a decade now.  Introduced originally with the aid of Fianna Fáil in office, carried on by successive Governments, a new concept of it was reached in recent times with the advent of the national understanding. During Deputy Haughey's time as Taoiseach greater consultation took place with the social partners, the employers, the unions and the farm organisations, than ever before.  I believe that is the way forward.  With a young, growing population like ours that type of co-operation can only help.</P>
    <P>What effect will this budget have on bargaining of any sort, on centralised bargaining especially and above all on industrial relations?  Perhaps it is true that the Government have already washed their hands of industrial relations problems. Today I was sorry to have to ask the particular Minister of State a supplementary question, because it was far removed from her portfolio, about the problems now facing social welfare beneficiaries. Two nights ago Deputy O'Malley said that shortly Dublin people would need photographs to remind them of what buses are like.  Since the Government came in not one bus has moved in Dublin city and provincial services have been curtailed.  I am sorry Deputy Byrne is not present but for three or four weeks he has been raising a problem affecting his people in north Dublin because of the non-functioning of lifts.  I believe the Government have already washed their hands of industrial relations.  I think the Minister for Labour and for the Public Service is already diving for cover &mdash; he carries much of my sympathy &mdash; because of the actions of the Minister for Finance now.  His problems, great though they may be at present will only grow when the full impact of this severe budget is felt.  I believe the Government are anxious to wash their hands of industrial relations, and this is understandable although I shall have some comments to make on this because I was often at the receiving end of the magical formulas that they could and would produce. <Col N="1222" /> There is no evidence that they have any answer other than the Minister saying that he intends to introduce legislation of which we do not yet know the details.  By legislation alone they will not wipe out industrial relations problems; there must be human concern and human concern is sadly lacking in the budget presented here.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced will hit living standards very severely.  One must be concerned with comments being made already by employers and trade unions in the early lead-up to what should be renegotiation of a national understanding. I hope a national understanding will be achieved.  Some may say that collective bargaining or centralised bargaining may have outlived its usefulness: I do not share that view; I believe the alternatives are too dangerous and that a free-for-all would only harm industrial relations.  The Government have an obligation to consider how much they are fuelling inflation. Certainly, this Government have set out to do it in a big way.</P>
    <P>A paltry £8 million is being given to agriculture.  This is no compensation for the probable £80 million or £90 million being taken out of agriculture by the increases in VAT and taxes.  People must realise that.  The motor industry is being crucified.  It is a hard word to use but the only one that will describe it.  About five elements of motoring are severely affected by the budget.  The employment content in the motor assembly industry is substantial as it is also in the case of accessories, tyres, etc.  These will all suffer setbacks because of the enormity of the impositions in the budget.  I understand we will now make our private vehicles easily the most expensive in Europe despite our heavy reliance on private transport especially in surburban and rural areas.  What are the alternatives in surburban Dublin at present if one has no private transport when no public transport is available?</P>
    <P>I understand from today's papers that ESB charges are to go up by 25 per cent. Yesterday, I was amazed to hear Deputy Kelly, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism commenting on the aids being given to industry by the dropping <Col N="1223" /> of the impost on hydrocarbon oil.  It was very interesting.  When one adds the ESB charge, the indirect taxation &mdash; petrol and VAT particularly in the case of industry &mdash; and telephone charges, the small relief being given on oil is of little significance in reducing costs when they are increased so substantially in other ways.</P>
    <P>Commentators have been extremely critical about the blow dealt to tourism. It was a shattering blow.  We are all aware that in the early months of this year tourism was encouraging and promising but, due to unfortunate political events, it received a setback.  Now, it has sustained this shattering blow and the consequences for all the different operations of tourism are very serious, employment being a very important feature of that industry.</P>
    <P>Although few details were given in the budget speech, we understand that investment by semi-State bodies is to be cut back by £135 million.  We have some scepticism about this figure but if it is correct we wonder how it can be reconciled with the comments of the Tánaiste yesterday morning in this House when he said he was committed to expanding the State sector to provide the maximum number of jobs.  One must doubt his sincerity. The budget curtails funds to semi-State bodies.  The Tánaiste spoke at length about the National Development Corporation, to which we are committed. He spoke about pouring millions of pounds into it but he did not refer to the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, was reducing the moneys available for other semi-State bodies.  As a Government we supported State-sponsored bodies.  We believe in using them also as employment vehicles.</P>
    <P>All of the bad news in the budget has been filtering through in bits and pieces. Today the Minister for the Environment announced that the 1 per cent mortgage interest subsidy, which we had introduced to keep down the cost of housing for young people, is to be abolished.  The evening papers today estimate the extra cost to married couples as £20 per month. When one adds up all the extra costs one realises the figure is very high.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> The £4,000 grant for first-time house buyers is being restricted to married couples. In my view single working people are entitled to their own homes and the incentives we gave them in this connection also gave a significant boost to the construction industry.  The parties who have for so long preached equality are discriminating now against single people who wish to buy their own homes.  They will not be given the same facilities as are given to married couples.  Some members of the other parties have been vocal during the years about equality and we wonder how they feel about this conservative decision taken by this conservative Government. Of course it will depress the building industry and will affect employment. If we take it that 22 per cent of house purchases are by single people, we can see that there will be a considerable reduction in the amount of building work.  When one considers in addition the effect of the VAT increases on building materials it is obvious that there will be greater unemployment.  In the past the Tánaiste had many comments to make on what he called our lack of attention to the building and construction industry. In his speech he referred to a huge growth in the unemployment figures by the end of 1981 as a result of our policies.  I wonder if these decisions were designed to ensure that the figures mentioned by the Tánaiste will be reached?</P>
    <P>This afternoon the Minister for the Environment said local councils should be encouraged to raise their own forms of finance.  Is this introducing rates by the back door?  Is charging for garbage collection and other services and are the raffle and lotteries another way of introducing rates by the back door?  We know what happened with regard to car tax. Will the people have to pay more for local services?  While the Minister gave his personal support for the restoration of rates, his party said otherwise.  However, it appears the Government are reneging on that promise also.  By one means or another they will introduce rates.</P>
    <P>I listened with some interest to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism when he spoke about the public <Col N="1225" /> service.  It was a very entertaining speech but it was not very enlightened or comprehensive and there was no content in what he said.  He made many light-hearted points, but this is not the time or the place for that.  These are difficult times and the measures taken by the Government will set back the progress of the nation.  The Minister referred to the growth of 31,000 jobs in the public service but he did not say who was involved.  Was he saying we should not have had more gardai, more prison officers, more teachers, more health services and people to work those services, was he saying we should not have had more people in the semi-State bodies?  That is where the bulk of those posts arose.  The Minister had a set on the public service for a long time when he was in Opposition and obviously he still has it in Government.  On Tuesday night the leader of our party pointed out some sectors of the public service where he had personal experience of the commitment of the officials.  I will not dwell on that except to say that the public servants seem to be a popular group to attack. Of course, people in the public service have not got the opportunity or the right to reply to the same extent that others have.  There is now an embargo on further recruitment.</P>
    <P>I omitted earlier to mention the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Previous Governments neglected the area of communications but we saw the importance of this sector.  More people were taken on, advanced technology was introduced, more telephones were installed and this rate of connection can be continued because of the excellent work of Deputy Reynolds when he was Minister.  I hope this Government will not do anything to impede the great progress being made in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that greater emphasis must be placed on the productive sector to give more jobs and I agree with that.  However, our young population are entitled to improved services.  I will give some statistics.  In the Community Report for April 1981, Ireland is shown as having the lowest numbers of civil servants per head of the population of any country included in the report &mdash; 2 <Col N="1226" /> per cent of the population, compared with percentages ranging from 2.2 to 3.7. It is disappointing for fathers and mothers of families to be denied this opportunity for employment of their families.  I heard the Minister say there would be ample opportunity in the civil service for young people, because of wastage, retirements, and so on.  That is a disgraceful suggestion for any Member of this House to make.  It is no substitute for useful public service recruitment.  I agree there are some areas that are overstaffed and underworked, but there are many areas where there is need for recruitment.</P>
    <P>Emphasis has been placed on public service pay.  It is a big change from the suggestions made by members of the Government when they were over here. Their comments then were very different. I should like to stress that the greatest increases in public service pay were as a result of national understandings and through recruitment.  An efficient public service is needed and the provision of jobs must take priority.  The Fianna Fáil Government gave tremendous sums of money to the IDA, one of our most successful State agencies, whom I must congratulate for past achievements and for what I know they will do in the future. At this moment we on this side do not know which Minister is in control of that agency.  There is confusion even within the IDA about that.  They are not sure whether it is the Tánaiste or Deputy Kelly who is in control.  The Government should make this clear immediately because it is essential that this efficient and successful agency should not be confused in this way.</P>
    <P>We understand there is to be a curb on public sector pay.  Meetings are to be held with the associations and unions in the service and the C and A scheme is to be discussed.  The C and A has served this country well and any Government exercise on the lines contemplated would throw it back to 1975.  I do not believe the public will condemn the Fianna Fáil Government for having recruited extra gardai, teachers, nurses and other health service employees.  They were needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> Neither Labour nor Independent Deputies have given adequate explanations why they should allow this savage deflationary budget to go through tonight.  This is their last chance to stop it.  It is not in the interests of the ordinary working people or of so many of our young people who are looking for jobs. This is the type of deflationary policy which has done so much harm in an island not far from us where such policies have contributed to soaring unemployment and lack of jobs.  Here it will have the same effect leading, perhaps, to a return to emigration, if that were available. Therefore, there is an obligation on those Deputies to examine carefully how they should vote in this, their final opportunity.</P>
    <P>Where are the food subsidies we were told by the Coalition parties would bring down the rate of inflation?  Where are Labour's promised transport and fuel subsidies?  The Labour Party promised all sorts of capital taxation, levies on banks and so on.  Tonight those Deputies are being given an opportunity to vote down this budget which will be remembered for its contribution to higher unemployment and many other evils.</P>
    <P>At Question Time today the Minister for Finance referred to the Employment Guarantee Fund and I should like to put the record straight.  It was introduced as part of the 1979 National Understanding and included contributions from employers and the Government.  A tripartite committee was set up consisting of the social partners and the Government.  In this years national understanding the Government contributed £10 million. Employers refused to contribute but after long and tedious negotiations we succeeded in getting a contribution form the employers towards vulnerable industries &mdash; Brussels did not allow us to contribute to high employment industries.  We succeeded in having a programme prepared which would be acceptable to Brussels and to the employer organisations.  That took considerable time.  A sum of £10 million had to be provided, and because of technical problems legislation had to be put through the Oireachtas.  Though <Col N="1228" /> the present Minister put it through it was ready and waiting for him.</P>
    <P>In the first national understanding a commitment was given to provide sports complexes and other facilities for the young.  As I said earlier today, we should pay a tribute to Deputy Tunney for his efforts in this respect.  He will be remembered for his great work in the Department of Education.  However, just as the Government have reneged on their commitments to youth employment, they have also reneged on promises in regard to sports complexes, and no brandishing of files will excuse them for reneging on our young people, particularly when we see so much trouble, riots and so on, across the water.  We were the first Government to make any worthwhile contribution to the development of youth facilities.</P>

      <P>This morning the Taoiseach put forward what was obviously a most inadequate defence of the budget.  He keeps talking about a crisis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly has. <Col N="1229" /> We repeat our position.  There is a recession of unprecedented severity, but there is no grave economic crisis peculiar to ourselves.  On the contrary.  We have been coming through it in better shape than most, thanks to the policies adopted by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred the House to the July OECD Economic Outlook and specifically the passage on Ireland which states that, with the type of policies Fianna Fáil were pursuing, the prospects for next year were reasonably good, indicating a substantial drop in the rate of inflation and the balance of payments deficit, and that unemployment at least would not worsen.  If people want a fair and impartial assessment of where we stand, they should read the OECD <i>Economic Outlook</i> and what it has to say about Ireland.  This morning the Taoiseach had no answer to that except to refer rather lamely to sentences of a general character in the introduction.  If the OECD thought they had special application to us, they would have stated so, but they did not.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach showed this morning that he is a true reactionary living in the past.  My definition of a reactionary is one who wants to restore the past and who does not fully appreciate how the world has changed.  He is fond of quoting the financial rectitude of the second Coalition Government who left money in the kitty on leaving office.  As Deputies will remember, that was a time of great economic stagnation and mass emigration. From his comments this morning he seems to regard the past 50 years as a model for today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sixties were an exceptional period of economic growth and development throughout the western world.  The 40 years previous to that were different from today in one vital respect.  Through emigration we had a declining population which meant that, relatively speaking, services and infrastructures were adequate to our needs.  We believe the people have no desire to return to the stagnation and emigration years, or the the conservative policies of many of those years.  What happened in the seventies to <Col N="1230" /> all developed countries &mdash; and there was no allusion to it in the Taoiseach's speech &mdash; was the ten-fold increase in oil prices in two steps.  If there were not to be a massive slump in living standards and employment a recycling of oil funds &mdash; and that means borrowing debt &mdash; was essential.</P>
    <P>These are the realities and yet the Taoiseach talks about bringing realities to the people.  It is all very reminiscent of a senior and respected civil servant in the Department of Finance in 1950 who, according to Dr. Fanning's admirable history, was critical of Marshall Aid as being too generous when countries should have been forced, he said, to face the realities of the situation, when expansionist ideas, however admirable, were completely out of touch with the reality of the financial position.</P>
    <P>Is that what we want today when we think about our young people?  All politicans have been saying that 50 per cent of our young people are under the age of 25 years.  They are our national asset. They are our investment in the future. With its growing population, this country needs to make full use of its borrowing capacity to build up jobs.  I want to give the lie to those commentators on the other side who indicated that our credit rating was in jeopardy.  That is not in accordance with the facts.  We have a very high credit rating.  Of course the borrowing will have to be repaid.  I see no harm in the concept of asking the young to repay part of the cost of providing them with education, housing, jobs and recreational facilities.  It is much better that these facilities should be provided even at some cost than that they should be without them.  A Government who, by their policies, leave them without those facilities will be remembered by the young people in the future.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach denied that this is a monetarist budget.  This is only the first instalment of Fine Gael's economic strategy. Obviously the Taoiseach is aiming at reducing the money supply by reducing the budget deficit and foreign borrowing. The main feature of Fine Gael's programme is their income tax programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> I fear that the policies now being pursued are the policies of people like Milton Friedman, the guru of monetarism. Surely that is not what we want at this time.  It is not what our young people need.</P>
    <P>We need only look at the position in the other part of our country and across the water to see the impact of the measures taken there.  Remember the path blazed by the British Government was that of increasing expenditure taxes, cutting income tax, cutting further expenditure and borrowing.  What are the effects today?  I would ask Members of the House to judge for themselves what those effects are.  Those who have the opportunity of voting on this budget for the last time should consider what the impact of the measures now being introduced could be.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that this morning the Taoiseach had to admit what our leader stated yesterday, that is, that the budget achieves remarkably little in terms of cutting the budget deficit or even the level of borrowing.  Look at the cost to the community.  Look at the imposition on the ordinary man and woman, on the householder, the housewife, the motorist, the ordinary people.  He admitted it achieves remarkably little.  He drew the conclusion from that, that it is not a deflationary monetarist budget.  In order to achieve this negligible result, the Government have raised substantially the estimate of the hypothetical budget deficit and borrowing without providing any detailed justification.  To bring it back down to the likely actual outcome, substantial taxation is being imposed.  It is extremely heavy taxation and nevertheless it will raise £77 million only.</P>
    <P>Let us think for a moment about the Fine Gael programme.  Perhaps three and a half times that amount and more may have to be raised in indirect taxes to pay for the income tax reforms promised for next January.  One wonders will they come.  If they do come, the cost, if borne in indirect taxation, will make a further substantial impact on the Irish taxpayer. It will continue to fuel inflation.  One <Col N="1232" /> must wonder what these measures are intended to do.  I believe they are deliberately intended as a purely political exercise.</P>
    <P>Yesterday one of the Taoiseach's Ministers claimed with great rectitude that as Ministers they were putting their political heads on the block because their Taoiseach and leader said that if one of the Financial Resolutions was defeated he would dissolve the Dáil and call a general election.  I regard this as a certain type of blackmail to try to frighten people, but not Fianna Fáil.  All members of Fianna Fáil would be happy at the prospect of a general election tomorrow, next week, or whenever.  Blackmailing some Independents is a most unscrupulous act by any Taoiseach, but it was obviously done for this reason.  We argued that the budget was not necessary.  Our various speakers over the past few days have substantiated without doubt that argument. Many economic commentators questioned the necessity for it and the harsh measures it proposes.  VAT with its impact on so many aspects of industry becomes a reality on 1 September but increased costs in industry are enormous. The smaller allowance given is of little or no significance.  All this leads to the major problem of rising unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is no joy for the young school leaver of an opportunity in the public sector.  This is the real area for producing jobs.  Our population is growing at a high rate.  The labour market is growing and will be for a considerable time.  It is important that in the productive areas of the public service and in areas such as the security of people and property there are sufficient people employed.  The Minister seemed to imply that I was saying that this was the only area of recruitment.  I agree with him when he said that the productive sector is the most important one and that it was important that the IDA be given every facility and encouragement. However, young people are now deprived of the opportunity of an opening in the public service.  What does that mean for school leavers?  Increased unemployment, lack of job opportunity, less spending money and activity generally. There will be a drop in general economic <Col N="1233" /> activity, soaring costs in industry and little or no chance of expansion for further employment.  These are offshoots of the severe budget we are bringing to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Inflation will be of the order of 22 to 23 per cent due to the Government's actions.  What will the worker's attitude be?  Far be it from me to incite people or produce problems for any government from any source, but questions will be asked about the drop in living standards, what compensation is being allowed, if any, and if it can lead to further industrial unrest.  We are proud that over the past 18 months our record in that area was great.  It now appears that this Government are shying away completely and are not having any concern with industrial relations.  If services are not available they are not concerned.  It is incumbent on a Government to provide services, whether a bus service or the payment of social welfare benefits.  These are serious considerations.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well be involved in efforts to get a national understanding and I sincerely hope he is successful. There is no doubt that this budget makes his task substantially more difficult than it would otherwise have been.  I do not say it was easy in the recent past but, taking a leaf from the Tánaiste's book &mdash; and the Minister may like to read the leaves I talk about &mdash; he consistently said that the greatest impact today on industrial relations was measures taken by the Minister for Finance.  I wonder if he commented on that to the present Minister.</P>
    <P>The national understanding expires for most people at the end of November. This morning we saw comments from both sides and their approach to a new understanding.  The action of the Government has made it more difficult to continue with centralised bargaining, which has been a successful feature of the national understanding.  There are those who say national understandings are too dear and too expensive, but the alternative may well be far more harmful and costly in the long term because of the unrest which would be caused.</P>
    <P>Whether one lives in Dublin or the country, the motor car has become essential <Col N="1234" /> for most people, particularly those in busless Dublin.  The cost of an average family car is now expected to increase by £10 per week.  What with the hike in petrol, the VAT increase, the 10 per cent increase in excise tax and the restoration of motor tax, it will be costly to run a car. I believe the restoration of motor tax is the most upsetting item for the motorist. Our decision was a wise one.  We were particularly wise to confine it to cars of 16 horse power or less.  There is no doubt but that it encouraged people to use a slightly smaller car.  This was done with some viciousness and malice, as if to say we will show the people that road tax should never have been removed from cars.  That was behind the thinking in introducing this measure, among a combination of impositions on the motorist. It will affect employment in the industry and in the accessory industry; and as a Corkman, I have an interest in both of those.  They are both big employers.</P>
    <P>The increased costs will mean higher industry costs, building industry costs, have a tourism impact and so on.  The Minister for Finance is one of the decent and honourable members of the Government, but he has been asked to carry the can to try to bring the country back to an era that had been gone for so long because of the approaches of successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  We will oppose every single step he tries to set it back, particularly at a time when the population is growing and the greatest asset we have is our young people.  We will oppose the Government every step of the way.  It is incumbent on every Member of the House, realising this is their last chance to vote on the introduction of monetarist policies, to stop it.  If this measure goes through it may well be too late and the people who will remember will be the young growing population in whom the parties opposite have pretended to be so interested and to care so much about.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure for me to have the opportunity of concluding this budget debate. I thank those on all sides for their contributions to the debate, the standard of <Col N="1235" /> which was particularly high.  This high standard may be attributable to the imposition of a time limit and, consequently, more concentration on the issues than has been the case in debates of this kind in the past when contributions dragged on for weeks and even for months without in some cases any conclusion being reached.  In this case the time allowed may have been a little too short given the exigencies of the situation but the standard was very high.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked me to give the basis on which we projected that the budget deficit for 1982 would be £1,500 million as against the opening budget deficit projected by him this year of £515 million.  I am very glad that the Deputy asked that question because that very issue is central to the whole approach of the Government on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we addressed the public finances at our first meetings &mdash; and the House will be aware from reports that we had very many and very long meetings in this regard in preparation for this budget &mdash; we were shocked by what we found.  In opposition we had predicted that the opening deficit for this year would turn out to be a lot more than the Minister's projection of £515 million, a figure which he had bravely adhered to up to the end only to be disproved by the Exchequer returns published within two days of his leaving office.  During the campaign we had predicted that the deficit would be about £800 million but the Exchequer returns made available to us and the information that was available in the Department as to committments which were entered into and about which we were not aware in some cases and in other cases not aware of the full cost while in Opposition, indicated that the likely deficit would be about £950 million.  We were shocked by this lack of control of Government finances and by the lack of seriousness on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government in respect of the estimates they put forward originally.  They arbitrarily chose figures for certain services which implied policy changes that would enable them to live within the revised estimates.  They set the figures but they <Col N="1236" /> did not make the policy changes immediately afterwards.  As a result the budget had gone completely out of line during the year.  This was painfully obvious in the Exchequer returns for the first six months.  Bad as all of that was, what really spurred the Government into immediate action was the projection of these figures into 1982.  It was the really serious situation that would occur in 1982 if action were not taken that was the most effective determinant of our decision to act immediately.</P>
    <P>The assumptions on which the projection of £1,500 million was made by people in the public service who are competent professionally to make such projections was first, that the present volume of public services would be maintained.  There was no assumption of new services being introduced but the present volume would include the new services that had been introduced in the first six months of 1981. Secondly, there was the assumption that the real value of social welfare payments would be maintained.  In other words the increase in those payments was also projected into the figure on the expenditure side.  On the revenue side there was the assumption that there would be no change in the tax rates or in the tax allowances and given a certain rate of inflation, that implied a certain amount of revenue by way of buoyancy.  The assumptions therefore, on which this £1,500 million budget deficit for 1982 were reached were technically neutral assumptions as I have just indicated.  It is on that basis, then, that the calculation was accepted by us as being entirely valid.</P>
    <P>There are a number of facts which do not come to light on the face of these assumptions but which were very important in creating a prospective situation for 1982 far worse than the one which obtained this year.  I would just mention three of those which by their very nature make the 1982 situation in prospect far worse than the 1981 situation in actuality. First there was the additional debt service. Trends in 1981 indicate that debt in 1982 will be far greater than in 1981 because a lot of extra money will have been borrowed by the time we reached next year simply because of the very big <Col N="1237" /> deficit we have this year.  It is projected that £400 million more in debt service costs would fall on the Government in 1982 than would be the case in 1981 mainly because of the borrowing in 1981.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the previous Government for reasons best known to themselves decided to bring forward into 1981 corporation tax that would normally be collected in 1982.  This amounted to £66 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes a difference to the deficit for 1982 because it increases the apparent revenue in 1981 but is not available in 1982.  Consequently, the deficit for 1982 is £66 million more than for 1981 as a result of the deficit for 1981 having being artificially narrowed by the bringing forward of this revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the smiles on the faces of the wise old men on the other side after bringing us into this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The third item is the fact that a lot of new services, many of them not having been sanctioned in the Dáil and without Estimate provision being made for them, were agreed to by the last Government in the run up to the general election campaign.  These included a deferral of major increases in prices for certain items which would cost very substantial sums of money, the introduction of mortgage subsidies and ESB subsidies.  All of those were not apparent and would not have their full effect because they would apply for only part of the year in 1981 but in 1982 they would have a full annual effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons we concluded that if no action is taken the deficit for 1982 would be £1,500 million, a very serious figure, far higher a current deficit than that obtaining in any othere European country to our knowledge, and maybe as a proportion of GNP twice or more the deficit obtaining anywhere elese.  We could not allow that to continue.  As I said in my speech, it is very bad to have budget deficits.  First of all, they lead to an air of unreality because measures can <Col N="1238" /> be taken in terms of increases in services, but if one has become accustomed simply to adding these on to the borrowing requirements by running budget deficits there is no discipline either on the people demanding the services or on the Government conceding them in regard to how they are going to pay for them.  They can pay for them simply by more borrowing. That lack of discipline is one of the main reasons why politics has deteriorated in this country in the last ten years.  The discipline which should be imposed by the need to balance the budget is not there in political transactions because people have no longer to say, as long as budget deficits are accepted as the order of the day, how they are going to pay for anything.</P>
    <P>Budget deficits have the effect, if the money used to finance them is borrowed on the home market, of pushing up interest rates.  They crowd out available credit to other productive sectors of the economy, and this is particularly bad for the housing sector.  The housing industry more perhaps than any other depends on borrowed capital for the creation of the demand for its services and if the Government are borrowing very substantially to finance current deficits on the home credit market that has the effect of pushing up interest rates and doing very serious damage to the housing and other similar industries.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, budget deficits encourage imports.  It has been pointed out that the propensity is for budget deficits to have a greater effect on encouraging spending on imports than they do on spending on domestic production. Ireland's situation is far from the traditional Keynesian model of the economy which is based intrinsically on a closed economy concept of where the full effects of a deficit budget run within the economy are felt within the economy itself. That approach loses its validity when applied to an open economy as in the case of Ireland where the effect of running such deficits usually is to encourage a much faster growth of imports than of domestic production.  The reason is that imports can be imported at will.  There is no lead time on bringing in imports <Col N="1239" /> because they are available on the world markets and all you have to do is pay the money.  An increased demand usually can be met very quickly by imports.  However, an increased demand for domestic production cannot be met just as quickly because there is a longer lead time in getting the production process into being. Hence, any attempt to pump more money suddenly into the economy through a budget deficit has the effect, due to the variance between the lead times of domestic and imported production to meet demand, of encouraging imports more than it encourages domestic production.</P>
    <P>Faced with this situation of a very high budget deficit and this reasoning as regards the undesirability of budget deficits, the Government decided very quickly, almost within two or three days of taking office, that action would have to be taken there and then to arrest this. That decisiveness, that failure to do as so many Governments have done in the past, to look over their shoulder twice, three or four times before making up their mind about anything, that decision to go straight down to work and do the job which obviously needed to be done inspired confidence not only at home but abroad also.  It is seen that the Government are prepared to take decisions and not postpone them as was very much the case under the previous Government who seemed at times to be almost in fear of their own shadow.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit was also running at a very high level and was having the effect of putting severe pressure on our currency.  The necessity to maintain the value of our currency is all the more important now that our currency is part of the EMS.  It is no longer tied to any other currency on a one-to-one relationship.  We have the responsibility of managing our currency independently. However, no currency can maintain its value <i>vis-a-vis</i> other currencies if a deficit is being run on the balance of payments of the country in question which is substantially larger than the deficit being run in the other countries with whom it seeks to maintain parity in <Col N="1240" /> regard to the currency.  Pressure would be building up on our currency because people would see that the writing was on the wall if deficits continued to run at that level.  The very fact that decisions were taken quickly once the election was over, even though their immediate effect might not be great in one month or two months, restored that necessary confidence.  People feel that here is a Government who will take the action necessary to maintain the value of the currency.  If we were not to take that action we would find ourselves on a slippery slope.  Devaluation should be avoided at all costs because it would lead immediately to a dramatic increase in our rate of inflation.  The price of almost all our imports, certainly all of the imports from countries against whose currencies our currency had been devalued, would rise very rapidly and that would have a knock-on effect throughout our economy which in turn would precipitate probably a further devaluation. Once one has moved off a parity one almost loses control of the situation.  In our view it is essential that we avoid that and we have taken very strong measures to avoid it.</P>
    <P>However, we do not believe that the problem is solved by virtue of this budget. I do not make this claim.  There is still a serious underlying problem.  Even after the increases in revenue and the prunings in expenditure which we have made, the budget deficit at the end of 1981 would be very much larger than it was supposed to be originally.  It would be around £780 million as against the £515 million which is projected, and that is far too high. Therefore, it must be said that the Government will have to continue to adopt measures in the future which will reduce the deficit progressively as the Government have planned.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of measures in the future to restrain the budget deficit must be in the area of public expenditure and we need a very imaginative approach to the control of the growth of that.  That is why I have laid special stress in the budget on the review of financial procedures here in this House.  Any endeavour to bring public spending under control if it is to be successful must have a wide <Col N="1241" /> measure of public support.  The best forum in which one can obtain public support for measures which are necessary, if not necessarily initially palatable, is in this democratic assembly.  There-fore, we are proposing to make very substantial changes in the way public spending is authorised in this House.  I have said on so many occasions in debates here on budgets and similar occasions that we do not approach this part of our responsibility adequately.  I feel I am bound to be boring many of the Members of the House who have been here before by going over the ground again.  The way we deal with Estimates for expenditure in this House makes no sense.  We do not even have possession of the Estimates documents until the year to which they apply has already begun.  The Estimates documents at present are not published until the middle of January of the year to which they apply.  At that stage, before they are published, one-twelfth of the money which they provide has already been spent.  Most of them are never debated in the House.  A small number are debated, and I concede that the previous Government did make efforts to discuss more of them than had been the case in the past.  Usually they are not discussed at all until half-way through the year.  In other words, half the money to which they apply has already been spent before they are even discussed. Obviously discussion then is of no value because telling a Government in power that it has allocated its money incorrectly and that it could make savings here and put more money there is quite irrelevant because the money is already spent.  The budget is already committed and nothing that is said in this House on Estimates documents can have any effect on the outturn for the year to which it applies.</P>
    <P>That does not make sense.  No business firm would discuss its budget for a year that was already half over.  No county council would discuss their estimates for a year which was half over.  Yet that is precisely the way we deal with public expenditure, the largest single entity spending money, the State itself, deals with its spending in a way in which the smallest private company would not <Col N="1242" /> approach its affairs, and it spending so much less.  That is something which, in our view, must be reformed if we are to bring public expenditure growth under some degree of control&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I shall be hearing more from the Deputy.  We must realise that, even in this House, we will be constrained by the realities of public finance in our demands and we ask the public generally to be equally constrained.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, that any change in the situation to enable Members of the House to do the work they are elected to do will require increased resources and facilities for this House.  It will mean a change in the format of the Estimates documents.  It really does not make much sense to present an Estimate for one year. An Estimates document should at least project expenditure for four or five years ahead.  I would like to see this developed by integrating the Estimates document which says what the Government are going to spend in figures, with the Government's economic and social plan which says what it intends to achieve as a result of those figures.  At present, the Government publish a plan at one time of the year, which very often contains figures which cannot even be correlated with the figures in the Estimates documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates document is concerned soley in its format with the needs of the accountants to account for money and how it was spent.  No effort is made in the Estimates document to set out any measure against which the results of the expenditure can be measured.  There is no attempt to provide Members of this House in the Documents with which they <Col N="1243" /> are presented with a method of finding out whether the expenditure on a given subhead for a given Department achieved anything last year or the year before.  No information is made available to Members of the House to enable them to make that judgment.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that we have indiscriminate demands for more public spending from all quarters when we do not examine properly the results that such spending is supposed to achieve here in the House which is legally responsible for the sanction of such spending?</P>
    <P>We must have Estimates documents concerning public expenditure presented here in the House in the autumn preceding the year to which they apply.  It is my aim to bring forward the presentation of the Estimates this year by about two months.  I realise there will be very severe problems in achieving this.  In fact, the traditional Estimates circular is only issuing to Departments today on more or less the same day as it would normally be circulated to Departments in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not try to be too ambitious.  We will not be pressing him on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. Ambition in this area is something to be commended because, unless one is ambitious, one will achieve nothing.  It is my aim to bring forward the publication date by two months, if possible.  It certainly will not be possible to do any more than that in the time available.  That will mean, when the process is completed, that the House should have an opportunity of discussing all the Estimates in the autumn session.  If this is to be achieved, it will mean the setting up of either one or a number of Estimates committees.  My own preference would be for just one committee, otherwise there would be competing demands and individual committees fighting for their own area of spending, without any consciousness of the overall macro-economic effect of what they were doing.  I am availing of this opportunity of putting forward my ideas in this area so that we will have the <Col N="1244" /> benefit of the opinions of the Opposition in this matter because I think there is a wide measure of agreement in principle, if not in practice, on the need to do something about the improvement of Estimates procedures in this House.</P>
      <P>I would also like to see these Estimates presented on a multi-annual basis.  I should like to see a similar discussion on the Government's capital programme. At present, the Government spend money in two ways, first, on current expenditure, which is basically day-to-day expenditure, salaries and so on and which, by its nature, recurs every year.  It also spends about one-quarter of the same amount on what is known as capital spending which is non-recurrent spending, one-off projects which do not have to be repeated.  We have a procedure for discussion of the current Estimates, but we have no discussion whatsoever of capital spending.  The Government just publish their capital programme about two or three days before their annual budget and there is no discussion whatsoever on that document unless it takes place in the course of the budget debate, which is so general and political that there is no serious attempt made to analyse the choices made by the Government.  There is no opportunity for constructive amendments to be put forward either by Members of the Government or by the Opposition. I should like to see us move towards a situation where we could have a discussion on the capital programme, in the same way in which discussion now takes place on the current Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to see us look at the possibility of reclassifying expenditure. There is a lot of expenditure classified at the moment as being capital and, there-fore, on the face of it capable of yielding a return in income to the Exchequer, either directly or indirectly, which will enable the Government to pay back the debt.  There is some expenditure on the capital side which does not fit into that category and we should perhaps look at whether it should be classified as capital at all.  I realise it is not a subject which can be approached on an amateur basis. It requires very careful study.  We have inherited the division of capital and current <Col N="1245" /> above and below the line, which dates back to 1949 when the late Deputy Paddy MacGilligan was Minister for Finance.  It has not been reviewed since then.  We should now have another look at the classification system which is used in regard to distinguishing capital expenditure, which it is legitimate to finance at all times by borrowing, and current expenditure which, up to ten years ago, one was supposed to be finance only by revenue.</P>
    <P>I also see the need for much more detailed scrutiny of the annual reports of the many semi-State bodies which spend money in our name.  Very much of present Government spending is not done by Government Departments at all, or by agencies which are answerable to this House through the Minister, or through the mechanism of the parliamentary question.  It is done by bodies outside the direct day to day control of the Minister, which is as it should be, most of these bodies being set up for a purpose and their autonomy being given to them for that purpose.  However, where these are bodies which are spending public funds and not bringing in substantial amounts of revenue to themselves, public expenditure is not accurately scrutinised in this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to see major changes in the format of annual reports presented to this House by such bodies, so that detailed criteria could be laid down which would say exactly what these bodies must tell this House about what they are doing, on a basis which will enable some form of cost benefit analysis on the effectiveness of these expenditures to be made by Members of this House.

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to question all these matters in his own way.  One of the reasons for finding ourselves most frequently running into budget deficits of a much larger amount than was originally planned at the outset of the year has been the facility with which Supplementary Estimates can be introduced.  Batches of Supplementary Estimates representing hundreds of millions of pounds were passed through this House, without any endeavour to inquire where the money was to come from, in the course of an hour or two on the last day before Christmas.  That is not proper public financing.  All that expenditure is immediately financed, not by taxation, but by borrowing.  There is no scrutiny either as to whether the expenditure was justified or whether it should be financed by new taxation or by borrowing. I would like to move towards the situation where a price tag would be attached to Supplementary Estimates and where the House would have a choice as to whether it would prefer these measures to be financed solely by borrowing &mdash; thereby enlarging the deficit which had originally been agreed &mdash; or whether they should be financed by some form or revenue. We must change the way in which documents are presented so that the House will have that choice which now is not even put to it, in the present format of Supplementary Estimates.  That is something which we should redress at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the House will forgive me for dwelling at such length on these ideas. As I said in the Budget Statement, it is not sufficient for us on this side of the House &mdash; and I certainly do not think it would be sufficient for me as Minister for Finance &mdash; to eloquently deplore the situation <Col N="1247" /> which we have inherited and condemn the politicians who have been, or are, responsible for it, without putting forward proposals which would ensure that it would not happen again.  This democratic &mdash; and I emphasise the word democratic &mdash; control on Government spending will have the effect of ensuring that the situation which we have inherited will not recur.  Having discussed these measures in this fairly extensive fashion in the House, I hope that we shall be able to reach a substantial level of agreement on a reform of the Oireachtas in this area, so as to enable all of us to do our work better than we have been able to do it in the past.</P>
    <P>The next item is, perhaps, not so agreeable to the Opposition.  It is the inconsistency in the criticisms which have been expressed on this budget.  Some Opposition members say that this is not the time to act in the manner in which we have acted, thereby implying that there is another time &mdash; perhaps next January &mdash; when one should act in the way in which we have acted.  Then there are Opposition members who simply do not recognise that there is a problem at all and suggest that no action whatsoever is necessary in regard to a budget deficit which is running at the existing level. There are other members of the Opposition Party who say we were right to act now.  I would have thought that, after four years in Government, which confers a lot of information, people learning a lot from being in Government, the Members opposite would at least have been able, if not to do anything about the problem, because manifestly they did not, at least to reach some common view on what the problem was and how it should be approached.  They might perhaps lack the courage to implement that common view but, quite clearly, there was no common view about the extent of our problems, or the timing and nature of the action which should be taken to remedy them. This must be distressing.  It would be better if we on this side of the House faced consistent criticism from the Opposition. That would put us under greater pressure to do our job properly.  We now <Col N="1248" /> have an Opposition which, in the matter of perhaps the second most important issue facing this country &mdash; the economy &mdash; is facing in three different directions at once.  That is neither good for them nor for this House.  I would urge them, in the relaxing months of summer to which we all look forward &mdash; and I am glad to have the opportunity of making the last speech here to this House as we face into a welcome respite from our labours &mdash; to spend a little time, now that they have the leisure, to work out their economic policy over the next few months.  If they do that, when the House resumes not only will they do their job better but they might help us to do ours better, even better than we would otherwise do it.</P>

      <P>No convincing argument was put forward by the party opposite as to why we should not have acted now. Some seem to suggest &mdash; and Deputy Fitzgerald was amongst them &mdash; that one should not really have supplementary budgets at all, that we should have a budget at the beginning of the year and that is all.  If that is the Deputy's view, fine, but I believe that the Deputy also said in the course of his contribution that we should be flexible in our approach to economic policy.  Surely it is the complete antithesis of flexibility to have one budget in the year and, no matter what happens after that, not to change anything until 12 months later.  That is the very antithesis of economic and fiscal flexibility.  If I had to choose between the two extremes expressed by the Deputy opposite, I would certainly choose the option of flexibility. One must face the situation as one finds it, even if it is different from what <Col N="1249" /> one anticipated would be the case two months previously.  The Government are right in acting quickly to face the situation as it comes and not waiting until next January.</P>
      <P>An area in which reform could be made constructively would be one where we could see how we could more appropriately fine tune our economy throughout the fiscal year so that deficits will not creep up on us, almost without our knowing it, without action being taken.  It is possible to foresee these deficits well in advance.  If the Government had been adequately scrutinising the weekly Exchequer returns published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> they could have seen a month or two in advance the very serious over-runs that were occurring, and which became so blatantly obvious in the Exchequer return figures published on 30 June.</P>
      <P>If the Government had paid attention to the figures available, it would have been possible for them to take the action we are now taking to put the situation right.  Or, if they criticise the mix of measures we put forward, they could have brought forward their own mix of measures because through the weekly Exchequer return figures all the information we have was available, but the Government chose not to act.  They chose to wait until after the election.  We need a much closer monitoring of expenditure trends throughout the year, with the possibility of taking quick remedial action in this House to maintain the original balance of the budget as set for the year, rather than having to wait for a budget, with all the attendant drama that has grown up in the past around budgets, whether they be supplementary or annual.</P>
      <P>A fantastic mystique has been created around budgets when all they are is an exercise in housekeeping.  We need to have another look at this to see if we could devise procedures where one could respond more quickly to the type of situation we now face.</P>

      <P>By way of elaboration, would the Minister accept that the flexibility he is talking about might also include additional expenditures during <Col N="1250" /> the year, and not just cutting back expenditure?</P>

      <P>In other words, over-runs on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that any over-runs that occur should be previously sanctioned.  The decision to sanction that expenditure should be made in public in this House.  This did not happen in the case of the current over-runs we found.  Many of them had been committed before the Supplementary Estimates were presented to the House.  We passed a number of Supplementary Estimates some time ago which were retrospectively sanctioning expenditure which had been already spent by the previous Government.  That is not a satisfactory situation.  I would like to see a situation where one could respond quickly to an up-coming situation.  That is something we should look at in the reform of financial procedures in this House and, as I said, I hope we will achieve a measure of co-operation from all parties on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Opposition referred to this budget as monetarist.  I am not very sure if the Opposition spokesman who used this word studied monetarism in any depth. One believes he has not because the essential tenet of monetarism is that if one gets the money supply right almost everything else automatically falls into place.  Monetarism has no time for a planned approach to economic management by an active Government.  It has no time for the idea of elaborating an incomes policy with wage and price norms which the Government relay into concerted action in order to bring down inflation.  Monetarists do not believe that has any effect.  They say all you need do is turn on or off the tap of the money supply and automatically everything will fall into place.  In my view, monetarism is a naive and optimistic approach to economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economics is concerned with the management of people and their affairs.  Simply turning on or off the money supply <Col N="1251" /> does not enable one to manage a country, and I do not believe that is an approach we should follow.  In fact, it is almost the direct antithesis of the approach of this Government.  We lay special stress on the need to have a concerted centralised incomes policy which controls, within agreed limits, the growth in money incomes.  We believe in the publication of advance plans for the economy, setting out targets for particular sectors and setting out the measures the Government will deliberately choose to achieve those targets.  Our approach as a Government is almost the complete opposite of the monetarist approach.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the party opposite are merely attaching the monetarist label to this Government not because they have any conviction one way or the other about monetarism but because they have twigged the idea that monetarism is in some way connected with Mrs. Thatcher and Mrs. Thatcher is a bad thing.  If you call you opponents monetarists, you can somehow get it into people's minds that maybe they have something to do with Mrs. Thatcher, and that might create the idea that they are not such a good crowd after all.</P>
    <P>This exercise in very subtle and deep thinking by the party opposite lay behind the former Taoiseach's speech where he used this term eight times.  Goebbels had the principle that if you repeat a lie often enough people will eventually believe it. He used to repeat lies very often.  I think the present Leader of the Opposition was thinking along the same lines when he said &ldquo;If I call them monetarists often enough, eventually people who have not studied monetarism, just as I have not, will eventually begin to believe that maybe they are monetarists and have something to do with Mrs. Thatcher, and we certainly do not like her.  Therefore maybe they are bad too&rdquo;.  I do not think that is going to work.</P>
    <P>People will judge our policy by results. They will judge our financial situation by the figures.  The financial situation clearly indicates that economists, whether they be inspired by Keynesianism, Friedmanism. Professor Alan Walters theories or <Col N="1252" /> the theories of any other economist &mdash; I could give a list of economists as long as Deputy Haughey's arm who have different theories &mdash; would all agree that where you have a budget deficit of the size we inherited, you have to take action there and then.  All the economists, from Marshall on, would support this Government in the economic policies we have introduced.</P>
    <P>The one man I expected to support us was the man who went on television in January 1980 and told us we were living beyond our means, borrowing too much. Having solemnly told us this he proceeded to live even further beyond our means.  He borrowed even more.  I do not know if he believed what he was saying in January or whether he did not have the guts to carry through the logic of his own words, that is something only he knows.  I think the public have passed judgment on that matter and there is no point in going back on it.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise, and even the Leader of the Opposition recognised this at a time when our deficit was far smaller, that action should have been taken but it was not.  It was left to us to take action.  We did not dither for two years, we acted within three weeks.  That is the sort of Government we want in this country, a Government prepared to take decisions quickly, as one commentator said, a Government prepared to take the ball and run with it.  We are a Government who are prepared to take the ball that was passed to us on 30 June.  We have been running with it ever since and we will be running with it for the next five years.  We will score very often.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned already what I perceive to be a certain degree of inconsistency on the other side of the House. They first said this budget was deflationary <Col N="1253" /> and then said it was inflationary.  I am not quite sure what they meant by that, but it indicated that they were not too sure what the budget was or how to analyse it.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the very important area of employment.  The party opposite tried to suggest that this Government did not do anything for employment.  The first necessity for the preservation of employment is a solvent Exchequer.  A bankrupt Exchequer cannot do anything for anyone and unfortunately that is the direction in which we were heading.  If trends had continued as they were any Government would be unable to do anything about employment because we would no longer be running our own affairs.  A banker from Washington would be in the Department of Finance telling the Government what they could or could not do. A bankrupt economy is not one to which the unemployed could look with any hope.</P>
      <P>The Government have taken a number of very precise steps to help create more employment.  We allocated £30 million more for local authority housing.  We have taken steps to reduce the costs of industry which is competing with products from abroad and on the export markets by reducing the tax on heavy oil used in that industry.  We have also indicated that we intend to reduce PRSI costs for the same type of industry.  That will protect employment in the exposed sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>We have provided substantial additional sums for agriculture.  This is one of the major contributors to employment, both directly and indirectly.  In a situation where farmers' incomes are reduced by half, employment in agriculture-related industry will also fall.  Our Government have provided a substantial sum for an injection into increased production in agriculture.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Agriculture has been singularly successful in negotiations this week in Brussels.  He obtained agreement for proposals and we will provide substantial matching support from our own resources.  He is to be congratulated on the manner in which he conducted those negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> We have also taken steps to establish a Youth Employment Agency because we recognise that there is a need properly to co-ordinate the various efforts which have been made under the aegis of different Departments in order to alleviate the problem of youth unemployment.  At present two or three youth employment schemes are being administered by different Government Departments, all of which are supposed to achieve the same objective but which have entirely different administrative procedures.  People trying to avail of public funds are faced with a maze of labyrinthine paths before they can reach a decision as to how to take action.  We want to give dynamic leadership in this area and we are particularly anxious to ensure that the jobs created will as far as possible be productive and sustainable, not jobs which will require continued support from the tax-payer but jobs which once established will remain viable of their own strength.</P>
    <P>The party opposite also referred to the problem of prices and said that the increase in indirect taxation would raise the cost of living.  We have not attempted to gainsay that in the course of this debate.  A serious cause of inflation in recent times has been the downward slide of our currency <i>vis-a-vis</i> the dollar and sterling.  This is a slide which we have shared with other EMS countries.  It has been particularly reflected in a very substantial increase in our oil bill because the price is denominated in dollars.  We propose by putting the Government's finances right to ensure that the balance of payments deficit will be narrower and that the currency will be stronger and therefore one of the fundamental causes of inflation will be removed.</P>
    <P>One cannot cure inflation simply by treating the symptoms; one must treat the disease.  One of the generating factors of this disease has been the downward slide of our currency, ultimately attributable to poor management of public finances.  We are, therefore, addressing one of the core causes of inflation.</P>
    <P>Another core cause of inflation has been that nominal income increases have well exceeded increases in production.  If we pay ourselves more in money terms <Col N="1255" /> without producing more in volume terms the purchasing power of the £ will go down and there will be inflation.  This budget, by taking measures particularly in the area of public sector pay, is putting an anchor &mdash; a strength &mdash; into the wage negotiation process.  In recent times the most common cause of inflationary increases in income has been the lack of will by the Government at the negotiating table.  During the talks which led to the recent national understanding it was the Government who put pressure on the employers to concede larger settlements than they may have wished.  The measures we have taken will provide a baseline which will give strength, not only to the Government but to all those engaged in negotiations in this area and ensure that increases which are granted are real, that people will be able to buy more with the money they receive.  In the past this was not the case.</P>
    <P>We have also taken steps to guarantee that the cost of certain basic foodstuffs will not be allowed to increase at all.  By virtue of a policy of consumer subsidies the weakest section of the community will be protected against inflation by keeping those prices down.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism has made available additional subsidies to enable the price of margarine not to be increased in line with actual increases in costs.</P>
    <P>I now refer to a point of considerable <Col N="1256" /> seriousness when related to the need for continuing effective Government. Reflections have been made &mdash; I have in mind a particular journal &mdash; on the integrity of certain officials in the Department of Finance in the matter of the preparation of figures used in various documents both by this Government and the previous Government.  By virtue of the fact that these figures did not seem to correspond in some ways, it was felt that there was a reflection on the competence of the officials concerned.  This is not the case. The figures are prepared by people of a very high competence and it is not proper to cast reflections on them.  If documents published by the Government contain information which is not correct or if Government Ministers make projections as to inflation or any other matter which subsequently prove not to be correct, the people who should take responsibility under the ministerial system which operates here are not the public officials who prepare them but the Minister who accepts those figures and publishes them. If I am proved wrong in any of the figures I have produced, as I am sure I will be in some instances, I hope I will take responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>This is not only a courageous budget but a very necessary one and on that basis I am confident that it will obtain the support not only of this House but of the country.</P>

      <P>Absenteeism is acknowledged as a problem not only in this country but throughout Europe and North America and in developing countries as well.  Experience suggests that the best hope of success in dealing with it lies in management initiatives supported by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>The parties to the national pay agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employer organisations recognise that in some employments the level of absenteeism is a cause of concern.  The agreement provides that &ldquo;in such instances the employers and trade unions involved should seek to agree on arrangements to reduce the level of unnecessary absenteeism&rdquo;.  Having identified alcohol consumption as a significant factor in absences from work, the Steering Committee of the Employer Labour Conference is at present considering the establishment of a joint working party to assess the effects of the abuse of alcohol on industry and business.  I would hope that, in the light of these discussions and any changes made arising from them, it will be feasible to have other causes of absenteeism discussed in similar fashion, at national level and at the level of the enterprise.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been made to provide kiosks at Tirellan Heights and Castlelawn Heights which, in addition to meeting the needs of these specific areas, will also serve the locality generally, including Sandyvale Lawns.  A kiosk would not be justified at Sandyvale Lawns at present based on existing criteria but with the further developments envisaged in the area, one may be warranted there later.  The position will be kept under review.  I might add that kiosks have already been approved for some 800 centres meeting the existing criteria and it will clearly take time to provide all of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is considerable public disquiet in the matter.  The Coroners Act, 1962, provides that, in cases when death may have occurred suddenly and from unknown causes, a coroner may cause a <i>post mortem</i> examination of the body to be held and, if, in his opinion, the report of the examination shows that an inquest in relation to the death is unnecessary it shall not be obligatory on him to hold an inquest.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that in most cases of `cot deaths' coroners exercise their discretion not to hold an inquest and that appears to me to be reasonable.  There may be, of course, circumstances where a coroner may consider an inquest to be desirable.  Naturally, I have no power to direct a coroner not to hold an inquest in any particular case.</P>

      <P>Under the voluntary restraint agreement on sheepmeat between New Zealand and the European Community imports from New Zealand to the Community are limited <Col N="1106" /> to 245,000 tonnes annually.  This voluntary restraint agreement, which will remain in force until 31 March 1984, also provides that imports from New Zealand into particular markets of the Community deemed to be sensitive must be limited to traditional quantities.  For purposes of the agreement both the Irish and French markets have been classified as sensitive.  As there has been no traditional trade in New Zealand sheepmeat with this country the question of imports under the agreement does not arise.</P>

      <P>Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which Ireland is a party, diplomatic agents in Ireland enjoy immunity from the criminal, civil and administrative jurisdiction of the State.  This immunity includes immunity from jurisdiction in relation to parking offences.  The same immunities are enjoyed by members of the families of diplomatic agents, and, except in the case of acts performed outside the course of their official duties, similar immunities are enjoyed by the administrative and technical staffs of diplomatic missions.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Vienna Convention provides that it is the duty of all persons enjoying such immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State, and I am quite satisfied that foreign diplomats resident in Dublin give due regard to this provision.  This is borne out by the fact that, to take last year as an example, the 358 diplomatic agents in Dublin, their families and staffs, claimed immunity in respect of only 141 alleged parking offences.</P>

Effect is given to them in Irish law by the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.  They were ratified on behalf of Ireland on 13 September 1962 and entered into force for Ireland on 27 March 1963.

Provisional figures for 1980 indicate that 561 persons were killed and 8,204 injured.  This compares with 614 killed and 8,250 injured in 1979 and represents a downward trend.  The latest available figures for 1981, which are again provisional, indicate that in the first five months of the year, 201 persons were killed and 3,088 were injured.

      <P>The provision, operation and maintenance of public water supplies in the areas mentioned by the Deputy are primarily matters for Dun Laoghaire Corporation and Dublin County Council. However, I have had inquiries made of the relevant local authorities and am informed that the position is as follows: Dun Laoghaire Corporation report that while complaints are received from individuals in the borough, from time to time, they generally relate to specific faults which are quickly remedied.  There does not appear to be any general problem in Dun Laoghaire Borough relating to significant lack of pressure or supply of water for domestic use.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council concede that due to the huge increase in population there are water supply problems in parts of those areas which are in the county particularly in high areas and at the ends of the present supply system.  The council have formulated proposals &mdash; the Rathmichael water supply scheme &mdash; which will substantially improve the local water storage and distribution system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that working drawings are in preparation for the most urgent of <Col N="1112" /> the improvements in the water distribution system.  Contract documents for a new reservoir at Rathmichael with a storage capacity of 2.31 million gallons were received by my Department from Dublin County Council on 23 July 1981 and are under examination.

In the absence of a completed claim form giving particulars of his dependants he was paid benefit for this period at the rate appropriate to a single man.  A form on which to claim for dependants which issued to him on 31 March 1981 has not been returned.  A duplicate claim has been issued to him and on return of the completed form any adjustment payment due for his dependants will be issued immediately.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 5 May 1980 and was paid at the rate appropriate to a married man with three qualified children to 11 May 1981 when he exhausted his title to the 52 weeks' benefits to which he is entitled as a person having less than 156 paid contributions to his credit.  He subsequently claimed in respect of an additional child born on 24 April 1981 and a cheque for the arrears of benefit due in respect of this child to 11 May 1981 issued on 3 June 1981.</P>
      <P>Where a claimant has 26 but less than 156 contributions paid in respect of insurable employment his title to benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  As he has a total of only 80 contributions paid since his entry into insurance he cannot qualify for further payment of benefit until he has at least 13 weeks of insurable employment registered on his behalf subsequent to the date of last payment of benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 May 1981 and has been paid at the maximum appropriate rate from 21 May, fourth day of incapacity.  All payment due to 18 July has been made.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.  The delay in payment is due mainly to the fact that he is quoting his insurance number only on the medical certificates submitted in support of his claim.  He has been notified of his RSI number and has been requested to quote both his insurance number and the RSI number on all medical certificates in future.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit continuously since February 1976 and is normally paid on the same day each week but medical evidence is required at monthly intervals only.  Payment was made on this basis up to 27 June 1981 when the cheque prepared for issue to him was mutilated and it was necessary to make special arrangements for the issue of the payment due for that week. However the question of restoring him to the original method of payment was overlooked and payment ceased.  The matter has since been rectified and all benefit due has been issued to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 5 January 1981 in respect of an incapacity which he alleged was due to an accident at work on 18 November 1980.  Pending investigation of the claim, he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis for the period from 5 January to 31 January 1981, when he was certified fit to resume work.  A cheque for the amount of pay-related benefit for the period from 15 January, 13th day of incapacity, to 31 January 1981 was issued on 24 March 1981.  Following completion of inquiries regarding the nature and origin of his incapacity, injury benefit has been allowed from 1 January 1981 and all injury benefit due, less the amount of disability benefit paid on an interim basis, has been issued.</P>
