      <P>&mdash;&mdash;today, I do not propose to press the point of order further on this matter.  But I point out to the Chair, as a point of order, that its decision to agree to the reversal of the order of speakers last night, in putting in Deputy Ryan in advance of Deputy Lenihan was done for the specific and stated purpose of enabling Deputy Lenihan to conclude and that, therefore, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was not in order in suggesting that the matter be adjourned.</P>

There is either an agreement to a three-and-a-half-hour debate, which the whole country knows there was and the Chair knows there was, in which case the three-and-a-half hours is up and the vote must be taken at 2 o'clock, or there is no such agreement, in which case the debate does not conclude after the Minister, but can continue.  There is no possible Order of the House or Standing Order under which the Chair may conclude the debate after three hours and forty minutes, and the Chair knows that.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1981: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night and again this morning we had a great deal of noise over an issue which many people would not consider to be the most important issue today.  The noise and confusion in this House did not hit the headlines, but today's headlines must concern the Minister. As I said yesterday, the Minister for Social Welfare is a failure.  He has failed, as his predecessor failed, to bring the Department up to 1981 standards.  He has failed to provide for the aged, the infirm and those dependent on the social welfare cheques they are supposed to receive.  Today people on social welfare are worse off than they were six or 12 months ago and are very much worse off than they ere four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister took the advice I gave him yesterday to compare the prices on the everyday shopping lists of the old age pensioners, widows and many others with the average increases granted by this Government over the past four budgets.  If he does that he will find that many of these people are living well below the bread line and are far worse off in real terms than they were four years ago.  If he made those calculations last night, he will have to do them again today because, as is reported in the press, we have had a mini-budget.  Petrol has been increased by 12p per gallon.  It can be said that the price of petrol does not affect the old age pensioner, the widow <Col N="1502" /> or the unemployed.  Of course, if does.  It affects everybody.</P>
    <P>A Deputy on the Government side referred yesterday to Opposition complaints regarding the budget and made some comparison with the budget introduced this week in Britain.  Let him make that comparison today.  Our budget increase in the price of petrol was not the end of the story.  Today's newspapers report another mini-budget, following the mini-budget introduced a week before the actual budget which massively increased the price of coal and bread. Those on social welfare benefits have not yet been compensated for these increases.</P>
    <P>Some minutes ago I was highly amused that the loud laughter from the Government benches regarding remarks on the neutrality issue came from the Minister for Social Welfare.  One would think he was doing the job he was appointed to do and that he was happy in his position.  I call on the Taoiseach to consider even at this late stage the appointment of a Minister for Social Welfare holding that portfolio only.  The Taoiseach himself formerly held the posts of Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health and there were appeals from this side of the House, and even some words from the Government side, that a Minister be appointed to the Department of Social Welfare alone.</P>
    <P>It is now over a year since junior Ministers were appointed who have very little to do.  We seldom, if ever, hear from them.  The Taoiseach almost appointed Ministers for dog licences.  The Department of Social Welfare look after the less well-off in our society and those who cannot provide for themselves and who are not highly organised.  Nobody would dream of putting the Department of Agriculture with another Department because there would be protest marches in every town and village.  Because the Department of Social Welfare deal with old age pensioners, widows and the unemployed who have not a loud voice, the Taoiseach has chosen to treat them in a manner which is not fitting.  I am sure he could find another person in his party willing to take on the responsibility of <Col N="1503" /> cleaning up the Department of Social Welfare and ensuring that those entitled to benefits received them on time.</P>
    <P>Many of those who have been waiting for weeks to receive their benefits will wonder what is going on in this House when they hear reports in the media of the happenings of last night and this morning.  What course is the country taking? I hope the Minister will have something new to tell us when replying to this debate so that we can give some reassurance to those of our constituents who are social welfare recipients.  Such people form the major part of the queue coming to see politicians and I am sure the Minister and his colleagues have similar experience.</P>
    <P>If the Minister gives us some reassurance, can we depend on it?  It is not long since he told us that the difficulties in his Department had been straightened out. He had admitted that there were mistakes in the Department and he used the postal strike as an excuse for the nondelivery of cheques.  He made use of that excuse for longer than was popular.  Then he admitted that there were delays because of a change in reference numbers and the introduction of computerisation. These were supposed to have been straightened out.  The junior Minister issued a statement, I forget the date of it, saying that this had been done and that we could expect a free run as far as payment of benefits was concerned.  That has not happened and I should like him to explain why he gave the impression that he had straightened out the Department. Public representatives receive more complaints about non-payment of social welfare cheques than ever before and this without a Cork by-election or postal strike.  I wonder what the Minister's excuse will be now.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme allowance has been increased to £3 but it is totally inadequate. We were very lucky that we had such a mild winter.  This helped to keep heating costs down and contributed to the conservation of energy.  The mild winter is what saved many people from freezing in their homes and not the Minister's <Col N="1504" /> miserable allowance of £3.  A few years ago recipients of a fuel voucher were far better off when it was for 1 cwt. of turf. However, by the looks of things they are better off today than they will be in October unless the Minister increases the fuel voucher today.</P>
    <P>Most of those entitled to the allowance, even those in the Minister's own constituency, use bottled gas and they are faced this morning with an increase of 76p in the price of a cylinder of gas. We no longer have increases of 1p, 2p, 3p or 6p on commodities but are rapidly approaching the stage where we have £1 increases.  Can the Minister imagine the inroads that the increase on a cylinder of gas will make on his fuel allowance which was totally inadequate before this?  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;in case the Taoiseach takes up the appeal I made to him to appoint a Minister for Social Welfare without any other strings attached&mdash;to have another look at the free fuel scheme and sort it out before he moves from that Department.  The Taoiseach did not pay a great deal of attention to the Department of Social Welfare when he was Minister, so perhaps it would be too much to expect him to appoint a Minister for Social Welfare.  There are many Members, both on this side and on the Minister's side of the House, who feel this Department is deserving of a Minister's full attention.</P>

      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to arrange for the prompt payment of these increases and to forget the Department of Health for a few days and his big public relations deal.  I would say he surpasses the Taoiseach in public relations ability.  I hope he will take people off the starvation line.  At the moment they cannot get their entitlements from the Department.  They are having a hard time as it is without having to endure delays.  I do not consider that these increases have kept pace with inflation and we have seen another illustration of that today with further price increases.  I am sure we will see further major price increases in benefits reach those who are entitled to them.  I do not want to mention the commodities in case I would tempt the manufacturers to apply for price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January there were increases in the cost of butter, bread and sugar.  If the 25 per cent increase in social welfare allowances had been granted last November it would probably have brought up the standard of living of social welfare recipients to what it was in January 1980. Benefits given to old age pensioners in the last budget should have been available to them no later than three or four weeks after the budget.  The sad fact is that many old age pensioners will not live to receive the increased benefit.  Last year I appealed to the Minister to reduce the time lag between announcement of an increase and payment.  With all the computerisation and modern technology that exists, it should not be beyond the capacity of the Department to do this.  I repeat <Col N="1510" /> my appeal to the Minister to do something about this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take notice of the points made during this debate.  I have a grave suspicion that to date the Minister has not taken seriously his responsibilities as Minister for Social Welfare.  If we have not a change of Minister in the near future, at least let us hope there will be a change of attitude on the Minister's part.  Perhaps he does not get the same press out of social welfare matters as he does out of health matters, although I do not see why that should be the case.  He is a good man at working up publicity.  Even though very many people are not social welfare recipients themselves, they are very concerned about the aged, those who have given service to the nation and widows.  The state should do everything possible to assist them.</P>

The Minister stated clearly that if he does not get this Bill quite soon implementation of the increases will be held up.  The Opposition have been told the position quite clearly.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is, he is not in the House.  It is extraordinary that somebody should accuse us of endeavouring to hold up payments.  I will not deal with that in detail but will just point out it is not true.  I appeal to those who say they believe that accusation to accept our integrity in this matter.  There is validity in an opposition making contributions to a debate like this.  It is not our desire to hold up payment or delay implementation of the proposed increases.  Our concern, voiced very strongly during the week, on delays existing in the system is testimony to that.  The suggestion just made is a mischievous one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should prefer to deal as constructively <Col N="1512" /> as possible with the proposals before the House.  The way increases in social welfare benefits are presented at regular intervals underlines a myth that is propagated by government about social welfare recipients and the payment to be made to them.  The myth is that we are genuinely endeavouring to improve their lot, but the facts do not bear that out.  In fact, the reverse is the truth and I will show that clearly and without emotion, based on cold, factual logic.</P>
    <P>I want to make three suggestions that I consider essential.  They should be included in the Bill and the Minister may reply to them if he wishes.  For example, there can be no doubt that the proposed increases have been completely overshadowed by the daily increase in the cost of essential commodities for people on social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>We have another mini-budget today. The cost involved to the person on social welfare as part of a pattern of continual price increases clearly shows that the increases proposed in this Bill are not enough.  The increases in this morning's announcement included 76p on a cylinder of gas, bringing the new price in the 550,000 homes which use that gas to £5.68p.  We know from researches, our own experience and commonsense that old people, many of whom are badly nourished, need at least decent heating. How can the Minister for Social Welfare justify the attitude the Government are adopting in relation to the increases proposed in the budget without reference to the increasing costs of living and heating?</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments are unjust if they are not index-linked.  It is scandalous for a Minister for Social Welfare or a Government to blindly go about, head in the air, pretending there is a 25 per cent increase for social welfare recipients when that increase is not enough to deal with one-and-a-half year's inflation because that increase is spread over a two year period.  There was an announcement this morning of a 20 per cent increase in ESB charges and an all time high in relation to the gallon of petrol.  The cumulative effect of any increase in the price of petrol is passed on to the cost of living index and consumer prices.  I imagine, on <Col N="1513" /> a rough calculation, that the increase proposed this morning will probably add I per cent to the cost of living index.  The increase in the budget was of the same order.  The cumulative effect of such increases, by the time they get down to the loaf of bread, the half pound of butter and the bag of coal, will make a major impact on the meagre subsistence of many people on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to introduce index-linking of social welfare increases.  I accept the Minister wants to do a good job and I believe that in part he is doing a good job.  We understand the constraints on him, but at the same time there is a touch of the superficial about the way things are being handled in that area at the present time.  One gets the impression that the surface features are being handled well but nothing is changing at heart.  It takes more than a little neck from the Members opposite to suggest that we have somehow a vested interest in holding up payments, which are not due to be paid for the next three weeks, when we have seen the spectacle over the last couple of weeks of the Minister pathetically admitting that the longest ever delays in the payment of cheques are causing him concern and he is working on this.  Let people in glasshouses not throw stones.</P>
    <P>The second request I have for the Minister is to introduce a subsidy for essential commodities for people in this category. I am talking about light, food and the cost of accommodation.  The three survival needs are food, heating and shelter. Those areas are causing concern to a large number of people.  There is no way round the problem if there is not a new resource commitment in this respect. Minor or major increases on a very small base in relation to social welfare recipients will not make a significant impact in this area.  We want to ensure that the old age pensioner and the person on social welfare does not have to open his morning paper, if he can afford to buy one, with fear in his heart wondering what new increases will erode his very small income.</P>
    <P>Index-linking is very essential.  It is vital as well, wherever a private company <Col N="1514" /> consider it necessary, or where the National Prices Commission consider it necessary, to impose increases in the cost of essential items, that certain categories of vulnerable sections of our society are cushioned against those increases.  This is supposed to be a Christian country, and sometimes we even say it is a just one.  It is clear in the wake of this morning's mini-budget that any pretence at price control has gone out the window, that the lavish promises of the manifesto in relation to what would happen in the prices area, the overhaul of the National Prices Commission and this that and the other have also gone out of the window.  The most vulnerable section of the community are being hardest hit.  The reason is that the Government operate on the basis of putting their finger in the air, seeing what way the wind is blowing and bowing to the strongest lobby.</P>
    <P>In the economic area as well as in the social welfare area the Government's policies have been dictated exclusively by political expediency.  They have conceded every claim, yielded to every pressure and given in right, left and centre. They have left the country in a shambles. There is not any great pressure from social welfare recipients because they are not organised and too many of them are mobile and have not got roots in the community and a strong voting block.  A measure of a nation is the manner in which it deals with those who are not strong enough to insist on their rights, who depend on wisdom, justice and good government to give them a fair share of what is going.  We are far down the league if that is the criterion.</P>
    <P>The third thing I want this morning, which I suggest with some trepidation, is a formal inquiry or a commission set up immediately to get rid of the anomalies the Minister admitted earlier are involved in social welfare and to try to bring about, as urgently as possible and with goodwill from all sides of the House, genuine progress in this area rather than papering over the cracks and pretending that real progress is being made when we all know it is not.  This morning's mini-budget will add 4 per cent to 5 per cent <Col N="1515" /> of an increase to the cost of living of people on social welfare when it has worked its way through the economy, but no allowance is being made and no increase is being given on figures which were deemed to be, even by the most impartial observers, just enough to keep pace with last year's inflation.  Even using the cost of living index is not an appropriate criterion in respect of the people in this category.  The cost of living index is a relatively wide and comprehensive yardstick which includes aspects of living costs not applicable in many social welfare cases.</P>
    <P>There is need for fundamental action and I should like to explain why.  Despite the fact that we pretend that things have changed for the better, the reality is that for many people on social welfare things have got worse.  The kernel of judgment in this respect is not the precentage increase or, indeed, the amount of money.  The Minister is fond of referring to the fact that so much extra money is being given to such people.  That is a misleading approach and one which is open to great distortion.  The key to it is to view increases and actual figures in the context of other economic criteria, to see them relative to what other costs have been and compare the table to see what progress has been made.  If that is the criteria I should like to demonstrate how things have got worse.</P>
    <P>With one exception the relative position of families dependent on social welfare, especially those with children, has disimproved considerably since 1973 relative to those in receipt of industrial earnings. Since 1973 onwards people in the social welfare category have disimproved in terms of their income.  Even more startling is the size of the gap between the less-well-off and those on average incomes.  In general, single beneficiaries get between one-fifth and one-quarter of average male industrial earnings while married couples with two children get less than half these average earnings. Those with four children get only slightly more than one-half.  It is important to remember that in any discussion on social welfare increases.  It is important when <Col N="1516" /> we look at the horrific, savage increases we learned of this morning: 76p on a cylinder of gas that a few years ago cost less than 76p.  The increase on that product in one morning is 76p.  We must remember the proportion of the high share of income that must be spent by poor families on food, often about 50 per cent and sometimes higher, but yet when the Government came to power they removed the already slight food subsidies that existed.  I do not accept that there is concern in Government ranks or, certainly, by the Minister.  There is not true concern about the social welfare people because it is not reflected in the actions of the Government.</P>
    <P>The real value of children's allowances, of which the Minister has made so much play, has fallen since 1973&mdash;a fact. The real value of child tax allowances has fallen over a much longer period&mdash;a fact. A study done for a child poverty action group in the UK estimated that in May 1980 the minimum cost of raising children ranged from £7.86 per week for a child of two to £11.55 per week for a child of 11.  Obviously, one cannot automatically compare both but there are major similarities. If we do a rough comparison we find that the Irish rate of children's allowances, the comparable figure, is less than one-quarter of that.  We should bear in mind that I am not including the fact that the UK figures are in sterling.  Is the Irish child worth no more than one quarter of the UK child?  I do not believe it is.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to accept the pleas of certain farming and producing organisations to avail immediately of the opportunity arising at EEC level for the introduction here of a scheme of free milk to Irish school children. The Minister is aware&mdash;I certainly am aware in the areas I am privileged to represent&mdash;of the fact that there are many children going to school hungry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister, if he is not aware of that point.  If he does not accept it I should like to tell him that three years ago I asked the Minister for <Col N="1517" /> the Environment to accompany me on a tour of my constituency and, although he promised by letter that he would, he has not done so.  The Minister of State does not accept that statement because he does not know it happens.  Some children go to school hungry.  If the Minister of State has any doubt about that he should ring the school attendance department of Dublin Corporation this morning, or ring any school attendance officer or teacher in the city and he will be told that that happens.  I am not suggesting that it is a national phenomenon, but it is happening. If the Minister is agreeable there is a possibility of facilitating Irish school children, in the social welfare situation in particular, with a modest opportunity of getting a degree of protein, some milk daily at a very small cost.  The Government have refused to accept that offer which has been made available to them. It is a shame that they should have done that.  It is not too late to take it up.  Not alone would it be good for the children but it would be good for the economy also, and we need that.</P>
      <P>The people who are hit most in this area are the elderly.  Frankly, I have never understood why it is that we expect people who have given their lives to the State when they reach 60 or 65 to suddenly accept, lamb-like and without demur, their passing into retirement&mdash;if not into oblivion&mdash; and also a marked decline in their living standards which they have worked for.  To some extent it is reminiscent of the attitude I saw in East Berlin earlier this year where people are released from that gigantic prison only when they become 65 and are a burden on the State.  The thinking is not dissimilar. The most scandalously treated people are the elderly and the old.  In many cases they live in hovels and exist, or subsist, in very meagre incomes.  What has the Minister to say to the person on fixed pension?  A lady who came to see me recently told me that her pension was £1.10 per week.  That woman has so calculated her budget that she has to go to bed at 11 o'clock so that the light will not be on for one extra hour.  That lady does not drink or smoke and is a good house minder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of free electricity for old people, I might make the point that many old people have great difficulty in availing of this concession.  I am referring to those who live in private rented accommodation where there is a common slot meter.  The Government, under pressure from all sides in the House, accepted the difficulties involved in such a situation and, consequently, an allowance was introduced but despite this, there remain some people who, because of fear of their landlords perhaps, are not getting the allowance.  They are afraid to send in the necessary documentation that would enable them to avail of the allowance.</P>
      <P>We all know that to go into a shop today with anything less than £5 is a waste of time.  If one buys only a few loaves of bread and a pound of butter plus a few sweets for the children, one's bill will be at least £3.  We are talking of income of about £30 in some cases.  Last week a worker came to see me.  His story is that his take-home pay is £64 per week.  He is employed as a fitter and he has a wife and four children.  This figure does not represent the average industrial earnings and I do not understand why it should be so low but in a situation of an employers' market, this man considers himself lucky to have any job.  Consequently, he is not in a position to press for higher wages.</P>

      <P>Are we still dealing with the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I cannot come here with a file full of constituency <Col N="1520" /> cases but the Minister may take it that what I am saying is fact.  I assert unequivocally that a lady has indicated to me that because of her social welfare payments being so low, she cannot afford to keep the light on in her house later than 11 p.m. at night.</P>
      <P>Despite what we are told about a general improvement for people in the social welfare category, I do not believe that there is an improvement.  Researchers can show, for example, that one-quarter of all households living on low incomes are headed by elderly persons whereas the elderly comprise only 11 per cent of the total population.  It has been shown also that households headed by elderly persons are 2.7 times more likely to be poor than are other households.  Many of these elderly people lack basic amenities. Therefore, we need, by way of the social welfare approach to complement where such deficiencies exist.  A Society of St. Vincent de Paul report, called <i>Old and Alone,</i> indicated that 30 per cent of those surveyed lacked all five basic water amenities, that is, they had not wash-hand basins, no kitchen sink, no flush toilet, no bath nor shower nor hot water.</P>
      <P>These are people who have given a life's service to the State.  We know also that people in the elderly category rely totally for heat on open fires because they can no longer afford to use even a one-bar electric fire.  These people spend at least £1 per day in each case to heat one room for 16 hours.  This represents £7 per week for a 200-day heating season.  An outlay of £7 a week represents either one-fifth or one-sixth of their incomes depending on which category one takes. It is the highest percentage spent for fuel for heating by any category in our society. We learn by way of this morning's budget that those costs are to be increased but there is not a whimper of support for these people in the budget or in the Governments bland assertions that much is being done for the less well-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since about 10 per cent of old people do not have the facility of electricity, they at least will be spared the increased cost but at what price?  Another interesting matter which I should like the commission that is being set up to inquire into <Col N="1521" /> the anomalies that exist in our system is the fact that many people fail to use their full entitlement to free units of electricity. The reasons for this should be ascertained and remedied.  Perhaps the people concerned are in fear of exceeding their quota but there may be another reason concerning those in private rented accommodation, people who are particularly vulnerable.  In the light of developments in the courts in the area of rent restrictions people in private rented accommodation are more fearful than ever.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on their excellent submission to the Government prior to the budget.  I hope that the Minister has had the opportunity of reading that document.  It emphasises that nothing fundamental has changed, that the resources distribution pattern still dictates the people classified loosely as being in the social welfare category are still in the welfare category and have no opportunity of bringing themselves out of that category, that they are being given just enough to keep their stomachs full so that they do not take to the streets.  Is the Minister aware that the unemployment benefit for those who were out of jobs in 1973 was 23.9 per cent of average disposable income?  That was for a single person. For a married couple the figure was 38 per cent and for a couple with two children, the figure was 59.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>After all the ballyhoo about improvements in this area let us consider the corresponding figures today.  When the Minister is replying I wish him to refer specifically to those relativities not vast sums of money now being spent which have not been spent previously, because that is meaningless.  It is as meaningful as the phenomenon during the last depression, of wheelbarrows of money being brought in.  It made one look wealthy, but one knew one was not because of the rampant inflation.  Talking about so many more millions than last year is not accurate. What is pertinent is the percentage in relation to other economic indicators.</P>
    <P>I have given the Minister the 1973 figure. In 1980, what is the situation?  The <Col N="1522" /> single person's unemployment benefit as a percentage of his disposable income is 23.1 per cent &mdash; that is a drop of .8 per cent compared with the 1973 figure. However, it gets worse.  What is the married couple's situation.  Their unemployment benefit as a percentage of average disposable income in 1980 is 34.2 per cent as opposed to 38 per cent in 1973.  If that couple had decided to have a family of two children, their lot is worse still.  Their level of unemployment benefit as a percentage of average disposal income is 46.6 per cent as opposed to 59.9 per cent. Who would have thought that in 1973 unemployment benefit was worth more than it is today?  Those relativities do not change, because if the Minister argues that these figures are outdistanced or outpaced by improvements about to take place or proposed, remember that we are talking about percentage of average disposable income which is going up, too, even if it is going up mainly on a huge raft of borrowed money which will sink. We will leave that aside for now.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>Let us look at unemployment assistance. In 1973, the single person's unemployment assistance as a percentage of average disposable income was 19.5 per cent, the married couple's 32.5 per cent. Again, for a married couple with two children, 52 per cent.  What are the figures for 1980?  For the single person it has decreased from 19.5 per cent in 1973 to 19.2 per cent.  For the married couple it had decreased even more, from 32.5 per cent to 29.6 per cent; and for the married couple with two children it has gone down from 52 per cent in 1973 to 40.9 per cent, a drop of almost 12 per cent.  Incredible and shameful.</P>
    <P>What is the situation with regard to the old age, non-contributory pensioner under 80?  In 1973 that person's unemployment benefit as a percentage of average disposable income was 22.4 per cent. What then, in the wake of all the ballyhoo and baloney and public relations exercise which we have had about the major new strides for old age pensioners, is the position today?  That person's benefit as a percentage of average disposable income is 23.7 per cent, an increase of 1 <Col N="1523" /> per cent.  That is some major advance for people in this category.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the overall picture in relation to family allowances for a two-child family on average earnings. How do we relate to other countries? The figure for Belgium of family allowance as a percentage of gross average earnings is 14.1 per cent, that is, the equivalent purchasing power of £842 sterling. The figure in Holland is somewhat lower, at 9.1 per cent or £589.  In Britain, the figure is 8.7 per cent, or £416.  In France, it is 8.4 per cent, or £402.  In Luxembourg &mdash; and the table is declining all the time &mdash; it is 7 per cent, or £567.  In West Germany, it is 6 per cent or £400. In Denmark, it is 3.9 per cent, or £266. In Italy &mdash; not, I think, a country that one, by and large, would want to ape in terms of their economic prowess or, indeed, their political stability &mdash; the family allowancce as a percentage of gross average earnings is 3.1 per cent, or £155. Ireland is bottom of the league, as so often.  Its figure is a shameful 2.2 per cent.  That is the brave new advance for people in the social welfare categories which this Minister heralds.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier when the Minister was not here.  I believe that this Minister wants to do a good job.  I know that he is putting in many long and hard hours and credit is due to him for that.  However, if he is to do his job properly there must be a fundamental change of heart in this Government.  The resources must be committed to people in our society who have never had a share of those resources.  No amount of cosmetic titivation will change fundamental patterns of poverty and deprivation in our society. That is the change which is necessary.  If we had any decency all of us in this House would hang our heads in shame at what some people have to live on, or survive on.  We would join together in some form of formal inquiry or grouping to undertake immediately an overhaul of the disgraceful anomalies which exist with a view to getting all-party agreement on major advances in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister has in the recent past given an undertaking to groups which he <Col N="1524" /> has not been able to honour because he has not got the money.  He has not been given the money because it is not there. How could it be there if it is being borrowed and frittered away at every hand's turn, with the Government caving in to every whim of political expediency, every demand from anyone who comes knocking at their doors?  The louder the knock, the more prompt and greater the response.  How could this Minister have more than just compassion in his heart for people on social welfare?  How could he have the resources to match it?  It is not there because it is given away to the biggest, the strongest and the loudest. Instead of that we have the occasional vague, general references to social welfare abuses.  The Minister in his budget statement referred to it again.  It meets the political need of people who believe that any attempt to recognise injustice is somehow a concession to people who are basically inferior anyhow and who preferably should be out of mind and out of sight.</P>
    <P>When last did I hear any Minister refer to the boardroom abuses, the companies with three or four sets of accounts?  When last did we hear of corruption at the other end of the scale?  What determination is there on the part of this Government to deal with that?  None, not even a gesture of public concern about it.  No, they concentrate on social welfare abuses.  I have no doubt that there are abuses and they should be stopped.  However, let nobody pretend that there are hundreds of millions of pounds, or many millions of pounds, being frittered away in abuses in this way.  There is not.  If the government tackled the abuses at the other end of the scale, abuses in company law at boardroom level, the yield economically and fiscally would be much greater.  There would, however, be very detrimental effects, particularly for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have domonstrated clearly this morning that the rate of social welfare increases in real terms, because that is what we should look at, has declined significantly during this decade. Groups like St. Vincent de Paul, ALONE, people who are trying to deal with poverty, the National Poverty Committee which this Government chopped &mdash; they know the truth.  If the Minister takes courage and appeals to the latent good and Christian instincts of Irish people and asks for their approval for resource commitment of a new order in respect of these categories, he will get support.  The Irish people have never been found wanting when an appeal of <Col N="1526" /> leadership and integrity was made.  It is right and fitting that these groups have been putting pressure on the Government. Tribute should be paid to them and to the churches because few others have held up these examples.</P>
      <P>The National Poverty Committee produced a report, which was, unfortunately, their final report.  They are the first to admit that they, like everybody else, made mistakes.  I want to ask the Minister publicly if he gave them an undertaking that the least he would do would be to make resources available to them to continue the projects they had in hand when the Government decided to get rid of the committee.  I want to know if he will clear up the existing situation with regard to the assets of that committee and the jobs involved.  These people are at present existing on social walfare payments.  I have been given reliably to understand that the Minister said that he could not guarantee the future of their organisation but he said he could ensure that existing projects, 11 of them, would be funded to their completion.  Is the Minister going to implement that undertaking and, if so, when?</P>
      <P>When we talk about social welfare payments we have to look not just at the vast sums of money, which are increasingly irrelevant and which are dwarfed by soaring inflation rates, but at the relevant figures which are the ratios between these benefits and other economic indices.  In that context the facts show that there has been a decline since 1973.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister to take at the very least the three steps I suggested, that is, to index-link social welfare payments so that increases in basic living costs can be accepted by these people without making major cutbacks in their standards of existence &mdash; nobody could call them standards of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were index-linked they would be lower than they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At present many people have to go without meat.  That should not be.  Everybody is entitled to at least a good daily meal.  I want regular index-linking which will make sure that, for example, the price increases in this morning's <Col N="1527" /> mini-budget would automatically be reflected in appropriate increases in the payments involved.  I am talking particularly about the essential commodities. Nobody expects the Government to wave a magic wand, especially during the present times of economic stringency, but I would demand this of the Minister so far as food, heating and lighting are concerned.</P>
      <P>Second, I want him to introduce a subsidy in respect of these items and recognise that there is grave hardship and fear being caused.  This subsidy could then be replaced by index-linking.  Third, I want him to set up a commission of inquiry into standards of justice in the social welfare area with particular reference to getting rid of anomalies.</P>
      <P>This is one of the areas where this Parliament should be exemplary in its behaviour and should be able to work closer towards making genuine improvements. We are talking about people who are at the bottom of what the sociologists call the pecking order.  In this respect the role of the public representative is particularly onerous because these people are not organised and in many cases are too preoccupied trying to live.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take a couragous stand in this respect, to hammer the Cabinet table, to raise funds, to commit resources and to bring about real change, because all we are doing at present is putting a cosmetic veneer on fundamental patterns of injustice which have wracked this society since its foundation. Unless they change, that injustice will not only continue but will be visited on the heads of the children whose parents were victimised.  This is a cycle of poverty and deprivation which has been in existence and which will continue to exist unless we honestly analyse how we distribute our resources and make the decision that percentage increases and the redistribution of such resources will go to those who need it.  That is not happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible.  I do not believe in statistics.  I firmly believe in the evidence presented to me by the people I meet and know. <Col N="1528" /> My principal interest in life is the social welfare scene.  The increases granted under this Bill may look good, and the Minister has boasted about them, but I want to know if we are any nearer to giving our social welfare recipients an average standard of living.  I believe we owe that to them.  The gap between the rich and the poor is widening, despite these increases.  It may be said that a 25 per cent increase is greater than the increase in the cost of living during the previous year, but mini-budgets are introduced with such frequency that increases to social welfare recipients are eroded.</P>
      <P>Almost four years after the general election Fianna Fáil have not reduced to the civilised standard of other European countries the old age pension qualifying age.  The National Coalition Government reduced it by four years in their anxiety to introduce the same standard which applies in almost every democratic country in Europe.  During 40 years of Fianna Fáil Government there has been a blank refusal to reduce the qualifying age for retirement and old age pensions.  If a decent standard of living could be assured for those in receipt of such pensions more people would be encouraged to retire, thus helping to make employment available for young people.</P>
      <P>Some people have expressed the view that the present Minister for Social Welfare is concerned and is doing his best.  I do not believe it because his actions have not indicated any concern.  The Minister has boasted about increases of 25 per cent, but the increase for dependants is only 9 per cent, half the rate of inflation. I understand it was argued yesterday by the Minister that the family allowance makes up for this, but this allowance is available to the richest in the land and does not help social welfare recipients to achieve a normal standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel a duty to talk about the chaos in the Minister's Department.  I had a question down to him on Tuesday last concerning this matter, but he was attending the funeral of one of the greatest benefactors of the poor, the Bishop of Ossory, the Most Reverend Dr. Birch.  He was one of the people who had advocated the <Col N="1529" /> setting up of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  The Minister attended his funeral and recognised Dr. Birch as a man who had the interests of the poor at heart.  However, by disbanding the committee of which the bishop was one of the instigators, the Minister showed a grave lack of concern.</P>
    <P>I wish to give details of two cases which highlight the delays in the Department of Social Welfare.  A neighbour of mine who has worked all his life was absent from work due to illness for two weeks before Christmas and two weeks afterwards.  He was not dependent on social welfare benefits to which he was justly entitled because his employer agreed to pay him during his illness on the understanding that the social welfare cheques would be given to him.  The man in question is now under serious suspicion because the cheques have not arrived, even though his card has been stamped for many years.  I brought this case to the notice of the Minister by writing to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider putting the Minister of State, Deputy Hussey, in charge of social welfare and look after health himself.  Deputy Hussey is very concerned about this whole area.  If the Minister was not concerned about publicity that would be done.  If Deputy Hussey had charge of that section he would do what is necessary to ensure that people get the benefits they are entitled to.  Many people think that those on social welfare are getting something for nothing.  People claiming social welfare have contributed over the years to these benefits as have their employers.  I accept there is a subvention from the State but when the Bill dealing with increases in contributions comes before us the amount of subvention will be substantially reduced.  Benefits were introduced by the State to ensure that people would have the necessities of life if they were unemployed or ill.  They are entitled to this as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who hold clinics know that the non-functioning of the Department of Social Welfare is a bone of contention in all constituencies.  Many explanations have been given but they are not much use to people who are left without money to buy food and clothing.  We heard a lot about the great increases the Minister gave but today we hear about increases in petrol and gas.  In order to resume work some people will need to use their <Col N="1533" /> cars.  The price of petrol will inflate the whole economy.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the previous speaker that social welfare allowances should be index-linked.  Every year in the budget we should increase the basic amount by whatever we feel is necessary in order to bring people on social welfare into an average income position in relation to the rest of the community.  If social welfare benefits were index-linked when we gave an increase it would be a real one.  It was also mentioned that during the time of the previous Government there were two basic dates on which social welfare was increased &mdash; October and April.  This is no longer the case.  The Government now give a full year's increase.  This gives a false impression because of the increasing cost of living.</P>
    <P>There are many categories of people on social welfare but I have a great interest in widows with young families.  My mother was a widow with a family of three children.  She suffered a lot at that time.  For most of the time there was no pension but later there was a small one. Widows have been badly treated under every social welfare Act that has come before the House.  A young woman with small children has to clothe, feed and educate them.  The same facilities should be afforded to widows with young families as to old age pensioners.  I refer, of course, to such items as free fuel and electricity.  We make great play from time to time about treating all our children equally, but how can a widow with a young growing family be expected to give her children equal opportunities in education, in clothing, in food, if she is not being treated equally under the social welfare code?</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a social welfare content in the health services but the social welfare element is not administered uniformly throughout all health board areas.  In one health board area free fuel is given automatically but in another area health board officials will tell you that people with contributory pensions are not entitled to free fuel. When bringing out the scheme the Minister failed in his obligation to spell out <Col N="1534" /> clearly how it should be operated.  If that had been done poor people would not be depending on the whims of health board officials.  I wish to refer to the means test as it is being applied.  It must be said that there are officials in the Department investigating claims in regard to both social welfare and health entitlements who seem to have one object, and that is to stop people from getting any benefits. There seems to have been a stepping up of that kind of attitude in the Department. I will cite one case, but before doing so I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister &mdash; in fairness, I do not always attack him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary for somebody to deal with administration because the system has broken down completely.  We are not getting any satisfaction in this House.  Apparently what we are saying is hurting the Minister.  This administration have not done anything about insurance and sickness benefit for the self-employed, who are willing to contribute to a scheme.  When Fianna Fáil took office all the preparatory work on a scheme for the self-employed had been done by Deputies Corish and Cluskey in the previous administration.  That scheme was on the desk of the Minister's predecessor &mdash; the person who is now Taoiseach &mdash; but nothing was done about it.  The self-employed represent about 25 <Col N="1539" /> per cent of the total employed people. Most of them are afraid of the prospect of falling ill because they will have nothing. It is essential that something be done to help the self-employed.  I am not suggesting that they should not pay towards that help.  People in the self-employed category would be quite prepared to contribute to a system that would give them benefits in the event of illness.</P>
      <P>The Minister is failing in his duty if he does not do something in this area.  In rural areas it is quite usual to have small businesses run by one person who is prepared to deliver goods to remote areas where the larger companies will not operate.  All of those self-employed people are frightened about what will happen if they fall ill because there is no State scheme available for them.  Even though all the homework on a new scheme was done before Fianna Fáil took over, neither this Minister nor the Taoiseach, who was his predecessor in that office, did anything about the matter.  The Minister has a duty to provide a scheme that will cover the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not deserve congratulations on the administration of social welfare benefits.  Neither does the Taoiseach deserve congratulations in this matter.  Both men present a fairly good public image of themselves but advances in the area of social welfare have been very limited.  The increased prices in the past week will erode all the benefits about which they boasted on budget day.  I judge a Government and a Minister on what they do to help the poor and those in the lower income groups.  We have shown that this Government have failed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to sympathise with the Minister.  When he was appointed as Minister for Social Welfare it was a popular decision and most people thought he would do a tremendous job. However, in the past few months things have gone drastically wrong for the Minister and for the Department.  The main reason is that there has been a dreadful mix-up in the Department with regard to payment of benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> I have a high regard for the Minister as a person but I am obliged to point out the dreadful state of affairs in his Department. My constituency is poor and in the past few months more and more people have complained to me about delays of up to five months in respect of payments. The Minister asked Deputy Bermingham for details of cases about which he had written to the Department.  I will have no hesitation in giving the Minister in this House the names of people who have been waiting for months for payment. Last week I met a woman who was waiting since November for a disability payment. She had a brain operation six months ago and there was no doubt about her entitlement to the benefit.  She had plenty of stamps, but the Department refused to pay her.  There was another case of a physically disabled person to whom benefit was cut off on 1 December 1980 and that physically handicapped person has not received any benefit to date.  I can give details to the Minister of 40 serious cases in the poorest constituency in the country.  These people have been barred from receiving disability allowances even though they are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I am not making these accusations lightly.  I can back up each of them with representations I have made to the Minister and questions I have tabled, when I have received the usual answer that this case is being looked into and the Minister will reply further.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there is something wrong with the Department of Social Welfare.  People feel that he is more interested in health than he is in social welfare.  The system is on the point of breaking down, the staff are on the point of rebellion and the chief executive officers are losing control of the system in social welfare.  I am making those accusations from my knowledge of trying to get social welfare payments for the people I represent.</P>
    <P>Surely, if this is the case, a Minister of State must be given, as Deputy Frank Cluskey was given in the previous administration, full responsibility for social welfare and the Minister should deal primarily <Col N="1541" /> with health.  If I was in the Minister's shoes I would seriously look at what is wrong with this system because the full blame will eventually come back on to his head.  I have listened to his replies day after day in the House.  We are told that the Department have changed to a computer. Many people in business have to change to computers, but if the computer is not right it is thrown out.  If the computer is not working right the Minister should see that the Department go back to the old system, because at least that gave the people payments.</P>
    <P>I represent the poorest constituency and it is becoming very difficult to get payment for the people.  My colleague, Deputy Harte, made the point a few minutes ago about not getting through on the telephone to the Department.  I do not believe that any Minister or any official can state that the Department's telephone is the easiest one to get through on.  There is a number to dial for dealing with disability benefit, but it is impossible to get through to that number unless one telephones at 9.45 in the morning.  Can the Minister not give Deputies a special number which they can ring with their problems so that they can be looked after?  The only way a lot of us can get through at the moment is to deal with the Minister's Private Secretary in the House which is not a satisfactory way to deal with social welfare problems.</P>
    <P>I am trying to be helpful to the Minister and to make suggestions where the system can be rectified.  We should remember that in the area I represent one out of every three people is on social welfare benefit.  I have never had as many complaints about lack of payment as I have had during the last few months.  If this goes on any longer the position will become much worse as far as the Department are concerned.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced this Bill he said that the Government's priority was to look after the weak, the deprived and the underprivileged in our society. He also said that the increases provided in the Bill were well beyond the Government's commitment to keep social welfare payments in line with the cost of living.  We had the budget five weeks ago <Col N="1542" /> and the Minister then spoke about the increases in social welfare payments, the 20 per cent increase for the short-term benefits and the 25 per cent increase in the long-term benefits.  At the time the Minister probably believed that.  We see in this morning's paper that we have another mini-budget.  Petrol is increased by 13p per gallon and gas is increased by 76p a cylinder.  The price of a cylinder of gas will now be £5.68.  Bus fares are being increased by 25 per cent.  The old penny bus fare we used to have when I went to school now costs 22p.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that social welfare payments are in line with the cost of living.  How can they be in line with the cost of living after the increases announced today?  We had a petrol strike last week and the Government agreed to a rise of £30 to tanker drivers.  An old age pensioner, even with the increases granted in this Bill, is expected to live on £25 per week.  The Minister has the audacity to talk about keeping social welfare payments in line with the cost of living.  We are in the third month of the year and price increases have already eaten up the increases granted to social welfare recipients less than two months ago.</P>
    <P>I asked a question yesterday about price increases as far as fishermen are concerned.  This new price increase means that the average weekly price of diesel for fishermen will be over £1,000. The greatest complaint which Deputies come up against is the small farmer's assistance scheme.  It is no longer called the small farmer's dole, because it is an assistance scheme.  Without it the people in Donegal and Mayo could not exist on their small holdings.  Those people did not get any rise during the last few years unless they changed from the valuation system to what is called the factual system, where they have to make it known if they have one or two cattle and ten or 12 sheep.  There are many people living alone who have to exist on £14, £15 and £16 a week on the small farmer's assistance scheme.  We have only to visit those people, not alone at election time but at any time, to see the bad conditions they are living in.  Most of them would not <Col N="1543" /> have been able to afford to change their suits in the last ten years and I am sure many of them have not been able to buy a pair of shoes because of the meagre allowances given by previous Governments and, in particular, by the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was ridiculous not to give such recipients the two increases they were entitled to.  It is unrealistic to expect those people to live on the amount of money they are given.  How can people live on such meagre allowances?  The Minister should give those people the same increases as those who are in receipt of dole allowances in the towns and cities. Those people are not as well off as those who live in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>It seems to be more difficult now for married women to obtain a disability allowance.  It is because of the cost of living that many wives must go out to work to keep up a fair standard of living. Many women who receive maternity benefit find after their child is born and if employment is not available for them that they do not get unemployment benefit. They are sent before a panel when they seek disability benefit but they are told they are not able to work because they must stay at home to look after the child. Regardless of the proof tendered on behalf of those people &mdash; in some cases the grandmother looks after the child &mdash; the appeals officer turns them down.  That has happened a lot in the last three years. In fact, as many as 75 per cent of the married women who look for that benefit are turned down for no reason other than that they are not available for work.</P>
    <P>There is little point in the Minister telling us he is caring for the social welfare classes when a directive is being issued &mdash; it must have been issued in the case of married women seeking disability allowance &mdash; telling the appeals officers to make sure such people are turned down.  I am sure this is happening in the area the Minister of State represents just as it happens in Donegal.  Another group affected are single women, 18 years and upwards, who find that they cannot get work.  At present 127,000 are on the unemployment register and when one takes into consideration that between <Col N="1544" /> 10,000 and 12,000 people are on part-time work that figure jumps to 140,000 on unemployment benefit.  Single women from 18 years of age and upwards often cannot find work, yet they must wait up to five months for their first unemployment benefit payment.  I cannot understand why there is such discrimination against females.  I have not found the same problem as far as young males are concerned.  I wonder if a directive has been issued by the Department not to give single women the dole.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State has come across this problem in his constituency.  In this debate I am anxious to be constructive and point out the defects in the Department of Social Welfare. I am aware of the difficulties because I represent a constituency which has the highest number of people living on social welfare benefits.  The Minister should inquire as to why females have to wait up to five months before they get their first unemployment allowance.</P>
      <P>I should like to know why we do not have a system whereby the benefit year starts in January instead of the present system of the benefit year for females starting in June and that for males starting in January.  It would be a lot simpler all around if all people could claim unemployment benefit from the last day of the previous year.  I am sure it would cut down the cost of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my pleas in previous years were listened to in this regard.  I should like to compliment the Department <Col N="1545" /> on doing this.  It will make life a lot easier for many people.</P>
      <P>It is hard to understand how it is that so many people seek the benefit of the free fuel scheme, but it is even more difficult to understand the number of people who need the benefit of that scheme and do not get it.  We are all aware that single people living alone are automatically entitled to that but I should like to know why the Minister has not made the recommendation that two old age pensioners living alone do not qualify for benefit under that scheme.  Two old age pensioners living alone get only £30 towards the cost of a ton of coal.  I should like to know how it is that disabled persons under pension age do not benefit. Others who do not benefit include those on supplementary allowances.  This is a good scheme and there is no doubt that if it was not in operation many old people would not have fuel during the winter but the principle behind it should have been extended to the less well off sections of our community such as those living on supplementary allowances.  They should be entitled to benefit automatically.</P>
      <P>In some areas certain categories benefit under that scheme but people in similar circumstances in other areas do not. I understand that applications are considered by committees and it is the members of those committees who decide who should benefit.  The scheme should be extended to all sections of the poor.  The free travel for old age pensioners was a good idea but it should be remembered that in some country areas there is not a bus service within 20 miles of some homes.  Pensioners living in such remote areas should be given some assistance towards the cost of car hire if they wish to travel to visit their friends.  They should get an extra allowance of about £1 per week towards the cost of such travel.  This system works all right so far as towns and cities are concerned, but in areas where a bus service is not available those entitled to the travel concession cannot avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on his intention to set up more welfare homes. A move in this direction is long overdue, but the problem appears to be that the <Col N="1546" /> money is not available.  What is happening in this sphere on the Continent is that welfare homes are being set up in flat complexes and old people are being encouraged to take accommodation in these places.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but we are talking here about such people as the old, the deprived, the disabled and so on.  The point I am trying to make is that the system of welfare homes within flats is worth considering.  The system on the Continent in this respect is one in which there are 100 or 120 one-bedroom flats in a complex in which there are communal dining halls and television rooms.  I have found during my visits to old age pensioners in rural areas that their greatest problem is that nobody really cares for them.  Old people living in areas in which there is in operation a group such as the St. Vincent de Paul society are very lucky, but in many rural areas there would not be any such group.  The greatest problem seems to be one of loneliness. I have come across some very sad cases of old people living alone and isolated to the extent that their nearest neighbours may be as far away as a quarter of a mile.  These are the people we should be encouraging to move into communal buildings where they would be looked after properly.  They are the forgotten people.  It is very sad that this should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the achievements of the Coalition of which I was very proud was the reduction in the old age pension age from 70 to 66, but I am very disappointed that there has not been a further reduction. We should be thinking in terms of a retiring age of 60, because a person who starts <Col N="1547" /> work at 20 and who works hard for 40 years is entitled to retire at that stage.  If we continue as we are in this respect we will be faced with a problem of many more of our young people not being able to find work and many of our older people not being able to retire because of not qualifying on age grounds for an old age pension.  I should like to see all sides of the House working towards a gradual reduction in the old age pension qualifying age from 65 to 60.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I have spoken about also in previous years is that of an insurance stamp for the self-employed. Coming from a self-employed background I have often wondered why we have failed up to now to introduce a scheme whereby people in this category would pay towards insurance that would provide benefit as a result of redundancy or that would ensure that a pension would be payable on reaching pension age. There is such a scheme in Britain.  I often meet people who have come into the Republic from Northern Ireland or from England and who, although self-employed in the other jurisdiction, are in a position to avail of benefit because of the contributions they have made to the relevant scheme.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that there is no such scheme here.  I understand that a couple of years ago the Department were hoping to introduce a scheme for the self-employed but, as there has not been any progress in this regard, I should like to hear from the Minister on the reasons for this failure.  There are many people who have given long service to the community through their initiative in opening small businesses and so on but who find in the later years of their lives that they have no entitlement to a pension of any kind.  If their business goes to the wall, they are not entitled to unemployment benefit. Usually such people are too proud to seek assistance from a social welfare officer.  In these circumstances the Minister should consider seriously the introduction of an insurance stamp for the self-employed.  I not that the VHI contributions are to be increased in the coming year by 23 per cent.  There is a link <Col N="1548" /> between the VHI and a scheme of benefits for the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly in the Border area is that somebody who is signing either for unemployment benefit or for disability benefit in England finds that, if he becomes ill and wishes to move to Ireland, he will not be paid the benefit here unless he has signed for at least three days in England.  What I am saying is that people who have been working in England and whose homes are in Ireland do not know that when they are sick they have to sign in England before they transfer their residence to Ireland.  They apply to the Department of Social Welfare, and when the Department of Social Welfare, through their EEC office, apply to Britain they find that they cannot get benefit because of this anomaly.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take this up with his British counterpart to see that this anomaly is stamped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, it is an EEC regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take the point up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is an EEC regulation but at the same time we are discriminating against people.  On the one hand we are able to give them money regardless of what EEC country they are living in and, on the other hand, if they do not sign in the EEC country that they were working in before they come to reside at home, they cannot get the money.  There is an anomaly there and it is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point regarding the EEC is that I honestly cannot understand why, when people are being paid from Britain they are not getting the equivalent of sterling here.  I know the Minister will probably say that they have agreed this with Britain but we have probably ten times more people getting money from Britain than there are people residing in Britain and getting money from Ireland. Let me illustrate the point I am making. Under EEC regulations the British Government <Col N="1549" /> are paying an old age pension to the Irish Government in sterling.  Why then is the pensioner paid in Irish money. There is a 25 per cent difference between the punt and the pound sterling and the pensioner is 25 per cent worse off.  I brought this matter up in a Dáil question a couple of months ago and I was told that arrangements had been made with Britain but it is the Irish pensioner who is not getting the right amount of money and it is completely unjust.</P>
    <P>At present everybody admits that there is something wrong in the Department. I suggest that the Minister should look very critically at it and try to sort out what is wrong.  The Minister should give Deputies in this House a direct telephone line so that they can contact the Department with queries.  The Minister should see that the Minister of State is put in charge of the social welfare system in the Department.  Will the Minister also, for goodness sake, find out what is wrong that those people are not getting paid.  In my length of time in this House I have never had as many complaints about late payments as I have had over the last five or six months.  Even though we agree with what the Minister states here, that this is a Social Welfare Bill and we are glad to see social welfare people getting an increase, I will prophesy that within six months the Minister will have to bring in another Supplementary Estimate to see that these people receive the extra percentage to allow for such terrible price increases as we are having weekly at present. I hope that when the Minister is replying he will state that if necessary and if inflation continues at the present rate he will have no hesitation in bringing before this House another Supplementary Estimate to ensure that the weaker sections of the community do not suffer. Other people are getting £30 and £40 per week in increases and at the same time the old age pensioner is expected to live on £25 a week.</P>

The senior officials and, indeed, the junior officials in the Department of Social Welfare are sick and tired of the repeated misrepresentation and abuse they receive from Deputies here in the House.  Some of the members of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare were beaten up outside their offices during the postal dispute because they insisted on going in to give a service to those people the Deputy is talking about now.  Yet I heard Deputies <Col N="1555" /> here in the House claiming in those periods that there were also delays at that time.  I also had to listen to Deputies here in the House saying that there were delays at these other times as well, that there are recurring delays on the part of the Department of Social Welfare and that this goes on year in and year out.

Looking at the various questions which have recently been raised, in many of these cases it has transpired that where employers made no returns there has been some delay in determining eligibility.  There is no way <Col N="1561" /> of avoiding some delay there because of the legal onus and responsibility lying on the officials in those cases.  The questions show many cases where medical referees said that a man or woman was fit for work, but the claimant did not agree.  Of course, there is a delay here because the Department will provide a second medical referee and will go further to provide an oral hearing and, in certain cases, provide specialist consultations.  The questions also showed cases where people who were not eligible for benefit got nothing.  Naturally, they were aggrieved and keep coming back about the matter. Opposition Deputies, again and again, refer to such cases as ones of delay.  This is grossly false and unfair and they know it.</P>

      <P>In any one week, the Department receive 1,500 claims for disability benefit which have no name, no number or a wrong number and, naturally, with the changeover to the PRSI system and the new governing contribution year effective from January, the number of these instances rose and that number is being dealt with.  This is a very specific, direct problem which is being dealt with very urgently.</P>
      <P>I have said to the Deputies who are making the case that it is the computerisation which causes this.  That the computer depends on the information fed into it.  The Department are just as expert at handling computers as people on the other side of the House and their friends are who are involved in business.  The problem arises in the input information. In advance, various measures were taken, like special regulations which would allow assessment on the 1978-1979 governing contribution year in the event of problems.</P>

      <P>I am aware that despite close maintenance attention the standard of telephone service in the Summerhill area is not satisfactory. The difficulties stem from problems with the aerial cable between Summerhill and Kilcock carrying the circuits to Dublin. To get over these problems it is proposed to re-route the Summerhill-Dublin trunk circuits via Enfield within the next two months or so when a new under-ground cable between Enfield and Dublin is in operation.  This should give a much improved service at Summerhill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that letters posted in Dublin can take up to five days, and frequently take three days, to be delivered?  Further, will he not agree that at one time if a letter was posted in the city before 11 a.m. it was delivered the same day?  Will he not admit that there has been a grave deterioration in the postal service in Dublin and that some major action will have to be taken to bring it back to its former level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last part of the Deputy's question, I do not agree with what he has said.  There are certain districts in Dublin where there are some difficulties.  Churchtown postal district is one such example.  The problem regarding the provision of accommodation is being solved.  It is not always easy to get suitable accommodation.  However, we are working on the matter and we will continue with our efforts to make the service even better than it was prior to the strike.  I do not accept the point made by Deputy Mitchell that a letter posted in Dublin will take five days to deliver.  I do not know what he means by that statement. An allegation was made in this House yesterday by the leader of his party who said a request was posted to have investigated by my Department an illegal phone-tapping in the Fine Gael headquarters.  We received that letter last night and it did not come through the post.  I wish to clarify that point.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept an assurance from me that it can take up to five days for a letter to be delivered, and very frequently it takes three days? I have had, in order to test the system, to resort to posting letters to myself because I have got so many complaints from my constituents.  Frequently it takes three days and often five days.  Will the Minister at least undertake to examine the <Col N="1574" /> situation urgently?  I would love the Minister to prove me wrong but if what I am saying is true will he undertake to take urgent steps to remedy the situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I try daily, not weekly, to keep on top of the situation.  We had a situation prior to an unofficial strike between 5 and 14 February when we had a 90 per cent delivery of letters posted at night and delivered the following morning. That is in excess of what the figure was prior to the strike.  Now that the Deputy has spent so long making insinuations about the technical side of my Department he is trying to denigrate the staff who work on the postal side.  I do not accept that.</P>

No mention was made of the staff at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's assertion that he monitors it on a daily basis he is failing in a number of areas, including the one Deputy Mitchell referred to, but specifically the Dublin 2 area where it can take up to five days in some cases to deliver letters if they are delivered at all.  If the Minister is monitoring it on a daily basis would he kindly indicate what parts of the city he is monitoring because there are areas he is failing to cover?</P>

Moreover, the new automatic exchange for Bantry has been designed on the basis that operator services would be provided from Cork and provision of operator services in Bantry would involve additional expense, delay in bringing the automatic exchange into use and poor quality of transmission on operator-controlled calls.</P>

      <P>If the Minister accepts that there should be a policy of decentralisation and if he thinks that the Bantry area alone would not justify having operator-assisted calls channelled through it, would he not consider channelling all west Cork operator-assisted calls through Bantry rather than through the city?</P>

      <P>Under the programme for the digital exchanges &mdash; Bantry will be converted to a digital exchange &mdash; we have 16 major centres chosen for operators.  They are Athlone, Castlebar, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Letterkenny, Limerick, Mullingar, Naas, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford and Wicklow.  Technically speaking the equipment for Bantry has been ordered and this is a unique opportunity for the people of Bantry to accept automation. We cannot change the decision at this stage because if we did it for Bantry we would have to do it for every town and the whole programme would be thrown asunder.  If we are to go digital we must comply with the regulations, the plans and the engineering requirements necessary for such digital exchanges.  We are offering all our staff in Bantry, particularly those on day work, alternative employment at Cork, Tralee or Limerick, the nearest exchanges to them.</P>

      <P>It has come to my knowledge that certain agitation is going on in Bantry and I should like to take the opportunity to explain that this change presents a unique chance for the people of Bantry to have a proper telecommunications service.  A digital exchange is the only answer because it must fit into the digital network.  In addition, if the people of Bantry Bay and Deputy O'Keeffe do not want us to put in the digital exchange they should tell me.  I cannot do anything else except put in digital exchanges.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to introduce legislation to change section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some journalists and broadcasters have expressed opposition to orders made under this section.  I have recently made an order exempting the television series &ldquo;Ireland, a Television History&rdquo;, written and presented by Robert Kee, from the scope of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (Section 31) Order of 1981.

But has the insistence on the inclusion of this section not the implication <Col N="1593" /> that a case could be made by the Provos, a convincing, valid and sustainable one, to which those of us who are opposed to them have no worthwhile reply?  Does the Minister not agree that there is in this kind of censorship a certain taint of patronising elitism, which reminds us of a predecessor of his in his Department, which tends to take the view that the ordinary people, unlike us politicians, are not capable of judging between right and wrong?  Is it not an implied criticism of the integrity of journalists generally and of their ability to expose the many dangerous weaknesses and contradictions in the Provo case?</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of a fallacy concerning the most recent programme the Deputy mentioned, that <Col N="1594" /> is a matter of opinion.  Second, I certainly could agree that perhaps when supporters of the Provisional IRA who are members of county councils want to talk, for example, about the question of a drain or a by-road, they could speak.  In all such acts certain parts of them seem to be extreme and others not.  That is the way I would suggest any legislation would be interpreted.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to conclude. I was making a number of observations about the deficiencies in the Estimate before us and I wish to refer particularly to the provision which it appears is about to be made in relation to Garda stations.  I noted with some dismay that the estimate of total cost of the Garda stations and renovations to Garda stations which it is proposed to incorporate into this Estimate apparently is not yet available.  I want to reiterate a special plea to try to ensure that standards in these Garda stations all over the country will be such as will not force gardaí to walk out of stations, as they have done previously.  I would like the Minister to be good enough to tell us whether resources additional to what was spent last year will be provided in this respect.  Any casual observer or any visitor to a Garda station often is quite appalled at the deficiencies there.</P>
      <P>The conditions in relation to the Department of Defence buildings, particularly those in which servicemen and their families are housed, are abominable. Without labouring the point, I ask the Minister to make a pledge to this House that whatever resources are necessary under items 133, 134, 135, 133. A. 134A, 135A or other headings appropriate will be allocated so that these men, who, along with the Garda, prison officers and certain other categories of people, serve the State in a particular way and whom we seem to penalise for so doing, will be given decent conditions under which to rear their families.  If the Minister had an opportunity to see or have reported to him the television programme last night or the previous night &mdash; which I did not see &mdash; in relation to such conditions he will know what I am talking about.  They are abominable and inadequate and should be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention, without apology to anybody, the disgraceful condition of this House.  Even as I stand here I can feel the perspiration on my brow.  The staff and Deputies in this House work in conditions <Col N="1619" /> that no self-respecting trade unionist would tolerate.  I am aware that shortly they may be asked &mdash; perhaps should be asked, in the light of recent events to shoulder extra responsibilities in relation to heightened security in this establishment.  If that is the case I trust that they will be consulted fully in advance and recompensed fully for any additional burden that will fall on them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister when it is proposed to introduce whatever changes are necessary to ensure that the Deputies and staff in this House act in accordance with the planning laws prevailing at present. The numbers in each room and the conditions of the rooms are in breach of building by-laws and of planning laws. They are overcrowded and, as far as I am concerned, not acceptable.  There is no point in anybody inside or outside this House pretending that we can do our jobs properly in present conditions which were never designed for the purpose for which they are now utilised.  The manner in which we have traditionally accepted substandards in this establishment is another symptom of the lack of respect which this House has always shown for itself.  It is about time that we brought Dáil Éireann into the twentieth century and gave it at least the facilities which any very modest business person in this country would have in terms of secretarial and other staff, technological aids, decent office accommodation and the possibility of having confidential discussions with people.  The result of that approach would be of benefit to the whole country.  It would mean a better, more efficient, more constructive and more productive Dáil, but that is not in this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I want to say in passing, in fairness, that some genuine efforts have been made in recent times by the Government to come some of the way, particularly in relation to facilities, and with representatives of the three main parties working together on it there has been progress.  I make a special appeal that the rooms in this building, which arguably in some cases might be fire hazards and in which too many people are working, would be <Col N="1620" /> replaced by new facilities to ensure that the people of this country get the best value for money rather than an overcrowded, inefficient Dáil, which I shudder to think of.  I would like the Minister to tell me, if he has an answer, where the new Deputies, soon to be elected presumably, are going to find themselves housed.  At present we are breaking the planning law, and that is an incredible indictment of the way we run our own affairs.  It is a reasonable question because if we cannot manage basic facilities such as office accommodation and central heating in this House, what chance have we of managing the country?</P>
    <P>In relation to office accommodation for staff generally, and specifically at this time in the Department of Health and Social Welfare, I ask of the Minister whether a heightened state of tension exists at present in these offices, if there is great discontent among the staff, particularly in the Department of Social Welfare, with their accommodation and if there is a threatened strike.  If the mayhem existing at present in relation to the payment of social welfare benefits, with all its downstream difficulties of people unable to pay rent, unable to buy food, having to go to loan sharks and so on, is to be compounded by a strike over bad conditions, then the Departments of Health and Social Welfare would not be merely in a state of total chaos but severe damage would be done to the wellbeing of very many people.  If what I have suggested is true I want the Minister to give a guarantee that it will be attended to without delay in order to ensure that there will be no tension, disenchantment or withdrawal of labour, due to bad office facilities in that Department.</P>
    <P>I notice also under that general heading the new growth industry of employment exchanges and what is presumably increased accommodation in the Dublin area.  Neither estimated expenditure for December 1980 nor estimated total cost of whatever is on hands is available in the Estimate.  I want to ask the Minister if he will personally visit the employment exchanges in north Dublin city.  It will take an hour or two.  I want him to do it without forewarning, not as a guided <Col N="1621" /> tour.  I want him to observe the degrading conditions in which both staff and those attending are obliged to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind who goes down there, provided it has the desired effect.  There is nothing like a personal visitation.  I made this request before to the Minister for the Environment.  I got a letter to the effect that he would make a visit.  That is three years ago.  No visit has taken place.  Would the Minister give an undertaking that he or one of his colleagues will visit these exchanges and observe the degradation which prevails there, the bad conditions which demoralise and brutalise staff and the worse conditions in which people have to queue up publicly to discuss their most intimate family matters.  Those standards belong to the days of Charles Dickens.  They are not good enough for 1981.  They should be a thing of the past.  From recent observations. I note it is as bad as ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister when the provision of additional accommodation will be provided in Infirmary Road. When will the work be completed?  In reply to a Dail question some time ago, the Minister for Defence said that the work was soon to be completed.  When are the works going to be carried out?  Is the plight of men who have to live in some of these Army dwellings going to be recognised and attended to?  The only way to solve these problems is to grant <Col N="1622" /> the resources to do so.  The conditions for men in these barracks are disgraceful.  It should not be necessary to continue raising it in the House or on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Since I contributed to the Estimate last week, when I belaboured the Minister in respect to a long-promised construction of facilities for the Gardaí at the entrances to Leinster House, I observe some movement in that direction.  Would the Minister confirm that the billets or huts which will afford some shelter to the gardai at Leinster House or any other establishment where they have to do round the clock duty, will be provided as a matter of urgency?  It would be a gesture of support for the job the gardai do, to which very often we only pay lip service. Let us now put our money where our mouths are.  Will the Minister say when these very modest comforts will be provided? I would be grateful also if he would tell me how much money is involved in the new delivery office of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at Fairview and when it will be completed?</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister the up-to-date position with regard to the papal cross in the Phoenix Park.  I was in contact with the Minister some months ago when it became known that there was a situation of fairly scandalous neglect in regard to what has now become, in the public mind, a national monument.  At that time a number of colleagues of mine from all parties in Dublin City Council, which has a passing responsibility in the general Dublin jurisdiction, got together and were willing to assist by raising funds or whatever else was necessary to ensure what is seen as a very important national landmark is not left in a grafitti-ridden and semi-derelict state.  I was assured at the time, in writing, by the Minister that everything was now under control and that the necessary improvements would be carried out.  I pass the site every day.  I made a cursory inspection within the last three days.  I was not impressed by what I saw.  We need to carry out urgently whatever works are necessary at this location to ensure that we do not disgrace ourselves by ignoring what is for many people, of all creeds and all walks of life, an important <Col N="1623" /> symbol, whether of celebration or historical importance.  It is a reminder of a momentous occasion.  The moneys involved are not great.  The plans were drawn up even before the papal visit.  It is a shame it has to be raised at all to get the work done.</P>
    <P>While in the general vicinity of the Phoenix Park, I want to ask the Minister if he would prevail upon whoever is responsible &mdash; if it is Dublin Corporation they are at present being asked &mdash; to provide markings on the main road through the park, which is the scene of accidents every second day.  Rarely does one drive along the main road without seeing a wreck on the side of the road.  I saw figures two days ago in relation to the amount of cattle and deer killed or maimed by speeding drivers.  I ask the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to curb the speed, including consideration of providing ramps if necessary and, at the very least, providing a white line in the middle of the road.  There is no marking of any shape or form on that road, on the mistaken premise that if you do not make it safe or allegedly attractive to drive on, you will discourage motorists. Motorists are driving on it in increasing numbers.  I am not sure whether that is desirable or not.  It is the shortest distance between two points.  We may have to accept that.  Consideration should be given to roads off the main road.  One would be amenable to reducing the degree of access at present.  If we accept that driving takes place on the main road, we should, for the sake of people who are being killed and injured and for the sake of their relatives, at least put decent markings on the road.</P>
    <P>In the last few days we had an incident at one of our prisons, which shows the poor conditions of the staffing arrangements in those prisons.  At a car park attached to a prison, due partly to the openness of the park we had an assault on two prison officers.  Is it possible that the Minister, who I am sure joins with me in deploring that act, would be good enough to review the buildings in which some prison officers have to live, in which most park their cars, with a view to ensuring <Col N="1624" /> that if there is need for greater security and greater comfort for the men involved it will be provided.  I believe that these prisons anyway are ripe for review in a number of respects not appropriate to this discussion.  The least we can do, as with the Garda, is to show to people who have a very difficult job that we care whether they get mugged or beaten or have their property vandalised.  At present in a number of these institutions one could be forgiven for thinking that they rate very low on the list of priorities.</P>
    <P>The same is true &mdash; in relation to items 68 and 69 &mdash; of the courts, the children's court.  I referred to it briefly last week but I must say once again that the children's court in the mentality of the Government appears to run parallel to labour exchanges.  It is a crucible of hopelessness, a place where the lives of young people are dealt with on average within a time span of five minutes for each case in foul conditions that are smelly, ugly and sordid.  Dealing with crime committed at any age is never attractive for parents of these children and those associated with dealing with them.  We have had many cries and demands for decent, minimal facilities at the children's court. In the light of the fact that the total estimated cost of whatever improvements it is alleged will be carried out under this Estimate and the estimated expenditure for last year are not yet available, once again one must be of the view that no great priority or urgency attaches to it, as indeed it does not, in my view, in the eyes of this Government in relation to any group without a strong lobby banging on the doors of Leinster House on their behalf.</P>
    <P>One could spend more time on this Estimate because it involves a great amount of detail but other Deputies wish to speak.  I have had a fair opportunity of making some points.  To sum up, I believe it is timely to consider some kind of supervisory management board separate from the Board of Works to control the efficiency, standards and conditions according to regulations and law of all these buildings in public charge.  The reality is that most of them are managed inefficiently, wastefully.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1625" /> to consult with his colleague.  Deputy Colley, and ask him to apply his endeavours, in relation to his conserve-energy campaign, particularly to public buildings where nobody seems to mind and nobody is in charge of heat or energy.</P>
    <P>Could each of these public buildings, for example, have somebody responsible for efficiency in terms of utilisation of space, light, heating and so on?  How many times in these buildings does one see lights burning hour after hour needlessly? How many times does one see windows stuck, painted over years ago, in a half-open position?  Similarly with radiators.  Somebody should be charged with responsibility for trying to ensure, not that staff would be asked to work in anything but better conditions than at present &mdash; I know some of them have to put up with conditions as bad as Deputies have to put up with &mdash; but that people would be asked to understand increasingly that we are dealing with public resources and that the vast octopus of the public service and all it costs cannot go on forever as it is going on.  With a little imagination, determination and leadership it is possible for Government offices and public services offices generally to be run more efficiently and productively.  If that happened, these would be more satisfying places for people to work in and this would undoubtedly be communicated to the people with whom one has to deal, the public.  At present the squalor of many of these offices is a mystery and I do not know how staff work in some of them.  I would not blame them if they said they would not work there any longer.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would try to reply as far as possible to the individual queries I put to him last week and today.  If he does not have that opportunity now.  I should be happy to hear from him in writing about the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate, if the figures we have got are correct, deals with an expenditure of £67,971,000 as against an expenditure of £51,825,000 last year. a net increase of £16,146,000.  I often wonder why the State has not made the Office <Col N="1626" /> of Public Works a full Department in its own right because if one looks through this Estimate and considers the tremendous range of work to be carried out by the officers of the Office of Public Works and by the Minister one wonders how it compares with some of the full Departments where perhaps the amount of money spent is very much greater but the variety of jobs carried out is not comparable at all.  Some people try to give the impression that the Office of Public works is a glorified national building agency, an office through which money is directed and it ends there.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The documentation here is sufficient to show that the work that should be properly carried out is of tremendous importance.  The Estimate has subheads for new works, alterations and additions including furnishing of new buildings.  I should like to return to this later.</P>
      <P>I find it rather disturbing that despite the fact that there has been an increase in the Estimate of slightly over £16 million &mdash; I suppose to keep in line with inflation &mdash; there appears to be a substantial reduction under a number of headings.  Perhaps it is not fair to ask the Minister to try to justify in detail all the points raised here but could he explain why there has been a drastic reduction in some subheads or how it is expected that the work can be continued if the amount of money made available is much less than formerly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal first with a number of local problems including the old problem that I have raised here by way of questions to the Minister on a number of occasions and on which I have got no enlightenment in the documentation here.  That is the question of garda stations. I know that a sum is shown for new Garda stations but the extraordinary thing is that in Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare and other departments it is possible to give details of new employment exchanges, telephone kiosks and so on, but when it comes to Garda stations the details are omitted. One wonders if this is done deliberately. The same situation applies in relation to schools.  Surely it is not because there are <Col N="1627" /> so many of them that it would be impossible to have them included.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give me some information in relation to an appalling Garda station which is on the direct route from the Border to Dublin, the Drogheda Garda station?  There are proposals for the acquisition of a new site but as far as I am aware a provision has not been made in this year's Estimate for the erection of a Garda station there.  Of necessity there are a great number of gardaí in that station who have to service an area adjacent to the groups who service the Border. They should have decent accommodation. Since I raised this matter with the Minister and since he promised urgent action nearly 12 months ago, we still have unpainted windows and doors, broken windows, holes in the floor for a toilet and cellars being used as offices where pieces of old broken furniture are lying around and electricity wires are hanging from the walls.  If this was featured in a Charles Chaplin film we would understand that it was meant to be funny but it is not funny for those who are trying to live and work in those circumstances.  The Minister said that he was not responsible for the furniture but the Estimate says &mdash; buildings including new furniture. Either the Minister is or is not responsible for the furniture but he is at least responsible for ensuring that there are proper toilets in the Garda station, that the floor is safe, that the windows are in proper order and that the station is properly wired for electricity.  The Minister cannot get out of that.  Unless something is done this will come up here again and again.</P>
    <P>In Laytown-Bettystown where I live, provision was made a few years ago to erect a new Garda station to replace the Julianstown Garda station which is a house on the Dublin-Belfast road which has a lay-by which holds only one car. This house was never intended to be a Garda station but the gardaí have been doing their best.  As the site has been obtained and since the cost of erecting a Garda station either in Drogheda or in Laytown will not get less it is ridiculous just to say that it is under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> In relation to &ldquo;the estimated total cost&rdquo; in the Estimates in general the note frequently says that it is not yet made.  When I came into this House accommodation was very scarce and the new building was being added.  Apparently the estimated cost of that building was £620,000 but it eventually finished up at close to £1 million. The reason given to me for this difference was because nobody seemed to know what the cost was to be and the builder just kept on adding bits here and there.  I know it may be necessary to upgrade costs because of increases in the costs in materials and labour but just to say that there is no estimate of cost is not right.  No business organisation would start a job without knowing what it would cost saying that they would spend £X on it this year.  That appears to be the idea behind a number of the things done here.</P>
    <P>I mentioned two Garda stations specifically but there are numerous Garda stations in my constituency many of which are in bad condition.  The people working there have been doing their best to make them habitable.  Some of them get some co-operation from the Office of Public Works but some do not.  I am not blaming either the Minister or his senior officials as they would not know what was happening at local level.  However, the onus is on them to ensure that if somebody is paid to do a job that the job is done.  Both the living accommodation and the Garda stations should be in a proper condition and should be kept that way.  On the Continent the police stations are considered to be the public face of the Government and they are usually found to be spic and span.  Our Garda stations should be kept that way.  It is not right for people to go in and encounter, as I outlined in one instance, a dirty smell.  The responsibility lies on those who are supposed to keep them in order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A Garda station in Navan which was in operation for about 150 years was replaced by moving the station into a school which the Christian Brothers had left.  That was an excellent arrangement but the old barracks is now being vandalised and in a few months it will be a complete wreck.  When I enquired what would be done about it I came up against a blank wall.  Neither the Minister for Justice nor the Minister here could tell me anything except that they were considering doing something at some time. A similar building in Bailieborough. County Cavan was shown recently in the newspapers as having been repaired and done up and it is the showpiece in the town.  In Navan the building has simply been left to fall down.  It is not good enough.  The Minister is allowing State money to be wasted because he is allowing this building which was not suitable <Col N="1630" /> as a Garda station although it was a structurally sound building to be vandalised and he is making no effort to do something about it.  When he is replying, I should like him to say if he has any idea about this.  Does he remember that it was raised with him?  Does he know what is happening?</P>
    <P>According to the Minister provision has been made for a substantial sum of money to be spent on schools in the next 12 months.  This substantial sum of money falls far short of what is required. What has happened with regard to the pre-fabs which were bought to make up for accommodation which was not available at various schools over the past 12 months?  Why have the Office of Public Works not paid the money due to the local managers for those schools?  As far back as last August or September they promised to pay this money and they have not made it available.  Do they think the local managers have a pot of gold to which they can run every time they want money?  Do they think the local people should be squeezed for every penny they earn to pay for something for which the Office of Public Works are responsible?</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to what happened in Navan.  There was quite a row about it.  This is the sort of nonsense we see. and something must be done to stop it.  I do not blame the Office of Public Works entirely for this, but there appears to have been a breakdown between the people who are anxious to have a school built in their areas and the Office of Public Works.  Figures and dates were given by Fianna Fáil spokesmen at a local function and in this House, and we do not know whether they are fact or fiction.</P>
    <P>Last week people interested in the Kilclone school had a meeting and the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael representatives turned up at that meeting with letters from the Minister for Education saying that a bill of quantities was being prepared and would be ready in a couple of weeks' time, and that the school would go to contract when the bill of quantities was ready.  Nothing could be further from the truth because the Office of Public Works told me, and they were right, that a firm had been selected to draw up the <Col N="1631" /> bill of quantities but they had not accepted, and it would be a couple of weeks before they would be available.</P>
    <P>A school manager came to see me last year and he did not even know what was happening about a school which was to be erected in his area.  A contractor had been appointed, but he could not find out whether the contractor was going ahead with the job, whether the OK had been given, or what on earth was happening.</P>
    <P>These things are inexcusable particularly as we have reached the stage where second level schools are not able to take all the pupils coming from the primary schools.  I know the Minister has no responsibility for initiating the building of schools.  I do not blame him for that. When a decision is taken that a school is to be erected, the Office of Public Works are responsible for putting everything in train.  They should also notify the people responsible at local level about what is happening and where they stand.  People who are awaiting vacancies in schools should know whether those vacancies will be available.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say it is easy for me to criticise, but people come to me with complaints.  There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Everything is all right.  The Office of Public Works are doing a good job&rdquo;.  In the main they are doing an excellent job, but these are matters which should be attended to and we do not want to lose the ship for a ha'porth of tar.</P>

      <P>I did not hear anybody say they did not.  I said the Office of Public Works are responsible for the erection of schools and additions to schools once decisions have been taken.

I could give him at least 20 instances of where the local managements and committees are under the impression that schools are being proceeded with, but the facts are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I named the one in County Meath.  I mentioned Kilclone where nobody seems to know what is happening. Duleek school is another.  What is happening there?  If the Minister wants me to do so, I can give him details of at least 20.  What has happened Ratoath? What has happened about the building of a safety wall and car parking facilities beside Ratoath school which were promised two years ago?  There is no use in saying these things do not happen.  They do happen.  I am raising them because I believe it is proper to raise them here and give the Office of Public Works an opportunity to have them carried out properly.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about not being responsible for the furniture.  He is responsible for the furnishing of new schools.  I do not think he will deny that. I raised this before and I will raise it on every possible occasion.  When schools are erected the floor coverings and everything else in them should be Irish made. The Irish Goods Council gave pupils a very nice brochure telling them how important it was for them to influence everyone they could to buy Irish because their future employment could depend on the amount of Irish goods bought. There was a lovely picture on the brochure showing a group of children sitting behind desks which I expect were supposed to be Irish made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works put French carpets in that school, French floor covering. There is no way in which any Minister can justify that.  There is no way in which any responsible Minister can say that was the right thing to do.  This is <Col N="1633" /> happening throughout the country at present.  The Minister is not paying enough attention to practising what he is preaching.  He should insist on Irish goods being used in Irish schools, in Garda barracks, and anywhere else where he is responsible for the furnishing.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have done excellent work in Newgrange.  The Department must be congratulated on the work they are doing there.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it is their responsibility, but there is confusion.  A number of young people who had not worked before and, in the main, do not know anything about stamping insurance cards or about PRSI started jobs all over the place.  I do not think that anybody knows anything about PRSI, from what I see happening outside.  Four or five people told me that they had worked for six months and, although they had submitted tax certificates and had asked for tax to be deducted properly, are having as much as £30 a week deducted from their wages by the Office of Public Works.  That is wrong.  Nobody in the offices, from the Minister down to the most junior clerk, will allow anybody to do that to them over a long period.  Why should it be done on a labourer, on a gossoon who has just started work?  Does he not count?  Is he not a human being with human feelings, the same as everybody else?  They are brushed off, they are away down the country, in Newgrange, near Slane, County Meath, and what about them?  They do not count.  But they do count, and count very much.  What is happening there is happening elsewhere and it is wrong.  The Minister may say that he does not know anything about it and his senior officials likewise, but somebody must know of the system of payment under which these things can happen.</P>
    <P>I have always been a great supporter of proper arterial drainage.  It has done a tremendous amount of general good in this country.  However, I disagree with some of the things which are done.  When a river such as the Boyne or the Blackwater is being drained, it is wrong, for <Col N="1634" /> instance, that in order to do the job properly someone should cut mature trees back 15 to 20 yards from the bank.  That is not the right way to do it.  There should be more planning in this regard.  Some people have been looking at these trees all their lives and these trees were there before they were born.  Yet, somebody, without by your leave, cuts them down. The argument may be made that the shaking of the trees would interfere with the bank because of its being cut back ten yards, or portion of the bank might fall into the river but it is a pity that this happens.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a lot of spoil should be thrown onto someone's small patch of land.  In many cases it cannot be avoided, but if someone has only a small patch of land it is annoying to see 500 acres on one side of the river not having a shovelful of spoil and half of his ten acres covered with spoil.  It may be much more convenient that his ten acres be chosen, but the human factor should come into it.  An effort should be made to ensure that this does not happen.  If damage is done and compensation is to be paid &mdash; and the Board of Works do give compensation &mdash; they should make arrangements to have it given with a good grace and quickly.  It should not be put on the longer finger so that it could take literally years. Somebody in 1968 or 1969 is promised £1,500 compensation and is paid in 1981. What sense does that make?</P>
    <P>In addition, we have the situation where, when the river through an area is being cleaned and sunk, it sometimes happens that a water system for one, two or a dozen people, or maybe a whole village or area, is undermined.  I am not saying that the Office of Public Works should not sink the river because it will affect the local water supply.  I am saying that, if that is likely to happen, provision should be made to have the existing water supply attended to by the Office of Public Works before the drainage work is carried out in the area.  By doing this they will prevent an enormous amount of hardship and annoyance.  I am sure that the Minister, a countryman like myself, realises this.  He realises that if some old man or woman got in a water supply four <Col N="1635" /> or five years ago and spent all their savings on ensuring that they had water running to their houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not agree at all with the Minister.  It is the easiest thing in the world to anticipate the depth of the existing water supply and the Office of Public Works know the depth.  They are continuing with the sinking of the river and it is the simplest thing in the world to anticipate where trouble will be caused.  Even when it is caused, the Minister might tell us how long it will be before action is taken to restore the supply.  I refer particularly to Kilmainham, Kells.  These people got a polite letter telling them that the Office of Public Works would consider any application that was made for assistance, but that is not putting any water into the pumps.</P>

      <P>I hope so.  What I am saying is that &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo; is no use because that phrase from those benches could mean anything up to five or six years and the Minister knows this.  It can be years and years before the action follows the words.  I am not being critical. This has been the system of the Board of Works from the very start and I am not blaming them.  It is what they have been doing and it is not the proper way.  Would they consider altering their present system and having the matter dealt with in a different way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another small thing which causes a lot of annoyance is when the drains leading into a river are what is known as pegged &mdash; I do not know the official term but the countryman calls it &ldquo;pegged&rdquo;&mdash; and it is found that when the job is done one or two of the pegged drains are not done but some unpegged ones are.  This has led to a ridiculous situation at present where a drain running across the back of Bettystown into the sea below Mornington village was pegged and supposed to be done.  In the meantime, because this was happening, a contractor bought the land and proceeded to build houses on it and got permission to do so on condition that the drain would be sunk and the water taken away.  What has happened?  The Office of Public Works informed me in writing last June that they had decided to change the idea.  The result is, of course, that the unfortunate people who are going to live in the houses will now have no guarantee that water will flow from them.  It may be like Duleek.  Here I do not blame the Office of Public Works. The blame may lie somewhere else.  However, the River Nanny flows through Duleek.  Some of the officials in the Minister's <Col N="1638" /> Department might know that river, but I am sure the Minister does not.  It is a very small river flowing through a level part of the country for about only 15 or 20 miles.  It flows through the village of Duleek.  During the 1955 floods for some extraordinary reason it became so flooded that it knocked two road bridges and flooded the countryside. The bridges have been replaced and a few years ago housing schemes were built in the Duleek area, some of them near the banks of that river.  Thank God it did not happen this year, but in February 1980 people went to work and when they came back the water was up to their windowsills.  There is only one solution to this problem and that is that the four or five miles from Duleek to the sea, or at least to where the tidal water ends, be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works told me this scheme was No. 21 on their list of minor drainage work and it has now reached No. 10 or No. 11.  This means that in the normal way it will be dealt with within the next century.  Is there any way in which a particular case like this, where extreme damage and cost occur, can be brought forward?  The Minister might say everybody thinks their scheme is important, and I know that, but this situation is unique.  It is not an area with high mountains.  In fact, there are only hills there, and the rest is level ground. Trees fell into the river and islands formed around them.  A relatively small amount of money would remove them and save further flooding in that village.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council are anxious to do this.  I discovered a drainage scheme had been arranged half way between the villages of Duleek and Julianstown and that the council are responsible for cutting weeds and cleaning grass out of the river.  I do not know what good that does but that has been the system.  Yet, above and below, the river could be blocked by trees and they cannot do anything about it.  Meath County Council are prepared to do this work if they are given the right. Is there any way the Office of Public Works could discuss this issue and the expenditure of the relatively small sum <Col N="1639" /> of money necessary to prevent this valuable property being flooded?  These houses were bought on SDA or building society loans.  If this work were carried out, flooding of these homes would be prevented.  This is a simple matter.  If the Minister looks at it he will agree it is something which could and should be done.</P>
    <P>Some people are under the impression that once a river is cleaned under the arterial drainage scheme flooding will never happen again.  I know that is not so.  We have a typical example in Navan town, where there was excessive flooding for many years.  The OPW drained the Boyne and for a number of years there has not been bad flooding, but there still has been some flooding.  The area between Navan and Drogheda has not yet been done.  I do not believe the cleaning of the Boyne in that area will relieve the flooding in the streets of Navan, but this matter should be examined again by the OPW and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>Tidal waters come four or five miles up the river and when it is in spate it has an effect on the amount of flooding which occurs upstream.  I know the OPW are tightly tied by regulations as to what they can and cannot do, but an effort should be made to release some of those regulations and to allow work to be done which would relieve or prevent this flooding.</P>
    <P>I had experience of a road at Clonee which flooded every year and caused great inconvenience to people using the main Dublin-Cavan road.  All kinds of suggestions were made, including one from the Minister's colleague that we should dig a hole in a field and let the water run into it; but everyone knew that would not be very effective.  Because the water of the Tolka would eventually go down to the East Wall the then Minister for Local Government, a Dublinman, was not very anxious to allow anything to be done which would mean extra water coming into Dublin.  Eventually Meath County Council discovered there was a blockage &mdash; a fallen tree around which an island had formed &mdash; between Clonee <Col N="1640" /> and the city.  We came to the Minister and after a great deal of persuasion got him to agree that it could be removed. That happened about 15 years ago and there has not been any flooding on that road since.  This is the type of thing which could be dealt with in many areas by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to this House.  The trouble with this House is that like many other old houses &mdash; and this is something the Minister will have to take cognisance of &mdash; schools, hospitals and so on, it is in a dangerous condition at present because the fire escapes are very bad.  In my opinion the law is being broken not just by the present Government but by their precedessors and the position will get worse if additional Members come here because there is not enough office accommodation.  Not alone are members working five, six and seven in a room, but the accommodation for the staff servicing them is overcrowded. No outside concern would be allowed to carry on under the conditions allowed here.  Something must be done about this as a matter of urgency.  This problem should not be passed over because it was inherited.  That is what we did, but I do not think it was the right solution.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the entrances to this House.  Today I was looking at the wall being built at one of the entrances. I do not know if it is intended to let the gardaí use it as a shelter, but if that is not intended, the wall is not improving the situation.  We have come a long way from the little tin hut at the gate which had room for only two or three people, but we have not gone far enough.  More accommodation will have to be made available for Members, staff and visitors. On a fine day it is all right if a group of children have to wait outside, but if it is a bad day it does not make a very good impression on them.  These may be only minor matters, but they are of extreme importance and should get attention. People throughout the country occasionally read documents such as this and wonder what they are all about.  They see how much it is proposed to spend on embassies abroad and houses for officials and then look at the relatively small amount <Col N="1641" /> which would be required to bring offices here up to date.</P>

      <P>There has been much talk about the new post office due to be built this year in Navan.  No estimate has been made as to the cost but the provision is £30,000.  A new post office in Mullingar, which is smaller than Navan, will cost £500,000.  If the Navan post office is to be built this year at a cost of only £30,000 we should be able to build houses for all the people who need them.</P>

      <P>The Minister may listen but he will not take action.  I wish to refer first of all to the heating system which is rarely at the right temperature. This building is either excessively hot or too cold.  Can the Minister give some reason for the inability to control the level of heat?  I have posed this question many times without receiving an answer. The system is becoming progressively worse in the new block.  Whoever was employed to erect this building certainly did a poor job.  Ninety per cent of the Members complain that working conditions are almost intolerable due either to excessive heat or lack of sufficient heat. A large number of people are employed here and they have also complained. Once again I ask the Minister to examine the problem.  If this debate did nothing else but achieve a solution to this problem it would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second problem is the overcrowded conditions in which Members have to work.  I also include staff and Senators.  Office holders such as Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle and the <Col N="1642" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle have rather comfortable conditions.</P>

      <P>I know that the Ceann Comhairle and the Ministers are fairly well accommodated but this does not apply to ordinary Members.</P>
      <P>I was elected to a committee to investigate the working conditions of Members of my party.  In the room in which I work there are five other Deputies and one secretary and we have been promised a second secretary.  In the adjoining room there are six Deputies and two secretaries. That is on the third floor of the new block.  Other rooms there are also overcrowded and about 14 Deputies and Senators work in the main party room which is very often used for committee meetings, parliamentary party meetings and meetings with outside groups.  It can be fairly said that accommodation for these people is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>On the second floor of the old building a number of our Deputies and Senators have been assigned quarters.  In one room there are six Members and two secretaries and in another room &mdash; the most overcrowded in the House &mdash; there are eight Members and two secretaries. There is another room which is a little worse.  It accommodates nine Members and two secretaries.  I assume it is the Office of Public Works and the Minister of State who are responsible for providing us with accommodation.  He has failed to do that.  I know some changes were made over the years but they are minimal. It is time that proper office accommodation was made available for all Members of the House regardless of their party.  As regards secretarial assistants  party we have a total of 14&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards the Dunkellin, this is a small drainage scheme.  The total catchment area is 91,000 acres.  The amount that can be classified as severely flooded is 14,500 acres.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter.  It seems to be a feature of Dáil life nowadays to have to seek Adjournment Debates on inefficiencies in many Government Departments.  We have had Social Welfare during the past few weeks and it is still going on.  We have had to seek additional information in regard to PAYE, birth certificates and so on.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked the Minister for the Public Service about the number of civil servants and I was told there are 30,000 more than there were ten years ago.  Yet it seems that every service in direct contact with and supposed to be of service to the public is much worse than it ever has been.  This applies particularly to the Dublin city and county postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience of all my colleagues throughout the city and county &mdash; Deputy Quinn endorsed that <Col N="1646" /> earlier, and I am sure that if the Minister consults his Deputies in the two areas they will tell him the same thing &mdash; that frequently it takes five days to have a letter delivered, and sometimes longer. The usual delivery time is three days.</P>
    <P>I want to know what has happened. When I was a young fellow in Dublin we were all poor.  In pre-computer days we could post a letter before 11 a.m. and it would be delivered that evening.  We had three deliveries per day.  We are now lucky to have one and luckier still if the post is delivered at all.  The Minister can &ldquo;tut-tut&rdquo; all he likes, but this is a major problem.  I asked him at Question Time to check to see if there is any merit in what I had been saying.  He refused, saying there was not any need to check. Deputies are not putting down questions for nothing on matters that do not need checking.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem in the Dublin city and county postal service &mdash; I do not know what the position is in the rest of the country.  As I told the Minister earlier, I resorted to a checking system: I sent myself a letter with a batch I was sending out from my office.  I have frequent complaints from my constituents that they had not got letters even though I might have written to them sometimes nine days earlier.  Many of my Christmas cards, which I posted a week before Christmas, did not arrive until 9 January. If the Minister likes I will bring these letters to him.</P>
    <P>All I want to achieve is to get it into the Minister's head that there is a major problem so that he will not be coming in here telling us there is not.  It seems to me that this is a part of a bigger jigsaw, a general breakdown in the public service. As the Minister tried to impute to me at Question Time, I do not blame the staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, either postal or administrative, any more than I blame the staff in the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Health where there are queues for birth certificates.  I know the staff are doing their best.  The complaint is against the management, and the Government <Col N="1647" /> are the management and they are making a total mess of it.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to check with other Deputies and with business concerns in the city.  I had an appointment today at 2.30 with two Dublin businessmen. Deputy Kelly, who had put down the question could not be here and he asked me to come in on it.  When I went to meet them I apologised for my delay and explained why I was late, and they told me &mdash; one of them is a Fianna Fáil cumann member in Dublin South Central&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>He had business to discuss with me.  I will give the Minister his name and business if he likes.  Both told me that any letter which they want delivered reasonably promptly, or at all, they do not entrust to the postal service; they have it delivered by hand.</P>
      <P>I have not come in here to attack the Minister of State personally, or the Minister. I know they are busy, trying to do their best in a big Department.  However, I want to draw their attention to the fact that there is a problem in the areas I have mentioned and it has become particularly acute since the postal strike of 1979: the standard has not recovered to that level. The Minister need not be nodding his head &mdash; that is a fact.  Many of us in the House get invitations to this or that function, but the invitations arrive two or three days after the function has taken place.  It is not confined to Members on this side because many of my Fianna Fáil colleagues have had the same experience. Perhaps once or twice the organisers posted the invitations late, but when it happens frequently, and when it happens when a person has to resort to sending letters to himself in order to check the system, it is obvious that there is a massive problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that morale in the Post Office, at least in the postal delivery section, is lower than at any time even before the strike.  I would ask the Minister to comment on this.  During that prolonged strike, when there was a virtual lock-out <Col N="1648" /> of the men by the Government for 19 weeks, when the employees were nearly forced to starve, there was much bitterness and it seems to me it exists even today.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to say there is no problem.  If he does he will be showered with evidence of the problem that has existed and still exists.  It seems to be part of a general breakdown of the public services despite the fact that we are employing an additional 20,000 non-industrial public servants than was the case ten years ago.  In that sense the Government must take the blame.  They are the people who are presiding over this transdepartmental chaos.  We want something done about it.  If the Minister cannot do anything about the matter, let us hope there will be another government in power before long who will do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Killilea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply today and again after listening to Deputy Mitchell, I want to make one point very clear.  I did not say I would refuse to inquire.  What I said was that I try to monitor the postal services, if not daily at least weekly.  That is the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the talk of trans-departmental failure suggested by the Deputy, I should like to state some facts.  For the Dublin city postal services, in mid-1980 we had an 80 per cent first-class delivery, that is letters posted today and delivered tomorrow morning.  Towards the end of 1980 we had an 85 per cent next day delivery of first-class mail.  Following Christmas and up to 5 February we had a 90 per cent next day delivery of first-class mail.  To prove that point I should like to inform the House that the amount of mail posted just now in Dublin which the Dublin city postal services dealt with, is 20 per cent above average, despite the atmosphere of gloom and doom Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Kelly and others have tried to create.  At Question Time today I did not deny that we had a specific problem in Deputy Kelly's area, thinking that was the district about which he was asking the question.  I acknowledged that <Col N="1649" /> there was a problem but we have solved it.  Delivery of mail will improve every day in this city.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the number of postings in the city.  In mid-1980 some 750,000 units per day were posted on one day and nearly all delivered the following day.  Would it not be far better for the Deputy to accept that there are difficulties because the postal service is getting larger, which is what we want.  Will he not acknowledge that an increase of 20 per cent above normal in postings is bound to create certain difficulties?  I can assure him that those statistics stand.  I explained to the Deputy the monitoring task being carried out.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to make a complaint about a specific item he can ask me at any time, either privately or publicly.  I will look into the matter and deal with it as courteously and efficiently as I can.  All Fine Gael Deputies know that I try to do this but I get little appreciation from them.</P>

      <P>The monitoring is done weekly if not daily.  There is no doubt that we have problems, but that is not strange when one considers the size of <Col N="1650" /> the postal service.  It is a challenge we accept willingly.  We hope that some day we will have a 100 per cent first-class delivery service.  We have attained the figure of 90 per cent, the highest figure in the history of the State.  The Deputy should acknowledge what has been done. He should support and thank the people employed in the service.  Instead of which, he and others have come to this House in the past year insinuating that the technicians on the telecom side of the Department were not doing their job. However, when they discovered those people were doing their job they turned to the postal services.  I will not take that from the Deputy or from any Member of Fine Gael until he or they produce facts. It is easy to stand up here and say things but I have stated the facts.</P>

      <P>The facts stand for themselves. I will stand over them at any time, in this House or in any other place.  I should like the Deputy and others to show an appreciation of the work of the staff in the Department.  There have been difficult times but it is up to us to lift their morale.  That is our job.  The accusations and allegations from Fine Gael have made me so sick that I cannot believe the people will ever see fit to allow them to sit on this side of the House again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 18 March 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to the public telephones at Osprey Road and Orwell Park Estate.  Both kiosks were extensively damaged early in December 1980.  Repairs, which involved replacement of the equipment, were completed in early February.  Both boxes suffered further damage subsequently and they were replaced recently by boxes of a more durable design.</P>

Service will be offered to waiting applicants as the necessary cable becomes available.  Depending on their location applicants will be connected to existing exchanges at Tallaght and Terenure and to the new exchange to be provided at Crumlin later this year.</P>

As service was with-drawn in March 1980, credit for rental in respect of the period April to December, 1980, will be allowed in the final account now being prepared, as will also credit for £1.22 in respect of trunk calls incorrectly debited to him, the total amount due being £294.91.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall, from my reply to related questions tabled by him on 23 October 1980, that I am aware that General Pinochet proposes to rule Chile for one or more additional eight-year terms.  This decision was taken as a result of the constitutional referendum held on 11 September 1980, a referendum which clearly did not follow the accepted requirements of democracy.  It appears that the human rights situation in Chile has deteriorated since September 1980 and that the authorities have little intention of returning the country to democratic rule.  As before, I condemn the regime in Chile and the anti-democratic manner in which the constitutional referendum of last September was held.</P>
      <P>In recent years Ireland has co-sponsored United Nations resolutions calling for the restoration of human rights in Chile.  Indeed, Ireland has co-sponsored a resolution on human rights and fundamental freedoms in Chile at the current session of the UN Commission on Human Rights being held in Geneva.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government <Col N="1601" /> will take all measures open to us with the EEC and the UN to help restore democracy to the people of Chile.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the average rent and maintenance subsidy in respect of each local authority house is not readily available in my Department.  The cost of maintaining and managing their rented estates is met by housing authorities by way of rental income, a proportion of the proceeds of sales of houses to tenants and the balance from the authorities' own resources.</P>
      <P>The direct Exchequer subsidy for local authority housing meets in full the loan charges incurred by authorities in the provision of houses for letting irrespective of whether or not these houses are subsequently sold to the tenants.  The following table gives details for the years in question of the number of rented dwellings and the cost to the Exchequer of subsidising local authority housing which, as indicated above, relates to the loan charges on all houses provided for 'etting:&mdash;</P>
