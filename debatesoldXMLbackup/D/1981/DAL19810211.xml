      <P>May I put three questions to the Taoiseach on the one subject?  My motion, No. 8 on the Order Paper, was No. 79 yesterday&mdash;it seems to be going backwards.  Will the Taoiseach, if possible, arrange with the Whips that this motion be taken during Government time, having regard to its importance and urgency?  Alternatively, would the Taoiseach arrange to have the terms of the motion accepted in order to save time? Will he admit that a mistake has been made in this case and have this grave injustice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the last couple of sitting days you have allowed Deputy Bruton to ask questions whose purpose was to unpick items in various Estimates which Deputy Bruton regarded as not credible.  I put down a question with the same object, bearing not just on the Estimates but on an item in the Minister's budget speech in which he saved himself an item of £200 million by estimating it as the likely contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Browne to move his motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Issue of Writ:" RHead="Motion">
    <Title>Issue of Writ: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, No. 5 on the Order Paper in my name:</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil following on the resignation of Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, a member for the constituency of North Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I hope that the fact that it is nearly 30 years ago since I moved a motion for the issuing of a writ for a by-election will emphasise to all Deputies that I have not taken this decision lightly.  On both sides of the House there is little difference between us that the Republic is in a state of economic crisis pretty well unprecedented in the history of the State.  I make the concession that we are all guilty in this matter.  In the media and here in the House we all have been preoccupied with general election speculation.</P>
      <P>It might have been presumptuous for an Independent Deputy to usurp the power of the Government by moving the writ, but I believe the delay in this matter is part of the general election manoeuvring which has been taking place for a long time.  We all know, and above everybody else the Taoiseach has known for at least a year, that Deputy O'Kennedy was likely to be going to Europe and that a vacancy in Dáil membership would then be created.  Therefore it seems to me that there should not have been even the delay which is usual when a vacancy arises in Dáil membership, occasioned by the death of one of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, it was noticeable on the occasion of the regretted death of the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Brennan, that we had little or no delay in the moving of the writ.  After what I will call the palace revolution in Fianna Fáil, the replacement of Deputy Lynch by Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach, there was at first <Col N="1462" /> the trickle of a debate about a general election and this became intensified on the Government side after the Donegal by-election.  Since then this has eased on the Government side and it is in full spate now on the Opposition side, understandably following the budget&mdash;I, personally, have taken part in this and I do not try to exculpate myself.  There has been preoccupation with a debate about tactics among us here.</P>
    <P>Yet we are all in agreement with the people, the electorate, that things have never been more serious, that there is a condition of near crisis, with unemployment up by 30 per cent, the appalling debt load which the PAYE income just about meets, the trade union movement worried about the prospects of new national wage negotiations in the autumn.  The Government seem to be distracted from their job, and I do not blame Ministers feeling they should be looking over their shoulders.  The necessary work is not being done in the Departments of Health and Education and various other Departments and there is a general feeling of stagnation in the Government and in the country.  It is my belief that the people do not understand why there is delay in the moving of this writ and that there is preoccupation with and speculation about the proposed general election.</P>
    <P>This Government have been in office for three years and they have had an unprecedented strength and power in their majority.  They could pass any law; they could provide any remedy.  They still have their majority and the best part of 18 months to run but we are all wondering whether they know that the position is so serious that they are afraid to face the country and are running away because they have no solution for the problems of the next three or four years should they be re-elected, no more than they have had such solutions in the past.</P>
    <P>There is much worse to come.  They say that ours is a small open economy and this is the reason for our disastrous present situation.  What do they propose to do to change that reality?  The sad truth is that, up to the present at any rate&mdash;possibly it is one of the disabilities <Col N="1463" /> of Opposition&mdash;the Opposition have not provided a solution either, with the exception of the Labour Party's socialist programme put forward at their conference which, alas, is unlikely to be implemented in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will accept that I have given him very considerable latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing strictly with the moving of the writ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Whatever the fears, whatever the truth, whatever the reality and whether it is the threat of the very angry farmers, there is only one person who can clear up the doubts and end the speculation in the press and among politicians and the rest. If the Taoiseach intends to go his full time he should say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should note that we are not dealing with the general election but with the moving of a writ for a North Tipperary by-election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government intend to go to the country they should do so but if they do not intend to go to the country they must not continue to deny the people of North Tipperary their proper representation. The Taoiseach should now let us know that he is going to support the motion and face the music of the farmers or the Opposition or the discontented electorate following his budget in the very representative constitutency of North Tipperary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, Deputy O'Kennedy's resignation took place just over a month ago.  I might mention that when Deputy Richard Burke resigned in similar circumstances in January 1977 to take up his appointment as a Commissioner in the European Economic community there was no great rush on the part of the present Opposition parties to move the writ to fill the vacancy caused by Deputy Burke's resignation.  In fact, they never moved the writ at all.  They allowed the vacancy to continue until the general election in June 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By-elections are a necessary and essential part of the parliamentary process.  We on this side of the House have no hesitation in initiating them if they are justified and necessary but that can hardly be said in the present case.  Is there any real need to interrupt our parliamentary programme for the holding of a by-election to elect a Deputy who will sit in this House for, at most, just over a year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be allowed to continue without <Col N="1465" /> interruption.  I ask Deputies on both sides of the House to allow him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of Tipperary are represented in this House by five Deputies, two of whom represent North Tipperary, so they cannot be regarded as being seriously deprived of representation. The outcome of the by-election could not have any effect on the voting situation in this House.  As the by-election in Donegal last November &mdash; I hope the Opposition have not forgotten it&mdash; provided a recent opportunity for the people to give a verdict on the policies and performance of the Government and Opposition it cannot be suggested that there is any serious public demand for a further test of public opinion at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not in the past couple of weeks moved this writ in deference to the normal courtesy which leaves this matter to the Government if they act within a reasonable time, the Opposition intervening if there appears to be an inordinate delay.  Nevertheless when Deputy Browne moved the writ we determined to support it and the grounds he gave for moving it were certainly cogent.  Everything other than the questions of practice and procedure were in favour of the action he took.  In the face of the compelling case he made it seems right to us to support it in the hope that we might influence the Taoiseach towards the broader decision in relation to a general election.</P>
      <P>I note that the words the Taoiseach has chosen are a clear implication that not alone was this writ not to be moved now but that it was not to be moved on this side of the general election.  That was said in terms which seemed to imply, almost regardless of the length of time between now and the general election.  I have not heard that said in those terms in this House before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fact that in May 1977, four years ago, in similar circumstances we did not move the writ for the by-election on the appointment of Deputy Richard Burke as a Commissioner of the European Communities.  I <Col N="1466" /> would remind the Taoiseach that the situation then was somewhat different.  The Government that had been in power had taken decisive action in the previous couple of years.  That action had moved the economy from stagnation into a growth rate of 5½ per cent, three times the highest in the EEC, and the Government had brought inflation down at a rate which in 18 months was to bring it to its lowest level for many years, to 6½ per cent.  That Government had also started the process of bringing unemployment down and it had been falling for the previous six months, though not at the rate at which it has been rising for the last year during which time 17,500 more people have become unemployed or are on short-time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that he is moving a considerable distance from the motion before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to answer the Taoiseach's political charge in the matter.  We had in that budget of 1977 brought borrowing down from 16½ per cent of GNP two years earlier to 10½ per cent of GNP.  In those circumstances there was no compelling demand or need for a general election, as the country was being governed.  In the present circumstances the exact opposite is happening under all these headings.  The country is not being governed and when three-and-a-half years of neglect have left it in its present chaos, there is a case for a general election.  There is, therefore, a case for a by-election and there is certainly a case for supporting Deputy Browne's motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We also support the motion by Deputy Noel Browne for the by-election, although I do not think that a by-election would make any substantial <Col N="1467" /> contribution towards getting the country out of the difficulties to which it was brought by the policies that have been pursued so vigorously by the present Government and particularly by the present Taoiseach.  By their policies they have created an unprecedented crises.  The only hope, and it is not even a great hope, that the ordinary people have is for that Government to go out of office at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>That hardship and misery will be intensified for every day that the Government stay in office.  There is no overnight cure for the difficulties and the chaos they have caused in our national economic affairs, but there is a hope that there can be a way out of the difficulties. Deputy Browne, in moving the writ, was generous enough to indicate that the only hope of getting out of those difficulties is contained in a programme which was adopted by this party last October at its general conference.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has clearly indicated that he is running away from the by-election.  But, even if it were held, it would not cure the difficulties which Fianna Fáil have brought to the country.  However, it would give the people of North Tipperary an opportunity to express what I am convinced would be shared by their fellow citizens throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  They will reject the Fianna Fáil candidate in the by-election as they will at the first possible opportunity reject the Fianna Fáil Government in the next general election.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that because of the failure of the National Coalition Government to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Deputy Richard Burke, in similar circumstances, he has an excuse for a deliberate delay in giving the people of North Tipperary their constitutional right of full parliamentary representation. They are being deprived of that and that shows contempt not alone for those people but contempt for the full legal and constitutional representation of the House.  We all believe in parliamentary democracy and in the full implementation of the rights of our democratic institutions and the Taoiseach has not produced <Col N="1471" /> any justification as to why immediate steps should not be taken to give the people of the areas I mentioned, who are suffering as a result of the loss of what they considered to be an enthusiastic and energetic Deputy, proper representation here.

      <P>There is no need for me to go into North Tipperary because the people there leave their constituency to seek the parliamentary services of Deputies outside that constituency. That is constitutionally wrong.  The Taoiseach has told us that he is ignoring the plea for the filling of the seat because the National Coalition Government did not immediately fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Deputy Richard Burke.  I should like to assure the Taoiseach that there are many other examples of good Government, the headline of which was set by the National Coalition Government, which he would be well advised to copy just as he is endeavouring to do in relation to this matter.  There is no justification for depriving the people of North Tipperary of their legal and constitutional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy FitzGerald and <Col N="1472" /> other Members in asking the Taoiseach to throw off the shackles of cowardice and come forward and have the by-election so that the people of North Tipperary can get their proper representation here.  By failing to fill the vacancy the Taoiseach is guilty of an effort to flout democracy seriously.  He is showing contempt for the full membership of the House as a democratic institution which should be protected.  A good example should be set by the Government.  This is a vital matter because not alone is it an effort to deprive the people of North Tipperary of representation but it is also an effort to flout the rights of the House to full representation.  It is wrong and unjust to do so and for that reason the Taoiseach should not lose any time in giving the people of that constituency their right to their spokesman, irrespective of the party he or she represents, in this House.  To deprive them of that representation is wrong constitutionally and it is wrong in the interests of a display of concern for the people.  I have been a Member of this House for many years but never before have I seen such pressure on all Deputies as they are experiencing at present.</P>
    <P>Full representation in Parliament is necessary so that the public are given the services they are entitled to.  They should be given such representation so that efforts can be made to set right the many wrongs that exist.  It will not be possible to set those things right without the assistance of full parliamentary representation. I hope the Taoiseach will reconsider his attitude.  He has not given an adequate explanation as to why the people of North Tipperary cannot have full representation. His excuse was a sham.  I have no doubt that he went to considerable trouble and carried out a lot of research to prepare the statement he made this morning in an effort to have an excuse for failing to hold the by-election. As a Deputy from an adjoining constituency I should like to state that it is wrong that the people of North Tipperary should be deprived of their proper representation. For the Government to continue that state of affairs indefinitely is <Col N="1473" /> wrong and unjust.  I join with other speakers in appealing to the Government to change their attitude and have the vacancy filled.  Irrespective of who is elected, the Government should ensure that the full terms of the Constitution in relation to parliamentary representation are complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Taoiseach has decided to adopt this cavalier attitude to the rights of the electorate and the opportunity for an elected representative to enter this House.  In my opening few words I mentioned the Government's majority of 20 and the authority and power that the majority gives them.  Is it not very sad that it should be used by the Taoiseach against the electorate of North Tipperary to deprive them of their right under the Constitution?</P>
      <P>I do not think the significance of the Taoiseach's decision will pass unnoticed. Everybody remembers the whole episode when the Taoiseach won power and his remarkable contribution in winning the Donegal by-election, the amount of energy time and work he put into it, the enormous gratification and satisfaction he achieved in winning the Donegal by-election and the value that was to him and to his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we not all know full well that, if the Taoiseach and his party knew if they moved the writ and went down to North Tipperary they would win the by-election in spite of the budget and in spite of T. J. <Col N="1474" /> Maher, they would gladly do so?  It must be unprecedented for a Government who swept into power in the way the Fianna Fáil Party did under Deputy Jack Lynch, with a magnificent majority of 20, to find themselves, under a different leader&mdash;and possibly because they are under a different leader&mdash;now cowering behind Deputy Jack Lynch's majority of 20 and defending themselves against the electorate of North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The problems now facing the country are much too serious to be allowed to continue.  The Taoiseach's decision in refusing to honour his responsibility as the leader of the Government and to allow the by-election to go ahead is reprehensible and shaming, with all his authority and power.  As on so many other occasions where he could act on the various aspects of Government&mdash;in health, education, housing, and so on&mdash;he has used his power to see that nothing gets done.  He is a true conservative.</P>

      <P>I was speaking yesterday about the 125,000 people on the unemployed register.  We can add to that 10,000 people who are on short-time. Within the next few months there will be another 40,000 school leavers.  As far as the unemployment figure is concerned it will get a lot worse before it gets better. The magical figure of 150,000, which has never been surpassed, is likely to be surpassed under this Government.  Listening to the Minister for Finance introducing <Col N="1477" /> the budget I wondered if we were doing the right thing as far as unemployment is concerned.  We are in a recession and foreign industrialists who had been induced to come here are leaving because of that.  What we should endeavour to do is look at our natural resources as far as fisheries, forestry and tourism are concerned.</P>
      <P>It is hard to realise how much the tourist industry is suffering under the present Government.  Last year was probably the worst year it had.  Before 1980 the forecasts were that it would have its best year. At the end of 1980 all the tourist experts admitted that it was one of the worst years the industry had experienced.  During the week Bord Fáilte estimated that in 1981 the industry would show a growth rate of 8 per cent and they said that tourists would come from Great Britain. They mentioned the fact that the £IR is worth 74p against sterling and that this should induce English tourists to come here.  The troubles more than anything else have probably hindered English tourists from coming to Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is now 18 months since Lord Mount-batten was murdered, an event many English people have not forgotten even now.  I would be very wary that we could increase our tourist revenue from Great Britain.  I hope Bord Fáilte are right in their estimations but I doubt them particularly as we are basing everything on the devaluation of the punt.  I was very disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not give some type of incentive to the tourist industry.  In the past two years hoteliers and guesthouse owners have been seeking some new ideas by way of inducing more people to come here on holiday.  What have we seen?  Petrol has been increased recently by 15p a gallon, as has the price of cigarettes and drink in the recent budget.  This in no way helps an ailing tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, when I am speaking this time next year, I will have been proved wrong but I am afraid our tourist industry is in for another very severe year as far as numbers are concerned.  Last year the figures were down not only for English tourists.  Americans did not come in such <Col N="1478" /> great numbers and neither did the Germans or Scandinavians.  The message being brought home to people in the tourist industry is that we are gradually pricing ourselves out of the market.  Anybody travelling abroad visiting countries like Germany, France and Scandinavia &mdash; noted to be expensive tourist countries &mdash; will have noticed that a lot of their commodities are cheaper than ours at present.  I know people contend that the devaluation of the punt is really against sterling and not against the other EMS currencies.  Can anybody explain to me why it should be that when one changes £100 in sterling or £100 in Irish money one still gets 30 per cent less for one`s money regardless of the currency one is changing one's money into.  Surely the proof of devaluation is the amount one gets for one's £100.</P>
    <P>In regard to the EEC I wonder sometimes have we, as a nation, gone completely mad.  The EEC are able to tell us that we cannot put import duties on goods coming in here.  Import levies are gradually being reduced which means an awful lot of goods are imported completely free of duty, most from Great Britain, but some quantity from other continental countries.  In border counties this is particularly noticeable in that one sees so many of our traditional &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;&mdash; industries now in trouble.  For example, there is the footwear industry, textiles and bakeries in respect of which one sees bread coming in from Northern Ireland. It is unbelievable that in an agricultural country like this 25 per cent of the eggs consumed in Southern Ireland are imported or dumped here from Northern Ireland.  We have also concrete products and electrical goods being imported from Northern Ireland.  We must ask how many cars are manufactured in this country. The position is that practically all of the cars sold here are imported ready-made. What about frozen foods? Ninety-eight per cent of the entire consumption of frozen fish here is imported from other countries.  For instance, it is incredible that most of the chickens eaten here are imported also.  If one looks along supermarket shelves one sees large quantities <Col N="1479" /> of English, Scottish and continental biscuits competing with brands like Jacobs and Bolands.</P>
    <P>One only has to go into any large supermarket today to see the amount of goods being imported.  Of course the supermarket bosses themselves are largely to blame because they are not really promoting Irish commodities.  They are interested only in getting goods at the cheapest possible price regardless of the consequences for the economy.  I ask myself: have we really gone mad in that we are not endeavouring to impose some kind of levy on such imported goods? Certainly this is affecting our employment prospects and some part of the 125,000 people at present unemployed have been hit directly by such imports. Sixty per cent of the goods we use or food we eat is at present imported.  And it is not sufficient merely to ask our people to buy more Irish.  It is up to our Ministers when they go to Brussels not to allow this free market situation to obtain, allowing the larger countries to use Ireland as a dumping ground, as they are doing in regard to chickens and eggs at present.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise this point by elaborating somewhat on the egg situation in Northern Ireland.  At present 25 per cent of the eggs consumed in Southern Ireland are imported from Northern Ireland even though the punt is worth only 74p against sterling which means that already they are trading at a 26 per cent disadvantage. Were it not for that fact every egg farm in Southern Ireland would be bankrupt today.  If one traces the history of this industry one sees that in Northern Ireland egg producers receive grants for their sheds and machinery which the Southern Ireland producer does not.  Up to very recently the same industry in Northern Ireland also received a subsidy on their meal which meant that the meal fed to their stock was at a cheaper rate than that at which the Southern producer could purchase his.  The Northern Ireland producer used to export the bulk of his eggs to England.  In the last two years there have been large markets available, particularly in the Middle East, when the English have at times, quoted a price to <Col N="1480" /> supply that market.  Any time that English egg producers could not avail of the Southern Arabian market there was a glut on their own market which, in turn, meant that Northern Ireland producers could not supply the English market. Therefore those Northern Ireland producers dumped their surpluses down here leading to the erosion of our market. That has been allowed to continue.  I see the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture sitting opposite, I would draw his attention to this very unfair competition. I am trying to highlight one point only.  This practice should not have been allowed to continue.  It is ludicrous that one in every four eggs consumed in this country at present is imported. Indeed one could easily name 250 articles in respect of which jobs are being affected here.  It is high time that our Ministers stood up to their EEC counterparts, stating that they will not allow this practice to continue because it is affecting our job situation and economy generally.</P>
    <P>As far as manufacturing is concerned, I do not have to tell the House that every other country in Europe is working on lower overheads in relation to diesel, fuel oil and petrol.  I do not have to tell the House that we have the most expensive telephone and postage stamp set-up in Europe.  We are paying more for insurance contributions than any other European country.  We are gradually pricing ourselves out of business.  I can see no sense in allowing those goods to come into our country.  The result is that factories are closing.  Factories, like Hanson in Sligo, which were welcomed with a fanfare and were expected to give employment not only to the people in the immediate area but to people from three or four counties, are on short time and near to bankruptcy.  GT Carpets had to close because of the cheaper carpets coming from the North.  I could name at least 16 factories in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>But we have natural resources that are not being used.  In regard to forestry we are exporting timber at £1 per ton to the Swedes because we have not got the processing plants here to process it.  We are offering £125 an acre to private forestry to encourage them to grow more trees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> We have to do something far more radical. Last year the Minister did not even reach his planting target of 25,000 acres and that is the minimum target that any Minister should be interested in replanting. He tells us that there is yet another plan.  Every day we hear about plans but we are not seeing any action.  The latest is that there is a new plan whereby the EEC will give pound for pound to develop another 50,000 acres in the underdeveloped areas over a ten-year period.  It is high time that the State itself started to look at the forestry industry and, as private industrialists do not seem to be making a go of the State forests, the State should decide to plant, thin out and set up large saw milling enterprises and processing of timber and market it here. The forestry is the most neglected industry we have here and it is an industry where we could probably give work to 10,000 more people.</P>
    <P>This budget has proved that we have borrowed to spend.  Some day I would like to see a Minister borrowing to invest in national resources, to make use of all these wonderful resources that we have, to secure full employment based on something long term.  The three most long term things in Ireland at present are forestry, fisheries and tourism.  The Government should give the other industrialists that come in here from abroad the right incentives by making sure that our products are at the right price and putting a stop to all these terrible imports coming in from other countries that are so damaging to our economy.</P>

      <P>Most speakers have dealt in fairly considerable detail with the various items both in the budget and not in the budget according to their taste.  I would like to spend the bulk of my time in a more general context because it is important that we should not lose sight of the role the budget should play in the operation of the economy. The easiest way to summarise that basic point is to say that the budget is not and should never be simply an exercise in economic arithmetic.  On the contrary it is a political act in the best sense of that term in that at any time the economy will <Col N="1482" /> have a number of different conflicts, problems, issues, arising within it.  It is the task of the Government of the day to deal with these problems as adequately and as fairly as they can.  That whole prospect of trying to deal with conflicting things and various outstanding problems, seeking to strike a sensible and reasonable balance among those conflicting pressures, is the essential task of the politicians in an elected assembly.</P>
      <P>The budget is one of the main instruments by which a Government can undertake one of these acts of political concensus. It is an element of helping to resolve conflicts within society by peaceful means.  So what is the context of this year's budget?  We can all agree on the main problems facing the country at this time.  We know the pressures on the inflationary front.  We know the problems of rising unemployment.  We know the difficulties of achieving some sort of balance in our external payments with the rest of the world and we know too that because of the international recession there has been little if any improvement in living standards and hence we want to see a resumption of growth in output and living standards at the earliest possible date. We can all agree that these are the main economic problems confronting the country.  We know too that in any attempt to tackle these problems we want to see the solutions dealt with and taking a form that will win acceptance throughout the community as being reasonable and fair among all the different sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What then should we say about the budget as it has sought to deal with these problems this year?  Here I was fascinated by the approach which Opposition speakers were adopting because to my mind they have been behaving in a two-faced manner.  One could go further, in that in some instances I would suggest that they are almost being deliberately dishonest because, while it is easy to recognise the problems, it is not so easy to come up with satisfactory solutions.  Indeed, I know of no set of policy measures which will solve all of those problems simultaneously in a satisfactory way.  In other words the Government of the day must <Col N="1483" /> make a choice among those conflicting problems, must decide what their order of priority is going to be and it is no service to democracy or to the task of satisfactorily overcoming those problems to have Opposition speakers both running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.</P>
    <P>Why do I say this is what they have been doing?  We could summarise the requirements of dealing with these problem by saying that if we are to resume growth and if we are to bring down the level of inflation we need to find some way of curbing excess spending, on the one hand, especially on imports, and on the other hand, find ways of increasing output here in Ireland.  If the Government are to help that process through the budget, that will call for selective additional spending.  On the other hand, we know there will be claims for giving relief to some sectors of the economy that were experiencing difficulties, the two main sections being social welfare recipients and the farming community.  Everybody agrees that improvements in social welfare benefits were needed so that the weaker sections of the community would not suffer any reduction in their living standards as a result of price rises.</P>
    <P>Farming had gone through a very difficult period in the last two years and there were very special circumstances which suggested that specific financial reliefs should be given.  Action of that kind requires either extra Government spending by improving social welfare benefits and so on or reducing the amount of tax revenue the Government are seeking. In the case of farming the Government reduced or abolished some of the tax burdens confronting farmers.</P>
    <P>So much for those conflicting approaches.  What were the Opposition saying? They said on the one hand we had not given enough, whether to farmers or PAYE taxpayers, or we had not spent enough through the provisions made in the Estimates or in specific areas. If we were to tot up the various implied remarks from Opposition speakers on these heads we would come up with a frightening total to which I will refer in <Col N="1484" /> detail later.  At the same time that they were demanding more Government spending or more tax cuts they were castigating the Government for failing to bring about a sufficient reduction in the level of Government borrowing.  Phrases were used like &ldquo;restoring order to public finance&rdquo; but whatever the precise language we know what was intended &mdash; that the level of Government borrowing, which we know has been running at an unsustainably high level in recent years, ought to be reduced at the earliest possible date.  Of course we cannot simultaneously reduce borrowing, cut taxes and increase Government spending.  This is where I accuse the Opposition of being two-faced.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples of the way they have been doing this.  Immediately after the Minister concluded his budget speech Deputy Bruton spoke of the problems for farming and referred to the measures introduced in the budget to give some relief.  He said:</P>
    <P>What does this budget do?  It offers them £29 million, a mere 5 per cent of what is needed.</P>
    <P>He had said:</P>
    <P>It has been calculated that to bring farmers back to the income position that they enjoyed relative to the rest of the community in 1978, a transfer of resources to agriculture of approximately £645 million would be needed.</P>
    <P>He then went on to describe £29 million as a mere 5 per cent, which in arithmetical terms it is.  I do not know how much Deputy Bruton would envisage as a satisfactory amount to offer farmers this year but I am sure he recognises it is not possible to offer them anything like £645 million.  Presumably he has a larger figure in mind, and he is certainly holding out that prospect to the farming community.</P>
    <P>The next morning Deputy FitzGerald, the leader of the Fine Gael Party, in his contribution to the budget debate took a similar position.  He said:</P>
    <P>The farming community are, justifiably in my view, incensed that so little attention has been paid to their plight. <Col N="1485" /> If their income were to have retained in 1981 its 1978 purchasing power it would need to have been £635 million.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the Government could not find that sum this year and that any Government concerned about the hardships suffered by this important group would have made a serious attempt to alleviate these difficulties.  Again we are left with a clear presumption that a serious attempt would need a much larger sum of money.  If £29 million is a mere 5 per cent and if that is not a serious attempt we will have to pencil in a sum which is more substantial.  I see Deputy Bruton in the House and perhaps he can assist me.  He said £29 million is not enough; could we pencil in £100 million?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> Let us pencil in a mere £41 million extra to bring the tot up to £70 million. Deputy FitzGerald went on:</P>
    <P>I turn now to the PAYE sector.  Their claims to greater equity have been swept aside with contempt.</P>
    <P>A total of £60 million by way of PAYE concessions is regarded as contempt, and the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, shared a similar position.  He said the PAYE workers got £60 million, £40 million of which they got through industrial strength under the terms of the national understanding.  He said:</P>
    <P>The £20 million was a cosmetic exercise to try to doctor up the PAYE aspect of taxation and put some face on it.</P>
    <P>He went on to comment on the additional revenue which would come from the PAYE sector this year, which would be of the order of £140 million.</P>
    <P>I do not know what precise figure we would need to have this concerted so that the PAYE concessions would not be swept aside as contempt or as a mere cosmetic exercise, but from the context it would be not unreasonable to suggest that we would have to add on at least another £60 million or £80 million.  Let us put in £60 million with Deputy Bruton's £40 million, giving £100 million.</P>
    <P>There is also concern and disquiet expressed from the Fine Gael benches about the additional receipts from business taxation this year through bringing forward the payment date for corporation taxation, the clear indication being that that would not be done.  We can put down £66 million there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>I want to point out to Deputy Bruton, if he has not learned the fact, that the budget is a financial statement dealing with this year. Therefore, if one is going to talk in financial terms, one must begin with the budget as it is and one must talk about the finances in 1981.  I will be dealing with other years in due course.  We would not have been collecting that money this year if we were to accept the Fine Gael position. That puts us up to £166 million&mdash;£40 million for farming, £60 million for PAYE and £66 million for business taxation. With regard to the spending side, many Opposition Deputies, Deputy Bruton included, have been making the point that in their opinion the current Estimates do not make sufficient provision to meet costs this year.  A figure of £112 million was quoted by Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is the Estimates are totally dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The clear message is that the Opposition want to increase the current spending Estimates by at least £112 million.  That is the sum which in their view should be added on simply to maintain the existing level of services.  In addition, we had numerous statements and suggestions from spokesmen on different subjects about the inadequacy of the provisions in their areas. They spoke about the need for additional resources for the particular areas they were concerned about.  This is perfectly understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there is always a large number of possible areas in which improvements can be made.  There is never a shortage of scope for doing good works, there is simply a shortage of the necessary resources to pay for those good works.  If we are to take the suggestions which <Col N="1488" /> come from the educational field, from people like Deputy E. Collins for Fine Gael or Deputy Horgan for Labour, from the housing field, somebody from the Environment and so forth, we could reasonably add on at least another £30 million to £40 million as a minimum sum, which would probably be derisory in their opinion. I am sure we could put it in as a minimum sum which would have been needed to satisfy their statements.  That adds up to something of the order of an extra £300 million either by way of extra spending or by way of reduced taxation.</P>
    <P>That is what the Opposition wish the public to pay.  If they do not mean that, if they want to say that they would have brought in a budget which would have had a borrowing level the same as that put forward in the Minister's budget, or if they want to go further in the direction of restoring order in the public finances, to use their phrase, they need to show us where they would have made the alternative cutbacks or where they would have got the alternative additional tax revenue to satisfy those claims.  I believe they have not any such intention.  They were very coy on the subject of additional taxation with one or two exceptions on the Labour benches, to which I will come later.</P>
    <P>The message to me is absolutely clear. The Opposition were trying to hold out to the public that if they were in charge of the public finances they would have behaved more responsibly by having a smaller borrowing requirement, while at the same time they sought to pretend they would be able to spend more money under the various headings which I have taken as examples.  That is simply not possible and is simply not true.  It does no service to the House or to the people to continue that sort of pretence, hypocrisy and misleading statements.  That is all I propose to say about the Opposition's contributions to this year's budget, although naturally I will have remarks to make about their contributions of a more general nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one other contribution by Deputy FitzGerald.  He said he thought it was an extraordinary budget in the sense that the Minister had managed to please nobody.  He had not satisfied <Col N="1489" /> those who were making claims on him for additional spending or tax cuts and he had not managed to satisfy those who wished to see a greater reduction in the level of Government borrowing. Deputy FitzGerald is concerned because the Minister should have been able to do more to make his budget politically attractive or should have been able to do more to reduce the level of borrowing. What could he have done to make it more attractive?  When we look at the budget statement we find that the Minister made provision under two headings which he need not necessarily have done.  I do not believe the House would have criticised him if he had not made those provisions.</P>
    <P>On the capital side the Minister made a contingency provision of £70 million to cope with any additional possible demands that might arise in the course of the year.  Secondly, in the current budget he made a provision of £80 million for additional possible settlements of special claims for public sector pay, a total of £150 million.  I do not believe, judging from the tenor of the remarks from the Opposition benches, if the Minister had not made those provisions, there would not have been any criticism of him.  He would then have been in a position to reduce his borrowing requirement by that amount, a not inconsiderable reduction, almost 2 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The special pay increases cost £137 million last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the contributions from the Fine Gael benches that they felt there should not be any special pay increases in the public sector.  If there should not be any special pay increases this year there should not be any financial provision for them.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  That £150 million could have been used either as a contribution towards reducing the borrowing requirement or, if we turn to the other side of the account, if we want to be more politically popular, what could the Minister have done?  He could have settled for a borrowing figure similar or identical to the one he actually <Col N="1490" /> brought forward and instead have gone for a much lower level of taxation increases.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we could settle for 5p or 10p on the gallon of petrol instead of 15p. Perhaps we could settle for a modest 2p or 3p on the pint instead of 6p, and so forth.  All would have been perfectly plausible and all could have been done with the lower level of spending which would then be provided.  Therefore, quite clearly it was open to the Minister and the Government, had they so wished, to have done what Deputy FitzGerald and other speakers have implied should have been done, namely, that they should have dressed it up to make it politically more attractive, or, on the other hand, they could have made a bigger contribution towards lowering the borrowing requirements.</P>
      <P>Surely the fact that neither of those courses of action has been taken suggests that the Minister was not seeking the easy way out.  He was not going for the convenient, politically attractive solution which in the longer term would not have made any contribution towards restoring order to the public finances.  Equally, by going for the public borrowing approach, by leaving the higher levels of tax increase but at the same time not claiming that he was going to bring about a much greater reduction in the borrowing level this year, he was presumably setting himself more modest targets which therefore should be more easily attainable.  I find it curious that the Opposition should on the one hand want to hold out to the public the notion that they would have been far more generous than the Government and also at the same time imply that really the Minister ought to have done more to satisfy one or other section or group within the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn now from the question of the budget as a specific one-year financial statement and start to place it in its wider context.  We have the other problems, the way in which the budget can impact on the overall performance of the economy and in particular our concern at the way in which it affects employment, inflation and our balance of payments position.  A number of speakers chose to <Col N="1491" /> make references to the Fianna Fáil Manifesto of 1977 and the policies associated with it.  After that they were not quite so consistent.  Some of them felt that this budget was a continuation of those policies while others felt that it was a last desperate attempt to get free from what they saw as the wrong approach enshrined in that manifesto.  In the circumstances because some of these references were, quite simply, inaccurate, I think I ought to deal with a number of these points and set the record straight. One of the main concerns with the manifesto approach was to seek to do something about unemployment and secondly, almost as an equal priority, was to do it in a way that would reduce inflation.  The approach then was quite clear-cut in those terms: to increase employment, to reduce inflation and then, when those two objectives were being implemented and progress being made, we would get ourselves into a position to bring about a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirements.  In other words, it was a statement of objective and it gave the then order of priority for dealing with those problems.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers seem to be under the mistaken impression that no progress was made in achieving these results and that it was a failure in areas like employment.  That simply is not so. The facts are that not alone were the employment targets of the manifesto met, they were exceeded.  The latest statistics published by the Central Statistics Office just before Christmas are a dramatic revision of all the earlier statistics under this heading.  They show that not alone were earlier estimates for the period with which I am most interested, namely from 1977 onwards, inaccurate, but that the statistics for the earlier years, 1975-77, were also out of date.</P>
    <P>In fairness, let me put on the record that instead of, as was thought earlier, a fall in employment between 1975 and 1977, we know now that there was slight increase in those two years of about 15,000.  Much more important, what the new statistics show is that during the three years from April 1977 to April 1980 <Col N="1492" /> there was an increase in employment of 82,000 against the manifesto target of 75,000.  Therefore, I do not see how that can be regarded as a failure.  What it does show is that there can be a case for setting ambitious targets.  Those targets are described as unrealistically high, impossible to attain and so forth and how then could they be attained?  That is a point to which I want to return later.</P>
    <P>The more interesting part in some respects is that despite this dramatic increase in employment &mdash; and it is the first time since independence that we have seen any significant increase in employment &mdash; we now find ourselves faced with a higher level of unemployment than anyone had anticipated earlier. Quite apart from the effects of the recession in causing a loss of jobs in many industries, one of the other powerful reasons is the extraordinarily rapid increase in population.  Apparently nobody contemplated a population increase on the dramatic scale that took place in this country especially from about the mid-seventies onwards.  That means that, even though we have had an unprecedented level of progress in raising employment and putting more people to work, we also have an even greater demand for employment, an even greater number of people seeking work.  That is a measure of the problem, a measure of the challenge which this country faces in the whole area of employment and population policy.  As long as this rapid population growth continues we must face up to thinking in terms of either finding work for this population or contemplating a level of unemployment which would be frightening and which in relative terms would make what is going on in Britain at the moment like a sedate tea-party.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to take different stances on this question.  There are those who say that we should not try to think in terms of providing employment, that instead we should accept the fact that people may have to be educated to permanent leisure, to use the polite phrase, in other words, some form of life of enforced idleness.  It would take me too long and too far from the immediate putpose in hand to deal with that issue satisfactorily. <Col N="1493" /> The prospect of trying to arrange a society where only some people work and where a great number of people do not work &mdash; because there are no opportunities for them &mdash; strikes me as a recipe for social disaster rather than social progress.  I shudder to contemplate the frightening social evils and tensions which would arise in such a society. Whatever the difficulties of providing employment opportunities for all, it must be the route we follow if we are seriously concerned about having a future country worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>I will come back to that subject on future occasions but, obviously, not here today.  I wanted to read into the record that there has been substantial progress on the unemployment front during the period from 1977 to 1980.  It had more than met the targets which were set.  I wish to correct some of the mistaken statements which were made.  Deputy Keating said that according to the manifesto unemployment should have been reduced to 32,000 by 1980.  That is not so because the manifesto had no targets or numbers in it for the level of unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Indeed, there was some debate about it, as to whether the official figures were accurate or not.  We said they were not.  We also did not know what the true population figure was.  These latest statistics show that even we understated the size of the problem so we were perfectly correct in not putting an unemployment figure on it, and in not saying that unemployment <Col N="1494" /> would come down from 118,000, which was the Coalition peak, to 80,000 or 90,000 or any other figure because we knew the true figures for population in the labour force, whatever they were, were different from the ones which were being used at the time.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Bruton is going to keep interrupting I had better do the professor and point out that if he wants a pass mark he will have to do better than that because, quite apart from the people who were born in 1971, it is much more important to know the number of people who are migrating, whether immigrating or emigrating.  We now know that immigration has been one of the dramatic causes of the spectacular increase in the numbers of people in the labour force.  It is simply not true for Deputy Keating to say that we put figures in for levels of unemployment.  We did not.  We had spoken about the changes which we would make in the numbers of people at work.  That was the correct way to formulate it and it has been vindicated by events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary was also uncomplimentary about the manifesto.  The gist of his remarks is that the real crime of the manifesto was in raising people's expectations to too great a level.  This is a view which has been expressed by a number of Opposition speakers.  Perhaps we should not have raised people's expectations, <Col N="1495" /> but what should we have done?  What would the Opposition parties have us believe they would do in Government? According to Deputy O'Leary, unemployment should be the main priority.  He said that unemployment is the major social evil in our society and that there should be a programme designed to put an end to that social evil.</P>
    <P>The following morning Deputy Cluskey talked about six things which the budget should have set out to do.  The first of those is that it should have stimulated employment.  Clearly, the Labour Party at least want to do something about unemployment.  I think from their statements, although it is not quite clear, Fine Gael members would like to do something similar.  All speakers said they wanted to see a reduction in inflation. They also talked about restoring order to the public finances.  At that point I pause and say it sounds remarkably familiar.  It sounds like the manifesto recipe, which set out to increase employment, reduce inflation and restore order to the public finances.</P>

      <P>I was saying that that approach sounds remarkably familiar to me, it is remarkably like the manifesto programme, unless we believe Deputy O'Leary and the general tenor of the remarks from the Opposition benches that the crime is the way in which the manifesto set about doing this was to raise people's expectations.  It was holding out the prospect that these things could be done while also raising the standard of living.  What possible alternative could there be that would do these things and not raise people's expectations? It suddenly dawned on me that, of course, if re-elected the Coalition would bring back the Minister for Hardship in all his spectacular glory because the only way he could do it would be by imposing savage cuts in the level of public spending. If this is going to be done in a way which will provide employment for everybody, it has to mean equally savage cuts in the level of wages and salaries. Now we know what the manifesto style policy of the Opposition parties would be to seek to restore order to public finances, to increase employment and to reduce inflation.  I am not quite sure how far they would have to go in order to bring about this result but at a rough order of magnitude I calculated that we are talking about cuts of at least 25 to 30 per cent in the levels of public sector wages and salaries because that is about the amount that would be needed in order to eliminate even the current budget deficit.  That would still leave you with a level of public sector borrowing of about 8 or 9 per cent.  I am not being unduly hard on the Opposition when I say that this is the sort of figure they presumably have in mind.  It might well be that this is the kind of policy that is being talked about on those benches because some other remarks we had, some in the House and some outside it, rather puzzled me regarding the attitude which Deputy FitzGerald would adopt should he find himself in command.  In talking about the way figures were prepared and so on he actually made a very interesting statement.  I hope he does not mean it and that he corrects it at the earliest opportunity but it is on the record <Col N="1497" /> of the House and it says:</P>
      <P>In an argument civil servants win, and that is the end of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Column 562 of the Official Report of Thursday, 29 January. He was talking of a time when he was in Government and debating some numbers that should be adopted.  I do not see the point in electing any Government if they adopt that approach.  It would be much nicer for us to go home and let the civil servants run the country if that were the fact of the matter.  It cannot be altogether an accident that he made a statement like that because outside the House on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; recently he was asked about the wealth tax and he admitted that they had rather got it wrong and made a bit of a mess of introducing it because as he said &mdash; I cannot quote him verbatim but I hope I do not distort the sense of his remarks; I am open to correction &mdash; they had spent so much time arguing with the civil servants about the principle of the tax that they had not spent enough time working out the details of how it would actually operate. He was saying that the civil servants were very much wedded to the then death duties &mdash; he actually used some such phrase as that they were wedded to them until death would them part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that was an extraordinary line to have taken.  Here was a Minister in a Government saying that they did not really have the power or ability to implement their own policy because at the end of the day the civil servants were doing the decision-making for them.  I totally disagree with that point of view, I happen to think that the whole point in getting a Government democratically elected is to ensure that in the end they will take the decisions &mdash; not because they are always right; who will claim perfection and say that they are always right?  Of course politicians will make a few mistakes but so will the civil servants or anybody else. But the crucial thing is that it is the politicians who are elected to carry the can and it is they who should answer to the <Col N="1498" /> public at intervals of three, four or five years, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>That was an extraordinary defence to put forward.  Incidentally, in the case of the wealth tax I think it is factually wrong, My recollection is that the wealth tax was promised during the 1973 election campaign &mdash; it was not called by that name but referred to as a more satisfactory alternative to death duties &mdash; and that a committee spent a year preparing the proposals for the wealth tax and other classes of taxes before they were published in February 1974, so that every civil servant and every politician should have had more than sufficient chance to sort out opinions on them.  It was only after the proposals were published at the end of February that they became public. There was a public debate and, indeed, a public outcry, because in their original form they were so patently absurd and dangerous to the whole future of Irish business that they had to be amended before enactment into law.  Even if there was any validity in the earlier remarks, even if it was the case that there had not been enough time to discuss them with the civil servants, there was certainly sufficient public debate between February and May of 1974 to enable any Government with reasonable intelligence and wit to get their Act in order and bring in sensible taxes.  So, to have the admission on television that even after all that process they still coughed it up tells a great deal about the economic acumen and the level of analytical ability which went into the tax proposals of that nature.  I dealt with that point because I think it is relevant to one of the other points I want to make about any alternative policy to the manifesto type of approach.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Cluskey of the Labour Party also lamenting the departure of the wealth tax.  Clearly, he does not share Deputy FitzGerald's view that it was all a mistake.  My point is that, whatever general attitude one might have about reforming the tax system so as to produce greater equity, one would want to be very careful to make sure that in a small open economy such as ours which has to earn its living in competition with the rest of the world we do not put Irish <Col N="1499" /> people at a disadvantage in their own country.  That is precisely what a wealth tax was doing to all Irish business.  We were saying that any Irish people who owned a factory or business of any kind were expected to pay a levy on the capital they needed to run that business while at the same time foreigners would not have to pay that tax, even foreign firms located in Ireland were not liable to the wealth tax.  How could any Irish Government with a pretence of wanting to win through to real economic independence for its people deliberately set out to introduce a policy that would penalise its own people? That is the basic point I wanted to put on record about wealth tax so that if anybody was thinking or talking about tax reform they would not lose sight of that fundamental requirement.</P>
    <P>To return to the argument that got me on to this line, I was talking about the alternative approach that might be used to deal with unemployment, inflation and public sector borrowing requirements.  I was saying that it might call for pay cuts of 25 to 30 per cent in the public service. Deputy FitzGerald because of his experience with the civil service may have meant that as a delayed revenge for the sufferings which the civil service inflicted upon them.  If not, he should come forward and state what the alternative would be.  Some people would say that there is no need for a positive incomes policy of this kind which would actually chop wages and salaries.  They ask why we do not do what the British are doing and have Thatcherism, or monetarism, if you wish to call it that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If one really wanted to adopt that approach, would it not have pretty much the same result because with a monetarist policy one does not try to use tax increases or other cuts.  One does not have to have an incomes policy as such.  One simply puts a very tight ceiling on the additional amount of money available in credit, and then let whoever will make the most of it.  In practical terms, that would have to <Col N="1500" /> mean that, in the first instance, the pressures would come on the very sectors which we need for our long-term survival and development.  When one inflicts a tight monetary squeeze, it is the areas of the economy which have to trade with the western world &mdash; areas like industry and farming &mdash; which will find themselves at the greatest disadvantage, as compared with those parts of the economy which are protected from foreign competition, the public sector to a large extent, and some parts of the private sector, like banking services, perhaps some domestic industries like cement, where imports would be relatively difficult and expensive.</P>
      <P>When one looks at these protected sectors of Government financial institutions, one or two industries catering only for the home market, these would presumably continue pressing their own claims for pay rises and other improvements for at least some time to come and that is what we see happening.  If you adopt a policy of simple monetarism, you inflict the maximum damage on the competitive parts of the economy and, indeed, one can see, in that regard, what has been happening in the United Kingdom.  British industry and British exports are now being hammered.  We saw a little of this in our own case in the early part of last year when the Central Bank &mdash; to my mind, unwisely &mdash; began inflicting some sort of monetary squeeze here.  What happened?  We then saw the pressure being put on agriculture and on industry. It was only when rescue packages were put together for both of those sectors, through the introduction of low interest money from the European countries, that we saw a halt to that.  Had the trend continued and had the monetary squeeze been allowed to operate unabated, we would be sitting in this House today contemplating an Irish economy in much greater distress, with much higher levels of unemployment and with far fewer prospects of being able to restore its future growth and vitality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So this is the alternative, such as it is, to the approach which has been adopted by Fianna Fáil in Government for the last four years.  If this is the approach which <Col N="1501" /> the Opposition wish to offer to the people, let them have the courage to stand up and say so, instead of carrying on this crusade of pretence, on the one hand claiming that they had some miraculous secret formula which will restore order to the public finances, while at the same time pretending that they would be able to do more and better for farmers, social welfare recipients, industry, PAYE taxpayers and so on.  That is simply not true and not possible.  It does no service to the people to pretend that it does so.  We need to recognise that we are going through a period of very rapid &mdash; indeed traumatic &mdash; change in this country because of the incredible nature of our population trends.  We have enjoyed remarkable success in coping with those pressures in recent years.</P>
    <P>We have had a very significant increase in employment and, despite the effects of the recession during 1980, there are at least 60,000 to 70,000 more people at work today than when Fianna Fáil came to power four years ago.  A significant tax reform was brought about during that four-year period.  Rates on houses have been abolished and there has been a substantial reform in the income tax system. Recall that when the Coalition left office a married man began to pay income tax on a pay packet of £23 a week.  Today that figure is £55, an increase well in excess of any inflation which has incurred during the intervening years.  There has been a reduction in the tax burden on the lower paid.  There has been a dramatic improvement in the tax burden as it affects most families, both through the reform of the PAYE system and through the abolition of rates.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic improvement in the position of social welfare recipients, a real improvement in social welfare benefits of between 40 and 50 per cent during the last four years.  That contrasts with an improvement of about 10 per cent during the four years of the Coalition Government and gives the lie to any claim on their part that they were the Government with social concern and that they were catering for the weaker sections of the community.  We have made progress and that progress has been <Col N="1502" /> substantial.  However, we are by no means at the end of our task.  Of course, we need to make even greater strides in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the magnitude of the problems facing our people and the truly deplorable state of our economy, this budget must surely be regarded as the most ineffectual and utterly futile exercise ever engaged in by an Irish Minister for Finance.  It is the great irrelevance of our time.  It has evaded all the real issues of mass unemployment of a kind unprecedented in the history of this State, of factory closures, redundancies and lay-offs which we witness as an everyday event.  This has brought misery to the lives of the vast majority of our people.  The hopes of our young people, in particular our school-leavers, have been dashed.  All have been betrayed by the promises made by this Government.  This budget showed the callous disregard for the unemployed. Far from creating job opportunities, it has clearly endangered existing jobs by the additional taxation on petrol, oil, drink, postal charges and the like, and the failure of the Government to come to the rescue of our vulnerable industries is to be greatly deplored, likewise its failure to provide economic aid.  It is not only the vulnerable industries that are involved.  The awful truth is that the oldest, the strongest, the most reliable industries, those that provided the best guarantees of employment, are now threatened, many of them as a direct result of the budget.</P>
      <P>Under this Government our country has reached a new low in many important areas, productivity, living standards, the value of our £.  Conversely, in terms of unemployment, prices, inflation, borrowing and the balance of payments, this Government have achieved unprecedented heights.  From any standpoint it is an awful record, shameful and disgraceful. It seems to me that the Government have adopted the philosophy of Toryism, Thatcherism, a policy of trying to solve economic problems on the backs of a vast army of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this is a far cry from the 1977 manifesto <Col N="1503" /> which promised us all a new Utopia of full employment, ever rising standards of prosperity, undreamed of before.  This economic dream has become a nightmare; the Utopia they promised us has become a living hell for the vast majority of our people.  In less than four years they have achieved the notoriety of causing a 30 per cent increase in unemployment.  It has been acknowledged by neutral observers, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, that 25 per cent of our people are living in poverty.</P>
    <P>The value of our £ is withering before our eyes day by day.  It has become a sick joke in the finance counting houses of Europe.  It is now being treated as confetti money which has lost its value to the extent of 25 per cent.  Is it any wonder that as a State our solvency is being called into question?</P>
    <P>I listened with interest this morning to the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, and his pathetic attempt to justify the budget.  I marvelled at his courage and audacity, particularly when he referred to the Fianna Fáil manifesto, because I do not know of any other Fianna Fáil member, certainly not in my constituency of South Tipperary, who has the temerity to mention that infamous manifesto.  They would prefer to see it buried, lost, forgotten.  The words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil manifesto&rdquo; stink in the nostrils of every decent, honest person in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I marvelled at the audacity of that man who had come to be recognised as the great dreamer of economic dreams.  The dream has become a nightmare. The dream he conceived has resulted in economic ruin and financial disaster.  That man occupied a very high office in Government until a short time ago.  He was regarded as the architect of the infamous manifesto.  One has only to look at the Government front bench not only to see that he has been removed from office but to appreciate that the office he held, the Department of Economic Planning and Development, designed and structured by his philosophy, has been abolished and discarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> Today Deputy O'Donoghue sought to defend the budget and the manifesto with great courage and audacity.  His Fianna Fáil colleagues know his achievements or lack of them and they blame him, perhaps not to his face but behind his back, because when he left office he also left economic disaster and financial ruin unparalleled in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue told us the manifesto was designed &ldquo;to create employment and to reduce inflation&rdquo;.  He did not advert to the fact that there are many more people out of work, that yesterday it was announced by the CSO that 125,100 persons are unemployed, that 7,356 are on short-time, that the unemployment rate went up by one-third in the past year, that it is the highest rate of unemployment in the EEC, 13 per cent. Taking into account young people not yet registered as unemployed and the large numbers coming out of schools, 40,000 according to recent figures, the real unemployment figure is 170,000.  By the end of this year the figure will be in the region of 200,000.  This man deliberately ignores these figures and tries to purport that under his manifesto there was an increase in employment.  Is there any person in this country who would believe that?  Whom does this juggler of figures think he is fooling?  He is clearly living in cloud cuckoo land and is utterly removed from the reality of Irish life today.  No wonder he was removed from office and the very Department of State he presided over abolished, never to rise again except under another Government who would put it to effective use.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue did not advert to the colossal increase in inflation; this he carefully avoided.  The ever-increasing prices have left housewives in a state of stupefaction and bewilderment. They simply cannot cope.  Life for the average family has become intolerable and it is an excruciating exercise to try to make ends meet on the average wage.  It simply cannot be done and this has become one of the most expensive countries in which to live.  No wonder our tourist industry is in the doldrums.  Did we ever think we would see the day when it would be <Col N="1505" /> cheaper for our people to holiday in America, and possibly to live there, than to stay at home?  Yet we have Government Ministers and industrial tycoons hectoring and lecturing the trade union movement and the workers that they must not seek further wage increases and that they should not try to compensate for the increase in the cost of oil and the general increase in the cost of living, even though all the evidence is that it is not the Arabs who are increasing the price of oil but the Government.  The budget increase was a deliberate and calculated design.</P>
    <P>The fight to maintain and improve living standards must continue unabated and with a more determined effort than ever.  The Labour movement which I represent, both industrial and political, will continue to be in the forefront of that fight and I make no apology for that. Were we to lose that fight, which must not and shall not happen, the outcome for our people would be abject slavery. The national agreement must be honoured and there must be no welching on that agreement.  It is a bit much to expect our people to suffer the injustices heaped upon them by this Government without taking the necessary steps to defend standards.  This is what must and will be done.</P>
    <P>In every city, town and village there is at present an air of gloom and despair.  In my constituency of South Tipperary unemployment and short-time working are rampant and there is no sign of an easing in the situation.  In fact, it is becoming progressively worse.  The human misery it brings in its wake is shattering, especially to housewives and young couples who may have heavy financial responsibilities in paying for a house and maintaining a family.  Home life is a misery and young lives have been blighted.  The future looks grim.  There is poverty prevailing all around us where only a few years ago there was full and plenty.</P>
    <P>This, then, was a shamefully dishonest budget in that it did not face up to the reality of the situation.  By not facing up to the rising tide of unemployment this <Col N="1506" /> Government are playing with fire, toying with dynamite.  They are sitting on a smouldering bomb which may erupt at any moment.  Let us not forget that no longer have an Irish Government the safety valve of emigration.  Toryism and Thatcherism have stopped the movement of the emigrant ship and Irish men and women must now remain at home despite the economic circumstances.  I believe they will not tolerate the present situation and will assert in no uncertain manner their right to work their own land.  The sooner they do so the better it will be.</P>
    <P>Our young people &mdash; highly educated, articulate, proud and resourceful &mdash; will never forgive this Government for the betrayal of the confidence which was reposed in them.  They will not stand for the degradation of the dole queue and will not be treated as paupers or slaves to an economic system which denies them the right to apply their God-given talents and energies in productive work.  I am absolutely satisfied that the young people will not be conned by Fianna Fáil a second time.  I earnestly hope that they will show their rejection of the infamous manifesto through the medium of the ballot box.  If this great crisis in their lives continues for much longer there is a real danger that they can be misled into adopting other means of protest and of asserting their rights.  Already we hear the sound of marching feet from aggrieved sections of our community &mdash; from the farmers.  The PAYE people and the students.  If this Government remain in office it is hard to know where this marching will lead us.  Does it not lead to despair or even to revolt with such a high percentage of young people without work, stripped of dignity and a sense of purpose and with no real prospect held out to them?  We are taking a grave risk. Are we not undermining the very pillars of our democratic society in times of protest, violence and extremism?  In rejecting the Fianna Fáil manifesto of very pale green is there not the likelihood that some people may adopt a manifesto of a far deeper hue and possibly with an alien philosophy?  If that happens many of the things which we hold dear in this House and many of the things we hold precious <Col N="1507" /> in our Christian philosophy and way of life will have been imperilled.  There is a real danger that, if our generation cannot solve their problems within the present system, people may decide to go outside the system.</P>
    <P>In this situation of massive unemployment, massive inflation and a gruesome cost of living, this Government have created a climate, a spawning ground for alien influences which are ever active and ready to undermine the authority of this House and the agencies of our democratic system.  I appeal to the Government to act quickly to stem the drift toward social and economic ruin.  If the Government have the power and the ability to do so let them do it now, but if they cannot solve the grave problems they should do the honorable thing and get out and let others who have the courage to face the facts take over.  Fianna Fáil have been condemned from their own mouths.  Their former leader, Deputy Lynch, is on record as saying that any Government which had an unemployment level of 100,000 people should be rejected.  Doubtless his words will come true.</P>
    <P>In the area of unemployment great play is being made about the increases of 20 per cent and 25 per cent in social welfare benefits.  Surely these increases were long overdue.  It was well recognised that those depending on old age pensions, widows pensions and so on were in recent times living in poverty, hunger, cold and misery, utterly unable to cope with everyday rising costs.  Let us not forget that they did not receive an increase in these pensions since April 1980 and that the cost of living in the interim has increased by at least 20 per cent, 18 per cent in 1980 and by at least 2 per cent as a result of this budget.  These people will have to wait until April of this year to get these increases of £5 or £6 per week and on that they must make do for another 12 months.  Nothing will be done in the meantime to cut the impact of price increases on those unfortunate categories of persons and there will be no increase in the autumn as the previous Government provided.  There is no question of <Col N="1508" /> subsidising the cost of living, as the previous Government did for these people. One of the first acts of this Government was to abolish the food subsidies and do away with the second increase to social welfare beneficiaries in the autumn.  Neither was the age limit brought down by one iota in the last four budgets.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme is nothing less than a national disgrace.  The administration of that scheme is patently unfair and unjust.  The most reprehensible aspect of it is the withdrawal of supplementary welfare allowances, otherwise known as home assistance, when free fuel is granted.  It came to my knowledge that the most destitute in our society, the recipients of home assistance, were, on receipt of free fuel, obliged to take a reduction in supplementary welfare allowance.  Persons in receipt of £2 supplementary welfare allowance on being granted free fuel, which amounted to £60 over the winter period and which commenced for the first time in rural Ireland last autumn-winter, had £1 of their assistance money taken from them.  They received free fuel, which amounted to £60, and sustained a reduction in their allowance of £1 per week or £52 per year. They allegedly benefited by £8 and that was quickly eroded by substantial increases in the price of coal in recent months.  I raised this matter prior to last Christmas and was told by the genial Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Woods, that the reduction in the home assistance allowance was justified on the grounds that the allowance was originally granted as a fuel allowance and consequently the health boards felt justified in withdrawing portion of that allowance when the free fuel was allocated.  It was a mean, shabby and despicable trick on the most destitute in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving aspects of the budget which the Minister wishes to ignore.  The administration of the so-called fuel scheme makes a mockery of the suffering of the unfortunate people to whom I have referred.  I note that it is <Col N="1509" /> intended to provide free telephone rental to a new category of people, people who are in receipt of British pensions.  I welcome that.  Why have we to have the anomaly whereby people in receipt of British pensions, widows pensions, war widows pensions or retirement pensions are not entitled to the other perks of free electricity allowance, television licence, free travel?  Why do we not extend those facilities to this category?  They are our own people.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a reciprocal agreement between here and Britain and between here and the European Community to confer benefits on all such people. Why do the Government continue to welch on this important matter?  I have made repeated representations in regard to the widows of Royal Irish Constabulary policemen, of whom there are very few alive.  There is one in my constituency and because her pension is payable from Britain she is denied the usual perks that go with the Irish pension, free electricity allowance, free television licence free fuel and free travel.  The people to whom I refer could be included if there was a slight amendment to the regulation.  Are we in breach of an agreement with other countries in withholding those benefits from the categories I referred to?  I again appeal to have them included in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of the budget to do something positive to stabilise Irish industry and safeguard jobs must be deplored. Every day we witness closures and redundancies and it is no longer a question of vulnerable industries, such as textiles, footwear and clothing, but old-established industries, which had a reputation of secure employment, are now affected. Their future is threatened.  It is bad enough to have to contend with trade from the EEC countries but why the Government permit the wholesale closure of Irish industries because of imports from countries outside the EEC is very difficult to understand.  We all know that imports from third world countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Timbuctoo and other parts of the world have resulted in closures and short-time working.  The Government <Col N="1510" /> have allowed this to happen while all around us industrial graveyards are being created and thousands of Irish people are being put on the unemployment scrap heap.  Nothing is being done to stop imports from those countries or no financial assistance is being provided for the industries in distress.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy, which was a great advantage to many of those vulnerable industries, is about to be withdrawn. The excuse being made is that the EEC require this to be done.  More and more of our factories will have to close because of this.  In my constitutency we have seen all the signs of redundancy and short-time working.  The most recent one is Cashel Textiles, which was a boon to the town, which had no industries before this. There are very few job opportunities in this town.  There is chronic unemployment and an exceptionally high rate of emigration.  The people of Cashel are very perturbed about the loss of precious jobs and the real danger of the closure of an industry which has been an integral part of their economic life.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Labour to come to the rescue of this industry and do something to save the situation.  If this factory is allowed to close it will be not only an economic blow to the people of Cashel but a psychological blow from which they will find it very difficult to recover.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour must have known for years that this industry was in a bad way and that there was a fall in numbers employed there in recent years. Despite being aware of the situation nothing was done to help that industry. The meat processing industry is also important in my constitutency.  There are redundancies and short-time working in this industry.  Is it not the height of economic folly that thousands of our cattle are shipped out every week to various parts of the world while our meat processing factories are closing down and laying off workers because they have not got the raw material?  The figures for cattle exported last year are frightening.  When will the Government curb the sale of <Col N="1511" /> cattle on the hoof?  Thousands of extra jobs could be provided in our meat processing plants, our canneries, our hide, pet food and bone meal factories.  These factories would boom and thousands more people would get employment if we restricted the outward movement of cattle.</P>

It would not be appropriate for me to disclose the different aspects of the matters which are discussed in a confidential session between the British Prime Minister and myself.

Secondly, could I ask the Taoiseach is the traditional policy of neutrality under question at present arising out of the totality of the negotiations, the words used in the communique?  Is it now under question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if sworn affidavits relating to house improvement and solid fuel conversion grants were accepted by his Department after 31 January 1980; the number of affidavits accepted in each case; if such affidavits are still being accepted; if any public notices were issued to the effect that such affidavits might be accepted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Every application for a solid fuel grant must incorporate a statutory declaration by the applicant that the information given on the application is correct.  In addition, in the administration of the various housing grants schemes, sworn affidavits are from time to time accepted by my Department as a means of verifying particulars in relation to the applications.  A record of such affidavits accepted is not kept.  Each relates to an individual case and is associated with the other papers relating to that case.  Since the question of the need for and the acceptability of an affidavit arises in individual cases and is pursued directly with the applicants, a public notice on the lines suggested by the Deputy would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people applied for this type of grant and their applications were either mislaid or could not be found when the time came to look for them and in some cases affidavits appear to have been accepted by the Department.

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Affidavits cannot be accepted as evidence that the grant application <Col N="1529" /> was received in the Department because the condition lays down quite clearly that the application would have to be received by a certain date and an affidavit does not mean it was received.</P>

      <P>Despite an exhaustive search, ther is no record in my Department of the receipt of an application for a house improvement grant for the person named.  Unless evidence can be produced to indicate that an application was made in time to reach my Department by 1 February 1980 nothing further can be done.  The correspondence already received from the applicant and the Deputy does not provide such evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that this applicant has gone through the only conceivable means available to him to get this grant, or to send in the application, and then he discovers the Department have lost the application.  The only way he can state that the application was lodged is to send further information by way of registered letter.  Has the Minister any memory of that registered letter being received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but a registered letter is not an application.  The registered letter was received after the closing date.  It had nothing to do with the application. The application, as far as I am concerned, was not received before the closing date and I do not accept that the application got lost in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Then if the person in this situation were to make a sworn affidavit, as has been suggested in the previous question, would the Minister not be prepared to accept the sworn word of that person that he had applied prior to the closing date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>A sworn affidavit cannot be accepted as proof that the application was lodged with my Department before the closing date.  If there is any further evidence such as a receipt or acknowledgment from the Department we will certainly accept that as proof but, in the absence of that application, which has to be in the department by a certain date, unfortunately that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware, as we all are, that there was considerable confusion in the Department <Col N="1531" /> after this grant scheme closed, and the confusion ran to such an extent that the public office was locked for a number of weeks because the office was not able to cater for the number of people calling. Public representatives were not allowed to call and at one stage Ministers were not able to get into their own offices.  In a situation where they could manage to lose a junior Minister is it not conceivable that they could lose a number of applications? Surely the Minister could accept the sworn word of an applicant.  Otherwise he is questioning evidence given by a person under oath that he applied prior to the closing date.</P>

      <P>The trouble in this case is that the Minister will not answer questions he is asked, while he gives information which is not asked for.  That could be one of the reasons we are having this trouble.  If the Minister's figures of 25,000 to 35,000 controlled dwellings given in this House are correct &mdash; and a number of people are unable to retain their tenancies in privately-owned dwellings because of that &mdash; will this not throw a very big strain on the local authorities? Would the Minister like to offer an opinion as to what will be done, or has any provision been made to try to cater for this very large number of people who, in addition to the crowd already on the lists, will be looking for rehousing?</P>

I have given him the opportunity of asking several supplementary questions.  If he is not satisfied with the Minister's answer, he has a means at his disposal by which he can raise it.  In fairness to the Chair, the Deputy should accept that the Chair is not responsible for the Minister's replies.

      <P>Particulars of road grant allocations and of requests of local authorities for allocations, together with the actual allocations made for house purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants, for 1981 are set out in the form of a tabular statement, which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Two brief supplementary questions.  First, is the Minister telling me that no money has been allocated so far this year?  Second, is he saying local authorities do not ask for specific sums under those headings from the Department? If so, things have changed a lot in a couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the amount of money owed by each local authority for materials, machinery and employment, including overdraft accommodation, up to 31 December 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities make returns to my Department which show for each local authority the aggregate amounts of unpaid bills and bank overdraft, if any.  Preliminary returns for the period up to 31 December 1980 are at present being collected and I am arranging to forward to the Deputy as much information as will be available in the returns on the matters he has raised as soon as possible.  The returns, however, give aggregate amounts and do not give a breakdown into the detail mentioned in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one local authority, according to a report in the local press, have been £6 million short for SDA loans?  When giving his reply would it be possible to have it put in the Official Report, because giving me a separate reply is not telling the House exactly what the position is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a breakdown of the unpaid bills of local authorities. I do not think there are any unpaid bills.  For example, the Deputy mentioned employment and I cannot imagine any local authority owing anything under that heading.  If people are employed on a contract basis they are paid when the bills are submitted.  I do not think there is any money outstanding for SDA loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister go back to his Department and ask the questions which he has not asked?  It is ridiculous to suggest that a local authority clear all their accounts and do not owe anything at the end of a year.  At the end of this year and under numerous headings, particularly the ones I mentioned, is it not true that every local authority are literally up to their necks in debt?  Is that the position?  Is the Minister aware of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority of which I was a member before I took up this position ended the year with a surplus of £160,000.  All local authorities are not in debt.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the amount of money required by each local authority at 31 December 1980 (a) for the payment of small-dwelling acquisition loans to qualified applicants and (b) the amount of money required to pay contractors for local authority houses.</P>

      <P>Statistics of the amount of money required to meet the commitments of each local authority on foot of <Col N="1543" /> SDA loans approved and not paid at 31 December 1980 are not yet available.  The figures at 30 September 1980 are as set out in a tabular statement which, with the approval of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to payments due to contracts for local authority houses is not available in my Department.  The conditions of contract generally used by <Col N="1544" /> authorities stipulate that payment must be made within a certain period, normally 14 days on foot of certificates issued to the authority showing the amount due in respect of work already done.  Such payments made by local authorities are recouped periodically by issues from the Local Loans Fund.  Authorities are not required to notify the Department of payments due to be paid by them at any specific time.</P>

      <P>Numerous local authorities have stated that they do not have the money to pay contractors for local authority houses they are erecting and at least one local authority has been reported in the local press as being £6 million short for 1980.  I should like to know if the Minister is in a position to get that type of information.  Is the Minister saying that local authorities do not inform <Col N="1545" /> the Department if they are in debt under any of those headings or in surplus at the end of a year?</P>

I do not want the impression created that local authorities are short of money in the way the Deputy has suggested.  I do not have any responsibility for what appears in press reports. I have given the information about the local authority of which I was a member and I expect that the same position applies to other local authorities.  It is not true to say that local authorities are short of money in this regard or that they are in debt.</P>

For that reason they cannot pay out money because they do not know when or how much they will get in any given period. There are many people on overdrafts and local authorities are in the same position because of the irregular method of payment by the Department.

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of Women published in December 1972 identified the areas of legislative discrimination which existed against women in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 75 recommendations made by the commission, the most significant progress has been made in the employment field.  The major outstanding recommendation relates to paid maternity leave.  This is receiving urgent attention at the present time.  It is intended to have a scheme of paid maternity leave in operation in April 1981.  I am also taking steps to establish a representative working <Col N="1548" /> party to examine the position of child care services and facilities for working parents.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other issues of vital concern to women, mainly in the area of family law.  The reform of the law on criminal conversation and related torts is under active consideration by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>As regards social welfare, this is being dealt with in the context of the commission's report and the EEC Directive on the progressive implementation of equal treatment of men and women workers in the matter of social security.  As already announced by the Minister for Social Welfare, the directive will be fully implemented within the time scale laid down, that is, by December 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the budget debate was adjourned I was dealing with the crisis situation that has arisen in one of Ireland's basic and most important industries, the meat processing industry and all its ancillary operations in respect of <Col N="1577" /> tanning, leather, hides, pet foods, bonemeal and animal offal processing.  This essential raw material is going abroad in ever-increasing volume and our native industry is crumbling all around us at present.  All the evidence is there by reason of the incidence of closure, of redundancies, and of short-time working.  Anyone who is in any doubt about the situation can look at the figures in respect of live cattle exports for 1980.  I am about to quote from the Central Statistics Office and Annual Review and Market Outlook issued by the Irish Livestock and Meat Board in December 1980 which has just come to hand.  In 1980 the total live cattle exports to Great Britain and Northern Ireland amounted to 195,000 and to other countries of the EEC last year 77,200 cattle.  To Third Countries 202,800 cattle were exported last year, giving a grand total of 475,000, and in terms of total value £208 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When is this economic folly going to stop?  We are throwing away one of Ireland's most cherished assets when we export cattle to such a large extent and leave our home industry shattered.  The vested interests in this situation &mdash; and many of those are very close to the Government &mdash; must be faced up to, challenged and restrained.  An immediate subsidy is required for all those affected in the meat processing industry and that subsidy should be applied immediately. We have reached a crisis situation, and I know this to be true because over the years and particularly in recent times it has affected many of my constituents in South Tipperary.  We see the evidence of the lay-offs, closures and short-time working in respect of the meat processing plants in Clonmel, Cahir, Castleblake and other parts.  We have witnessed the closure of meat processing plants which were the economic lifeblood of the respective communities in neighbouring towns.  The situation is very serious.  The 130,000 cattle that were exported to Libya last year represent an asset that we could do with in my area.  If we had that kind of consignment of cattle I am satisfied that our local industries would be booming and we would be taking on additional men and women.  It is a sorry <Col N="1578" /> spectacle and the time has come for this Government to face up to this reality, subsidise this industry and place restraint on the export of live cattle.  The folly is obvious to all.  The damage is there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, some 78,000 sheep were exported last year.  When one considers the intrinsic worth of this raw material and the many thousands of jobs that could be maintained and created here, it is an absolute disgrace.  The vested interests, however big they may be, however close to the level of power, have got to be challenged.  This policy is anti-social and utterly unpatriotic.  It is doing irreparable damage to our economy and it is time to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the time allotted to me in this budget debate is now very limited. One of the most lamentable aspects of this budget was its failure to recognise the terrible plight of the homeless in this country.  It is more difficult now than ever before to secure a home of one's own. Costs have spiralled, loans are inadequate, the £12,000 from local authorities difficult to secure.  Bridging loans from the bank are also difficult to secure, even at extortionate rates of interest.  A young couple embarking on the purchase of a house of their own place a financial millstone around their necks which exerts a stranglehold from which they will never extricate themselves.  It is a crushing burden. We, as public representatives, know the result is mental anguish and domestic upset which are too prevalent today.  No relief was provided, by way of additional grants, to the homeless.  There was no reduction in interest charges and no regard whatsoever for the human misery involved in this vital area.</P>
    <P>Our local authorities are starved of income.  There was an inordinate delay in the provision of money for housing in 1980.  It came to us extremely late in the year.  In my county, the allocation of new money for housing came to us in October. It seriously set back our housing programme. It extended still further, perhaps by some years, the long purgatory of waiting for the many thousands of unemployed on our waiting lists.  Our housing programme for 1980 has hardly <Col N="1579" /> got off the ground.  No new house was built in my constituency this year, probably for the first time in its history.</P>
    <P>It seems that the policy is to make money available to land and housing speculators, to enable them to provide what is called rented low cost flats.  Having regard to the history of low cost housing under a previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Robert Molloy, the term &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; sounds ominous. God help the flatdwellers.  This policy of moving away from the local authority, which has always been recognised as the body with whom the responsibility lay to rehouse people, is a dangerous precedent. It will stultify still further the role of the local authority in the provision of houses.</P>
    <P>It has been rumoured that new house grants may be increased this year and the likely announcement may well be made at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis which will be held at Ballsbridge this weekend.  The grants may be increased from £1,000 to £2,000 or even £3,000.  I sincerely hope that is true.  I encourage the Minister to make this statement even though it should be made in the House.  It is a discourtesy to announce it outside the House.  Wherever and whenever it is made, it will be very welcome.  I express the ardent hope that the increased grants will not be jacked up by an equivalent amount by the builders, their agents or the speculators involved, as transpired when the £1,000 new house grant was provided in 1977.  Prices were automatically increased and the unfortunate home buyers found themselves in the same sad predicament.  It should be made perfectly clear, therefore, if grants are going to be increased that they are designed solely for the new house owner, not for the builder or the speculator.</P>
    <P>If the Minister embarks upon statements of this kind I hope he will decide at the Ard-Fheis to bring back important grants which were abolished by this Government within the past two years in respect of repairs, reconstruction, the provision of back boilers to obviate dependence on oil, water, sewerage, amenity grants and many others of such <Col N="1580" /> importance abolished by the Government. People were not told about these things before the last general election.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to deal with many other matters &mdash; health, education, fisheries and income tax.  The PAYE earners are, despite alleged endeavours by the Government, the most exploited class in the country.  They still provide over 80 per cent of all tax collected in the State.  It is clear that the private sector and the professional classes are getting away with absolute murder in respect of paying their fair share of tax.  The system of PAYE, which was originally intended to be a rather painless extraction of moneys from the pockets of workers, has now become a gruesome, excruciating exercise for all of us.  It is a system which must be changed because it is unfair, it is a disincentive to work or to save and it is one of the most demoralising aspects of our society.</P>
    <P>I will find another opportunity to deal with the many other matters to which I have referred.  This, for the time being is my comment on the alleged budget for 1980</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan) Thomas Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of this party since our return to Government has been to provide new productive jobs for our young workforce.  We have steadily moved towards this objective in the last three budgets.  We have followed an economic strategy designed to control inflation &mdash; in a world of high inflation &mdash; and to keep the economy in a healthy state, especially in the midst of the present world economic recession.</P>
      <P>This budget follows the same pattern as others.  It is also designed to bring order and balance to our public spending. We have moved to divert a major share of the available national income to the more productive sectors of our economy and to provide the infrastructure for our continued industrial expansion, roads, telephones and other services which are the life blood of industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy has always been to create favourable conditions for the development of our industries, which were victimised during the Coalition <Col N="1581" /> years of the mid-seventies.  When we returned to power our industrial sector was in the doldrums.  We have restored confidence to industry and, with their endeavour, together we will come out of this present recession better placed to take advantage of the coming upturn in the world markets.  This budget, because it is fair, strikes the right note for the great effort we expect and need from the community to enable us to succeed.</P>
    <P>This party when in Government have always provided for the less well off in our community.  They have always been a special priority with Fianna Fáil.  This year is no exception, for even when public money is scarce they must be helped to cope with the increasing difficulties of day to day living.  We have provided an extra £111 million to improve the rates of social welfare payments.  All round increases of 25 per cent in long term and 20 per cent in short term benefits are a major improvement, and may I add, more than was given by the Coalition Government in their total four-and-a-half years in office.</P>
    <P>For example, the basic old age contributory pension has increased from £14.60 in 1977 to £30.65 this year, unemployment benefit from £13 in 1977 to £24.55 this year, in each case approximately a 50 per cent increase.  These show the commitment of this Government to our dependants and this budget has increased their real spending power.  We will, as in the past, continue to give priority to these people.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the budget I am particularly pleased about is the increase in benefits to the disabled, with a raise in tax allowances, the removal of VAT from medical aids and substantial improvement in the various allowances for them. These improvements are a help for the disabled to cope with the problems of everyday living not faced by the rest of us.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the problems facing the disabled is the finding of suitable employment and indeed the theme of the International Year of Disabled Persons is &ldquo;Full Participation and Equality&rdquo;.  My Department are making a very significant contribution in the fields of employment <Col N="1582" /> and training.  I have responsibility for the implementation of the Government decision that a 3 per cent quota of disabled persons should be employed in the public sector.  We have already arranged for recruitment to the civil service to be opened up to disabled persons and special arrangements made to facilitate their appointment.  I am satisfied that these arrangements will lead to a significant number of disabled persons being offered employment in the civil service this year. My department are also in regular contact with local authorities, health boards and State bodies to assist and advise them on how best they can implement the Government decision and proceed as quickly as possible towards the 3 per cent quota.</P>
    <P>AnCO involvement in the training of disabled persons for open employment is increasing significantly.  They are providing training for open employment, for those suitable, on an integrated basis with able-bodied.  They trained 473 disabled persons during 1980 and hope to double that figure for 1981.  AnCO are also proposing to provide training opportunities for the disabled by increasing use of the external training facilities at their disposal.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of employment, the co-ordination and supervision of manpower policy is an important aspect of my responsibilities and the Manpower Consultative Committee were set up to advise on the role of manpower policy in economic and social developments.  In the past year the committee have looked at the important areas of attitudes to work in industry, youth employment, shortages of skilled manpower and work-sharing as a method of increasing employment.</P>
    <P>Their report on the question of youth employment, including its conclusions and recommendations, was published recently.  They considered young people should not be regarded as a separate element of the labour market and the provision of special schemes such as those introduced in the current recession should not indicate a separation of youth employment from the general labour market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> I am concerned, however, to protect our young people from the worst effects of the recession.  They are a particularly vulnerable sector of our workforce.  The consequences of high levels of youth unemployment, both in terms of demoralising effects on the individual starting out on a career and the implications for society in general of a large group of disillusioned young people, must not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>The report came to certain conclusions. Among them are that insufficient information has been made available to young people on where the best job opportunities are and the occupations needed by industry.  The results of work in this area such as the identification of skill shortages and occupational supply and demand forecasts should be published in a form that would be accessible to young people.  Another recommendation suggests that young people who remain unemployed for, say, 12 months after leaving school should be regarded as a priority case for placement on an AnCO training course, work experience or special youth employment schemes if they had not previously participated in these programmes.  I am examining these and the committee's other recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee assessed the extent of shortages of highly qualified skilled and semi-skilled labour and have got the commitment of various organisations so that we can tackle the problem.  A further recruitment campaign was undertaken in the UK last autumn and a register of applicants will be distributed to employers notifying shortages within a few weeks.  At the request of the MCC education authorities expanded existing courses and developed new courses to increase output in the short supply occupations between 1980-1983. As a result the intake into graduate engineering courses increased by approximately one-third between 1979 and 1980.  Employers are being encouraged to take on more fitter and toolmaker apprentices than their immediate needs. All these measures should go a long way <Col N="1584" /> towards removing the shortage of highly qualified and skilled manpower which was becoming a major constraint in industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee are now looking at the question of attitudes to industrial employment in Ireland, with the aim of informing young people of career prospects in industry and eliminating, with the assistance of industry itself, any bias which may exist. The committee have already made a number of recommendations.</P>
    <P>Another significant development recently is that three regional manpower committees were established on a pilot basis and three more will be set up shortly.  The task of the regional committees is to advise on the implementation of labour market policy in their specific region.  I see this as a move towards a more co-ordinated approach to manpower problems at a local level.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to stem the number of job losses and to give more help to firms in difficulties.  The National Manpower Service is operating an early warning system on job losses and firms with problems. Information on these firms received from the National Manpower placement staff and through the Redundancy and Protection of Employment Acts is forwarded to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism for possible appropriate rescue action by the IDA or Fóir Teo.</P>
    <P>In order to assist them to maintain their employment levels, an inter-agency group has been set up, comprising representatives of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Labour and Agriculture, The IDA., Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company and CTT. Measures to assist firms where redundancies or closures are threatened are being co-ordinated by this group.</P>
    <P>One does not have to look further for evidence of the success of the Government's job creation programme in the past few years than the estimates of the numbers employed in the various sectors of the economy in 1980 and revised estimates for the years 1975, 1977 and 1979 published recently by the Central Statistics Office.  These estimates show that the <Col N="1585" /> total employment increased by almost 100,000 between 1975 and 1980.  Nonagricultural employment increased by 23,000 per annum on average in the same period.  The total labour force is shown to have increased by 96,000 or 8.4 per cent between 1975 and 1980, an average yearly increase of 19,000.</P>
    <P>The IDA achieved record numbers of job approvals in the past three years &mdash; over 35,000 last year, 34,500 in 1979 and 30,200 in 1978.  Many of these jobs will be coming on stream this year or in subsequent years. In all, as a result of IDA projects already approved, it is expected that 15,000 &mdash; 16,000 new manufacturing jobs will be provided this year.  The IDA have also set themselves the target of achieving 30,000 job approvals this year. In addition, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company expect to provide 1,500 new jobs this year and approve projects with an employment potential of 3,000.</P>
    <P>In the second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development the Government affirm their commitment to the earliest possible achievement of full employment.  While the job creation results of existing Government investment and economic promotion policies are compatible with the early achievement of full employment, the domestic repercussions of the general world economic recession are currently off-setting these gains by causing exceptionally high job losses.  I believe that the slowing of the unemployment rate in the past few months is an indication that the Government's commitments under the understanding are taking affect.</P>
    <P>The Government Investment Plan for 1981 provides for a total investment in 1981 of over £1,700 million and will result in higher direct employment of about 10,000 mostly in building and contruction, with the inevitable spin-off employment in Irish firms supplying materials and services.  It is a blueprint for the foundations on which we will continue to expand our industrial sector.</P>
    <P>The effect of the recession is also evident <Col N="1586" /> in the number of vacancies notified to the National Manpower service last year.  During 1980, a total of 41,652 vacancies were notified, a drop of 8,792 or 17 per cent on the number notified in 1979.  However, a slightly higher proportion of vacancies was filled.  Vacancies filled as a proportion of notifications, were 66 per cent for last year compared with 61 per cent for 1979.</P>
    <P>It is essential for our economy that our industrial training be geared to the needs of the labour market so as to ensure a well-trained labour force and to avoid as far as possible any bottlenecks in either supply or demand.  This calls for frequent reviews of the training provided and I am satisfied that the training agencies under the aegis of my Department &mdash; AnCO and CERT &mdash; are very conscious of this and keep their programmes under constant review.</P>
    <P>The 1981 non-capital Exchequer grant to AnCO is fixed at £21 million.  This represents an increase of 20 per cent over last year's allocation.  When the grant from the European Social Fund is added to this, it means that AnCO will have about £7 million more at their disposal than for the 1980 programme.  This increase will enable AnCO to increase by almost 10 per cent the numbers receiving training in 1981 over the 15,700 trained in 1980.  AnCO will also concentrate more on high skilled training, so that the potential of Irish manpower can be used to the full in the new and developing field of high technology employments.</P>
    <P>During the 1974 to 1977 period we had the disastrous situation of the intake of apprentices being cut back resulting in a severe shortage when the economy regained its bouyancy on our return to power.  I am encouraged that this shortsighted action is not being repeated. Industry is now very aware of the need for training and how the future development of its individual firms depends on continuing to train its potential workforce.</P>
    <P>The stock of apprentices reached 21,500 at the end of December 1980.  This was an all-time high and AnCO are determined that every effort will be made to increase the intake of first year apprentices <Col N="1587" /> during 1981.  The additional funds being provided this year will enable AnCO to continue providing special arrangements for apprentices who may find their apprenticeship temporarily disrupted by the economic situation due to closure or lay-offs.</P>
    <P>This year's Exchequer capital grant to AnCO amounts to £9.5 million, that is, an increase of almost 50 per cent on last year's figure.  This substantial increase will allow AnCO to proceed with their plans to build new training centres.  The building of new centres will be started at Loughlinstown and Baldoyle during 1981 and new training centres at Cork and Finglas in Dublin and substantial extensions to existing centres at Tralee and Ballyfermot in Dublin will be completed in 1981.  By the end of this year there will be almost 900 more training places compared with 1980.  In addition to the employment which AnCO's capital development programme will generate in the services and construction industries, the additional training places provided will allow for greater annual trainee throughput.  The selection of new training centre locations is heavily influenced by the identified needs for vocational training facilities, the employment outlets, both existing and planned, and the skilled needs of local industry.</P>
    <P>The Community Youth Training Programme continued to be a success with over 2,000 young people benefiting.  In all, 118 projects were completed making a lasting contribution to local communities and their environments.</P>
    <P>Another improvement was in the number of women seeking training.  Last year, 30 per cent of all AnCO trainees were women and 10 per cent of these completed courses in traditionally male skill areas.  Forty-four per cent of those trainees on our management training programme are also women.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, CERT caters for the education, recruitment and training for the hotel, catering and tourism industry.  The 1981 Exchequer grant to CERT amounts to £935,000, which is an increase of £105,000 over the 1980 allocation. When the ESF grant is added, it <Col N="1588" /> will mean that CERT has over £200,000 more at their disposal than they had in 1980.</P>
    <P>CERT hope to train 5,000 persons during 1981 and, going on past performance, the vast majority of these will find worth while and satisfying employment on completion of their training.  CERT will also continue to provide industry-based training to ensure that the industry provides an efficient, friendly and value-for-money service for the public, including the visitor from abroad.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the work of my Department relates to the drafting of new labour legislation and the improvement of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>An area of considerable importance is the field of safety in industry.  I feel a major contribution will be made to the improvement of safety standards in industry by the phasing into operation of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980.  The Act updates the Factories Act, 1955, improving safety standards in general, that is, noise levels, training, protection of eyes, fire drill, machinery protection.  Most sections will be brought into operation on 1 March 1981.  The cornerstone of the Act is the establishment of safety committees under Part III, which will operate from 1 April 1981, ensuring the establishment of safety committees before the end of the year.  In addition, Part III puts an onus on employers to set down in writing the arrangements which they have made in their premises to ensure the safety of their workers.  I am arranging for a publicity campaign to bring the provisions of the Act to the attention of employers and workers and I would like to take this opportunity to ask both sides of industry to ensure that its operation is effective.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the search for oil is continuing off our coasts.  Hydrocarbon exploration is becoming a permanent feature off our shores.  Drilling for oil is a hazardous occupation and at present is not covered by legislation.  To fill this gap a Bill has been drafted in respect of safety on offshore installations and it is my intention to introduce the Bill in the Dáil in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another area which I feel needs to be updated is statutory limits on hours of <Col N="1589" /> work, which were set in the thirties and are now completely out of date given existing conditions in Irish industry.  Discussions have been held with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employer organisations with a view to amending the relevant legislation.  It is my intention to introduce a Bill during the current Dáil session and I hope we can agree on an early enactment.  The legislation will also limit overtime working. Studies have revealed that a reduction in overtime could result in increased employment.  I am hoping that, with the co-operation of employers and workers, the legislation will result in the creation of additional jobs.</P>
    <P>A further piece of protective legislation which I am preparing relates specifically to young persons.  This legislation will amend the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, to fulfil an undertaking given by my predecessor in the Dáil last July when an order to extend section 4(3) for a further year was debated.</P>
    <P>With increased industrialisation, the range of dangerous substances being used in this country is increasing.  The Dangerous Substances Act is a particularly wide-ranging Act, which provides for the protection not only of workers but of the public and property from the hazards of dangerous substances.  Regulations under the Act control the handling, conveyance and storage of petroleum, and last September, regulations were made to control the conveyance of 25 other substances which are most commonly transported in this country.  I intend to have this list extended, and a further set of regulations is currently being drafted to control the loading, unloading and storage of these substances.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major legislative progress that has taken place during the past few years in relation to occupational safety and health, and which is still continuing, I believe that the establishment last year of a commission of enquiry on safety, health and welfare at work is one of the most important developments in this area since the Department was set up.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that my predecessor <Col N="1590" /> announced his intentions in this respect during the debates on the then Safety in Industry Bill.  The commission will examine both the statutory and voluntary arrangements for safeguarding the safety and health of people at work as well as the question of safeguards for the public from hazards, other than general environmental pollution, arising out of work activities and the transport of dangerous substances.  Their investigations will extend to all areas of work, including those that do not at present come within the ambit of my Department's responsibility.</P>
    <P>The commission have been requested to report back with their findings and recommendations by the end of 1982.  I am confident that the commission's recommendations will help to outline the ways in which the well-being of our work-force, and ultimately that of the community as a whole, can best be protected in the decades to come.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to amend the Night Work (Bakeries) Act to allow the licensing of night-baking.  As Deputies may be aware, employment in the bakery industry is being threatened, one of the main factors being that the bakeries are unable to operate efficiently as they cannot bake at night.  One bakery was due to close down on 31 December last with a loss of almost 200 jobs.  That closure was averted following discussions with the management and a guarantee that the legislation would be amended urgently. The Labour Court also recommended that the legislation be changed to allow baking at night, where employers and workers agree.</P>
    <P>It is therefore my intention to put before the House shortly a Bill to amend the 1936 Night Work (Bakeries) Act to allow the licensing of baking at night. Licences will only be issued following consultations with representatives of employers and employees.  It is my hope that the passing of this legislation will help to stabilise employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality section of my Department is responsible for administration of the equal pay and equal opportunity in employment legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> This legislation establishes the legal right of women to equal pay with men for like work, and for equal treatment with men in entry to employment, training, promotion and all conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>All prohibitions on women at work, such as the prohibitions on women working in industrial work at night, are being looked at to see if the concern which originally inspired them still applies today. If it is necessary to protect women in special cases as, for example, from working in lead processing during pregnancy, such protection will remain, but if any such protection does not appear necessary and results in discrimination in employment, we will give consideration to removing it from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency set up under the equal opportunity in employment legislation of 1977 has the task of publicising the legislation and overseeing progress.  They have monitored the cases being heard by the equality officers and the Labour Court and they encourage individuals to avail of the redress procedures set up under the Acts.</P>
    <P>The agency keep a watchful eye on discriminatory advertisements and on any signs of discriminatory practices in employment.  If they suspect a pattern of discrimination, they are empowered to hold formal investigations and to issue non-discriminatory notices.</P>
    <P>The question of the extent to which career choices for women are affected by subject choices in schools seems basic to the question of removal of discrimination against women.  The Employment Equality Agency, assisted by the Departments of Education and Labour and the EEC, have commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to carry out a research project on the subject.  The project is well advanced.  A sum of £172,000 has been made available in the 1981 budget for the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>In the area of women's affairs, the Department give a grant to the Council for the Status of Women which is the umbrella group for more than 30 women's organisations.  The council are <Col N="1592" /> consulted about any Government initiatives of special relevance to women.</P>
    <P>Suitable premises have been secured by the council in Merrion Square with Government assistance.  A sum of £30,000 has been made available in the 1981 budget for the Council for the Status of Women to help them to continue to promote the role of women in our society.</P>
    <P>The Government have been conscious of the fact that schemes for paid maternity leave exist only in the public service and in some large firms.  To remedy this situation and as a further measure to help to improve the position of women in our society, a statutory scheme of paid maternity leave for women in employment has been prepared which will operate from April 1981.  I am glad to say that the relevant Bill is almost finalised and I expect to present it to the Dáil within the next week.  This legislation will make it easier for women to continue to work after child birth should they so wish and therefore to enable them to compete on equal terms with men.  In too many cases even now, women are in danger of losing their jobs when they take time off to have a baby.  This is a situation which could not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>As part of their industrial relations policy and to promote a more positive and co-operative industrial relations climate, the Government are encouraging the development and promotion of various forms of worker participation.</P>
    <P>In January of this year I authorised the completion of the final stage in the implementation of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  The objective of this scheme is to facilitate greater employee involvement in a number of State companies by providing a legal framework whereby employee representatives may be elected as members of State boards.  To date, elections have been concluded in six State companies and employees have been appointed to their boards.  Plans have been made for the holding of an election in Aer Lingus, the last of the seven State companies covered by the Act.</P>
    <P>The experience in these State bodies has been instructive; the appointment of <Col N="1593" /> worker directors has served as a catalyst to the development of new participative machinery at below-board level and has prompted new management and union approaches to the sharing of information. It is my hope that this favourable experience will ensure the adoption of appropriate initiatives based on the same commitment to structure and process on the part of both sides of industry generally. I am engaged in preparing amending legislation to extend the scope of the Worker Participation Act, in accordance with the Governments' commitment in the national understanding, providing for employee participation at board level in additional State bodies.</P>
    <P>Forms of worker participation at below-board level are being encouraged by the Government through the work of the Irish Productivity Centre, a State-subsidised agency which operates under the joint control of the social partners. The centre offers a range of consultancy and advisory services to industry, including assistance with new forms of consultation, industrial relations and worker participation practices and mechanisms, A growing number of Irish firms are now availing themselves of this facility to review information sharing, methods of work organisation and increase the level and degree of employee involvement in decision making.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the discussion paper &ldquo;Worker Participation&rdquo; which was published by my predecessor in March last year.  The publication of this document has afforded both sides of industry the opportunity to put forward their considered views and opinions on the range of issues involved.  I have been impressed by the response and have requested an evaluation of the range of submissions received to date.  I should add that the scope for initiatives in participation at different levels of the enterprise will be the subject of further study by a representative committee which I propose to establish.  This body I hope will review progress, highlight exemplary practice and direct our attention to the realistic options for our industrial relations system.  The combined effect of these initiatives should make a significant <Col N="1594" /> and positive contribution to reducing the source of industrial strife and, in this way, to fostering a greater sense of cooperating and collaboration between both sides of industry.</P>
    <P>Last year was a relatively good year for industrial relations.  The number of days lost through industrial disputes showed a considerable drop over 1979 &mdash; a total of 404,000 as against 1,427,000.  In fact the 1980 figure represents the best performance in terms of days lost since 1975. There are, however, serious deficiencies in our industrial relations system, in particular the incidence of unofficial strikes and inter-union disputes which are a threat to the peaceful resolution of legitimate conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>We must not be complacent, nor rest on our oars, now that we see an improvement in our industrial relations performance. We should strive to ensure that the improvement is not short-lived and that our commitment to a fair day's work for a fair day's pay is not lessened.  There should be enough means at the disposal of unions and management to discuss and resolve grievances before they are allowed to fester.  On the management side, that means first and foremost accessibility. It also requires a consistent personnel policy which has been determined and agreed upon by all those in management. I would not advocate a dictatorship of the personnel function, but I would urge all line managers to remember that a good working atmosphere means greater efficiency.  In turn, a high rate of output can provide greater security and possibly financial benefits for the work force.</P>
    <P>Where there is a serious grievance which is not capable of being solved by the employer and union concerned, the resources of the State dispute-settling machinery, paid for by the taxpayer, are available as a means of reaching compromise. The Labour Court has been expanded with the addition of a fourth division, and its operation has been made more efficient with the purchase of advanced technology word-processing equipment.  All of this means that the waiting period between referring a dispute for investigation and the issue of a <Col N="1595" /> recommendation on it has been steadily reduced.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of unofficial strikes, the Government are clearly concerned about the situation, where a person or group of individuals acting quite without authority or support from their trade union and engaging in unofficial picketing enjoy precisely the same legal protections as those who mount a picket with a full mandate from their trade union.  Deputies will be aware that consultations are currently going on with employer and trade union interests with a view to reaching consensus on a number of outline proposals for the reform of trade union law which I have suggested to them.  When these consultations are concluded, I intend to put specific proposals to the Government for a decision on their implementation.  Legislation on its own cannot, however, eliminate our industrial relations problems overnight. The primary responsibility for the resolution of disputes rests with employers and workers.  The most the law can do is to even any imbalance which may exist in the legal protection afforded to either social partner, and it would be wrong to suggest that our problems can be solved with a stroke of a pen, or the bringing into effect of a particular piece of law.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention a subject which will have a vital influence on our industrial relations system in the longer term, and that is trade union education and training.  I am well aware of the important contribution which an informed and highly trained trade unionist can make to rational negotiations.  As an indication of the Government's commitment to trade union education, I have authorised the payment of £450,000 to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions towards the cost of their education, training and advisory services during 1981. This sum represents an increase of 50 per cent over last year's figure, and nearly 120 per cent over the 1979 amount.  I am sure the House will agree that this is a generous increase and one that will bear fruit in the years to come in the form of a more articulate, responsible and efficient trade union movement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> This budget is for the people; we have set a clear course for the future.  We are making significant steps towards equity and justice in our society.  I believe we are heading into calmer times, but we must take advantage of the opportunities offered us.  Together we must as a society improve our attitude to the work ethic by reducing absenteeism, improving our industrial relations, by giving more personal commitment to doing our jobs well and being less rigid in the face of technical change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to Deputy O'Donoghue's speech this morning. Deputy O'Donoghue based his speech on the fact that he felt that speakers in the Opposition parties were hypocritical and insincere and that they felt that they had solutions to all our problems.  We do not feel that we have the solutions to all our problems.  We feel that government is needed and government we have not at present.  That is why we would like a general election.  We want the opportunity to get to the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insincerity began in a blatant fashion in 1977.  Deputy O'Donoghue was responsible in no small way for the infamous manifesto which promised to reduce inflation and to create full employment within five years.  Where is the full employment and the reduction in inflation?  Yesterday we had 125,100 people recorded as unemployed and last year we had an 18 per cent rate of inflation. That surely is not sincerity.  The manifesto also raised the expectations of people, especially young people.  When the manifesto was offered we felt that that was the end to all our problems.  We now find that we were conned all the way.  We were told that we would not have to pay car tax in future but the Government have reintroduced car tax in this year's budget in the form of a registration fee of £20.  In the manifesto we were told that there would be a reconstruction grant of £600, a back-boiler grant of £600 and water and sewerage grants but all these grants have been abolished.  The biggest failure was the promise of full employment within five years.  Deputy Nolan knows full well that there are 40,000 people <Col N="1597" /> under 25 unemployed.  That is a horrendous figure.  What a start in life &mdash; a start on a dole queue.  Is this what young people expected?  Certainly not.  They were told there would be jobs for them but where are they?  Deputy Nolan said in his speech that unemployment must be treated as one problem and that youth employment is related to overall employment. I know that the Manpower Consultative Committee said that, but I would argue against that strongly.  There is a contradiction in Deputy Nolan's statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have daily rising unemployment.  We treat youth unemployment with different solutions.  In 1977 youth employment agencies were started off and they began very successfully. We also had the temporary youth employment scheme.  These were separate solutions to the separate problem of youth employment.  Young people found themselves in a catch-22 situation.  They could not get a job because they had no experience and they could not get experience because they had no job.  For that reason youth employment schemes were a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt but the Consultative Manpower Committee recommend that we should take all the unemployed people together and say that where young people are employed we should have special schemes for them.  The Deputy might have misinterpreted what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss Barry Miss Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I interpreted it correctly. They are saying in effect that we should find a solution to unemployment.  They go on to contradict themselves by saying that there are separate solutions for older people, for unemployment generally and for youth unemployment.  Instead of cutting finances available for youth employment schemes as was done last year and this year, more finance should be made available.  I call upon the Minister to bear <Col N="1598" /> in mind that the youth experience programme and the temporary employment grant scheme were very much worth while and that AnCO are doing good work which they cannot continue if they are under-financed.  I appeal to the Minister to put more money into this organisation for the long-term good of young people.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of North-East Cork the unemployment problem is marked. One has only to walk down the streets in any town to see people on the dole queues or fooling around with nothing to do.  It is very demoralising for them. Many of these people are married with two and three children and the children are brought up with the notion when they see their parents at home all the time that there is no such thing as work and they question why anybody should work.  Psychologically this is setting a very bad precedent for family life.  We should guard against this degrading situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last year unemployment in my constituency has increased drastically.  In Fermoy this week last year 387 people were unemployed and this week 700 people are unemployed.  In Mallow this week last year 389 people were unemployed and this week 749 people are unemployed. In Midleton this week last year there were 322 people unemployed and this week there are 740 people unemployed. In Cobh this week last year 196 people were unemployed and this week there are 483 people unemployed.  In Youghal this week last year 252 people were unemployed and this week 359 are unemployed.  During this week last year in my constituency 1,546 people were unemployed but this week there are 3,031 people unemployed.  Unemployment has doubled.  This is a shameful situation and I do not see anything in this year's budget which will help to create employment. All I can see is that £17 million has been set aside for a jet for Aer Lingus but the jobs will be created in Seattle.  This is not much good to the people in my constituency who have no job or no hope of a job because there are no job prospects in the area.  There is no point in a Fermoy man looking for a job in Dublin or in Cork if he has set up family in Fermoy.  It is up <Col N="1599" /> to us to provide jobs for people in their own areas.  After all it is a basic human right.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the investment plan as a blueprint of the plan for the future.  If that is a blueprint of the plan for the future.  I do not want to be around for the future.  I am not a mathematician but I am not stupid.  The first page of that document says that 100,000 jobs will be created here this year.  One can read through the document and tot up 100,000 jobs but in the conclusion to the so called investment plan they state categorically that 10,000 jobs will be created this year. On the first page of the investment plan 100,000 jobs are promised and in the last page we are told that 10,000 jobs will be created.  Who is fooling whom?  I am very cynical about official Government publications. In my short time here I have found they do not make sense at all.</P>
    <P>I am very sceptical about the Book of Estimates.  Will the Department of Justice be run on less money this year with increased inflation and an increased cost of living?  Will the Department of Foreign Affairs be run on less money?  I do not see, with the cost of fuel increasing, how travel will be cheaper this year.  The only solution which I can see to back up this budget, the investment plan, the Book of Estimates and the background to the budget with no plan whatsoever, is for a further budget this year or, as we had last year, thousands of pounds in Supplementary Estimates.  We cannot see anywhere in the budget a cohesive and homogenous plan.  There is no plan whatsoever in the budget.  Perhaps there is a general election on the horizon but the people are suffering because of the prospect of a general election.  The country's interest is being placed second and the general election is placed first.  Surely this is not integrity and this is not what we were elected to do.  We were elected to run the country and not to be concerned only with preserving power for power's sake. I feel the Government are more concerned about preserving power for power's sake.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is falling down on his job.  The most basic thing <Col N="1600" /> needed in agriculture is the restoration of confidence, which is at a very low ebb. The Minister is not doing anything to restore confidence in agriculture.  Deputy Bruton put a six point plan to the Government last December which would restore confidence to agriculture, but 66 Fianna Fáil T.D.'s said no to an inter-subsidy. An inter-subsidy is of vital importance.  Farmers come to me regularly telling me they are not making a profit and they cannot pay back the bank at 18 per cent interest.  I often have to ask them if they have an old tractor which they could sell to keep the bank manager from the door.  I do not know how any Minister for Agriculture could allow a situation to develop where so many in-calf cows were sent to factories to be slaughtered during the past six months. The number of cows disposed of like this is very high.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State comes to my constituency I can show him a farmer who disposed of his entire herd of 300 cows in this manner.  They were sold at £300 to £350 per head.  In any mart or any fair he could get £600 each for them.  Financial circumstances six months ago forced him to sell the in-calf cows to the factory.  Many of our hauliers are forced to go out of business because they have not got the money to pay for their equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this I could not understand, with all the telephones which are being installed every week, why nobody in my constituency was getting one but I came up with an answer last week.  The new telephones, which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tells us are being installed, are being installed in the cities and new estates.  When new houses are being built it is easy to install telephones. We now have people going around canvassing to know if people in those estates will have telephones.  All the telephones are being installed in those places.  People in rural areas like Midleton, Cobh, <Col N="1601" /> Youghal, Fermoy and Mitchelstown are on the waiting list for three and four years.  They are not getting them and they cannot understand why when so many phones are being installed.  There are many people in those areas who are in poor health and who are being deprived of telephones.  Surely this is not a fair means of allocating telephones or distributing them.  The lines are not good either. A constituent of mine rang me this morning and said he contacted me because he was unable to get on to the Department of Social Welfare.  He said he got Baltinglass, then Wexford, then Meath and then he contacted me.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of 25 per cent which has been given to social welfare recipients.  The Department of Social Welfare are not answering their telephones. There are many people who cannot get their money.  There are long delays in paying them what they are due. I came in to this House yesterday morning, and again this morning at 9.30 a.m.. I spent my time from then until 11 o' clock ringing 786444 but I failed to get a reply.  It has been the same story for the last six weeks.  It is all right for TD's who get their money every week and have sufficient to live on but many social welfare recipients who have six, seven or eight children have nothing to live on because the Department of Social Welfare are not sending their money out to them.  Will the Minister of State in the House at the moment tell the Minister for Social Welfare that I cannot understand why, if there are so many lines into the Department of Social Welfare, I continuously fail to get on to the Department? If the Minister of State has five minutes to spare and he comes up to my office and tries to get on to the Department of Social Welfare he will understand how impossible it is to get on to them.  One day last week Deputy Lipper came in at 9.30 a.m. to get on to the Department of Social Welfare but when I spoke to him at 1 o'clock that day he had not got on to them.  There is something amiss.  That matter should be rectified. They are trying to help people who cannot help themselves.  As the Department of Social Welfare is being run at the <Col N="1602" /> moment, these people cannot help themselves because they are not getting the money.  The long term solution &mdash; and it is badly needed &mdash; is to decentralise the Department, but we need an immediate solution to deal with urgent problems.  I will try again when I go upstairs and I guarantee that it will take another half an hour.  In the meantime there are people in Cork who have not got a bite to put in their mouths, and the Government have no sympathy for them.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the increase in social welfare benefits, the Government should remember that many people suffer because of a lack of proper services.  If they are genuinely concerned about social justice, they should take immediate steps to alleviate the plight of these people.  Deputy Dr. Browne has put down questions in the Dáil about this before.  County councillors and Deputies send speeches to the papers about this problem, but I have never seen anything done about it.  This is about the tenth time I raised the matter in this House and I hope something will be done now.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the licence fee imposed last year after the budget.  The £100 licence fee for dance halls was very unfair.  It includes community centres, and so on.  It is all very well for proprietors of commercial ballrooms to have to pay a licence fee of £100.  They can make sufficient profits to cover that fee.  In no way can I understand why small community halls, which were built through the efforts of the local community, should be charged £100 to run three or four dances a year.  I thought all Governments and all parties were in favour of fostering a community spirit.  It is very important that such a community spirit should be fostered.  This licence is doing a disservice to the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Taoiseach that no drink is served in these community halls.  They are ideal gathering places for young people and it is ludicrous to charge them a licence fee of £100.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Fianna Fáil Party will go to Disneyland for the weekend.  I am sure those who join the melee in the RDS will have a great weekend.  There will be clapping, cheering, congratulations, <Col N="1603" /> innovations and celebrations.  I should like to remind them of the realities behind the hullaballoo.  Will they clap the Government with 125,000 unemployed? Will they clap the Government who allowed the cost of living to go up by 37 per cent in the past two years?  Will they clap the Taoiseach and the Government who allowed farmers' incomes to drop by 50 per cent in the past two years?  Will they clap the Government who do not seem to make any effort to provide housing for young people?  Young people are experiencing a very serious housing problem. We speak about broken marriages and their solution, but we never ask what causes them.  One of the major causes must be inadequate housing facilities. People have no chance to make a start in life because they cannot get a flat, not to speak of a house.  Young married couples trying to get a house are the new poor. The Government should do something positive to alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government increased the county council loan from £9;000 to £12,000, and that was good in itself.  The problem we were faced with in Cork County Council was that, by the time people got the loan, which took at least a year, it was no good to them because they had been repaying an 18 per cent bridging loan to the banks.  Therefore, the benefits to be derived from the county council loan were wiped out compleely.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will enjoy the weekend.  It will be cloud cuckooland.  They will clap and shout.  The Government who have failed in their aim to reduce inflation, to increase employment, to increase growth and to balance the public accounts have not got very much to celebrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget debate is now in its second full week.  We have had the inevitable speeches from Deputies on the far side of the House.  Most of those speeches, if not all, have been tempered with a great deal of dishonesty.  I should like to compliment Deputy Barry, who opened her contribution by making the point that her party had no plans and no solutions to the country's problems.  We have made that point from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> I am glad at least one Member of the Fine Gael Party was prepared to stand up and make such an admission.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that at present the world is going through a very serious economic recession.  In many parts of the world it has been termed an economic storm.  For the first time since the war big countries are having extreme difficulties with their economies.  Unemployment has been rising at an unprecedented level in most western countries.  Inflation has reached extremely high proportions in countries such as Germany, Italy, and the United States which was always the bulwark of western society.  They have felt not only a breeze but a storm over the past few years.</P>
    <P>Our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, has over two million unemployed. Recently it was forecast by independent commentators that unemployment will increase to three million in the UK before the recession ends.  The dominating influence affecting the world's economy has been the spectacular increases in the price of oil.  The quadrupling of prices at the end of 1973 plunged the industrial countries of the west into a deep and prolonged recession. Since 1979 oil prices have risen by as much as 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>Considering that background, which has sufficient factors to cripple and damage seriously strong economies and strong countries, countries with historical industrial traditions, I fail to understand the theoretical thinking of the many critics who try to lay responsibility for all our economic ills on the shoulders of the Government.  The fall in the value of the punt has been presented through the media to the public in such a manner as to suggest that it is the biggest, the most serious and the greatest problem we have today.  It has not been stated clearly that the world currency market has been in turmoil as a result of the increased strength of sterling.  In recent times we have had experience of the American currency recovering to some extent.  Our position within the EMS has been relatively good.  Since we entered in December 1979 we have maintained our position <Col N="1605" /> as one of the strong currencies in the European context.</P>
    <P>The budget has been criticised in much the same manner.  One would expect such criticism from the Opposition benches but, irrespective of one's political leanings and thinking, there was a lot of good in the Minister's proposals through the responsible approach he took, bearing in mind the present economic climate.  This climate has unfortunately been glossed over and has been hardly referred to.  The Government's concern for the more vulnerable sections of the community, particularly social welfare recipients, the aged, the ill and unemployed, were skipped over and little reference was made to them in the reporting of the budget two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare granted last year were very similar.  They were real and worthwhile, not only to keep pace with the present rate of inflation but also to provide more in real terms for the less fortunate.  It seems we still have in our midst dismal Jonahs who would begrudge that little extra for the less well off.  On the evening of the budget we witnessed the sad scene of the Labour Party, who claim to hold the principles of Connolly and Larkin, march through the lobbies with Fine Gael to vote against the Government's proposals to obtain the required revenue to pay social welfare recipients.  There is no excuse for that. Nobody condones that action.  Putting a few extra pence on the pint or a gallon of petrol does not hurt anyone very much. I am fully aware from speaking to people that nobody will grudge the additional few pence necessary to provide extra social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Before, the budget the media were competing with each other in their forecasts and most commentators were forecasting what they termed a soft election budget or one with lots of goodies to give away.  There were others who went in the opposite direction and forecast an extremely harsh budget.  They forecast increases in direct taxation as well as on the old reliables.  Perhaps the fact that the Minister brought in a responsible budget to suit the economy rather than <Col N="1606" /> one to suit any other narrow purpose was a disappointment to some commentators. Hence, we have the non-constructive and unbalanced reporting and comments we have had ever since.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the manner in which the Government have handled the country's affairs during the serious recession which is still with us.  It is true that unemployment figures have risen.  That is an unfortunate and unpalatable fact that nobody likes.  However, the record number of new jobs created in 1980 has helped to cushion the effects of increasing unemployment to some extent.  The creation of so many new jobs during 1980 was a great achievement.  It was a tremendous feat for the Government agency concerned that they were so successful in attracting foreign industry here during a recession of real magnitude.  Competition by developing countries to attract new industries is fierce and it is more difficult than ever to attract new, worthwhile investment that will give the required number of extra jobs to this or any other country.  We can no longer offer the obvious advantages we could up to some years ago.  Our labour costs are rising swiftly and the IDA must be able to convince prospective industrialists of a steady flow of labour of good quality and performance.  Any investor intending to invest a lot of finance in any industry will seek industrial peace.  In 1980 the number of work-days lost showed a big improvement over 1979.  We hope this trend will continue and that all those concerned in industrial relations will realise that disputes resulting in job stoppages and strikes, whether official or unofficial, benefit no one, least of all the worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour this afternoon pinpointed a number of factors in this respect.  I was pleased to hear the proposals and plans which his Department have for 1981.  The recession has hit every country very hard.  No country escaped. All economies suffered.  In some cases bigger economies have suffered more than smaller ones.  The UK, for instance, despite the compensation of having North Sea oil, is in an extremely bad way. A recession in Britain in the old days was always bad for us.  For different reasons <Col N="1607" /> today it is still bad for us because they are one of our biggest trade customers.  The effects in the context of our European membership is lighter.  Nevertheless, a buoyant and healthy Britain is good for us.  They have always been excellent trading customers.  They have a big population and many outlets and have a business understanding similar to ours.  It has always been easier to trade with Britain. It is unfortunate that the recession has hit so hard over there and bitten so deeply that it has restricted the opportunity for our exporters.</P>
    <P>If the British market was not in such a depressed condition we, with our currency advantages and benefits, could have enjoyed a tremendous increase in our export opportunities and this would have confirmed everything that was said when we entered the EMS.  We have now an independent currency.  Certainly it should be of tremendous value in so far as selling goods to the United Kingdom is concerned.  The loss in the value of the punt against sterling receives constant publicity in the media.  Unfortunately, in a situation in which sterling may be gaining daily, various announcements totally distort that picture.  For example, anybody listening to the 1.30 news on RTE, listening to other news headlines and reading headlines in the press could be forgiven for thinking that the punt is a currency on the way out or about to disintegrate. It is indeed unfortunate that news should be given to the public in this distorted fashion.  Little or no emphasis has ever been placed on the fact that it is not the value of the punt that is changing but that of sterling.  In these difficult times it is to our credit that the punt has remained stable within the EMS and remains in the upper half of the European currency basket.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that nobody criticises the Irish as severely as the Irish themselves which, unfortunately, has been proved true in many instances. Indeed this is borne out by the examples I have given of how we criticise ourselves unfairly and unjustifiably, which does not do our image abroad any good whatever. In a recession such as we are experiencing <Col N="1608" /> rather should everybody be putting their shoulders to the wheel, being more constructive in their approach to all aspects of life.  For long enough we were tied to a foreign currency.  Now that we are independent and doing reasonably well in present circumstances we should be propagating the good news that the punt has been holding so well in the European context and not be painting a picture of a sinking currency.  The media can be and has been shown to be a very powerful influence particularly on our younger people.  I would appeal to them to be somewhat more constructive and balanced in their reporting and not be pouring forth scare headlines day after day because the news is not as dismal as it is painted.  I would hope that advice might be borne in mind in the future.</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister for Labour spoke at some length on industrial disputes. I shall not dwell on the subject in any great detail except to say that I can never understand why the parties to a dispute cannot sit down and talk to each other.  I can never understand why there appears to be some groups who seek always to emerge occupying a position of strength, using that strength against weaker sections whether they be in their industry or in the community at large because this brings about unnecessary suffering on their fellow citizens.  Such confrontation helps nobody, least of all the nation.  Collective bargaining should always be the objective of everybody, thus bringing about a greater degree of co-operation and understanding.</P>
    <P>Indeed such would also reflect real patriotism and would seem to be working in the interests of the country at employee, employer and union levels.  I should like to think that we would throw out many of our old, bad habits this year, that everybody would seek to do a little better and what is right for the country rather than for themselves only.  There has been a lot of greed demonstrated in recent years.  Of course there has also been a lot of justifiable complaint but there is no reason that such matters cannot be approached in a moderate, constructive way.  But let us throw out the greed that has been prevalent and work <Col N="1609" /> as a unit.  If we do so I have no doubt but that we will emerge from this depression in a way which will be beneficial to us all and particularly our younger citizens.</P>
    <P>In so doing we would also attract the greater foreign industrial investment so necessary for the continued creation of jobs.  In this respect the investment plan announced by the Minister will substantially increase the provision for industrial development in 1981.  Foreign investment here has been extremely strong despite the recession.  This has been so particularly in the growth industries such as electronics, chemicals and so on.  Indeed in this respect we have made tremendous progress in the matter of job training. AnCO have made an excellent contribution here, one which has been of benefit to the many thousands of our young people coming on to the labour market. They have become qualified in a highly technical way making them eligible to work in these new industries, which has served also as an encouragement to the more sophisticated type of industrialist to come here.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have set course to strengthen and improve the public investment relationship <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector.  I do not see why private enterprise should not be deployed more in a role complementary to public development.  For example, roads are a real case in point.  Last year legislation was passed in regard to toll roads.  At present in Dublin there are proposals for the building of a toll bridge across the Liffey, north to south.  Such developments are absolutely necessary.  Indeed one might very well ask: why should not private enterprise be not alone encouraged but pressed to assist in such national development?  Such developments would, in the final analysis, benefit the whole community with a beneficial spin-off for commerce generally.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised by Opposition parties on numerous occasions because of the condition of our roads.  I cannot speak with any great knowledge about the condition of roads in rural areas.  As far as I am concerned the biggest traffic problem is in Dublin.  No major road development has taken place in recent <Col N="1610" /> years except the Talbot Bridge which was built across the Liffey about four years ago.  The population in Dublin has increased to almost 900,000 and it is forecast that in 1991 it will have increased to 1.3 million people.  It is also forecast that in 1991, with the present development in the city, there will be half a million vehicles on the road.  The greatest obstacle to doing anything definite to develop road systems, to build motorways, has been the Opposition parties who are split because of local issues.  If we are to provide the jobs which will be required in the future and if we are to meet the requirements of our young people in Dublin city and county we must develop our road systems urgently to cater for the new and developing industries and the increased industries that will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Dublin port is developing at a fast rate and modernised methods have brought more and more juggernauts driving through our city streets creating greater traffic jams and bottlenecks.  Energy has been lost and wasted, not to mention the stress on nerves resulting in coronary attacks and so on that such traffic brings in its wake.  Dublin city and county must provide an additional 100,000 new jobs over the next ten years.  This Government continue over the years to invest more and more in the IDA and the spin-off has been worth millions of pounds because of the record number of jobs that have been created since 1977.  That will not be enough if, over the next ten years, we are to reach the target that will be necessary to provide sufficient employment for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>Because of the serious traffic problems Dublin city cannot take such major industrial development.  It is therefore urgent that all responsible at Government level, at City Council level, commercial interests and so on, come up with proper road development plans and proposals to meet the needs of a growing city.  Recently the Fianna Fáil group in City Hall proposed a section 4 motion directing the City Manager to bring in major road proposals as a matter of urgency.  This was passed and hopefully when these plans are produced later this year Fine Gael and Labour <Col N="1611" /> will act in a responsible way and support the plans which will be for the benefit of the city and of future employment and industrial development.</P>
    <P>Such chaotic traffic conditions as we have at present also mean a serious and expensive waste of petrol.  Energy conservation is being driven home strongly to everybody.  The Tánaiste, in an effort to emphasise and make the public more aware of the necessity to conserve energy, has been on a nation-wide tour expounding this.  We are now paying the best part of £1,000 million for our fuel and our economy is much too small to be able to afford the shocking, substantial waste of energy that seems to take place daily all over the country.  Householders and industrialists and motorists can all save energy and use less energy if only some thought was given to it.  The amount of energy that goes up in smoke, in exhaust fumes, polluting our city daily in traffic jams must be fantastically high. Any reasonable saving brought about by a free-flowing traffic system would almost be sufficent over a short period to meet the cost of major road development.</P>
    <P>The willingness of Irish consumers to purchase Irish made products is a very major factor to enable companies to expand sales and employment.  For many years now the various bodies set up to promote the sale and the purchase of Irish made goods have not been too successful. Now, however, the Irish Goods Council, through its more modern type campaign has met with some degree of success.  The big problem, however, for the shopper is the difficulty in locating a store where he or she can purchase Irish made goods.  I have had this experience myself in some of our leading stores and I have from time to time received complaints from consumers who wanted to buy Irish but had great difficulty in doing so due to the fact that some of our stores have been reluctant to stock Irish goods. I believe that a significant change in the purchasing patterns recently is leading much more to the purchase and the sale of Irish made goods.  In the present economic climate manufacturers and retailers cannot, in the national interest, afford <Col N="1612" /> to ignore the growing consumer demand for and commitment to buy Irish goods. An additional 5p spent by shoppers in buying Irish would provide a further 16,000 jobs.  This is very little additional expenditure to make such a complementary factor in employment and it is something that many people possibly do not think about.</P>
    <P>The investment plan which I mentioned earlier provides for a total investment of over £1,700 million.  This offers unprecedented opportunities to Irish manufacturers to increase sales of domestic goods.  The plan has made it quite clear that success in this area will depend ultimately on the competitiveness of Irish goods and services.  Therefore the importance of highlighting and maximising the Irish context of the different investment projects cannot be emphasised enough. There must be a positive approach by the private sector to taking the opportunities to utilise such advantages as are there daily in an ever growing domestic market. The investment plan will provide the necessary base for this.  Very often we come across miscellaneous items and express surprise that a particular item we are looking at is not manufactured in Ireland but has been imported.  Very often these are small things and the price is low but they would have a huge turnover and would create many more jobs. This is an area where much more can be done.  It is an area where specialist qualities or specialist involvements might not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I said earlier, I felt the budget proposals were realistic, that they were strategically tailored to suit the present economic climate and that they were specially designed to maintain economic growth and development.  The budget made an honest effort to protect the living standards particularly of the underprivileged and the less well-off.  The plight and difficulties of the weaker sections of our community have always received priority from a Fianna Fáil Government. Irrespective of what Labour or any so-called socialist-minded person may claim, this has been the case down the years and there are figures to prove it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> In this budget it cost £133 million to provide social welfare increases.  Every fair-minded person will understand and accept that the Minister must provide for that type of expenditure from some source.  It is true to say that the smoker, the drinker and the motorist have accepted these increases as inevitable and will continue to do so.  There were some complaints recently from publicans about drop off in business but I do not know if these reports were made prior to or after the budget.  Any Member of this House who goes into a lounge bar in this city any night of the week will see this complaint is not true.  I was in a couple of suburban lounges recently and each place was packed.  This was not at the weekend but on week nights.  I cannot see the basis for such despondency.</P>
    <P>It has been proved over the years that price increases make little difference because it must be remembered that incomes are increasing all the time, but well ahead of prices.  There is very little resentment when the revenues from these increases are passed on to the less well off.  I would go further and say that in 99.9 per cent of cases there is no resentment if they pay a little extra for drink, a smoke or whatever, knowing it means an increase for pensioners, the sick and the unemployed.  I consider this has been a very good budget which faced up to our problems, which planned for the future and has given assistance and help where it was most needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker did his best when speaking about this budget and tried to do a PRO job on the punt, but I could not agree with him.  I believe this budget has failed badly.  In household budgeting one must take into account the amount one is likely to spend, what one is likely to get in by way of income and revenue, figure out what one can afford to spend and then balance the account. This is a dishonest budget because it does not set out to do that.  Independent economists stated that in all our newspapers. If the newspapers or the media tell the truth we should not be too concerned because that happened when we were in power.  We did not like it but that is the <Col N="1614" /> job of independent economists.</P>
      <P>Just before the Christmas recess we were presented with a package of £450 million worth of Supplementary Estimates. That is how good our budgeting is.  We can be sure that this budget is exactly the same.  The big problem &mdash; and we can trace this back to the manifesto &mdash; is that people are expecting the earth and they have to have it and it is all right as long as somebody is carrying the can. In other words, we all have a sense of justice but it is justice in the passive voice: let everyone else be just to us and let everybody else pay.</P>
      <P>I am fearful for the economy.  The previous speaker mentioned the Dublin pubs being full every night of the week. We have come to a situation of eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die.  The nation has been demoralised by the Government's attitude.  People see no future. They have lost confidence and this is very serious.</P>
      <P>In my constituency we have industries closing down every day and people going on a three-day week.  Of course these people are drawing unemployment benefit but how long can we keep on like this?  Something should be done quickly. It was not correct for the previous speaker to say that this recession is happening across Europe.  In 1980 the European farmers said that 5 per cent was more than adequate, but 5 per cent here did not even meet farmers' basic costs.  In most European countries there was a 5 per cent and 6 per cent growth rate, bank interest rates were 7 per cent and 8 per cent and inflation was at 7 per cent and 8 per cent, but here we had inflation at 20 per cent, bank interest rates of 20 per cent and a zero growth rate.  That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in blaming the EEC. We have to straighten out our own household. Election year or no election year I thought the Government would have had the courage to do this, and they would have been admired for doing it because people are prepared for the truth.  They have had enough lies.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto tells us what they were going to do about price control.  Comparative prices were to be published weekly by the <Col N="1615" /> media but the papers do not carry such information any more because it is not news.  We have a budget every day.  In fact, the day after the Minister introduced the budget there was an announcement of massive increase by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in postal and telephone charges.</P>
    <P>The people are ready to hear the truth. It will have to be made known quickly that we as a nation cannot carry on borrowing indefinitely, that we must stop and decide to fight our way out of the difficulties.  We will have to say to our people that we have landed in one hell of a mess with unprecedented borrowing. The time has come to stop and bring back confidence, the first stage in the fight to control inflation.  Once inflation has been got under control everything else will follow. The big worry of industrialists contemplating setting up an industry here, apart from the industrial relations problems &mdash; the Government have not done anything about them &mdash; is that the country is running downhill quickly.</P>
    <P>There was such a bad year in 1980 that those involved in the tourist industry made an appeal to the Government.  The hotel industry employs 23,000 people on a full-time basis and 20,000 on a part-time basis.  It brings in £170 million to the Exchequer, 50 per cent of which originates outside the country.  The Government were asked to do something to help that industry in the coming year.  Those involved in the industry put forward good suggestions which would not cost the earth.  The suggestions include the removing of VAT from meals consumed in hotels, the removing of import duty from cars and coaches used in tourism, the introduction of a low cost fuel scheme for cars and coaches rented by tourists, the lowering of the insurance cost to car rental companies and the introduction of a scheme of low interest loans, similar to those available to the manufacturing industry, for those involved in the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Those suggestions have been ignored. The cost of licences for dance halls and community halls has been increased by 100 per cent.  The ordinary guesthouse <Col N="1616" /> owner was not forgotten in the budget because he will have to pay £100 for the privilege of being able to serve a bottle of wine to his guests.  The appeal of those in that section of the industry fell on deaf ears.  They wanted the grant to Bord Fáilte substantially increased.  In real terms that grant has been reduced.  There is little point in talking about tourism if the board responsible for it is not adequately financed.  I have also pointed out that, because of the many problems experienced by hotels in their efforts to develop and expand, a substantial portion of Bord Fáilte funds should be spent at home. Bord Fáilte are doing a wonderful job in promoting the country but I believe we would be better off spending more of our time and money developing the product at home.  If our product is right, like any other good product, it will sell itself.  That is why I was disappointed that the Minister did not mention those salient facts.</P>
    <P>In 1980 we had a crazy situation in that the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism did not spend £700,000 of the amount allotted for the tourist industry.  That amount was spent by some other section.  That was bad form at a time when the industry was crying out for assistance in many areas.  Many of those involved in it were up to their tonsils with bank problems.  They were trying to expand and develop and to hold their prices.  We have heard the pious approach of the Minister to those in the hotel industry to keep their prices in order, but how can they do so when they have VAT at the rate of 15 per cent slapped on to them, when the price of the bottle of beer and the packet of cigarettes is jacked up out of all proportion, when the cost of petrol is increased drastically and when the oil used to heat hotels is increased?  How can they contain their costs when the Government are responsible for the inflationary spiral?  Last year the number of visitors dropped by 95,000. We cannot afford that size of a drop in that industry.</P>
    <P>As Opposition spokesman on tourism, I intend to point out at every opportunity the errors of the Government's ways in dealing with this industry.  Recently Mr. Robin Berrington, the Cultural Affairs <Col N="1617" /> and Press Officer at the US Embassy in Dublin, wrote a few things about us.  I do not agree with all he said but it is fair to say that he blew some fresh air into our isolated and provincial country, as he called it.  He referred to our dreary landscapes, the areas that are fouled up with rubbish, the car skeletons and so on.  In that regard he was correct.  I accept that this is not a matter for the Government alone: it should be the concern of us all. Years ago, when people did not have the benefit of modern education, one rarely saw the type of messing up of public places that takes place today.  One did not see grafitti on the walls or the deliberate wrecking of telephone kiosks.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have my sympathy because they cannot keep the kiosks in order with the amount of vandalism that is taking place.  Where can one park a car in Dublin city at night without it being damaged?</P>
    <P>This is a problem all of us in this Parliament must tackle.  However it is to be done, this country has to be cleaned up. Everybody &mdash; the teachers, the parents, the social workers and the Garda Síochána&mdash;must help to get people to toe the line to stop this fouling up of the countryside.  If we adopted what operates in Europe we might solve a lot of the problem.  For instance, anybody found dumping rubbish on our beautiful roadsides should have to pay substantial fines. On the Continent anybody throwing, say, a paper bag out of a window would be fined substantially.  This is the only way out of it.  The fines and penalties will have to be increased if we are serious about tourism and about advertising our beautiful countryside.  Our countryside must live up to the descriptions and colour illustrations of our tourist literature.  It will not do to have our roads and towns littered with refuse and dirt and to leave derelict motor cars around the place. That will have to stop.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed to hear the Minister for Transport at Question Time yesterday show so little concern for the unfortunate victims of the Bray Travel collapse.  As one commentator pointed out today, he was let off lightly on this one.  However, I say to him now that he <Col N="1618" /> must introduce legislation immediately to cover that situation and he must do so retrospectively.  If he cannot do it, the challenge is there for him to move over and let us do it.  Bonding should be extended.  We had a situation in the cattle business recently where small farmers sold their entire herds to men of straw and now these small farmers are penniless. Right across the board we should have a system where people who give goods or money on trust will be covered by a bond.  Certainly, cattle traders and people like that should be registered for this purpose.  It should apply to anybody dealing with public money.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the farming situation and we have been criticised for not coming up with a positive solution.  We are accused of condemning all the time.  Quite rightly somebody can come along and ask &ldquo;If you spend money on tourism, where are you going to get it?&rdquo;  It is like putting in fertiliser.  It is one area where we can reap the benefits.  It is an area where money has to be spent, if you are to get full value out of it, but you will have your reward.  The same applies to agriculture.  That fact is registering now.</P>
    <P>In Limerick recently we had a public meeting of the farmers and the number of people who came out from Limerick city, many miles, to sympathise with the farming section was amazing.  It is percolating slowly into the minds of city and urban people that the farmers are in even bigger trouble than they are admitting.  It is serious.  Every day of the week groups of them are coming along to meet members of the Government.  I joined a few of these deputations, not in any critical sense but appealing to the various Ministers to do something quickly.  We in Fine Gael put up some concrete proposals. The least mentioned of these I am inclined to put first, and that is that immediate help &mdash; and I mean immediate &mdash; be given to many young farmers who have found themselves in difficulties because they borrowed money to develop and expand their farms.  The help must be immediate because, as we see in the weekend newspapers, when the sales start to come on, tomorrow may well be <Col N="1619" /> too late.  These were not lackadaisical people.  These were the very best, the cream of the farmers, the people who took the advice of their agricultural advisers, which was the best they could get at the time.  They borrowed at 12.5 and 13 per cent interest.  In one case I know of the increase in interest alone has added £5,000 to the farmer's repayments bill. That is something he did not budget for and he could not be expected to foresee that things would go so haywire in such a short time.</P>
    <P>What the farmers are really looking for is a note of confidence from the Government. We wish the Minister well in his endeavours in Brussels, but it must look pretty bad for him going out there pleading for the special case when here at home nothing is being done for the most substantial farmers who have experienced so many problems.  All they have is substantial rates and ever-increasing costs and it is this factor that makes life so uncertain and difficult for them.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that they should produce more.  I even tried that myself at one time.  It is only compounding the problem because if you are not getting paid for what you produce, if you are not getting a profit on X tons, then, because your costs are going to increase, you are not going to produce more.  You cannot make a profit on X plus anything now.  For that reason the Minister will have to look very seriously at the prices being offered to farmers, otherwise we will have problems of production in the sugar industry, the dairy industry and the beef industry.  Certainly these are areas where we should be talking about expansion. All over Europe people are buying as much food as ever.  Our dairy products are selling well.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Government, during this difficult period for farmers, cannot help to tide them over. It will not be an on-going situation.  We must be clear about it, the sort of help we are asking for now need not, necessarily, be repeated.  It should be identified as temporary help but it should be immediate.  It is one of the more frightening <Col N="1620" /> areas of the present crisis, that the Government seem to be caught in the rain without an umbrella.  It used to be a feature of Irish life that we put something by for the rainy day.  The rainy day has come in more senses than one.  We find ourselves unable to come to the rescue of farmers.  As a result, they are talking about taking to the streets.  The farmers do not want to do this.  It is not in their interest or the interest of society that this should happen.  It is a serious matter if they are compelled to do this.  They feel their livelihoods are at stake and they see no solution to their problems, except direct Government help, which they require now.</P>
    <P>When one considers the foolish spending undertaken by the Government over the last three or four years, one wonders why the Taoiseach, who is supposed to be a financial wizard, could not see his way to put money where he will get returns, to the farming community, the sugar industry and into the food business. It is rather frightening.  Last evening, Deputy Bermingham spelt out what happened in Carlow.  The farmers there never dishonoured their contracts and the workers also played their part.  In spite of all that, we are faced with a closure.  Where is all this going to end? Have the Government lost heart completely with regard to industry?  We have now come to accept the three-day week as normal.  Farm machinery firms are on a three-day week.  I do not have to tell Government Members and the Minister sitting opposite me how demoralising that is.  They may be as well off financially but they are at home with very little to do.  The discipline of work becomes more and more difficult for them.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was speaking to someone about the purchase of a house from the local authority.  I was pointing out how much it would cost.  He seemed very hesitant and he asked what would happen if he was not able to meet his repayments. I told him he could revert to being a local authority tenant and asked him why he was worried as he was in a safe job.  He said there was no such thing in East Cork at present as a safe job.  That remark is the greatest indictment of the present <Col N="1621" /> Government which I have heard in my constituency.  After three years, having found the economy in good heart &mdash; according to Senator Whitaker &mdash; we are in a situation where our borrowing has got out of hand and we are throwing good money after bad in the wrong direction. If the Government had any sense, they would be pouring money into those areas which would help us to get out of our difficulties and creating jobs in the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is well known and accepted that agriculture is in its infancy with regard to processing.  We have a long way to go and many jobs can be created in that industry. When you see those basic industries closing down, it is time for Opposition parties to tell the Government to get on with the job or to get out before it is too late, because the equipment in those factories will not last very long in mothballs.  The skills of workers in Youghal Carpets will not last very long because these people will go abroad to find work.  The skills that took a century to build up will be gone like the froth of the sea, which is happening at the moment in my constituency.</P>
    <P>We find the reality of our problems in the Department of the Environment. Reference has been made by many speakers to housing.  We are fast becoming a nation of mobile homes and caravans. Living in a mobile home no longer ensures you will get a house.  Such people are told they have a good mobile home. The whole area of housing must be tackled immediately.  There is an increasing demand for local authority housing because people have not the money to build their own houses.  They have not the confidence or security of jobs to do it.  Local authority housing will have to be handled completely differently.  The Government should, forthwith, use every available acre of land in local authority ownership for system built houses. Rather than having to wait for the lengthy process of building the traditional house we should construct system built houses which can be completed in six weeks.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing loans, we will probably get something now that there is an election in the air.  We have hardly <Col N="1622" /> had a housing loan paid since before Christmas in Cork County Council.  The County Manager told us he could not pay the loans because he had no money.</P>

      <P>We will be told all about the millions that were spent.  In every paper I read a Fianna Fáil Deputy is telling us about more millions that were spent.  We cannot get away from the grim fact that we did not have the money to pay the loans that were cleared.  We are now bringing in &mdash; this is something that we will hear more about &mdash; new clauses to make housing loans more difficult.  We have such a thing as a certificate of reasonable value and a certificate of exemption from reasonable value.  We have clients writing for a certificate of exemption only to be told that what they need is a certificate of reasonable value.  When the builder goes for a certificate of reasonable value he is told that the customer should go for a certificate of exemption. This sort of crazy situation continues to exist and I can give ample evidence of it.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction grants are gone but even the few miserable grants that are left are hedged around with new clauses. You must now improve the whole house. An unfortunate person who has scraped up every penny he has to build a back kitchen or a room for a child is told that he will have to put in all new windows.  If he uses a product called &ldquo;beauty board&rdquo; in the hall he will have to take it down and plaster the wall.  That is what he is told.  He will not get his £600 grant unless he improves the whole house.  That is out of the question; he has to forfeit his grant. It would be a better thing to say: &ldquo;You will not get a grant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the performance in the area of sewerage and sewage control.  The UK was mentioned as doing badly but it is going a great deal better than we are.  They had a major effluent problem.  The Thames was so bad at one time that you could almost <Col N="1623" /> walk across it but they have made that river so clean at enormous expense that the salmon are now moving up the river again and there is life in it.  What are we doing?  In the case of Cork harbour we are making proposals to the Department of the Environment, with the blessing of the Minister to dump raw effluent into that most beautiful harbour.  We are told that 5,000 tons per day of effluent from one town alone will not cause any deterioration in the quality of the water.  Did anyone ever hear such rubbish?  If we are serious about tourism and our people's welfare the environment is important and we should protect it; we have a duty to do so.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that a previous Minister of the present Government produced a beautiful document called &ldquo;Water is Life&rdquo; which made some very good comments.  That Minister was moved on and we now have a situation when this beautiful harbour &mdash; I am sure the same applies to Dublin and elsewhere &mdash; is being made an outdoor toilet. Everything it can take will be dumped into it.  This is one of the finest harbours in the world and it is our hall-door as far as most Europeans are concerned.  All during our summer they will sail up that harbour from various car ferries and in tourist boats from abroad and at low tide, what will they see?  Effluent all over the place.</P>
    <P>Many of those who live and work in those harbour areas cannot afford to go to Tenerife or such places, but they need some recreation in their area and are entitled to it.  I appeal to the Government to follow the European trend and clean up our harbours and make the country beautiful.  I have already made suggestions regarding graffiti, cars and rubbish dumps.  Much of the refuse problem goes back to the Department of the Environment. We are told they had not sufficient money to collect refuse and had to cut back on collections.  That being so, people had no option but to dump refuse somewhere on the road and that is happening.</P>
    <P>We hear wonderful talk about toll bridges.  Soon we will be constructing toll <Col N="1624" /> bridges over pot holes.  Cork county engineering staff are doing a wonderful job in keeping these holes filled but it is an impossible task because what we need is major road works.  Nobody is boasting about what is happening to the roads. The only roads being dealt with are those funded out of EEC money; every other road is completely neglected.  As regards the hedgerows the buachallán and the thistles were almost meeting last summer. We made one run with the hedge cutter up and down where we would normally make three.  It is pathetic to think that we as a local authority put up big notices in our windows warning that a farmer with noxious weeks will be prosecuted when we are the greatest propagators of noxious weeds ourselves.  They blow all over the countryside as a result of the inability of local authorities, because of lack of funds, to do their job properly.</P>
    <P>I do not like this business of water charges.  Local authorities were supposed to get all the funds they needed from central funds but we are now trying to knock money out of the householders by jacking up water charges &mdash; rates by another name.  Last week I asked the Minister to tell me what he is doing about the Blackwater.  The Minister of State is now in the House and I appeal to him to do something for the victims in Mallow. I was told in the written reply in the Dáil that the Minister was considering the matter.  How long more will he be considering it when you have shopkeepers, private owners and even farmers with stock losses who are thousands of pounds out of pocket?  We were promised something from a disaster fund and we were told we would have to put something into the fund ourselves.  Surely we should do that. This should apply not merely to flooding but to other disaster areas such as Cobh where we had a massive landslide.  We should set up an insurance fund to deal with those disaster areas because they cannot be insured in the normal way. Some people in Mallow who had their own insurance found when they went to claim that they were not entitled to anything because it was supposed to be a disaster area.  I appeal to the Minister, <Col N="1625" /> not in any venomous spirit, to do something no matter how little within the limits of the funds of the Department for these people.</P>
    <P>I must come back to the matter of job losses because it is the thing that bugs me most.  When I pass through my local town as the children come out of school, it terrifies me to see all these wonderful young, educated people who will be coming on the job market.  We have nothing to offer them.  I do not think that even the emigrant ship is there now because the job situation abroad is probably very tight also.  What are we doing to get jobs for them?  What are we doing to hold on to existing industries?  We are continually allowing traditional industries to go by the board.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about the fishing industry?  We have had concrete suggestions from the Department of Fisheries. Once we have finalised our limits &mdash; whatever they are going to be &mdash; we must put it quite clearly that the fishermen from other EEC countries who fish our waters should land all their catch in our ports, to be processed here.  It would be worth while for them, because they would not have all that travelling back and forth with their loads.  However, we have no provision, at present, for processing all this fish.  What are we doing about protecting the industries which are in trouble? Absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy came down to Cork recently and told us that if we were not careful NET would have to be closed down.  Is he not a bright boy?  This is an industry which is the basis of a completely new petro-chemical complex, an industry with a future, with many thousands of jobs.  It would be a lot better for him to try to keep some of the other industries open than to be criticising Nítrigin Éireann. Whatever problems Nítrigin Éireann have experienced, they were not caused by the present staff.  These problems are a matter for a committee of this House, whose findings will be published and I am sure whatever action is needed will be taken.  People have left good jobs and changed houses, to make their livelihood in this new exciting industry which is currently producing 2,000 tonnes of <Col N="1626" /> fertiliser per day for the home and export markets.  The jobs are important to us because we have not many similar jobs left.</P>
    <P>I come to another major industry and when one is talking about an industry which employs 1,500 to 2,000 men, one is talking about an industry which, in times of recession, could have problems if care is not taken.  I was the only Deputy, without permission from anyone, to back the Minister when he said that he would give £10 million to Irish Shipping to build a ship in Verolme Dockyard.  In the Book of Estimates for the Department of Defence, there is nothing about the two promised naval vessels.  Are these vessels to go by the board?  This is where we come to the blatant dishonesty of the budget and can foresee another supplementary estimate being brought in when it suits the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>In Dublin yesterday, the Irish Sugar Beet Growèrs' Association met the Minister to discuss their problems.  I believe that they were well received, which is good, and that the Minister's remarks were constructive.  This is an area involving comparatively small sums of money. The whole sugar company complex developed over the years and carried with it a growing infant food industry.  Perhaps that was the wrong structure.  The food industry perhaps should have been developed as a separate entity with the necessary financial help.  The sugar company have now major financial problems which need not have occurred.  This is an industry which can expand and develop.  It has a farm machinery section which is second to none anywhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>Some of the best machines for the cultivation, sowing, spraying and harvesting of sugar beet have come out of that section. The plant was designed by a couple of Irish men, not so young now, some of them.  These people should be congratulated on the work they are doing.  Their plant can be sold all over the world and they should be encouraged to continue producing them by being given the necessary funds.  We are speaking here about a once-off type of investment.  The sugar company will not be a constant drag on anybody but, because of high overdrafts <Col N="1627" /> and heavy bank interest commitments, unless they get this financial injection they will have to consider cutbacks and slowing down.  This is an area of great importance in industry which is employing thousands of people involved with fertiliser, transport, the whole area of sugar beet pulp, compounds and so on, similar to Nítrigin Éireann.</P>
    <P>We hear criticism of Irish farmers.  They have not as many hundreds of gallons of milk per cow as the Dutch have.  The only reason why the Dutch farmer can beat our farmer at the moment on yields per cow is that he is obtaining sugar beet pulp and other products from South America and California literally at give-away prices.  If there were a change in that situation, the Dutch and the Belgians would not be able to supply their own country with milk, but we in this country would.  It is vitally important that Irish farming, the Irish sugar beet industry and Nítrigin Éireann should be fostered.  If anything happened in the Persian Gulf &mdash; and anything can happen there any day of the week &mdash; and there was a cutoff of fertiliser supply from abroad, what then would happen to our food supply? Where then would be our surpluses?  We have a supply of fertiliser which would keep us going &mdash; not a balanced fertiliser by any means, but a fertiliser which would keep us going for quite a few years. For that reason alone, we should protect and guard that industry with our lives.</P>
    <P>I have not been destructively critical in my comments, I have tried to be as constructive as possible.  I appeal especially to the party opposite because their Manifesto has put us where we are now, millions of pounds in debt.  We were promised strawberries in December, something which could not be delivered. We had a sample of these promises again in Donegal on a Sunday morning when we were presented this time with a technicolour manifesto, handed out at the chapel gates, again promising things which could not possibly be delivered. Indeed, I was told last week that they were not delivered.  Let us be honest with the people.  They are ready for an honest approach and will believe us if we tell <Col N="1628" /> them the truth.  Let us not have a Dutch auction situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, which is my direct responsibility as Opposition spokesman, I make a final appeal to the Government in the beginning of this year, before it is too late, to do everything possible to encourage tourists here this year.  We are not asking the Minister for Finance to take the duty from the drink sold in hotel bars.  We are only asking that he remove VAT from meals served in hotels.  About £700,000 of hotel grant money was not taken up last year.  I am suggesting that the Government give out these grants to hotels and not limit the kind of work that will qualify.</P>
    <P>This budget has emphasised more than ever the absurd and growing contrast between the appearance presented by Government pronouncements and the reality of the state of the country.  The Government's self-image has assumed a life of its own and is now operating independently of reality.  Because of this, parliamentary politics has been made to seem like some irrelevant puppet show. This stratagem of distraction and deliberate confusion does not have to develop very much further to prevent democracy from effectively functioning at all.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage when the budget is no longer the final word on either Government income or spending. We are told consistently that more revenue will be collected and less money will need to be spent than will be the case. The budget is becoming increasingly irrelevant as a guide to the Government's handling of money.  The Taoiseach is trying to wriggle out of his accountability to the nation by presenting it with incomplete and unreliable budgets.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is regarded as an excellent public relations man, which is naturally an important part of a Taoiseach's job.  In spite of this reputation, he has been unable to convince the Irish people that he cares either about their wellbeing or about social justice, and therefore he is unable to unify the country at a time of economic crisis.</P>
    <P>What effort has been made in this budget to ensure that the cost of this recession is shared justly so that the <Col N="1629" /> strongest will bear the heaviest part of the burden?  In fact we have only to look at the area of taxation to see what is really happening: every Fianna Fáil budget since 1977 has given the most concessions to the people with incomes of more than £10,000 at the expense of those with less. The Taoiseach may call for a national understanding and co-operation between all sections of society but this call carries no weight because he cannot convince the Irish people that he will ensure that justice will prevail and that people do not have to fight each other to protect their legitimate interests.  This is what public relations ought to be about.</P>
    <P>This Government claim to be a caring Government because of the 25 per cent social welfare increases, yet their desperate reliance on indirect taxes hits those with lower incomes the hardest, because items such as drink and cigarettes, fairly modest luxuries, form a larger proportion of lower incomes than higher ones.  This is, of course, the same Government that abolished food subsidies and have been under-financing health, education and local government services.  This is the reality behind Fianna Fáil's claim to be a caring Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has presented the image of an expert economic manager, yet the Government have failed to make any determined attack on the country's appalling financial problems.  Instead, they have tried to sweep them under the carpet by borrowing.  In fact Government borrowing has increased almost 1,000 per cent since 1977.  By doing this the Government have thrown enormous masses of dead weight on to the future economy of this country which may well bring it crumbling to the ground.  The Government have been paralysed in the face of competing vested interests and have failed to show the courageous leadership necessary to rise above these interest groups.  Instead the Government have fallen back on a cynical policy of drift. Perhaps this is hardly surprising from a Government whose ministerial quality is so poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any joy for any of us when we speak in the tone <Col N="1630" /> we have been using about the state of the economy.  It is a tragedy to watch the downward trend we have witnessed in the past four years.  We were told in 1977 that we would all be better off if Fianna Fáil were elected.  Now we find that the greatest threat to democracy is the lack of realisation by the electorate of the expectations they held four years ago. We all know of the unfavourable reactions throughout the country to this budget.  From now on our people will view with the utmost suspicion any promises given by Fianna Fáil.  Many people remember how they were conned in 1977.</P>
      <P>The internal squabblings in Fianna Fáil have been doing damage to the economy. It has become particularly obvious in the past 12 months that there is a rift in the Government and that is very serious for the country at a time when the economy needs leadership.  It is time for Fianna Fáil to take a rest for a while and try to get back into office later, because this is not a time to have a divided camp running the economy.</P>
      <P>During our term in office there was much criticism from these benches by Fianna Fáil spokesmen about unemployment. The then spokesman for Labour asked the Government to do something about unemployment, particularly about school-leavers.  He asked how any ecomomy could survive with 103,000 people unemployed.  He said that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office all those problems would be solved.  Fianna Fáil in Opposition never lost an opportunity to tell us that all our problems were caused because of a weak Government.  We were told that the tail was wagging the dog and therefore there was lack of decision.  Now we have 125,000 people unemployed.  As Minister for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald failed completely.  With all due respect to the man, the Department of Finance will not be improved by his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a job vacancy arises in my county about 50 applications are received and there have been 1,000 applications for 40 vacancies for student nurses.  What hope have these people?  The budget has done nothing to improve their situation. the Government have behaved as if this recession were a simple change in climate <Col N="1631" /> which would pass away in the normal course.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, was very vocal on the subject of unemployment and said that if the number of unemployed exceeded 100,000 his Government would resign.  It is no satisfaction to the Irish people that Deputy Lynch retired from his position as Leader, but he stands guilty due to his lack of action during three years in office.</P>
    <P>Many factories in my constituency of West Limerick are working a three-day week and are about to close down.  We had a sad experience in this area with the Ferenka factory and the present Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism played a major part in the closure of that factory through their neglect of the situation. The IDA and SFADCo should be asked now to come to the aid of factories which are in difficulty.  I recently asked an IDA official the cause of the present problems but he did not give the information I requested.  The situation is now so urgent that a meeting of all interested parties should be held to discuss the problem, whether it is management, overstaffing or lack of exports.  I appeal to the Government to ensure that the IDA and SFADCo make the necessary aid available.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave many undertakings in their manifesto with regard to prices and undertook to keep them under control. It is now something of a joke that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce was called the Minister for Prices. The present Minister is always ready to approve price increases and should be ashamed of himself.</P>
    <P>The cost of a telephone has now gone beyond the reach of the ordinary man and it costs 18p to post a letter.  Where do the Government think the people are getting the money?  Electricity charges have increased by almost 100 per cent, yet the Government are strangely silent on the subject of prices.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago a packet of cigarettes and a bottle of stout may have been considered a luxury, but that is not the case today.  It should be remembered that <Col N="1632" /> today's luxuries are tomorrow's necessities. I remember seeing on television and in the press the former Taoiseach and Deputy Lemass touring supermarkets in Dublin and somebody said that they would have done justice to any stage play.  The amount they spent then on groceries would buy very little today, yet I do not hear any protests.  Perhaps the organisations representing consumers will have something to say on the matter. Fianna Fáil have failed completely to deal with prices.  They have a majority of 19 in this House and could bring in any legislation they wish.  Today they had the opportunity to let the people express their feelings about the budget and the Government, but they rejected this opportunity because they are afraid to face the public.  The money which was available in Donegal is no longer available. It is possible that those who got grants in Donegal were refused them four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the Minister of State, Deputy Moore, when speaking about house prices asked why the National Coalition did not increase the SDA loan, which then stood at £4,500.  The price of local authority houses then was in the region of £7,000 and purchasers had to find £2,500.  Today the loan amounts to £12,000, provided the purchaser is in a position to pay £128.50 per month and find another £12,000.  During the period of office of the National Coalition and in the first year of Fianna Fáil it was normal for people purchasing houses to get a bridging loan, but that has disappeared. Public representatives are being asked daily by young people for advice on how to raise money to complete their houses. There is no answer.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they have lost interest with the result that such young people are in a bad financial position.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil got into office they introduced a £1,000 grant for new houses. That was attractive then because houses cost in the region of £13,000 or £14,000. However, many people did not get the message that the grant only applied to first-time occupiers of new houses.  Such a grant is not much help to people buying houses now.  I appeal to the Government, <Col N="1633" /> whether or not we are approaching a general election, to increase that grant to £4,000.  I do not mind whether it is put forward as an election bribe or not.  The Government should increase that grant and make it retrospective to help the unfortunate people who cannot finish their houses because of lack of money. Local authorities do not have money to help such people.  Last night the Minister of State told us of the number of houses built last year, but not one house was started in my county in 1980.  We had to wait more than two years to get approval for a scheme for Croom in County Limerick. Many of the applicants for those houses went to other counties or other parts of Limerick to get a home.  All we had in that village were mobile homes and caravans.  That is the situation in most rural towns today.  I cannot understand why the Government, with a huge majority, have not done anything about that problem.  I am led to believe that the 15 Ministers of State work exclusively on election and constituency work and that gives our people an idea of the priorities of the Government.  They are concerned about the party and leave the economy in second place.</P>
    <P>Prices have gone completely out of control.  The Government did not do anything to control the price of building materials because some builders had to be allowed a certain amount of scope. Not alone are those building a house refused bridging finance but they have to face a huge bill from the ESB for services. It can cost from £300 to £1,000 to have the electricity installed and there is no subsidy towards that cost.  The Government will go down on record because they have not done anything to help young couples build their own homes.</P>
    <P>The election manifesto was attractive in so far as it proposed the abolition of car tax, but the registration fee, which was £10 last year, has been doubled this year.  We are almost back to where we were before Fianna Fáil took office.  As soon as Fianna Fáil were installed with a safe majority they penalised the motorists they led astray in 1977.  I am sure that Fianna Fáil would be put on trial in any country.  I am sure that there are not any <Col N="1634" /> three-card trick men anywhere in the world who would get away with what the Government have done since 1977.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the situation in the agricultural sector was never as bad.  In the last budget the Minister gave a rates concession which made me laugh.  When they got into power Fianna Fáil withdrew the agricultural grant with the result that rates on farms trebled.  Now they are handing back a certain amount to the farmers and telling them that it amounts to a concession.  It is the same as taking £20 from a man last year and giving him £5 this year as a present.  I am sure millions of pounds are owed by farmers on rates because they cannot afford to pay them.  Any county manager who is approached about this will say the same thing.  The Government have not done anything for those people, who are in a bad financial position.  In 1977 the farmers were told that, if they got rid of the socialists and returned Fianna Fáil they would not have to pay tax.  The Government do not have any money.  It must be accepted that we are bankrupt but our people are not being told.  Our people should be told that from now on.  We are bankrupt and the longer it goes on the worse it will get.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the growing and frightening problem of abuse of alcohol, especially among teenagers, demands the urgent introduction <Col N="1635" /> of appropriate legislative measures to ensure that young people are not enabled to purchase alcohol with the ease which at present obtains, and further demands that the Minister for Justice enters into discussions of an urgent nature with the professional bodies involved and takes all other steps to ensure that this enormous problem is curbed and that loopholes in existing legislation are ended.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and add:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, aware of the widespread concern at the abuse of alcohol, particularly by young people, welcomes the initiation by the Minister for Justice of an urgent review of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts with a view to the introduction of amending legislation to help in counteracting this abuse and notes that consultations have taken place in this connection with a wide range of interested bodies.</P>

      <P>We spent one and a half hours last night discussing this very serious subject.  I was glad to see the reception the media gave it because I want to correct something I said last night. I said that this very important matter was being debated from 7 o'clock to 8.30 in the evening and that the media did not seem on some occasions to take much notice of what happened in this House.  However, I am very happy with the reception this debate got on the radio last night and this morning and in the newspapers today.  I believe the media have a part to play in the campaign to have teenage drinking reduced to proper proportions or, if possible, eliminated.  I am glad the media played their part last night and today.  I believe the media can be used by the Minister's Department to highlight the evils of under-age drinking and the evils of introducing drink to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> I go a long way with what the Minister said last night in regard to people's attitudes. Our attitudes as parents leave a lot to be desired.  I have heard parents whom I regard as responsible people saying that if their children were introduced to drink at an early age there was less likelihood of their becoming alcoholics.  It has never been proved that that is the case but that is still the attitude of many parents.  Those people are anxious to ensure that their children never become alcoholics but they have this false idea that their children should be introduced to drink at an early age.</P>
    <P>There was reference by parents to children drinking at an early age in continental countries.  France is most often quoted.  But the French are extremely worried by the high rate of alcoholism there today.  Those parents should find out what the position is in those countries rather than take what they hear as fact. That is as far as I can go with what the Minister said last night.  Those who have taken an easy attitude with regard to teenage drinking should be encouraged to change their minds.  The facts should be put before them.</P>
    <P>The Government have not taken steps to put the facts before the people.  We have only to look at the amount of money spent last year by the Health Education Bureau and compare that with the amount of money spent the previous year.  This will show how insincere is a lot of what the Minister said last night.  The Minister for Health, in reply to a question last week, said that the Health Education Bureau spent £187,000 in 1979 and in 1980 spent £176,000, a reduction of £11,000.  When one takes into account the rate of inflation, which was officially put at 18 per cent, I make that reduction to be £44,660 compared to what was spent in 1979.  If those of us who are concerned about the problem are to have any effect on the community at large we will have to be backed up by serious Government action.  I do not consider a cut in real terms of £44,660 spent in the research on advertising with regard to alcohol consumption serious Government action in tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the Minister <Col N="1637" /> announced on budget day the extension of the tax on table waters to include squashes this was detrimental to the campaign to reduce the consumption of alcohol by teenagers.  Many teachers and parents have organised meetings to try to educate parents about the best way of introducing their children to alcohol.  If one is to be successful in this the Government should make available an alternative drink at the cheapest possible price. The sales of this alternative drink have escalated over the past few years.  I believe more squashes are used in hotels and private homes than ever before.  I am sure that is why the Minister for Finance had a look at it.  It is unfortunate that he put 37.2p per gallon on squashes.  It has had an even greater effect than I thought it would have the day it was introduced in the budget.  The extra cost, including VAT, to the consumer will be 36½p per four litre pack of lemon and orange squashes.  This put the total selling price of the four litre pack to over £2.  This takes from what the Minister said last night that the Government were taking seriously the problem of teenage drinking.</P>
    <P>One of the main alternatives to drinking alcohol is squash.  What does the Minister for Finance do?  He puts on a tax of 37.2p per gallon when he extended this table water tax to include squashes.  One producer of this product informed me that he will be forced to withdraw the four litre size from the market.  I hope the Minister sitting opposite will have a word with the Minister for Finance and try to persuade him to drop this tax in an effort to reduce under-age drinking.  No doubt arguments will be made in favour of an increase in the tax on wine and spirits and other alcoholic drinks.  This will be put forward as a way to entice people not to take alcoholic drink.  In making that argument people should also look at the tax the Minister has seen fit to put on table waters and squashes.</P>
    <P>Another contributory factor to our high rate of teenage drinking is the lack of adequate recreational facilities in the new and developing areas.  On occasion when I go into a lounge bar to have a leisurely drink with friends we are the <Col N="1638" /> grandfathers.  There is a very high rate of teenage drinking.  Concerned parents and teachers have taken an initiative in calling for the meetings to which I referred last night to try to educate the public about drinking.  That has to be done, but it is pointless if they have not got the backing of the Government.</P>
    <P>Not all teenage drinkers are under age. I am just as concerned about the young person who is drinking legally as I am about the under-aged drinkers.  A person drinking at 19 years of age is at as great a risk as the person drinking at 17 years of age.  When I discuss this matter with them inevitably I am asked: &ldquo;Where else can we go?&rdquo;  We need a massive financial injection into the provision of facilities other than lounge bars, or licensed clubs, or wherever else drink is sold.  I have not got much of an answer for youngsters who ask where else can they meet their friends.  Some discos sell alcoholic drink and others specialise in soft drinks.  This indicates that there are people in the community who are prepared to do something to ensure that drink is kept as far away as possible from 16, 17, 18 and 19 year olds.</P>
    <P>The Government could play a very big part by giving extra money to the Health Education Bureau and by having second thoughts about the imposition of 37.2p per gallon on squashes.  They should make more money available to provide alternative facilities for recreation for young people.  Areas which have a recreation hall without a licence are few and far between.  I would ask the Minister to bear this in mind when he is considering the other legislation he spoke about last night.</P>
    <P>The law on the sale of drink is far from adequate.  People as young as 15 years of age are legally entitled to buy drink in off-licence premises.  People younger than that are buying drink in off-licence premises.  At 15 years they are legally entitled to do so and nobody can do anything about it.  If a 15 year old goes into an off-licence premises and asks for certain drinks he must be served provided the quantity of alcohol is one pint and the container is corked and sealed.  It is time that law was looked at.  The law dealing <Col N="1639" /> with 18 years olds drinking on the premises is not fully enforced and it is not fully enforcible unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Some people are prepared knowingly to serve drink illegally.  There were quite a number of prosecutions last year.  In the past few days I saw the figure for the number of prosecutions in the Republic, and convictions were secured in 37 cases. This is proof that some people are prepared to break the law.  This is to be deplored.  Any person who is prepared to break the law in that way has a great deal to answer for.  I do not know how they can remain and watch the young person drinking.</P>
    <P>Members of organisations are doing great work, but it now seems to be the in thing for a football club to obtain a licence. It may be that running clubs is so expensive that they have to seek other ways to finance their activities.  It may be that they realise that, if they do not serve alcohol on their premises, young people will go elsewhere.  I do not know why football clubs should be so eager to get a licence.  There are a number in my constituency and, in my opinion, this does not add anything to the game.  Football clubs with a licence are no better today than they were some years ago when they did not have a licence.</P>
    <P>I occasionally visit these clubs.  On one occasion I recall visiting a club at 12.15 a.m. and was shocked to see youths who were no more than 15 years of age with alcoholic drink in front of them.  It had such an effect on me that I did not buy a drink there that night but asked to see the committee to discuss the matter with them.  Some of them agreed with the attitude I had taken and others had arguments against it.  The organisers of football clubs who run licensed premises as well have a terrifying responsibility to the community to ensure that the licence is not abused.  I do not know how it can happen that 14-, 15- and 16-year-olds can obtain and consume drink in football clubs and nothing is done about it by the law.  There is inadequate supervision of many of the clubs.  Many members of the vintners association are prepared to admit that there is under-age drinking on <Col N="1640" /> their premises.  They may not admit it as an association but many individual members of the association have admitted it to me and also the fact that there is an under-age drinking problem in the country. I wonder if all 37 convictions were publicans or were any of them clubs that have licences for their premises.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the law keeps a tight eye on these licenced clubs.  They are not all football clubs. There are other clubs now obtaining licences. I do not believe most of the people realise the responsibility they take on in running a licenced premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be some process whereby a club seeking a licence should have to ensure that there is a responsible committee in charge of the club.  A licence should not be granted to a club simply because there is a need in a particular area.  I do not know how much money was allocated to the Health Education Bureau this year.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us if it has been increased.  I hope they have been given more money this year to enable them to return their attention towards educating people who are not publicans but are qualified to run football clubs and other sporting activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this matter was raised by Fine Gael.  I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his handling of this problem since he came into office.  He has already done something the resolution asks him to do and that is engage in discussion with various bodies.</P>
      <P>In the resolution too much emphasis is put on legislation.  We cannot legislate against an attitude.  If there is a weakness in our fighting this problem it is our attitude towards the abuse of alcohol.  I do not drink but I am not anti-drink.  The abuse of drink is something of which we should be ashamed.  There is a high percentage of non-drinkers in our society which shows all the more the way drink is abused by those who do drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> I hear people complaining about anti-Irish jokes.  However, I have often seen at social functions some poor unfortunate absolutely crazy drunk and we all laugh at him.  As they say in Dublin, he is &ldquo;a hard chaw&rdquo;.  To my mind he is a stage Irishman.  We are worse than he is because we laugh at his antics as a drunk and he parries the life of a dignified person. We are all to blame for the abuse of alcohol and legislation cannot cure that.</P>
    <P>We have all to get together on this, as the Minister has done with the various bodies, and fight it in homes and pubs backed by whatever legislation we have. However, we must not depend on legislation to solve the problem.  People's attitude must change.  We spend £1½ million per day on drink.  Whenever that is mentioned people say: &ldquo;Look at the tax we get from it&rdquo;.  I am not including the figure for the cost of hospitalisation of the victims of drink.  I do not have the exact figure but I am sure it is over £100 million a year.  The rate of admission of alcoholics to hospital has increased.  We accept this now.</P>
    <P>I recall a case a few years ago where a man was charged with a most horrible crime and his friend came to me to see if I could help him.  He tried to make an excuse for him and said he was drunk, but his victim was not drunk.  His victim was an ordinary peace abiding citizen who had been attacked.  The excuse put forward was not that the man was mad but that he was drunk, as if there should be a dispensation for drunk people and that they, unlike the rest of us, can do what they like.  I am not condemning drink but the abuse of it.</P>
    <P>In arguments about drink people usually ask what about the wedding feast at Cana.  It was the first miracle.  However, there is a lesson in it.  It gave us a proper use of drink.  Drink has been abused by the Irish people and our image abroad is that of a drunken people.  That is not true of the whole population, but many people are addicted to drink.  We are paying a lot in money terms and in terms of human suffering.  How many marriages have broken up because of alcohol?  How many people have been killed on the <Col N="1642" /> roads?  These are the evils it brings.</P>
    <P>As regards legislation, the Minister can and will help.  There are many applications to the courts by sports clubs for exemptions and extensions of licences. These extensions seem to be awarded fairly freely.  I cannot understand this practice.  If people go out to enjoy themselves they can drink until a certain hour and then we should be able to say: stop, it is late enough.</P>
    <P>Going through this city at night one can notice the time at which some public-houses close.  It constitutes a grave abuse of our licensing laws.  Then there are people who contend that we should go on continental lines, extend the drinking hours so that people would not be cramming drink into them in order to meet the closure deadline.  Some countries with these extended hours, or practically no control, are paying a frightful price in alcoholism which costs them a colossal bill annually in their hospitals.  I would ask the Minister to consider in any new legislation the control of such exemptions to sports clubs.  Indeed in the area in which I live there are some very fashionable ones.  Close to my home there were two clubs almost put out of existence because of the behaviour of people leaving them.  I might add that they both had bars in their clubs.  These clubs did a lot of good work despite the fact that they allowed people to abuse drink.  At the time I said I would not oppose their licence because they were doing such good work but I heard Deputy McMahon say their clientele had nowhere else to go.  I have here a list of grants given by the Government to youth clubs and so on.</P>
    <P>First of all, however, example in the home is all important.  Some parents may be a little careless.  I have often stood in a supermarket watching young people who can buy as much drink as they want &mdash; there is practically no control &mdash; and the owners of these supermarkets are not entirely to blame because generally the assistant at the check-out is too busy to ascertain the age of a young person buying drink.  It must be remembered also that because young people are maturing more quickly, dressing in such a mature way, it is very difficult to ascertain their <Col N="1643" /> exact age.  Therefore it is very difficult for the owner of any supermarket to ensure that a person buying drink is over age.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMahon said he was in some of these clubs and saw the young people who frequented them.  I was in a well known publichouse on one occasion and my companion who was a fairly hardened drinker, if not an alcoholic, looked around him and said: &ldquo;This is like Boystown with all the young boys here&rdquo;.  I am not blaming the publichouse owner either because he will find it very difficult to say to somebody: &ldquo;You are under age&rdquo;.  The body which will play the largest part in fighting alcohol abuse will be the Vintners' Federation.  I know they do a lot of good work sending people to lecture in schools and so on but they have a duty to extend that exercise to educating people in the control of drink.  If we do not take serious steps now in a few years time the problem will be that much worse with many a young life destroyed through the abuse of alcohol.  I hate sermonising on this topic because it is such a human one. Perhaps because of our biological makeup we like to drink but if only people could enjoy a drink without abusing it it would be better.  We must emphasise that we are not condemning drink but rather its abuse which is very prevalent in this city and country generally.  Even if the Government were to quadruple moneys to youth clubs the same problem would obtain.  For example, how often does one pass a suburban football ground where there is a dance or disco about to start at 10 or 11 o'clock in the evening?  There will be very few young people around there but one will find the nearby publichouse packed with them.  I know a man who owns an off-licence shop.  He told me that when there is a rugby cup match to be played near his premises he must guard them very carefully or otherwise the boys will either buy or take the drink, and these are young boys.  Again, how often do we see young people who have passed an examination celebrating by drinking in a publichouse?  Is there something wrong with our educational system that our youth indulge in that kind of practice by way of celebration?  Is it <Col N="1644" /> because of an attitude to drink prevalent amongst us that we cannot condemn this practice and say it is wrong that these young people should be served?  There is no use in saying simply that we should legislate.  One cannot legislate against an attitude.  One must create a healthy spirit and thinking amongst our people, demonstrating to them how evil is the abuse of drink.  Only when we succeed in doing so will we be able to contend that we are somewhere on the way to curing this disease.</P>
    <P>We know this problem is worsening continuously and that the rate of admissions of drinkers to our mental hospitals is increasing.  One often asks oneself why can we not bring the example of alcoholics to the attention of young people? Again, how often does one meet somebody with whom perhaps one was at school, or a work associate, an unfortunate wretch, drunk or nearly drunk daily, whose whole life has been ruined by drink?  It must be remembered that the drink addict incurs disaster not alone for himself but for his wife and family also, Thereafter it behoves all parties in this House to get down to a scrutiny of every aspect of this problem.  We have had all-party committees on many subjects and perhaps an all-party committee on the abuse of drink would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown by his attitude and activity that he is prepared to go a long way towards having proper legislation introduced.  However, legislation alone is insufficient.  We must examine the question to ascertain what can be done apart from legislation.  There are many bodies dealing with this problem. There is one umbrella organisation catering for very many local organisations who are fighting this problem.  We must ask ourselves if we are fighting a losing battle? Deputy McMahon contended that young people have nowhere else to go.  If somebody is bored with life then it is a question more of there being something wrong with that person than with life. Any active politician, sportsman or whoever is seldom bored.  It is only when they do not indulge in some health activity like sport that their thoughts turn to the lounge bar.  In this city, which is getting <Col N="1645" /> bigger all the time, with almost one million people, a new menace is raising its head, a kind of night club or place where it is fashionable to be seen.  Young people, in their immaturity, will frequent such places.  Of course it must be realised that big business is behind all of this, that these people do not manufacture drink or run night clubs for the benefit of their customers.  Rather is it done to make money.  I do not condemn profit properly made but I do contend that to make profit at the expense of some poor unfortunate too weak to withstand the attractions of drink points to the fact that there is something wrong with our society, something which should be put right.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he has the power &mdash; and he may not have the power &mdash; he should instruct the courts not to give late night exemptions.  That is one way of stopping it.  The Minister should introduce legislation to control the sale of beer and spirits in supermarkets so that the assistant can see who is buying it.  That does not apply so much to spirits, but a young boy or girl can go into a supermarket, grab a crate of beer and go down to the checkout; the girl there is too busy to see who is buying it so it is very easy for people to buy drink and it is very easy for people to extend their drinking hours when they have already been a long time in the pub by bringing more home with them to drink.</P>
    <P>Very often one sees in advertisements footballers leaving the field and having a drink.  Young boys who like football may imitate this.  It may not be that way but big business portrays it that way.  On the hoardings on the street the young set are depicted with glasses of whiskey in front of them.  Some of them may not drink at all but they are models and are paid to portray how attractive drink is.  All the time there is relentless pressure put on the youth.  I am not blaming the youth for succumbing.  But the many young people who do not drink should use their influence to encourage their friends and school-mates not to drink at least until they are about 21 years of age and have reached some measure of maturity.</P>
    <P>It is sad that we have had this abuse of drink for a long time.  What are the causes <Col N="1646" /> of this?  Even before we reached this affluent age we had a problem.  In the days of Father Mathew there was not very much affluence but there was a lot of drinking.  In some of the poor countries drink is abused to a very high degree.  It may be that it is a form of escape from the realities of life.  If people have a problem they might drink hoping it will go away.  We know it will not go away and when they come to their senses in the morning the problem is still there to be solved.</P>
    <P>I am glad Fine Gael raised this here and I am pleased with the Minister's attitude to this whole problem.  The fact that he has given a factual record of what he is doing gives us some confidence that we are going to start making progress in the battle against drink abuse.  I am not against drink; I am merely against the abuse of drink.  Being against the abuse of art is not a condemnation of art itself.  Likewise being against the abuse of drink is not condemning drink itself.  Drink can be good.  All we are doing is condemning its abuse.  The figures given out by the various bodies are becoming a bit frightening and we in this House have to set headlines but we can only do so much.  If the Minister brought in a Bill tomorrow morning to solve the problem I am sure it would get unanimous support.  But no Minister or Government, no matter how wise, can make a Bill work without the help of the parents and the various interested groups.  I do not want to criticise parents, because they have enough problems, but they must set a great example and ensure that their children will be given the education which will help them to withstand the pressures of big business and the social pressures exerted to encourage them to drink.  Some of the greatest people in the world never drank.  But the advertisements are for ever showing famous people and saying he or she drinks something in particular.  In my younger days one seldom saw women drinking but unfortunately that is not the case today.  It may be said that they have the same right as men but nobody has the right to abuse drink and this is what the debate is about.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would <Col N="1647" /> tackle first of all the exemptions given to sports clubs and other clubs so that they can have late night drinking.  I hope that he will look at the supermarket situation to try to ensure that there is control over the sale of drink in them.  I know there is some control over the selling of spirits but there is very little control in relation to beer.  Having said that we have to examine our whole attitude to drink and its effects and try to bring home to people for the sake of youth, for the sake of the lives that are being ruined by drink, that we will legislate in so far as we can legislate to stem the abuse of drink.  But one cannot go very far with legislation.  It is up to our education system to convince young people that they can lead a very full life without drink.  This can be done but people are always saying that one is somehow inadequate if one does not drink, that one is somehow not with it. The people who say this are making the profit from drink.  They are exploiting young people and it is vicious to exploit young people when it comes to drink.</P>
    <P>I would appeal again to the Vintners Federation.  They are in a position to go out among the young people and employ teachers and people who are able to speak on drink abuse.  They are making the profits out of this and they owe it to society in general to show people that drinking can be a pleasant pastime.  There is nothing pleasant about abusing drink. If we can afford to spend £1.5 million a day on drink let us think of the amount of taxation we must pay for the hospitalisation of a victim of drink.  If we can make that comparison we are going some way towards the solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am glad this was brought up here by Fine Gael.  I am glad the Minister met it in the spirit that he did.  I hope that the contributions to the debate tonight will go some way to stopping the abuse of drink.  Perhaps this time next year we will be able to see some progress, because if we cannot the future of this country will be damaged very much indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this motion and <Col N="1648" /> the Minister's contribution.  It is popular to talk about young persons and the abuse of alcohol.  This motion is of itself rather limited because any debate of this nature makes me, even at 45 years of age, rather jaundiced and cynical about the extent of the moralising and pious platitudes we as adults indulge in about our young people.  I drink and have been drinking since I was 18 or 19 years of age. By the mercy of God I have managed not to become an alcoholic.</P>
      <P>As we all know, in trade union life, in which I was involved before I became a politician, and for the past ten or 12 years in public life, many of us become very heavy drinkers and some of us finish up as alcoholics.  In every group of male adults in society, of those who live until the age of 65 at least 12 will be in hospital at one time or another for alcoholism, so prevalent is this illness in our society, and of the women who will live up to the age of 65, three will at one time or another have treatment for alcoholism.  The problem is serious but it is not a youth problem and that is where I cavil at this motion. The problem is in our society.  If young people at the age of 15, 16 or 18 years of age start to drink we have to root out some of the pious hypocrisy that goes on about the consumption of alcohol.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we spend £2 million a day on alcohol.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moore, said we spent £1.5 million but they were the 1979 figures.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy and understanding for my two sons aged 19 and 20 years.  If they wish to go to the local pub for a jar I can understand that because that is a sign of the society in which we live.  In our society young people can hardly open the sports page of a newspaper without being encouraged to have a jar.  They can hardly open the page of a disco magazine without being encouraged to have another jar.  If they look at television, even with the code of advertising agreed by RTE, they are again encouraged to have another jar. One can hardly stop one's car at a traffic lights without seeing a bottle of vodka on a hoarding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> We have our legal licensing laws. Clubs, pubs, pigeon shooting and football clubs, bingo clubs, charity clubs, Christmas draws and so on, go to our courts for exemptions.  Every day 135 exemptions are sanctioned by those bewigged occupants of the judiciary.  In 1979 42,000 exemptions were granted. Then we come into this Dáil with bleeding hearts saying the youth of Ireland are going to the dogs.  Of course if we go to the dogs we can have another jar and if we go to Leopardstown we can drink ourselves out of our minds between races, and the race course makes a profit.</P>
    <P>If you want to be a success in life what better than to become a good publican. If you are a fine handsome young man you can marry the publican's daughter.  In Ireland the licensed vintners allied grocery trade is a most honourable profession. If you are diligent and hard working, and provided you do not become an alcoholic, you can finish up owning a pub which can be worth £500,000.  There is hardly a pub in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire and South County Dublin which is not worth between £250,000 and £500,000.  These pubs are owned by men of substance, importance and influence in the community.  You should have heard what they had to say when I complained about the price of drink being raised illegally.  I got it in the neck.  That is the kind of society we live in.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the youth when we, the legislators, say they cannot indulge in too much alcohol and that we are going to stop them getting any. Anybody in this country can open an off-licence.  I do not know if that is a good or a bad thing.  We have a society and a social attitude which evolves around booze and the making of money.  We spend about £750 million a year on booze.  In some ways we thank God we do, because almost 40 per cent of it goes on taxation and helps run the country. Every Minister for Finance has to keep a very careful eye on this because if the price of drink is too high the buoyancy of taxation revenue drops.  Therefore, one of the pillars of maintaining revenue in society in booze and cigarettes.  There is a certain degree of hypocrisy involved in <Col N="1650" /> that.</P>
    <P>There are associated problems.  Let us look at pubs.  What is so sacrosanct about a licensed premises?  Why should restaurants not be permitted to sell drink?  I have been to many countries, including America and most European countries in the last 10 or 15 years, and I have seen the way the distribution and sale of alcohol is treated in them.  Most Deputies have been to Strasbourg and other parts of France and they are aware that one can walk into a restaurant and have a meal, stay there until midnight and, if one wishes, one can have a jar.  Those who do not wish to have a jar can have a cup of coffee.  A 12 year-old or 16 year-old can enter such a restaurant and generally speaking, the waiter will not serve them alcohol.  Those young people, however, can sit there and have coffee.  In Ireland we go out of our holy minds between 9.30 and 11.30 at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I include myself in that regard because the Irish culture related to the consumption of alcohol is that between 9.30 and 11.30 at night one must have a certain number of pints.  We are all aware that eight out of every ten pedestrians killed, and six out of ten of those injured at night, have been found to have been drinking heavily prior to the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we do not need more legislation or cutting down on the granting of exemptions.  We do not need more control on the sale of drink in off-licences. We do not need more admonitions to young people that they will not be sold drink if they are under a certain age.  We do not need the Health Education Bureau issuing thick diaries containing articles about alcoholism.  We need to adopt an attitude similar to that we adopt in relation to our own children.  Those of us who are fortunate enough to have families and have an opportunity of having a social inter-action with our children or those of us in public life who meet and mingle among young people, are aware <Col N="1651" /> that we need to develop a rational, reasonable and sane attitude towards the consumption of alcohol.  That is perhaps the most difficult thing of all to do.  It is very difficult when one's closest friend or near relation becomes a heavy drinker and is on the verge of alcoholism.  It is difficult to convince that person that he or she is on the verge of alcoholism.  It is difficult for a family where the husband or wife is an alcoholic.  The rest of that family have great difficulty in coping and do not have sufficient information or sufficient training to enable them to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>We must have other major outlets of social and cultural opportunities for all our people.  The worst evidence of alcoholism I have in my community is not among teenagers but among married men aged between 35 and 45 years.  Very often in such cases heavy drinking has gone on for ten or 12 years and, at the age of 35, the individual with a young family becomes immersed in alcohol.  It is necessary to change the whole structure of social opportunities available to all our people.  I do not believe that setting up youth clubs, barren brick buildings with pool tables, basket ball courts, gymnasia or swimming pools, and telling young people that they cannot drink there is the solution.  In my view there must be an inter-action.  In many respects alcohol should be available at such centres.  For example, I am a member of such a club, at Glenalbyn in Stillorgan.  There is a swimming pool, a football pitch and a bar at that club.  There is also strict control exercised by the committee over any excessive drinking by adults or young people.  If a young person is given bad example in such places another difficulty arises and there is a heavy responsibility on us all in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not favour the negative and punitive approach in relation to the problem of the abuse of alcohol.  I favour a more positive approach.  When I see the lack of social opportunities in my constituency, the lack of open spaces, the lack of community organised facilities, the lack of ordinary areas of congregation for young people to cater for the foreign students <Col N="1652" /> who visit this country, I adopt a different attitude.  Each summer many foreign students come to the Dún Laoghaire area and, because of the lack of such facilities, most of them finish up in lounge bars. Spanish and French students aged between 12 and 15 years frequent those places and after four or five pints one wishes that they were trained how to drink.  They drink at home but they are accustomed to having a meal with a drink.  They are not accustomed to Irish consumption habits.  At home they can spend a longer period in a restaurant and do not have to deal with the frantic rush that occurs in Irish society between 9.30 p.m. and 11.30 p.m.  We need a broader approach to this problem and I do not think the solution can be found by imposing repressive legislation on young persons.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that the general legislation in relation to the licensing laws should be reviewed.  I commend him for his interest in this area.  I do not go along with his idea of identity cards because it is not practical in our society.</P>

      <P>One of the great benefits of living in Ireland is that we are able to walk around without an identity card whether one is 15 or 19.  I have seen that concept in France and Germany and it is my view that we should not have it here.  That kind of simplistic solution in terms of the sale of alcohol is not one that should be supported.  I was rather jaundiced about some aspects of the debate and I am concerned at the number of broken marriages directly attributable to alcoholism in our society.  I meet many such cases and it is a harrowing experience when one has to meet such families in dire circumstances.  It is quite a prevalent phenomenon here.  Nothing is more <Col N="1653" /> distressing and disturbing for any public representative than to have to know the children of a family of a broken home, very often children suffering from malnutrition, while one or other or, as sometimes happens, both parents have gone off to the boozer for the night and spent the limited family income exclusively on alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from my background as a trade union official the extent of the absenteeism and accidents at work arising out of alcoholism, and the road accident and crime patterns related to alcohol are well known to each Deputy here.  On that basis our concern in the Labour Party is broad and I feel that there is a great need in this country yet to develop a positive attitude on the part of people, particularly young people, towards the consumption of alcohol where people can learn to limit their intake, know what they are doing and have example from their parents and also their friends inside the pubs and elsewhere, and, above all, the alternative opportunity of not just finishing up at 8.00 or 9.00 o'clock on Friday night, having been paid, with an automatic decision that the only place we can go to now is the local pub and have six or seven pints.  That means that in later life one will do that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights and spend the weekend in and out of the local pub.  Nothing is more destructive and wasteful of human beings.  I hope that we will encourage a more useful attitude towards recreation and that in spending our leisure time inside or outside our homes we can learn to drink with moderation and sanity.  It is desirable for parents and children in many cases to drink together and know what it is like to drink fairly young in life. Many young people of 18 or 19 learn by drinking to control the excesses of drink and that is far better than later on in life becoming suddenly immersed in drinking and unable to control it.  Alcohol is a fact of life and of social relationships.  It is vital that young people should grow up in an atmosphere that enables them to cope with it without becoming too immersed in the extremes of booze.  This applies to smoking and other forms of <Col N="1654" /> social activities as well as to drink.  It should be possible for us in the Dáil to have legislation which is sensitive and responsive to the needs of the young people in our community.</P>
    <P>My sympathy in this motion lies more with those who are the object of it than with ourselves who have failed to create the kind of responsible society where young people can live in happiness with pride and the good health which we all envy them and which we want to see them retain throughout their lifetime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank everybody for participating in this debate.  It has been very helpful and I am pleased that the Minister has indicated that the Government will introduce legislation along the lines suggested by us in the original motion.  I would have been happier if such legislation and the introduction of the proposals which the Minister undertook to bring before the Government in due course were the object of some deadline.  We have had too many easy and glib undertakings in this and other respects to do other than leave us with some concern that we may find one year, another year and another year passing without the important legislative response that is necessary here being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I endeavoured to outline what I would propose on behalf of our party as a ten-point programme which would combat this growing abuse in our society.  I think that the suggestions and ideas then put forward and reiterated and added to by other speakers since are worthy of consideration.  There is a strong consensus on all sides in this House that this is an issue on which we can act responsibly and where the future and the welfare of our young people should be our primary concern.  It is very late in the evening for statistics, but to give point to the argument I want to mention quickly one or two figures.  Anybody who has any interest in this area will appreciate the severity of the problem.  It is frightening when you consider that the number of first admissions, for example, to hospitals, psychiatric units and treatment centres for the treatment of alcoholism <Col N="1655" /> and alcohol-related problems has grown in the age group 20-24 from 40 in 1970 to 266 in 1978 and in the age group 15-19 from nine in 1970 to 28 in 1978.  This is just the tip of the iceberg, to use a cliché, but it shows a quadrupling of the figures in a brief number of years,</P>
    <P>That problem is borne out in a very fine, concise and comprehensive study recently carried out by Dr. Brendan Walsh of the ESRI when he refers <i>inter alia</i> to the kind of costs which abuse of alcohol is exacting from our society when he talks, for example, about the road accident costs at present being probably of the order of £80 million to £100 per annum.  In 1976 it was £40 million.  That is the police cost and loss of output due to road accidents.  There are other costs in relation to health care facilities.  VHI, for example, in the year ending February 1977 paid out £174 million in claims.  On top of that the average outlay per claim for diagnoses was £356 which can be applied to the 6,101 hospital admissions for alcoholism to obtain a cost of £2.17 million or just under 1 per cent of the total State current expenditure on health, and that relates to merely one insurance agency.</P>
    <P>We find also that Irish mothers and fathers are increasingly concerned about this and in the survey carried out by O'Connor in 1978 we find a striking contrast between the 30 per cent of Irish mothers and only the 10 per cent of their English counterparts who say that drinking is the most serious problem in the country.  There is a growing consciousness of the severity of this problem.  If we want to dwell on it we will find in the consumption patterns and the amount of expenditure which is being lavished on alcohol that all the barometers show this problem increasing in severity.</P>
    <P>There is one other significant point which troubles me about the degree to which the Government and, arguably, any Government, are wholehearted in their endeavours in tackling this problem. It is the growing percentage of taxation exacted by Governments from excise duties on beer and spirits.  The figures show that any Government who <Col N="1656" /> want to tackle the problem seriously will have to confront the issue of how to replace gradually the very heavy burden of taxation which they exact at present from drink by some other form of taxation.</P>
    <P>There must be a comprehensive programme to tackle this fundamental problem which affects the future of the country and the welfare of our young people. That approach should be an educated and an educational one.  In schools and leisure centres for young people there should be a positive approach, stressing that drink in itself is good and that it is the abuse and the artificial web of false marketing and advertising woven around it which causes so many of the problems. Education in relation to alcohol is vital. We should consider urgently the total banning of sales of alcohol to anyone under 18 years.  That is the practice in a number of countries.  It operates in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the situation is sufficiently drastic here to warrant urgent consideration of that approach.</P>
    <P>We must crack down on the employment of youngsters in places which sell drink.  The law which exists at present is not being implemented in that respect.  It is tragic to see teenagers being exploited in this manner.  We should have separate access to off-licences which sell alcohol. It is wrong that a mother shopping with young children should have to endure this provocation.  A body should be created which would embrace all concerned interests in the community &mdash; politicians, parsons, parents, priests and young people, because the way we tackle this problem and the degree of success we will have depends very largely on the wholehearted co-operation of young people.  I cannot overstress the important role that voluntary organisations and youth organisations have in this respect.  We should support them and embody them centrally in any effort to combat the problem. Young people would rise to the challenge and respond magnificently to the onus of responsibility that would be thrust on them.</P>
    <P>I do not fault the advertisers or the marketing people for their campaign &mdash;<Col N="1657" /> in a sense they should be congratulated on their expertise &mdash; but it is up to us to ensure that adequate resources are available to the Department of Health, the Health Education Bureau and educators to combat this false web of fantasy which seems to have our young people believe that the bottle is the panacea for all ills and that a good life depends on the amount of alcohol consumed.  That is not true.  We need a campaign to deal with this matter.  Efforts have been made and the Health Education Bureau are to be congratulated on the advertising they have done, but it is a drop in the ocean compared to what the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; are able to do in this respect.</P>
    <P>The money at present spent in the development of amenities for young people, the provision of centres where the fun and leisure ethic is central, has to be upgraded and improved.  It is a shame that in many parts of the country the only area of leisure, of comfort and the only few square yards of carpet that many young people see is in the local lounge bar.  I have nothing against lounge bars <i>per se</i>, but our environment should develop in a more balanced way.  Spending almost all one's leisure time in a bar is not the vision I have for the future of young people.  There is no point in giving lip service to this concept.  Last year and this year we had limitations on the increased expenditure of local authorities, which did not even keep pace with the rate of inflation.  If we are serious about looking after our young people and those who at present have to beg on street corners to raise money for a few tins of paint for the upkeep of their premises such as youth clubs, we must do a lot more for them.  The creation of these amenities is an important point.</P>
    <P>Another important point is the introduction of law reform measures.  Some of these measures are long overdue and there are anomalies.  If the Garda come across a cider party &mdash; unfortunately we have had deaths at these parties &mdash; they are unable to seize the cider from young people.  That is wrong and the present law should be changed in that respect. There are other measures, which I outlined <Col N="1658" /> last night and I will not go into them again.  We should be willing to introduce consolidated legislation which will get rid of these anomalies and tidy up the law. This will give us all an opportunity of being involved in a campaign which will rid the country of the evil of abuse of alcohol and enhance the prospects of young people seeing drink as another element in their environment which, if used responsibly, has many good points. This programme must involve the whole community.  I am not happy about lecturing young people as if we had the monopoly of right, virtue and goodness.  Young people should be the focal point of any campaign to bring about improvements. In the authority I mentioned a short time ago, I would like to see youth organisations and young people generally represented. They would rise to this challenge.</P>
    <P>We lag behind in the treatment of people who are suffering from addiction to alcohol and alcohol-related problems. None of our prisons has a detoxification centre.  We tend to bury the problem until it is too late.  I have a haunting image of the spectre of a home in our city in which, right now, there is a family in which young people of six, seven, eight or nine years of age have to witness a mother and father who are, unfortunately and tragically, no longer able to look after themselves. They suffer from alcoholism, they are incoherent and in some cases physically abuse each other.  It is a regularly recurring pattern in many families and it is a serious problem.  If the Minister would give us an indication that the legislation he undertook to bring before the Government would be with us this session we would not need to put it to a vote; but as that has not happened, we will have to do that.  I want to assure the Minister for Justice and the Government that we will play our full part in conjunction with any effort they wish to make. Any reasonable attempt to tackle the problem will be met by a very generous and co-operative response from this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I do not propose to take any more than five or six minutes.</P>
      <P>One aspect of my Question No. 5 of today, to the Minister for the Environment, was if it was correct that almost 50,000 applications had been received for house improvement and solid fuel grants between 1 January 1980 and 1 February 1980 and to inquire the number paid to date.  The Minister indicated that it was correct, so in that month what I suppose could be regarded in the history of the State as the most phenomenal number of applications for any grant was received &mdash; 50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recall the furore caused by the termination of the grant schemes and many remember the tremendous rush of applications at the time.  I asked the Minister could he indicate how many grants had been paid to date in respect of these applications.  I fully appreciate that it may be difficult to segregate the late applications &mdash; the 50,000 which came in during the month of January 1980.  What I and everybody in this country want to know &mdash; particularly those who have not been paid their grants under the house improvement and solid fuel grant schemes &mdash; is how many grants, in total, were submitted to the Department from the inception of these schemes.  I put a general question which it is not impossible for the Minister to answer.  A home improvement grant of £600 and a solid fuel grant were brought in by the present Government.  How many applications <i>in toto</i> were made up to the time the schemes were terminated on 1 January 1980?  Of all the applications which have <Col N="1662" /> been sent in, how many have been paid and how many remain unpaid?</P>
    <P>We have been fed with little snippets of information on this matter which simply do not give any real indication of the extent of the problem.  We know from the Minister that in January 6,000 were paid.  We also know that in 1980 41,665 were paid, giving a total of 47,665 home improvement grants paid.  How many roughly are still in the pipeline awaiting payment and what is the value of these? The Minister said today in the House that £19 million was set aside in this year's budget for home improvement grants.  I do not know the value of the 6,000 grants paid in January but assuming, for the sake of argument, that they might be worth £500 each, presumably in the month of January about £3 million was paid out.  When will the £19 million provision be exhausted?  Does the Minister intend to pay out 6,000 such grants each month up to June and will this money then have run out?</P>
    <P>There are very many people constantly coming to all Deputies, saying that they put in an application for a grant in 1979, inspection was done, inquiries were made in 1980, there was another inspection and final confirmation and they received letters saying that payment would be made in due course.  Will they get the home improvement grant or not?  All I want to be able to say to people is either that they are likely to get it in the first half of this year or that they are not likely to have any prospect of getting it.</P>
    <P>Make no bones about this, we know that the scheme resulted in an enormous number of applications for this scheme. How many tens of thousands are still awaiting who will probably be paid some time in the future?  Secondly, what is the value, in approximate terms, of the applications being held up for payment?  It is a simple piece of information and it should not be beyond the capacity of the Department to give that information, particularly because it relates to this year's budget.  I regard the budget show this year as being exclusively the Taoiseach's, and I should like to know if the Taoiseach will turn around and say to the Department: &ldquo;You can have £19 million; <Col N="1663" /> I know you would like to have perhaps £27 million or £37 million so that you can clear the lot, but you will get only £19 million&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to know will the £19 million be enough to clear all outstanding applications in the next six months.  I have explained my reservations about this scheme and it is of the utmost importance, for the public record, to know how the scheme stands at this stage and what the Government intend to do in relation to outstanding payments.  I am sorry to have had to bandy figures around in this way but this matter is all part of the political strategy of the Taoiseach and there should not be a holding back of information.  I am sure the scheme is the bane of Deputy Fahey's life because of all the supplications being made to him, but we are entitled to know the situation in terms of applications received, payments made and the amount of money that will be available to meet outstanding payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I welcome this opportunity to put the record straight in this matter.  I can assure Deputy Desmond that there is no question of withholding information as regards applications, payment of grants or the amount of money available for these payments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond should be the first to admit that the content of his question would have placed quite an unreasonable burden on the staff of the Housing Grants Section of my Department, causing further delays to persons awaiting inspection and payment.  To compile the information he requested would involve the examination of more than 50,000 files or index cards, including a substantial proportion which would be out with our local inspectors,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts of the matter are that between 21 January and 1 February 1980, about 45,000 applications for house improvement grants were received in the Department &mdash; more than the number received in the first ten months of 1979. In that year 52,500 applications for grants <Col N="1664" /> were received in addition to the concurrent intake of applications for new house grants.  The bulk of this work was being processed in January 1980.  By way of comparison, 37,500 grant applications were received in 1978.</P>
    <P>Because of the huge volume of applications on hands, some delays in dealing with these were absolutely unavoidable even though increased staff, extensive overtime and the recruitment of temporary inspectors were used to speed up processing.  As an exceptional measure to ease the problems of delays in inspections, the Minister dispensed with the requirement of a prior inspection before improvement works were commenced. Furthermore, the latest date for completion of the works and claiming the grants was extended from 1 October 1980 to 31 March 1981.</P>
    <P>Significant headway is being made with the processing of applications on hands and with the reduction of the waiting periods for inspection and payment.  Last year 41,000 house improvement grants and more than 8,000 new house grants were paid.  In the first month of 1981, 5,800 improvement grants and 2,000 new house grants were paid.  Every effort is being made by the Department to maintain this momentum.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate will be sufficient to pay the 41,000 or so house improvement grants, including solid fuel grants, which will mature for payment this year.  The total of 90,000 grants mentioned this afternoon by Deputy Desmond has absolutely no foundation in fact.  Nothing like that number, or even half of it, will have to be paid.  However, in the completely hypothetical eventuality of this number falling due for payment, I can assure the House that the necessary funds would be provided by the Government.  Might I remind Deputy Desmond that the £19 million provided for house improvement grants this year represented a slight advance on the £2 million provided for the same purpose in the Coalition Government's last budget in 1977.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record my personal appreciation of the tremendous efforts which have been made by the <Col N="1665" /> staff, both indoor and outdoor officers, to deal with the arrears problem.  I would also like to express my appreciation of the co-operation and understanding shown by applicants and public representatives in connection with the situation.  I want to assure applicants that no effort is being spared to deal with all outstanding cases as quickly as possible. <Col N="1666" /> Our efforts in this regard could only be hampered by an unproductive exercise such a that which would have been necessary to provide an answer to the question tabled today by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 February 1981.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 24, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The level of allocation for AnCO's capital programme is influenced by the overall capital requirements.  The Government have committed themselves under the second national understanding for economic and social development to increase the State's contribution to the financing of training.  In line with this commitment the Government have allocated £9.5 million to AnCO for their capital programme this year, an increase of 50 per cent on the 1980 allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans to build extensions to existing AnCO training centres at Tallaght and Dublin (Ballyfermot) have not been postponed. The extension to the AnCO Tallaght training centre is almost completed, while the extension at Ballyfermot which <Col N="1553" /> commenced early in 1979 is expected to be completed shortly.  While some courses have already been provided in the new Tallaght extension, the equipping of that extension to facilitate provision of the full range of courses envisaged for it has not yet been completed.  It is intended to have that extension fully equipped this year.</P>
    <P>AnCO plan to build new training centres at Loughlinstown, Baldoyle, Drogheda, Carlow, Galway and Letterkenny to provide a total of 1,864 training places.  AnCO plans also envisage the extension of the AnCO Athlone training centre.  Construction on the Loughlinstown and Baldoyle sites will commence in 1981 and on the Letterkenny site in early 1982.  Details of start-up and completion times related to the other locations mentioned will be influenced by an examination of capital Exchequer requirements.  That examination is at present under way and pending its conclusion I am not in a position, at this stage, to indicate likely developments in those locations.</P>
    <P>Work on the new AnCO Finglas training centre commenced in January 1980, and that centre, providing a total of 420 places, should be operational by the end of 1981.  It will, of course, be possible to initiate a limited range of training courses there in advance of that date.  AnCO had intended to build a new training centre in the Dublin inner city area.  These plans have now been superseded through AnCO acquiring the lease interest in a premises suitable for adaptation as a training centre in Dublin inner city.  That centre will provide a total of 200 training places and it is hoped that it will be fully operational by the middle of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned has been claiming disability benefit since July 1974.  She was considered capable of work by a medical referee on 26 September 1979 and payment was refused from 8 October 1979.  She was examined by a different medical referee on 14 November 1979 and was again considered capable of work.  She appealed against the decision refusing payment of benefit, and an appeals officer, following an oral hearing, disallowed her appeal in respect of the period 8 October 1979 to 7 January 1980, the date of the latest medical certificate before him.  She had a further appeal in respect of the period 8 January 1980 to 3 April 1980 but this appeal was also disallowed.</P>
      <P>As she continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity she was again examined by a medical referee on 7 May 1980 and was considered capable of work.  Payment of disability benefit was, however, inadvertently restored from 10 May 1980 and continued to be paid up to 9 December 1980</P>
      <P>In addition, she claimed and was paid unemployment benefit from 21 April 1980 to 25 November 1980 when she ceased to register as unemployed.  She has, therefore, received double payment of disability benefit and unemployment benefit in respect of the period 10 May 1980 to 25 November 1980 amounting to £582.83.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As she is still submitting medical evidence of incapacity she has been referred for medical referee examination at an <Col N="1555" /> early date.  On receipt of the result of this examination her claim to disability benefit will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>It is understood that she has been paid supplementary welfare allowance by the North-Eastern Health Board from 29 December 1980.  When the question of her entitlement to benefit is resolved the arrears due, if any, will be reduced by the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid to her since that date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 3 October 1980, but at the time was not entitled to payment as he had not the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1978 contribution year which governed his claim.

Disability benefit at the personal rate has now been paid to 30 December 1980, the date of the latest medical certificate received.

      <P>The Irish Building Societies Association announced on 8 December 1980 that it had recommended to its members that the investors' interest rate be reduced from 9% to 8.25% standard rate tax paid and that the interest rate on home loans for owner-occupation be reduced from 14.15% to 13.15% per annum with effect from 1 January 1981.</P>

    <P>The society in question has indicated that in accordance with the terms of individual mortgage contracts, one month's notice of the change in the mortgage interest rate was given to all mortgagors. The effective date of change in the interest rate in all cases was, therefore, 1 February 1981.  The accounting system operated by the society does not permit consideration of changes in monthly loan repayments until the month <Col N="1574" /> in which the changes are due to take place.  At the end of that month a new monthly instalment is calculated with effect from the first day of the following month.  Loan repayments due to the society in March and succeeding months will, therefore, be adjusted to take account of the decrease in the mortgage interest rate and accounts will be credited with any overpayment made in respect of the month of February.</P>
