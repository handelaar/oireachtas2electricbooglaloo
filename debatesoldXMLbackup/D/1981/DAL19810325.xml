      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question put to you by the Taoiseach was, if he or I or the Leader of the Labour Party gave you notice would that be in order? Is that <Col N="3" /> agreed? You said if the Taoiseach gave you notice it would be in order. Are you excluding us from this?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following Standing Order No. 38. It is open to the Taoiseach to make a statement to the House without a question being asked, if he so desires, but the initiative rests with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to insist on our right to ask questions on the Order of Business about future business, not the business of the day but future business, which has been the practice of this House for 60 years. You have attempted to change this persistently. We cannot and will not accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some confusion. I wish to clarify this point. I had a telephone call from the Government Whip's office asking me if I would be agreeable to the Taoiseach making a statement on the summit at 3.30 tomorrow afternoon. I said I was agreeable to that. I want to be clear on what you said. I assumed then, and I still assume, that the procedure which was followed in the past was that the Taoiseach would make a statement, the leader of Fine Gael would make a statement and I would <Col N="4" /> make a statement. Is that the procedure to be followed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. On the Order of Business, with regard to item 16 on today's Order Paper, I will read it:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the targets for economic and social development and the supporting policies set out in the Government's White Paper: <i>Programme for National Development</i> 1978. 1981.</P>
      <P>That reads like a joke but it is not a joke. Would the Taoiseach be prepared to resume that debate next week to allow the Dáil to discuss the chronic economic situation facing us, where unemployment is running at 126,000 and inflation&mdash;I confidently predict&mdash; will be revealed tomorrow as running at over 20 per cent? If the Taoiseach is not prepared to use some other vehicle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some sporadic discussion about a debate on economic matters but, as I understand it, no decision has been arrived at. I suggest that the Whips meet this morning or this afternoon to see what can be arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Taoiseach to say that the Government are prepared next week to have a discussion on the economy and that the only <Col N="5" /> subject matter to be discussed between the Whips is the time that it will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>Is the Taoiseach indicating to the House that he is prepared to discuss a motion that would be moved, I assume, by the Government in order to allow us to discuss the catastrophic economic situation or is he proposing that we discuss when item 16 will be resumed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing anything specific at this stage. I remind the Leader of the Labour Party that we will shortly have to discuss the Finance Bill. Whereas that gives us an opportunity to discuss some measure of economic matters, I am suggesting that the Whips meet and consider the business before us and what is urgent and whether Government time can and will be provided for some motion on the economic situation, or what procedure can be arrived at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply to the questions put to him about this question of a debate appears to me to contain an element of ambiguity and I want to be clear that the principle of a debate on the economy has been agreed and all that has to be discussed is the timing. Is that the position? I want a straight yes or no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that that is not the position. What I said very explicitly is that the Whips should meet to discuss and decide whether a debate can be arranged, the terms of that debate and time of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald can find no grounds for what he is suggesting. Every Deputy in the House perhaps, except himself, is quite clear on what I did say.

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little bit worrying that such important matters under the Guardianship of Infants Act will be dealt with by the District Court. I am concerned that they will have the opportunity and time to deal with those matters. That is the main objection that I have on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I gave a very exhaustive reply in this connection. I am satisfied, as I have said, that the District Courts can adequately deal with all matters proposed in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been comments here that District Justices might not do the job as thoroughly or as capably as Circuit Court judges. I believe that our district justices will be conscientious, fair and thorough in dealing with guardianship matters and awards of custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that. Deputy Enright is the first Deputy who has said that in the House and it is an enormous help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the District Courts in operation for many years and 99 per cent of the district justices are dedicated to their position. I am quite certain that a lot will go above and beyond the call of duty in looking into those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will be restricted by the nature of the physical surrounds, in regard to court houses, interview rooms, waiting rooms &mdash;the whole environment of the District Courts. I am concerned about some of the places where justice is being administered&mdash;townhalls and even billiard rooms. Children will be coming into areas such as these and fundamental and important decisions will be taken in regard to their lives and their future in <Col N="10" /> surroundings which are far from proper for the administration of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy, but he knows that there will be certain amendments in relation to the matters which he is discussing now. I would like him to please confine himself to this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to do so. These environments are not proper or satisfactory but the district justices themselves will, I believe, discharge their duties fairly.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister about the back-up services for the district justices in making their decisions, involving court welfare officers. To make sure that this section and this Bill work, these matters should be very fully reviewed.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on earlier sections that in matters of this nature special times and dates should be set aside for the hearing of these sensitive and delicate cases. I mentioned it also in regard to other family matters. In regard to family matters, there are affiliation orders and so on which come up to be dealt with along with criminal cases. That is not proper. A number of decisions are taken under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, involving changes in custody of children and so forth. That family should not be in court on a day when serious assault cases, drunken driving cases and a long list of other serious cruminal matters are being dealt with. It would be very sad to have the wife, husband and children sitting in court in a local country area under those conditions, having matters of a sensitive family nature decided. To give the district justices and this section an opportunity of working well, I ask the Minister, with the help of his Department and of the court officials, to have special sittings set aside for the hearing of these family cases to prevent an unsatisfactory and unsavoury situation arising. The Minister should give this his closest attention, because of the importance of the issue.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Enright that the matters which he has raised in connection with timing and the type of <Col N="11" /> environment for such family law cases will be given consideration. What he is suggesting has already been considered and will be very closely and thouroughly examined with a view to providing suitable surroundings for the hearing of these sensitive and delicate family law cases. In that context, we accept that certain district courts are unsuitable because of their structure or their location and the possibility of a venue or two venues for a particular District Court area for the hearing of this type of case is being considered to ensure suitable accommodation in suitable surroundings to meet the requirements of these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I were to concede that jurisdiction under the Guardianship Act should not be conferred on the District Court, as section 15 proposes among other things to do, the amendments now under discussion are not acceptable because they propose to delete reference not only to the District Court's jurisdiction but also to the Circuit Court's Jurisdiction under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that under existing law the Circuit Court already has the same jurisdiction as the High Court under Part II of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. I have said already that the aim of the Bill in the area of family law is to draw together the various jurisdictions in such a way as to provide a forum where the whole range of remedies which the law provides can <Col N="12" /> be obtained on one application. To make it easier for applicants to do this, section 16 allows an applicant or plaintiff to take the full range of actions in his local District or Circuit Court venue or, if he wishes, to go to the defendant's or respondent's local venue to initiate proceedings. In practice, the local venue will be the same for applicant and respondent in many cases but where one party has moved from the locality or is working away from the locality it could cause hardship or indeed discourage the taking of action in some cases if the party wishing to initiate proceedings was obliged to do so other than at his local court venue.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the rationalisation has been sought by many interested parties and has been recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, which is an eminently qualified body chaired by a judge of the Supreme Court. It would defeat the whole purpose of the provisions of section 16, designed as it is to offer litigants choice of venue, to omit from the range of jurisdictions covered by it, the one relating to the very important questions of the guardianship and custody of infants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> These amendments are of a purely drafting nature and are to ensure that all civil proceedings come within the scope of the section. It was suggested to me that the wording of section 17 as it stands might be capable of the interpretation that subsection (4) would not apply to actions of tort or breach of promise of marriage commenced and heard in the High Court or to actions for the recovery of a liquidated sum where the amount recovered by the plaintiff exceeds £7,500. While it would, I think, be stretching a point to read this unintended interpretation into the section as it now stands, nonetheless if there is a potential ambiguity it should be removed at this stage.</P>
    <P>These amendments to the first three subsections ensure that the exception provided in brackets in subsection (4) relates to the full specification of the actions given in those three subsections, and not just to the generic descriptions of those actions immediately preceding the words being inserted.</P>

      <P>We believe that £15,000 should be substituted for the £7,500 in this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments arise, I think, from a misunderstanding of what this section is intended to achieve and of its background in existing statutes. The kernel of this section is contained in subsection (4) and, in layman's terms, would be something like this: If you are a successful plaintiff, and you took your case in too high a court, then you will only get costs at the rate for the lowest court in which the same result could have been obtained, unless the judge thinks the case was important enough to justify you doing as you did. This general principle replaces a somewhat similar provision in section 12 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which applies only to certain specified types of action. When one compares <Col N="14" /> this general principle with the detailed provisions in the 1936 Act, one finds, in fact that in some instances the 1936 provisions are more restrictive, and these more restrictive provisions are in effect repeated in the first three subsection of the section now before the House.</P>
      <P>If we now look at these subsections in detail, we will see their effect, and the effect that the amendments would have. Take the case of a person knocked down in a car accident who sues the driver of the car in the High Court. If the High Court awards him £8,000, costs will be calculated on the Circuit Court scale; subsection (4) applies. If the court awards him only £3,000, subsection (1) applies. Not only will the costs he can recover be calculated on the Circuit Court scale, but even if the costs on that scale amount to £3,500, he will be able to recover only £3,000 in costs. If Deputy Keating's amendment to this subsection were carried into effect, then the extra restriction of costs not exceeding damages would apply to all High Court awards between £2,500 and £15,000.</P>
      <P>In the case of a claim for a liquidated sum, that is, where the amount claimed is not in issue but only whether it should be paid or not, subsections (2) and (3) apply. Thus, if I commence proceedings in the High Court for a debt of £7,500 or less I can never get High Court costs, but if the amount of the debt at issue is between £7,500 and £15,000 the judge will have power to allow High Court costs if he considers the case important enough according to the formula in subsection (4). If the amendment to subsection (2) proposed by the Deputy were accepted, then any case involving a liquidated sum of £15,000 or less taken in the High Court would always be penalised as to costs and the judge would have no discretion, as he would have under the Bill, for awards between £7,500 and £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the section is, certainly, to discourage litigants from taking action in a court other than the lowest court with jurisdiction to grant the relief obtained. I think that the restrictions provided are, however, sufficiently tight to achieve this. On balance, I prefer them to the more draconian proposals of the Deputy. I <Col N="15" /> think that it is fair that the more severe penalty as to costs should not apply where the sums recovered tend towards the upper limits of jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment. Its purpose is to clarify that a certificate allowing full costs to a successful plaintiff who has commenced proceedings in a court other than the lowest court with jurisdiction to grant the relief obtained must be given by the judge who heard the proceedings. The amendment will also clarify that certificates of this type will not be available in default cases, that is cases where the relief sought is the recovery of a liquidated sum, the recovery of land or the delivery of specific goods, and no defence is entered. In such cases, judgment is entered in the office of the court without having been heard by a judge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> This amendment is designed to ensure that an application for a special certificate under this section must be made immediately on determination of the hearing. I understand that at present in the High Court such applications are almost invariably made promptly on determination of the hearing. However, it has been suggested that the wording of section 12 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, upon which this subsection is at present based, is such as to permit applications to be made even some considerable time after the main issue has been decided. This would cause practical problems in the High Court at present if it were to happen with any frequency; but it becomes more important now, with the extension of the costs limitations to the Circuit Court, that such applications be made promptly. With the higher throughput of cases in that court, and the fact that shorthand notes of proceedings are not taken in that court, it would be unreasonable to ask a judge of that court to entertain an application for a special certificate under section 17 at any time other than immediately on determination of the section giving rise to the application.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of this amendment is that we wish that this section should not apply to any proceedings issuing prior to the date of coming into operation of the Act. There appears to be an implication here in this section that the costs follow the event unless the judge issues a certificate to the effect that the case is of exceptional importance. This is a matter that we should consider when discussing the question of the various strata of courts. The High Court undoubtedly gives greater time and consideration and there is far more legal argument there than there is in this context. Consequently one hopes to get a result where a matter of law of principle is involved where the <Col N="18" /> matter is thrashed out carefully so as to ensure that the proper result is reached. This decision is then a guide or precedent with regard to future cases in that it establishes a principle that may be availed of in the lower courts where, as we know, matters do not get such a full hearing. This section to some extent needs a criticism with regard to the delay in the Act having effect but subsection (6) seems to us to be undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection is a repetition of the final subsection in section 12 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936. At that time there was a number of rules of court which repeated word for word certain statutory costs limitations which differed from those provided in the 1936 Act. The statutes upon which these rules were based were repealed by the 1936 Act, and section 12 of that Act provided in their stead. If the subsection had not been enacted, a conflict would have existed between the statute and the rules; the subsection ensured that no such conflict would arise. The same logic applies today. The subsection is being provided in this new provision for precisely the same reasons as it was provided in 1936.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate that the subsection is not an easy one to understand at first reading, but once one is aware of the background, its significance becomes apparent. Its effect is to restrict the power of the rule making bodies when they are making rules as to the limitation of costs, but goes on to make it clear that their power to fix scales of costs is not affected by the provision.</P>

      <P>What is the point of the subsection in the context of the general principle enunciated in section 17? It seems to me to be contradictory. The Minister said it is essential. I cannot see <Col N="19" /> the wisdom of that. The essence of subsection (6) is that a limit is being imposed on the amount of costs recoverable. I wonder about that, because it seems to conflict with the spirit of section 17.</P>

      <P>In page 11, before subsection (1), to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) If, during any period, the Chief Justice is unable owing to illness or for any other reason to transact the business of his office or the office of Chief Justice is vacant, all jurisdictions, power, authorities and functions for the time being vested in him by virtue of his office, other than the power of determination specified in section 7 (4) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, shall be exercised or performed by the President of the High Court or, if the President of the High Court is unable owing to illness or for any other reason to exercise or perform the said jurisdictions, powers, authorities and functions, or if there is a vacancy in the office of President of the High Court, by the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court who is for the time being available.</P>
      <P>(b) The power of determination conferred by section 7 (4) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, on the Chief Justice and exercisable in his absence, by virtue of that provision, by the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court for the time being available shall also be exercisable by the latter judge if the office of Chief Justice is vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) If, during any period, the President of the High Court is unable owing to illness or for any other reason to transact the business of his office or the office of President of the High Court is <Col N="21" /> vacant, all jurisdictions, powers, authorities and functions for the time being vested in him by virtue of his office, other than those conferred on him by subsection (1) of this section, shall be exercised or performed by the senior ordinary judge of the High Court who is for the time being available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments make provision for the performance of the duties of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court when the holder of either office is unable to do so or when either office is vacant. They represent a logical extension of the principle in section 18 as it now stands.</P>
    <P>At present, by virtue of section 10 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, when the Chief Justice is unable owing to illness or for any other reason to transact the business of his office, that business may be transacted by the President of the High Court, or, if the President is not available, by the senior Supreme Court Judge. In addition to this all-embracing provision at section 10 of the 1961 Act, there is at section 7 of the same Act a special provision allowing the senior Supreme Court Judge to determine the number of judges who shall hear certain business of the Supreme Court; no reference is made in that provision to the President of the High Court. There appears to be a conflict between the two sections of that Act.</P>
    <P>As well as resolving this conflict, the new subsection (1) of section 18 proposed in this amendment provides that the functions of the Chief Justice may be performed not only in his absence but also when the office of Chief Justice is vacant, by the President of the High Court or, if he is unavailable or there is a vacancy in that office, by the senior available Supreme Court Judge.</P>
    <P>As regards the President of the High Court, there is statutory provision for the performance of only one of the functions of his office&mdash;that of arranging the distribution of the High Court's business &mdash;when he is not available; this is at section 10 (3) of the 1961 Act. There is no provision for the performance of the duties when the office of President is <Col N="22" /> vacant. The new subsection (2) proposed in this amendment provides that, when the President of the High Court is unable owing to illness or for any other reason to transact the business of his office, or if the office of President is vacant, his functions may be performed by the senior available High Court Judge.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 37 amends the Schedule to the Bill so as to repeal the existing provisions of the 1961 Act which the new subsection replaces.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26 are related to Amendment No. 23 a and may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23a:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 18, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;15&rsquo;&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;&lsquo;11&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech at Second Stage, adverted to the fact that the new <Col N="23" /> rate of interest on judgment debts provided in the Bill as it stands at present was arrived at during a period when bank interest rates were subject to fluctuation. Subsequent changes in the Associated Banks&rsquo;overdraft and deposit rates have necessitated an adjustment in the rate specified in the Bill. Re-calculation on the basis of current rates would give a rate for interest on judgment debts of 11 per cent, and amendment No. 23a alters the figure accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to predict whether a further change will be required before the Bill becomes law; if such a change is indicated, the necessary amendment will be introduced at the appropriate stage. Acceptance of the amendment at this stage rather than, say, on Report Stage in the Seanad will save time if further modification proves unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I cannot; however, accept the principle underlying the Deputy's amendment to section 19. If it is his intention that the court should in each case determine what the rate of interest should be, then there is no point in specifying any interest rate in a statute. But the whole purpose of providing a statutory interest rate is to remove uncertainty from the minds of judgment debtors and judgment creditors alike. If it is the intention of the amendment to enable the interest rate on judgment debts to be varied by reference to commercially-available rates, this is already adequately catered for by section 20 of the Bill, which provides that the Minister may by order vary the rate specified.</P>
    <P>I have consulted with the parliamentary draftsman and I am satisfied that the wording used in the subsection which will give this power to the Minister is the appropriate form of words to be used when conferring on the Minister a power which is to be exercised subject to conditions. Amendment No. 25 is therefore not accepted. In this particular instance there is in any event an element of compulsion implied in the use, in line 25 of the section, of the word &ldquo;ought&rdquo;. There is no point in providing for such a power as this unless the intention is to exercise it. The aim of section 19 is to rectify the <Col N="24" /> gross disparity that has existed for many years between the judgment debt interest rate and commercially-available rates; and the aim of section 20 is to ensure that such a disparity, if it arises again, can be rectified without undue delay. The Deputy need have no fear that, if the situation warrants it, an order will be made under this section, subject of course to subsection (2). The purpose of that subsection is to restrict the frequency with which the judgment debt interest rate may be varied.</P>
    <P>This interest rate is intended only to be a rough approximation of the average between what one can earn in the banks if the money in question were deposited and what one would have to pay to borrow on overdraft. It does not have to be precise, nor need it reflect every fluctuation of a quarter or a half per cent in the Association Banks&rsquo;interest rates. Indeed, there would be actual disadvantages if it were to do so, as would seem to be the thinking behind amendment No. 26: litigants, practitioners and court staff alike would have to involve themselves in multiple calculations of interest for perhaps negligible amounts, and such calculations would, as well as involving extra work, increase the likelihood of error.</P>
    <P>By varying the rate of interest at less frequent intervals it is possible to maintain a reasonable relationship between it and commercial rates, while at the same time making the job of those who have to use the judgment debt interest rate less uncertain and error-prone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has met most of the points made in amendment No. 24, the idea being that it would not need a debate in this House, or any major initiative by the Government, to change the limits of figures available to the courts in making such orders and that they would automatically change in line with the economic indicators, the cost of living index or the prevailing bank and other commercial interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister is saying now that under the Act he has power to make a ministerial order to give effect to such changes and variations. We can only wait <Col N="25" /> and see how they will work. Ministerial orders are not made as often as they should be as a rule and I would be anxious to ensure that the figures we are talking about in this context would be realistic and current and would relate to the real values in existence. We know that the passage of time and inflation have eroded most of the real worth of such values. Only yesterday in relation to fining policy generally it was stated that the figures involved are completely out of date and bear no relationship to current values. It is to correct that situation that section 19 appears in this Bill. Is the Minister satisfied that this is the best way in which to achieve his object? It might be appropriate for the Judiciary to have the right at regular intervals to review the figures involved. Is a ministerial order the best way to achieve the Minister's object?</P>

      <P>Under the Debtors (Ireland) Act, 1840, a figure of 4 per cent was permitted on decrees. I am sure in 1840 a figure of 4 per cent was perhaps a little bit above the going rate. Over the years a number of people have obtained decrees in which for one reason or another there were delays in the payment of the awards and that had a disadvantageous effect on many people who have obtained decrees. I welcome this section. I take it the Minister is now substituting 15 per cent for 11 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating and I are reasonably happy with that. It is a fair figure. Had it been left at 15 per cent a sizeable number of people who had decrees given against them would have suffered great hardship. I hope that interest rates will fall even further because they have a disadvantageous effect on farming, industry and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 gives power to the Minister to bring in orders. Overall this amendment goes a long way to meet what we <Col N="26" /> had in mind. We wanted some method whereby the figure could be reviewed annually. I accept the good faith of the Minister in that he will review the figure annually. Difficulty could be caused where a case might commence in February and be decided in October. There would be no prevailing interest rate for that particular year and that could cause problems. The amendment goes a long way to meet our objections.</P>

      <P>Will there be a minimum period within which ministerial orders may be made? I am anxious that there should be a proper reflection of economic indicators. The provision is to be recommended. It is one that should have been introduced long ago. We have taken years to catch up with the realities of the situation. The 4 per cent figure has become utterly unrealistic. Often people had to borrow money and pay three, four, five and six times that rate. In the pursuit of equity I want to ensure there will be a mechanism which will adjust the figures spontaneously and automatically.</P>

      <P>If a situation obtained in which orders were to be made more frequently than proposed it would cause a lot of difficulties and uncertainties. It could create problems for litigants, for practitioners and it would be very difficult to calculate the amounts within such short periods. Two years is a reasonable length of time within which this situation should be reviewed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to take the argument a step further, let us assume the interest rates had come down to the rate at which they stood two years previously, which I admit is unlikely, the argument could then be advanced: well, there is no need to change them now. We should remember that what we are endeavouring to achieve here is not merely flexibility but a just system which reflects accurately economic indicators. I cannot see anything complex about devising a formula which relates to economic indicators, to prevailing bank or other commercial interest rates and which is applied throughout the 12 months of the year. Frankly, I do not know why the two year period is there at all; I do not see the logic of it. This will mean that orders will <Col N="28" /> be made or figures decided by the court which will relate more or less to what should be the case and what is agreed to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seems to make a lot of sense. Presumably it means that the Minister would have greater power to step in whenever circumstances would so dictate, though I am not totally satisfied that that mechanism will operate as ideally as it should. I should like to know if there is any better way of making sure that the figures about which we are talking, the interest rates and so on, would accurately and consistently relate to economic indicators rather than at spasmodic intervals, dependent on a minister making an order or dependent on commercial interest rates. If the section is to operate properly it needs not merely a two yearly interval gap; it also needs a coincidence of the two yearly interval with interest rates which are 2 per cent more or less than they were two years previously. Certainly I can foresee circumstances in which one or both of those aspects would not apply, in which we could have over three, four, five or six years the same interest rates prevailing. When the principle of responsiveness to economic indicators is being acceded to at all we should be able to devise some kind of formula which would act as a slide rule to people whose job it is to dictate these matters, so that they could get on with it. There is no virtue in itself in consistency in the figure: I see no advantage in that. What is important is that that figure bears a true relationship to economic costs and indicators. I think that is what the Minister had in mind in introducing this section. However, I can foresee a situation in which that may not happen. In other words, here we are getting half a loaf when we could be getting the whole pan. I do not really believe that we have the best formula for devising adequate figures which reflect economic costs because it will be dependent on a two yearly cycle and then bank interest rates being at a certain level. Would the Minister be agreeable to look at this again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="30" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am satisfied that what is proposed in the section is adequate to deal with the situation. On the question of accuracy in relation to the variation of the figure, while it is important that the interest rate on judgment debts should bear a reasonable relationship to prevailing commercial interest rates, it is not necessary that every move in the latter should cause an order to be made under this section. Indeed over-frequent changes of the judgment debt interest rate could give rise to uncertainty and difficulties of calculation, as I have pointed out already.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides, therefore, that orders varying the interest rate may not come into effect at intervals of less than two years. It is the intention to make an order only if the Associated Bank interest rates have changed by more than two percentage points up or down and, in striking a new rate, to use the same considerations as were used in arriving at the rate proposed in section 19.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>Every order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Keating is trying to convince me that there is another more suitable method of improving the situation than is proposed in the Bill. But, having examined it carefully, I am satisfied that there must be certain demarcation lines, certain time limits, certain methods of calculation. Otherwise, if we are to be responding to commercial interest rate fluctuations on a more frequent basis than is proposed the irregularity of the whole exercise would cause enormous problems. Having regard to the period of time that this type of litigation can take I do not think that the two-year period is either too long or too short but it is a period in which fluctuations in bank interest rates can be reflected. It is not likely that we would make any more worthwhile contribution to the Bill by altering this period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept in general what the Minister says but I do not see the problems he mentions. He refers to confusion, for instance. If there is a simple formula based on economic indicators, as is the case in many other aspects of life, in regard to costings and so on, there should be no problem. We are not talking about higher mathematics but about taking prevailing interest rates and applying them to a judgment. The difference is that the concept is new, that is, the concept <Col N="32" /> of having a variation based on true costs but that is only just. Perhaps it would be all right if we were to have fairly regular reviews but this may not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the case of an order made on a certain date on the basis of certain costs, the bank interest rates could have soared within 12 months?

      <P>This section commends itself to us because, as we all know, very often costs are not paid for lengthy periods after the action has concluded. In some cases these delays can be up to 12 months or even longer. This situation is caused not so much by inertia on the part of the legal profession, though I am sure that happens sometimes, but by delay in having costs taxed by the relevant tax master in the issuing of his report. In a situation of high inflation it is totally wrong that costs are not paid immediately or that they do not carry interest in the event of delay in payment. Ideally they should be paid immediately because payment of them, even with interest one or two years later, may have resulted in great hardship in the meantime to the people concerned. The solace of having interest paid at a later stage, and though helpful in itself, does not necessarily mean the elimination of hardship. Therefore, we should not in any way allow this section on its becoming operative to detract from our desire to have costs paid immediately. The amendment meets the situation in part but any other change that the Minister might think of to help the situation further would be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. In the section as drafted the word &ldquo;damages&rdquo; appears without qualification. This would leave the situation wide open in regard to motor insurance claims in particular but it would also touch on other aspects of insurance. This provision concerns me in my capacity here as spokesman on consumer affairs because if the section were to go through as drafted, it would lead to enormous increases in insurance premiums. Our amendment is designed to prevent that situation. If interest were to be allowed on awards from the date on which the cause of action accrued that would lead to a situation in which, for instance, in the case of a motor accident having occurred on 1 January 1981 in which somebody was injured and since the proceedings would not have to be issued in respect of personal injuries for a period of three years, in other words, before 1 January 1984, the person concerned might decide that there was no great hurry to issue proceedings and might wait until the end of November, 1983, before doing so, happy in the knowledge that he would receive a sizeable amount by way of interest on the damages that would be agreed by the court. In many instances people would deliberately delay proceedings. This would be true especially of the better-off people. The poorer sections would not be likely to be in a position to wait so long for damages in the first place. That concerns us on this side of the House, that a person as well as getting medical expenses, being paid for the period out of work and getting interest on those items, would also get interest on, say, personal injuries. That situation would have led to massive increases in <Col N="35" /> insurance premiums. Insurance premiums are prohibitive at present but this would have led to a bad situation getting completely out of hand if insurance premiums were to rise further and this section would have led to that situation arising.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies estimate their reserves for outstanding claims. For 1980 I believe they set aside a sum of £200 million and that the reserve for employers and public liability was in the region of £100 million. If the Bill had become law as introduced the danger is that those reserves would not have been sufficient. That is why I believe this amendment goes some of the way. The Minister's amendment does not fully meet the situation that we are anxious to remedy. If the matter is not thoroughly remedied insurance premiums will rise between 40 and 50 per cent. I read the Minister's comments in the newspapers over the weekend and I know he is anxious to avoid further increases in insurance premiums because he knows the very serious problems that would arise for people in all walks of life trying to get motor insurance.</P>
      <P>We are just talking about damages here and Deputy Keating's amendment includes all damages except those for personal injuries. This does not affect only motor insurance. There are very heavy insurance premiums on those working in the building industry and premiums must be paid by building firms to cover accidents at work and resulting damages. In my view the bill as it is, would lead to a very sizeable increase also in the cost of insurance for building firms. I have had discussions with people in the CII and the Builders Federation about this and they are concerned about it. So are those in manufacturing industries. Unless the provisions are changed they will lead to very sizeable increases in insurance in the building and manufacturing industries. This will also affect farm insurance costs, the different types of insurance involved in the agricultural sector, and in many cases will lead to increased premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there are insurance companies <Col N="36" /> happy to avail of the current situation and delay cases coming up for hearing. To give one example, the cost of a motor car is, say, £5,000. If a car is very extensively damaged and almost a complete write off, you could not bring that action in the Circuit Court. You have to go to the High Court. Many of these actions would not come up for hearing perhaps for a year or two. In dealing with an insurance company about a car accident involving over £2,000, their attitude was more or less: &ldquo;You can do what you like because it will be quite a long time before this is settled&rdquo;. They were able to postpone settlement of the claim. The present situation suited them in that they were able to avail of interest on their own money but the person who suffered the loss of the car was at a complete disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is need to consider the matter from both sides but as it stands at present this Bill is not correct. We must try to ensure that insurance companies are not allowed to evade their responsibilities and we must protect innocent people entitled to damages, personal or otherwise. Insurance companies in many cases have availed of delays up to now. We must consider the best way of meeting the situation. Deputy Keating's amendment in dealing with all damages except those for personal injuries goes a long way to meet the case. In England interest on general damages is paid from the date of issue of the writ. This came in under the Administration of Justice Act, 1969. There was a case of <i>Jeffard v Gee</i> in which this regulation was brought in. As regards special damages, 50 per cent of the standard rate from the date of the accident is payable and from 1 October 1980 interest calculated in the same manner must be added to lodgments.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with something of fundamental importance, the motor car is not a luxury. The vast majority of people need a car for family use. We must ensure that premiums do not become prohibitive and we must be most careful in this section to see that the proper amendments are made. My approach to it would be that interest would become due from the date of the service of the <Col N="37" /> proceedings on the defendant. The Bill provides &ldquo;between the date when the cause of action accrued....&rdquo; People could manage to delay issuing proceedings for two or three years in the knowledge that they would get interest from the date the cause of action accrued. To be fair to everybody interest should be allowed in my opinion from the date proceedings are served on the other side. That would mean that the insurance company would be notified reasonably quickly that an accident had occurred and that proceedings would be commenced. it would speed up the process of law in this connection. Once proceedings are issued they can perhaps use different devices to delay the matter further if they so wish but on the other hand once proceedings are served, if the insurance company want to have the case heard they can compel the plaintiffs to bring the case for hearing. They can bring a notice of motion for that purpose. That would meet the situation. In this section we are dealing with enormous sums of money and that is why I consider this matter should be looked into very carefully. Deputy Keating's amendment goes a long way towards meeting the situation. These are the main points I would like to make and I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment put down by Deputy Keating would, I think, be contrary to the interests of the public generally. To take an example: a person injured in a collision in his motorcar may &mdash; under the Deputy's proposal &mdash; be awarded interest on the cost of repairing or replacing his car but not on any medical expenses incurred. The aim of this section is to provide a means whereby a successful plaintiff may be compensated for being kept out of money which should have been paid to him. This is a perfectly just principle, and has universal application. There is absolutely nothing special about compensation for personal injuries which would justify blanket exclusion from this provision of that category of damages over and above any other form of debt or damages. There may well be circumstances in individual cases which <Col N="38" /> might warrant an award of more or less by way of interest, but such circumstances can arise in any type of case, not just personal injuries cases. Because of the wide variation in circumstances that can occur, the award of interest is made discretionary and within flexible limits. It may be that the amendments which I have tabled Nos. 29b and 29c &mdash; which propose to narrow these limits &mdash; will go a long way towards achieving the Deputy's objective.</P>
      <P>Much has been said and printed over recent months on the supposed effect of this provision on the cost of insurance, and all sorts of extraordinary figures have been mentioned. I would like to make it clear, however, that much of what has been said is based on a misunderstanding of what this provision says. Fears have been expressed that interest will be awarded in all cases and that it will be awarded on the whole of each award for the entire period between cause of action and judgment. That is not what the section says: it gives a discretionary power to award interest, and in the exercise of that discretion it gives two further discretions, in both the amount of the award which is to carry interest and the duration for which that interest is to be calculated. Given that the aim of the section is to provide a means of compensating an injured party for being kept out of the money which should have been his to use, then it is unreasonable to suggest that the courts would always determine that interest should be payable on the full amount and for the full period. In personal injuries cases there are clearly elements of such an award which the courts would inevitable exclude&mdash;significant elements. The proportion of an award on which interest could reasonably be expected to be awarded is generally quite small and would normally relate to compensation for losses actually incurred between cause of action and judgment. If there was evidence of delay on the part of the plaintiff, then of course it would be open to the court to reduce the amount or the period on which interest would be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that amendments Nos. 29b and 29c have been <Col N="39" /> tabled. They are intended to spell out in section 22 of the Bill&mdash;rather than leave it to the discretion of the courts&mdash;that two important elements in personal injuries awards will not attract interest. These are the elements of such an award which relate to all losses anticipated in the period after judgment, and to non-pecuniary losses experienced between cause of action and judgment. I should like to make it clear that without these amendments our courts here &mdash; in the exercise of the discretion given in section 22&mdash; would almost certainly exclude these elements from an award of interest. That is the position which has come about in England in giving effect to a similar provision. Nevertheless, it seems preferable on balance to spell out these main exclusions in the Bill itself. For one thing I accept that it is undesirable that the Oireachtas should give to the courts a statutory discretion very much wider in scope than the way in which we intend it to be exercised. In addition, the restrictions now proposed to be spelt out should allay fears which have been expressed as to any over-generous use of that discretion.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 29a clarifies the wording and intention of subsection (1) of the section; as it stands at present, discretion is conferred on &ldquo;the court&rdquo;. It is intended that that discretion &mdash; to determine what interest, if any, is to be awarded in each case &mdash; should be exercised by the judge rather than by a jury. The amendment makes this clear.</P>
    <P>It was originally proposed to bring this provision into effect six months after the date of enactment of the Bill, with the proviso that it would not apply to proceedings instituted in any court before that day. On further consideration, and particularly in view of the fact that by commencing the provision in this way it was possible that some defendants might find themselves liable for interest in respect of periods before this Bill becomes law, it has been decided to make a change. Amendment No. 29b provides that no interest may be awarded in respect of any period before the enactment of the Bill, and amendment No. 36a <Col N="40" /> applies the provision with effect from the enactment to all cases determined on or after that date. The amendments taken together rule out retrospective effect in accordance with the general principle in that regard.</P>

      <P>I have never held the view that amendments we tabled to achieve a certain objective should be technically accurate, but the Minister's amendments were tabled subsequent to our amendment which tried to ensure that there would be, at the very least, clarity in relation to the role of personal injuries and to ensure that they would not be open to abuse. I agree that the Minister's amendments partly meet the case and I do not wish to be petty about this but if the Minister is sure they are what are necessary, we would be happy about them. The section generally has much to recommend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of my argument was that damages in relation to personal injuries were awarded as of the date of trial, and not the date of the cause of the action. There seemed to be a difficulty here: we could have an individual making a gain &mdash; getting interest plus inflation. That would be unjust. There may be times when we would wish that to happen and on balance I would prefer to see the individual getting the benefit of the doubt as opposed to a company, but we must have the concept of justice spread right across the board. Our amendment was intended to deal with that problem. I am not too certain that the Minister's amendments meet the case but we have alerted him to our fears in this respect and if he is adamant that his amendments meet the case, fair enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a number of points. I welcome the Minister's first amendment. There was some ambiguity as to whether a judge acting on his own was involved or a judge and jury. That matter has now been clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years depreciation <Col N="41" /> was not allowed in relation to damaged motor cars. The only costs payable were the cost of repairs and the cost of car hire. The situation has now changed and in most cases depreciation is also allowed. When a judge decides to grant interest from a particular date a precedent will be set and discretion will rarely be used. A person who suffers injury will be paid medical expenses and then compensation for any damage to clothing and loss of wages. As regards personal injuries, our courts have been exceptionally fair and generous in taking into account the rate of inflation in deciding compensation for those who have suffered. A person who receives an award today for injuries received in 1976 will be compensated at today's rates.</P>
    <P>A change is now envisaged whereby a person will also receive interest on the award as well as compensation for inflation. If this occurs there will be a very sizeable increase in insurance premiums. Insurance companies do not need any excuse to increase premiums and do so at every opportunity. They will certainly make full use of a loophole such as this. When this Bill becomes law it will be necessary to keep a thorough check on insurance companes to see that they do not use this legislation to increase their profits.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 28, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister for Justice may make an order varying the amount for the time being standing specified in subsection (1) (a) of this section and the said subsection (1) (a) shall have effect in accordance with the terms of any such order.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> (3) Every order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the lower limit of applicability of interest on judgment debts to be varied by order from time to time. It is expedient that this figure should be variable from time to time in order to take account of the changing value of money. This limit is not the jurisdiction limit and, as such, is an appropriate subject for variation by order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the purpose of the amendment is to get away from the hard line initially taken in the proposed section, namely, to put a base line at the lower limit and to leave it at that. We are opposed to the inclusion of the section unless we get satisfactory clarification. What is the purpose of the amendment? Some people consider that a small amount of money, perhaps not exceeding £150, is of no consequence, but I do not agree with that. There are many people for whom such an amount of money is a serious matter and if it does not carry interest it means that such people are being penalised heavily. The Minister must give us some justification for including the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment the Minister has put down is another opportunity for cluttering up the Minister's office with ministerial orders of no great significance. Why insert a minimum amount in the Bill? For some reason I cannot fathom a person &mdash; perhaps an elderly person &mdash; who is awarded £120 is decreed to be less entitled to interest than somebody who is dealing with thousands of pounds. We are talking here of the true value of money. I do not understand the reason for the section.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about this matter in my capacity as my party's spokesman on consumer affairs. If a person buys an electrical item or household furniture and finds that something is wrong with it, he may get a decree in court. However, the company concerned may decide that in the case of goods costing £140 they can sit tight and not pay interest. This could cause hardship to a young married couple who bought furniture that proved to be defective and in respect of which they got a decree. To such people £140 represents a lot of money and it probably took them a considerable time to save it. If they wish to replace the item of furniture they will have to borrow the money from a bank and pay interest at 14 or 15 per cent. We are totally opposed to the section as it stands. It will adversely affect the poorer sections of the community. Delay in payment by the company will impose considerable hardship on a section of people who are not well off.</P>

I ask the Minister to accept that the only people who will be seriously affected will be the poorer section of the community. Earlier we discussed claims amounting to thousands of pounds and we spoke of insurance companies who have millions of pounds but our main responsibility is to try to protect people who cannot protect themselves.

      <P>I wish to support my colleagues on this matter. I cannot understand why there should be any exemption in respect of interest running on a judgment. A judgment of a court which awards a plaintiff a sum of money is an <Col N="47" /> acknowledgment that the money is due to him and has been wrongfully withheld by the defendant. The defendant should not be able to continue that wrong, which he will do if, as a result of not having an incentive to pay the money by virtue of the judgment carrying interest, he withholds payment of the money. Today money withheld can be extremely valuable. For instance, if the defendant happens to be a company of considerable means by withholding payment of their debts they can obtain profit on money invested. By withholding that money they can deny to the person not merely the interest on the money but, as Deputies Enright and Keating pointed out, they can impose on many plaintiffs the burden of having to pay interest on the money borrowed in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Probably I am being generous when I say that most judgments are in respect of debts at least two years old at the time the judgment is awarded. I am not making a political point now, but in the past two years the rate of inflation has been 18 per cent. That means that a plaintiff who has been wronged by a defendant who withheld money has lost already 36 per cent of the capital value of the money by the time judgment is awarded. By withholding from that person the right to get interest on a judgment, he will suffer not merely the loss of interest but also a further capital loss. As Deputy Enright pointed out, by the time the debt is paid by a reluctant defendant there could be up to three or four years capital loss due to inflation, plus the loss of interest on a judgment. Even with inflation dropping it will take from five to ten years to get the rate of inflation down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the provision is to avoid calculation of interest on small sums because the amount would not be worth the expense of calculation and collection. The figure of £150 is considered to be appropriate having regard to the general application of limits of this kind. As an example, cases under the Malicious Injuries Act exclude claims for compensation of £100. The limit on small civil bills excluded from crimiral legal aid schemes is also £100. I have listened attentively to what the three Deputies opposite have said and I am prepared to examine the position further and come back on Report Stage with my views.</P>

      <P>I am aghast at the Minister's suggestion in regard to the cost of calculating 11 per cent of £150. If only to activate the grey matter of officials, it is an expense that should be borne by the State. I believe officials&rsquo;brains and talents would be greatly improved if they had to make an occasional calculation. The money has to be collected, and whether you collect £150 or £166.50, the cost of collection is precisely the same. There is only a momentary involvement of the intelligence of highly qualified public officials in verifying that the calculation of the solicitor when he lodges the decree is correct. I do not for one moment believe it is beyond the capacity of our very competent public officials to do this, even if the State has to extend its resources to the purchase of a pocket calculator to enable them to do it. To ask any grocer who might be owed money to forego interest because the machine of the State is unable to calculate the interest is a ridiculous suggestion to make, and I do not want to be offensive to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have been trying to get across is that having a cut-off point is not justified unless the Minister is prepared to say that a judgment shall not be awarded for less than £150. That would mean the court would not be cluttered up with cases which, apparently in the Minister's view, ought not to be taken. There is not a cut-off in respect of the floor for malicious injury claims. Once a claim has been lodged it has to be processed through the local authority, the Garda and in many cases the courts. What the Minister is saying by insisting on a floor for such claims is <i>dé minimis non curat lex,</i> the law ought not to concern itself with trifles. It is not acceptable that people who are owed money of this dimension should not collect interest on what might be an old debt when the judgment is made. I am sure the Minister will bear these points in mind. If he has not reflected on them between now and Report Stage we will table the necessary amendments.</P>

      <P>There has been a considerable amount of legislation dealing with consumer matters and the bulk of those cases would be dealing with matters ranging from £50 to £150. It makes little of such legislation as the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act if we now provide that interest should not be paid on all decrees. The ordinary man who brings a claim in court and gets a decree is every bit as entitled to be paid interest on £140 as somebody who had brought a claim for £1,400. Calculating it is a simple matter of arithmetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Revenue Commissioners and the State services are able to work out the most intricate calculations in regard to, say, VAT and income tax and everything else.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 41, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Judgements referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be entered in and retained for a period of five years upon a Register of Judgement Mortgages, which shall be readily available.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The essence of this amendment is to try to ensure that there would be full public availability of decisions made in relation to judgment mortgages and that a register would be made publicly available for a period in order to get us over the increasing amount of abuse in this area by the canny manipulation of company law and law generally, whereby people can evade the full impact of the law and of justice in this respect. Therefore we would like to see section 24, which in itself is a good one and seems to streamline the law, added to and supported in this respect by the entering in and retention for a period &mdash; in the amendment we suggest five years &mdash; on a register of judgment mortgages which would be readily available to any interested parties. Obviously, the purpose of it is to give real effect to section 24 and to make available the details so that people can take appropriate evasive or other action. We believe that that is not an unreasonable request and we would be grateful if the Minister would look at it as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <P>This section as it stands enables a person who gets a District Court award to register it in the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds against the property of a debtor so as to enforce his right to recover the debt. There is no need for any special register to be kept in that regard. Certainly there is no merit seen in restricting the life of such an entry <Col N="52" /> to five years. That is what the Deputy intends. While this is not quite clear, the amendment seeks to have established a separate register for District Court decrees alone. This would be futile and would serve no practical purpose if, as proposed in the section, such awards are in any event registered in the central register. it would also raise the question of resources to be devoted to any such task whether at the Four Courts or District Court offices or the new central registry to be set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31a:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 27, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;£5,000&rsquo;&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;&lsquo;£7,500'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum amount which may be awarded to relatives of the deceased in a fatal accident was set at £1,000 when the concept was first introduced into Irish law in 1961. This new limit of £5,000 in the Bill as it stands at present is appropriate to the money values prevailing at the time the Bill was being prepared. On the basis of the latest available consumer price index the equivalent today of £1,000 in 1961 would be about £5,000. Deputy Keating's proposed maximum figure of £10,000 is excessive for an amount which is, after all, intended merely as a token of acknowledgment of the grief and distress <Col N="54" /> caused and it cannot be regarded as a measure of that distress.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 31a, which increases the maximum to £7,500, is adequate to restore the figure to a level more in keeping with what was intended by the Oireachtas in 1961, when the concept was first introduced, and to take account of inflation for some years to come. As well as providing for the award of compensation for mental distress in accidents generally, the Civil Liability Act of 1961 also provided for similar compensation to the relatives of the deceased in fatal aircraft accidents covered by the Warsaw Convention and related instruments. These international instruments govern the liability of airlines in respect of death or injury to passengers during the course of journeys by air and have been given the force of law in Ireland under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, as amended. The provision regarding compensation for mental distress in these circumstances was restated by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965. Amendments Nos. 32a and 32b now propose to increase the maximum compensation of this type which may be awarded by a court in fatal air accidents to keep it in line with the new maximum for other fatal accidents provided in this section.</P>
    <P>The apparent aim of amendment No. 33 is to permit the courts to order payment under the head of mental distress up to the new limit in cases which are not determined until after the passing of the Act. This, in effect, means that the Deputy would, whether he realises it or not, actually increase retrospectively the liability of the defendants. A defendant whose case was not determined until after the passing of the Act would find himself liable not for £1,000, as was the law when the cause of action was accrued, but for anything up to the new limit. To give the provision such a retrospective effect would be objectionable on grounds of general principle.</P>
    <P>There would, of course, be consequences other than for defendants in such cases if the Deputy's amendment were accepted. Take the case of a plaintiff whose case is determined by a court on <Col N="55" /> the basis of the existing limit immediately before this Bill becomes law. He would be worse off than a plaintiff bereaved in the same accident but who delays taking action and subsequently has his case determined by reference to the new limit. What the law would in effect be doing would be rewarding the dilatory and punishing the prompt litigant. It is no harm in this context to point out once more the real nature of this provision. It is described as &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; for want of a better word. No amount of mere money, be it £5,000 or £50,000, can compensate the members of a family for the grief and distress which the death of one of them causes. All that it can hope to do is to act as a token acknowledgment of that grief and distress. That was the intention behind the 1961 provision.</P>
    <P>It is important also to note that the amount to be awarded for mental distress is determined by the judge and is over and above any damages awarded by the court for such quantifiable or approximately quantifiable heads as loss of potential or actual earnings, medical and funeral expenses. It is a misunderstanding of the real nature of the provision to associate it with in particular, any consideration of means or needs. These are elements which fall to be considered under other heads of damages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make. I am pleased that, since the Bill was first introduced, the Minister has agreed to increase the amount of money involved in this section by 50 per cent. This is a case where the Minister on one hand says the sum proposed is actually a gesture and is not meant to reflect a true assessment of the distress caused to people. At the same time, it obviously should have some relevance to some criteria. The sum of £1,000 in 1961, for example, if we look at the consumer price index or the economic indicators to which we have referred once or twice, we will see that the initial sum proposed, £5,000, was clearly inadequate, even in the context of the arguable inadequacy of £1,000 in 1961. At that time the consumer <Col N="56" /> price index, say at base £100 in 1961, would now be £571. In other words, the £5,000 initially proposed would have been less than the £1,000 in 1961 and, therefore, not alone did not represent an improvement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the time the Bill will come into operation. The thinking behind it is that at the time this Bill will come into operation, which is the relevant time, the sum involved will be less in real terms than the £1,000 in the Bill in 1961. Is that disputed?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I want to establish, first of all, that the initial proposal of the Minister was less in real terms than the proposal which was in the Bill. That was 20 years ago, in 1961. Therefore, throughout those 20 years we saw a dimunition in the value of that fairly meagre £1,000. Now the Minister proposes to increase it to £7,500 which is obviously a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in view of the fairly scant attention this clause has got during that time and in view of the fact that no opportunity was taken to increase that amount, it is reasonable to assume that it will be a long time before it is increased again. That is why we are asking for £10,000. I do not expect the Minister will be coming into the House in the near future asking that this sum be raised. I think it only reasonable that, even though it might be in concept a gesture of our concern at the distress which somebody suffers, that we make it a reasonable gesture. I ask the Minister to give a little bit extra because in two or three years' time the sum of £10,000, taking a figure of 15 per cent or 20 per cent for inflation, will not be very much out of tune with the figure of £1,000 in 1961 <Col N="57" /> which we are using as a base. We are not asking for a cosmic leap in terms of the amount of money involved.</P>
      <P>I think it important to mention another matter, although I do so somewhat gingerly. It arises in the context of amendment No. 33. Our concern is to try to ensure, in view of the accepted inadequacy and injustice of the present £1,000, that, although further anomalies or difficulties might be created, those actions recently commenced which had not yet been terminated would find that they would benefit from the Act when it came into operation&mdash;in other words, that any action which had been commenced before now or before the Act comes into operation would get the increased sum. I know there are difficulties about that and I will not push it too hard because there are people affected just prior to that who would feel aggrieved. But by virtue of the fact that this sum has been so outdated for so long, it is only reasonable that people who are now on the brink of getting an award would get something closer to its true value. I ask the Minister to give his usual respectful consideration to those points.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 28, I had questions tabled and answered in the House 18 months ago, because I felt it was a gross injustice to people who had suffered a tragic bereavement in their family and who only received a sum of £1,000 for mental distress, pain and suffering. I felt it an insult that this figure, which was fixed under the Civil Liability Act, 1961, had never been changed. I welcome the improvement in the situation and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>

      <P>There have been many Ministers in the intervening period who could have done it but they did not. I agree with Deputy Keating and I ask the Minister to consider a further amendment and bring the figure to £10,000. The loss of a member of the family is very serious for the family concerned. While <Col N="58" /> £7,500 is quite generous, I would have gone the full way because in many instances, the amount of money which is received is often quite small. Apart from the money being paid for mental distress, pain and suffering, £10,000 would be a tremendous help.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear in regard to section 28, subsection (2), which says it shall not have effect in relation to a cause of action that accrued before the commencement of this Act. I note the statement in the explanatory memorandum on section 31, that the remaining provisions will in the ordinary way commence on the passing of the legislation. I am not quite clear what the Minister means. Is it that, when the Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President, this section will apply to an accident that occurs the following morning as distinct from after a lapse of six months?</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to consider going the full way on it. This matter has been going for years. I raised it at a time when I thought it would be met. It has been met now, but I think the figure should be raised to £10,000.</P>

      <P>In 1961 and for years after that as a practitioner of the law I had great trouble endeavouring to console next of kin with a ceiling of compensation of £1,000 in most cases. Next of kin of deceased persons complained bitterly that that was the ceiling which legislation thought could be put on their grief as a result of the death of a loved one. I remember the debate in 1961 and part of the argument at that time was that you had to take into account that even if an accident had not happened or a wrong had not been done, somebody might have <Col N="59" /> to suffer the loss of a dear one anyway. Obviously if you are the survivor you have to suffer the loss of a dear one and that was taken into account in fixing this ceiling of £1,000. It is a shame that we as legislators have allowed 20 years to pass by before adjusting this figure, but this is not the only sin of omission which we as a parliament have committed down the years. I would love to think that we will soon arrive at the day when we can have some omnibus legislation which will index to some acceptable figure and update the value of compensation payments made after due deliberation of this Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider what we do every year, for instance, in relation to the ceiling of eligibility for benefit and liability for payment under the social welfare and health codes. The Minister makes an order which in due course has to be confirmed here in the House. We do that deliberately in order to make an annual adjustment of figures where we are concerned that the value of benefits should not be eroded. Why do we not do it in cases of this kind? The Minister will probably agree with me that that would be the ideal. It will be argued that the only reason it is not done is the legislative time that it takes to do it. However, were the order to be made on an annual basis it would not necessarily have to be debated in the House on all occasions. I would like to think that even this Bill could be amended&mdash;and I urge on the Minister to amend it&mdash;in such a way as to enable an order to be made and laid on the table of the House to adjust this figure from time to time in accordance with some acceptable index, and if any Member of the House wants to challenge the order it should be left open to him to have the matter debated and, if necessary, amended or rejected as the case might be. Knowing now that through sins of omission we neglected this area for 20 years, some responsibility lies on us to try to find some means whereby the figure can be adjusted more frequently. I am an optimist but I do not anticipate that inflation is going to come to an end over the next 20 years. Even if inflation were to <Col N="60" /> get back to the halcyon days of 1961 there would still be a continuing erosion and the burden of work on this and all other democratic parliaments is increasing, not decreasing. So if it took 20 years, from 1961 to today, to make this amendment I fear that it will be our grandchildren who will be making the amendments some time after the year 2000, and that will be a serious injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a few brief points in relation to what Deputy Ryan has stated. It is the intention constantly to review this limit. I am informed that the present day equivalent of the £1,000 provided under the 1961 Act would be about £5,800 and the proposed £7,500 is in excess of that. It is also fair to state that this is not compensation as such for distress suffered by somebody who loses a relative. No matter now near or far the relative is I do not think that in monetary terms the person can be compensated.</P>
      <P>The question of retrospection was mentioned. I have already stated regarding the defendant whose case was not to be determined before the passing of this Bill when the figure would stand at the 1961 amount of £1,000, that retrospection if it were to provide for the new limit would impose an increase of liabilities on the defendant and it would be unfair and unjust to have it included.</P>

      <P>You can argue, say, two-and-a-half years, to come to a minimum. For the next two-and-a-half years under this section people are still going to continue to be awarded £1,000. The reference the Minister makes to the constant review is presumably precisely what was said in 1961 when the thing was introduced. I do not see any way in which we can honestly avoid the conclusion that this sum is going to remain on the books for many years. I would argue that the very first time it comes into effect will be probably three to five years' time and inflation, running as it is present at 18, 19 and 20 per cent, could very well mean that the sum involved at the first date of operation would be no better &mdash; or no worse &mdash; than the £1,000 was 20 years ago and will not bring about the improvement that the Minister believes it will. From that date on it will continue to decrease in value. I do not see any reason why there should be a limit on it at all. If we are talking about mental cruelty we should consider whether the judge should be entitled to assess a number of factors and make an order or settlement based on real factors rather than this gesture we keep on talking about. Let us at least treat the person suffering from the loss of a next of kin with some dignity and respect and give such person something that is at least meaningful. The Minister has come more than half way on this and I would be very grateful if he would come that little bit further which would mean that for some number of years at least that figure would remain genuinely useful and would not be eroded immediately with inflation, as it will if we go ahead with this figure which is little more than an updating of the 1961 figure and which by the time it comes into effect will be as that was. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to consider adding an extra dimension to it.</P>

    <P>This amendment increases the number of ordinary Circuit Court judges from 11 to 12 and assigns the new post to the Dublin Circuit, as mentioned by the Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate. At present, the number of permanent Circuit Court judges authorised by statute is <Col N="64" /> 12 &mdash; the President and 11 ordinary judges, of whom four are assigned to the Dublin Circuit. In addition, there is one temporary judge who has held office since 1978. The present volume of business of the Circuit Court shows no sign of falling off and commitments which must be met by the existing complement of judges warrant the creation of an additional permanent post. It has been noted that the new post created by this amendment is to cater for an already existing situation and does not prejudice, in any way, the provision of additional staff or judiciary to cater for any extra workload falling on the District and Circuit Courts as a result of the jurisdiction proposals in the Bill. The Minister has already indicated his commitment to the creation of such new posts when they become necessary and I reiterate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but I want to clarify a point. This new section proposes to appoint one additional judge to the Dublin Circuit. It is not intended to deal with any increase in the amount of litigation which may occur as a result of this legislation. It is intended to deal with an existing situation. The Minister for Justice has already given a commitment, which I have reiterated here this morning in speaking to the new section, that whatever numbers are required to deal with any increase in the work-load as a result of the coming into operation of this legislation, the judges will be appointed, if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Act could facilitate the appointment, although there are those who differ from what the Minister has just said. I am not sure where the judges are sometimes appointed. Is it not commonsense that the increase in jurisdiction imposed in relation to the Circuit Court will mean extra work? Is the Minister not aware that the Circuit Court is presently the most efficient tier of the courts, by virtue of the fact that these good men work themselves very hard and quite late into the evening? I do not understand what the Minister is waiting for. Is it the case that, by some magical process, extra work will be handled by the Circuit Court <Col N="66" /> without the need of extra staff &mdash; not just extra judges but extra staff?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not make these appointments in anticipation of a workload which has not established itself.

All that we are doing in this section is giving an indication in advance of our preparedness to provide the necessary number of judges for the Circuit Court when the occasion requires it.

      <P>(1) Subject to subsection (2) and (3) of this section, where a person charged with an indictable offence (in this sect ion referred to as &lsquo;an accused') is sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court sitting other than within the Dublin Circuit, an application by the prosecutor or the accused to the judge of the Circuit Court before whom the accused is triable to have the trial transferred to the Circuit Court sitting within the Dublin Circuit shall&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) in case the party making the application, not less than seven days <Col N="69" /> before making it, notified the accused or the prosecutor, as the case may be, of the application, be granted, and</P>
    <P>(b) in any other case, in the discretion of the judge, be either granted or refused, and the decision to grant or refuse the application shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    <P>(2) Where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) two or more accused are sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court sitting other than within the Dublin Circuit and it is proposed to try them together, and</P>
    <P>(b) an application by one or more, but not all, of the accused ander subsection (1) of this section is granted,</P>
    <P>an application, without notice to the accused, by the prosecutor to the judge who granted the application to have the trial of one or more of the remaining accused transferred to the Circuit Court sitting within the Dublin Circuit shall be granted.</P>
    <P>(3) Where there are less than seven days between the date on which the accused is sent forward for trial and the date of commencement of the trial, an application under subsection (1) of this section shall be granted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the Second Stage debate on this Bill, the Minister indicated that he was actively considering how best to change the law to permit the transfer of criminal trials from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court. These amendments are as a result of that consideration. The present position is, broadly, that, by virtue of section 6 of the Courts Act, 1964, if either party in a trial for an indictable offence in the Circuit Court gives seven days' notice to the other that he intends to apply for proceedings to be transferred to the Central Criminal Court, the judge must grant that application. If the seven days' notice is not given, the judge has discretion.</P>

      <P>I understand circuses have not sought any financial assistance from the Arts Council but are asking the Taoiseach to introduce legislation to ensure the continuance of the circuses. As the Taoiseach is well aware, they have a proud record of service to the Irish people over the winter period and there is a great fear that both their livelihood and their art will disappear if the submission they have made to the Arts Council is not covered by legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the meetings which I held last year with the chairmen and chief executives of the main State-sponsored bodies involved in economic development, a number of developments have taken place. A subgroup of chairmen and chief executives have been meeting to identify ways in which the contribution of the State-sponsored <Col N="72" /> sector in general to economic development can best be increased. They consider that opportunities exist for greater enterprise on the part of State-sponsored bodies including the increased involvement of State bodies in technological industry. Their preliminary findings have been drawn to the attention of the relevant Departments and State agencies, which have been requested to examine and bring forward at an early date development proposals for implementation. This process is a continuing one and the possibilities for additional sustainable growth and employment in the main State-sponsored bodies will continue to have priority in the dealings which individual Ministers have with their relevant State-sponsored bodies and in my meetings with the combined chairmen and chief executives of these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>After the nine month period of gestation which has taken place since this matter originally arose, that reply is a very general one and does not offer any prospect of specific developments. It has only reached the stage of preparing things in Departments and I would ask the Taoiseach has he any expectation that concrete steps will actually be taken in the immediate future or will the matter remain in this bureaucratic maze indefinitely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is fair to say it is in a bureaucratic maze. The chairmen and chief executives are satisfied that the right way to proceed is for each Minister to relate directly to the State-sponsored bodies under his jurisdiction and press them &mdash; they do not need to be pressed &mdash; or invite them to put forward specific proposals, particularly proposals related to advanced technology, and that process is well under way in the Departments and State-sponsored bodies concerned and they are actively engaged in bringing forward proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to a particular report that had been drawn up by the chairmen and chief executives of the companies. In view of the considerable expertise acquired by the Oireachtas Committee on semi-State bodies, may I ask the Taoiseach if he will give an undertaking now that that report will be circulated to the Oireachtas Committee &mdash; it is an all-party committee &mdash; to facilitate the work of the Taoiseach, who is undoubtedly a very busy man, and enable the committee to look collectively at the possible potential of the combined State sector on the basis of this report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if that is exactly a function of that particular committee. My understanding is that the function of the committee is to examine how any one particular State company is discharging its own particular mandate from the point of view of efficiency, accountancy and so on. I am not sure that this particular committee would have any functions in regard to an extension of its activities or the undertaking of additional development proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this committee have been able to examine with considerable success the effectiveness to date of semi-State bodies and that therefore they could perhaps be in a better position to evaluate future proposals for investment than a closeted State Department or a Minister in private and that, while it may not be their function at present, they could provide the House and the State with a very beneficial service? If I am not wrong they have already made such recommendations in some of the reports they have published to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly any proposals which the committee would put forward will of course be taken up by the appropriate Ministers and State bodies. I can see the philosophy behind the Deputy's suggestion but I am not sure that it would not be adding another bureaucratic obstacle to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;process. One of the problems that chief executives and chairmen of State bodies put forward is that very often they cannot get decisions quickly enough from Government Departments. Much of our attention at present is directed to that particular area to try to ensure that the examination of proposals on either side, whether in the State company or in the Department, are expedited. It might well be that bringing <Col N="75" /> the committee the Deputy has in mind into the picture might not necessarily improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Labour Party welcome the view that has now progressed to the extent that we look at the entire State sector together as one collective entity and not as extensions of individual Departments, and in view of the fact that that view has been accepted in principle, would the Taoiseach not concede that the only body so established to look at the entirety of the State sector is this Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and it has examined in detail individual companies perhaps with better success than individual Departments and that accordingly this report of the Committee to which the Taoiseach has referred and which exists could most usefully be examined without prejudice to any future decision that a Sovereign Government might take and that there would be no bureaucracy involved in it.</P>

      <P>Where a State-sponsored body has been established under statute the approval of the Minister under whose aegis the particular State-sponsored body operates, together with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, is generally required for its superannuation scheme. Where a State-sponsored body has been established under the Companies Acts the relevant articles of association generally contain analogous provisions. The question of whether a formal fund should be established in relation to such schemes is considered to be primarily a matter within the operational discretion of the State-sponsored body in question.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has statutory functions in regard to the pension funds of certain State-sponsored bodies which come under the aegis of other Ministers as follows. The investments in which the pension funds of CIE, RTE and the ESB may hold funds require the approval of the Minister for Finance if these investments are not specified in the instruments establishing the funds. Similarly, the investments of the Bord na Móna pension funds, if these investments are not specified in the instrument establishing the funds, require the authority of the Minister for Energy, given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I should be very surprised if it is. Perhaps I might test the Minister. The answer is that 40 per cent of the food consumed in this country last year consisted of imports.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person claims to have sent in an application for a house improvement grant of which there is no record in the Department I can only accept that it was received if conclusive evidence of its receipt, such as an official acknowledgement, is produced. The precise number of cases where such evidence has been furnished, although the applications had not been recorded, is estimated to be less than 50. Several times this number have claimed either directly or through public representatives that applications were sent in which are not on record but they have been unable to produce conclusive evidence to this effect and, having regard to the Housing Regulations, 1980, cannot therefore be considered for the payment of grants.</P>
      <P>Before the final date for the receipt of applications all possible care was taken to ensure that each application would be individually date stamped on receipt and then recorded and acknowledged. In any case where papers are mislaid after the application has been recorded, the applicant's entitlement to a grant is not affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>When an application is received in my Department it is recorded and sent out to the inspector involved. Then if it is lost in the post or mislaid we will still have it indexed in the Department. The Department will then make the necessary arrangements to make up a new file. If the applicant is entitled to the grant he will not be at any loss provided he meets the necessary criteria laid down under the regulations for the said grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agrees. In view of the fact that there are still a number of cases in dispute&mdash;the Minister says less than 50&mdash;would he be prepared to accept the sworn word on affidavit made by an applicant that he or she had made application prior to the closing date as being valid evidence of that application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is precluded from paying a house improvement grant by article 14 of the Housing Regulations, 1980, unless the application for the grant was received by the Minister on or before 1 February 1980 or, where the application was received after 1 February 1980, verification is furnished that the application was sent by registered post or by letter postmarked in sufficient time to permit normal postal delivery by that date. Accordingly, any person who claims to have sent in an application which is not accepted as having been received cannot now qualify for a grant.</P>

      <P>I am not clear what information the Deputies require having regard to the fact that local authorities have no commitments in relation to this scheme of grants. If, however, the question relates to the outstanding grant commitments in each local authority area, the position is that records are not kept in my Department in a manner that would enable that information to be provided.</P>
      <P>A provision of £19.5 million has been made for the payment of house improvement and solid-fuel grants accruing for payment in 1981 where the work is satisfactorily completed and payment is claimed by 31 March 1981.

      <P>Is the House correct in assuming that the Minister can give us the gross total payments in relation to house improvement grants and solid fuel grants to a considerable degree of accuracy, having counted to 74,835 house improvement grants, but that he cannot give a breakdown on a yearly basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a breakdown because there may have been partial payments of grants. In some cases an instalment may be paid and there is a carry-over to another year.</P>

In that case a grant of £200 was allocated in February 1977. I can confirm that the file in this case had gone for inspection as the Deputy was informed on 26 January 1978. Following the inspection, the grant was revised to £600 since the work had not commenced. The applicant was so informed on 23 May 1978.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 30 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their sixth interim report, and again in their twelfth interim report, recognised that this effectively absolute right to transfer from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court was in need of curtailment. The President of the High Court has also expressed great concern at the provision. While the ostensible justification for this law is to provide an alternative location in the event that a local jury might be biased either for or against an accused person, many applications for transfer are made for much more pragmatic reasons than this. It may suit a party's legal advisers better to have the trial held in Dublin, or it may suit an accused person to take advantage of the long delays in the High Court generally to, as it were, put off the evil day.</P>
      <P>While there will still be a need to offer a choice of jury to people accused of indictable offences, and indeed the prosecution, no end of justice is served by transfer up to a higher court. In cases outside of Dublin it is true that transfers to the Central Criminal Court mean that the jury will be drawn from a panel less likely to be influenced by local prejudice. But the same would apply in a transfer to another Circuit Court venue. In Dublin cases, as the law stands, there is no benefit by way of non-local juries to be gained by transfer to the Central Criminal Court, as juries for both courts are drawn from the same population base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said already that no end of justice <Col N="132" /> is served by a transfer upwards from the Circuit Court. In fact such transfers result in a serious disservice to the ends of justice. It is a startling and disturbing fact that over 80 per cent of the business of the Central Criminal Court over the last three legal years has been work transferred from the Circuit Court, a court which by law has full jurisdiction to hear such cases. The Central Criminal Court was set up to deal with crimes of the utmost seriousness but its capacity to deal with such matters is being seriously diluted by the sheer volume of cases transferred up to it. It is no mere cliché to say that justice delayed is justice denied. This is exactly what is happening to those accused of serious crimes. There is a delay of about seven months between setting down and hearing of a case in the Central Criminal Court and this delay is directly attributable to the volume of transfers from the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>What then are the options? Clearly one that has been the subject of serious consideration is the complete abolition of the right to transfer substituted by a discretion to be exercised by the Circuit Court judge where he was of the opinion that there was a serious possibility of bias or prejudice on the part of a local jury. This is not proposed at present, in part because it might not be considered fair to the House to introduce such a radical departure to existing law by way of an amendment to a Bill which deals principally with civil jurisdiction matters. I would like to make it clear, however, that the option still remains open in the future and if the situation warrants it we may well find ourselves debating just such a proposal in the context of a future Bill.</P>
    <P>Given that a less radical modification would be more appropriate at this stage, what is now proposed is that the transfers should no longer be from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin but to the Circuit Court in Dublin. This right of transfer will be subject to precisely the same conditions, such as time limits for notices to the other party, as at present. This proposal will enable the parties in a country case to avoid a trial before a local jury. Consideration has been given to a number of other <Col N="133" /> means of satisfying the requirement of transfer out of the original court. The possibility of transfer to any other circuit to be decided by the judge has been examined and, indeed, it has not yet been ruled out as a subject for future legislation. However, there are practical problems of pure organisation which would be involved in setting up a system to enable a judge to determine which circuit should take the case and obtain the consent of the judge of that circuit. In the limited time available it would not be feasible to solve these problems. The possibility of permitting transfers from Dublin to another circuit was ruled out because of the possibility that individual Circuit Court judges might be unfairly burdened.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the section now proposed with the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the chairman of the Courts Committee and the Director of Public Prosecutions and I am satisfied that what is proposed will meet the requirements of justice and will remedy and injustice caused by the practical effects of the existing provision on the High Court lists. I am also satisfied that the Dublin Circuit will be able to absorb any increased workload arising from this proposal. As I have said before, however, the proposal before us today is not necessarily the last word on the matter. It is as a result of the operation of this provision. If I find it necessary to propose further changes in the law I will not hesitate to bring a Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously the first time one has had the opportunity to hear the Minister on this very important section and it behoves us to spend a few moments teasing out precisely what is implied by it. I gather from what the Minister said that he recognises, as was mentioned on the Second Stage debate, that there is a problem in relation to the operation of the Circuit Court's criminal jurisdiction, that is, the fundamental right to a trial by jury of an accused person which is in itself essential and fundamental and should not be tampered with. There are times when this right is <Col N="134" /> particularly appropriately obtained as, for example, when local circumstances or other reasons might prejudice the fair trial. There are, however, strong grounds for thinking that the procedure presently available is being to some degree abused and that there are some accused persons who transfer not because they fear the existence of prejudice on the part of the jury or any of the reasons which underlie the need for the transfer or the opportunity presented by it but because they are aware of and disapprove of the sentencing policy of the Circuit Court judge involved which, of course, brings in another dimension to all this, that is, as Deputy Fitzpatrick was saying earlier on in this debate, that there are certain judges that we might call defendants' judges and others who have different types of known dispensations in relation to how they treat the people who come before them. Is the Minister proposing in this section to abolish the absolute right to transfer? Is that what I understood him to say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is provision in the section for an application either by the prosecution or by the accused and either party, on giving seven days' notice to the other party, can avail the provision which provides for the right of transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister see that the section will bring about an improvement, if the essential situation, the right of the accused to transfer, is as untouched as it was prior to this? Presumably every accused person who would, allegedly, abuse such a situation will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The right of transfer will now be from the rural Circuit Court to the Dublin Circuit Court. There is no right of transfer from the Dublin Circuit Court to another Circuit Court in Dublin. <Col N="135" /> The right obtains only in county areas: someone from Monaghan, Roscommon or some other place may transfer to a Dublin Circuit Court for the reasons I have outlined. The whole purpose is to ensure greater opportunities for seeking a remedy and for expediting the hearing of these cases by reducing the pressure that exists in the High Court at present.</P>

      <P>In relation to the position of the jury, in Dublin there is a much wider panel of jurors to be selected from than anywhere else, but it is the same process. The view we have expressed here is that by transfer to the Dublin Circuit Court we are affording people an opportunity to be tried elsewhere, because they might feel that there was a certain bias or attitude prevailing amoong jurors in rural Circuit Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine in itself. What about the position of a person who might wish, due to the circumstances surrounding their alleged crime, their apprehension, incarceration and so on in the Dublin context, to be removed from their local environment? I can see how the need is met for somebody living outside Dublin who may feel that, because of their locale, prejudice might arise. They are now given a trial which will be independent of that, but what about a person in Dublin who feels similarly about a trial in Dublin? How is that concern and fear to be met by somebody living in Dublin? I appreciate that the grounds for such a fear might not be as great, but they can exist. I am anxious about creating a double standard, depending on where you come from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>A superficial analysis of the section now proposed will indicate that a distinction is being introduced between persons returned for trial in and <Col N="136" /> outside the Dublin area. On closer examination of both the existing and proposed provisions it is clear that the distinction already exists. Transferring from the Circuit Court in Dublin to the Central Criminal Court under existing law does not avoid a jury drawn from a common pool which both courts share. That is something which is very relevant and important in relation to a reply to the Deputy's question. Thus removing the right of upward transfer does not worsen the position of the Dublin person who is accused. The distinction is, in any event, more apparent than real. The area covered by the Dublin Circuit Court contains in or around one third of the population of the State. It contains, as does any modern capital city, a representative cross-section of the various traditions of life as well as urban dwellers whose background is firmly rooted in city life. It contains a high proportion of people with strong links with rural areas, provincial towns and villages. A jury drawn from such a dense and cosmopolitan base cannot be regarded as local and is less likely to suffer from the natural local prejudice or bias towards or against the accused which might occur concerning a crime in a rural area or a provincial town where greater opportunities exist for knowing more about each other and each other's business.</P>

      <P>I am a little surprised that the Minister has introduced this amendment. This provision was not in the original Bill and there is no note about it in the explanatory memorandum. I would like to know why the Minister suddenly decided to bring in this amendment. The Bill we are dealing with is mainly a civil Bill, a family Bill, and does not have criminal jurisdiction. When did it strike the Minister and the senior officials in the Department of Justice to bring in this amendment on Committee Stage without having made any reference to it before? The amendment has been tabled properly &mdash; I am not questioning that and it is in order &mdash; but it strikes me as strange and unusual to bring a matter relating to very serious criminal cases in to what is basically a civil matter. I should like to know what type of indictable offences will now be heard in the Circuit Court. What other types of cases has the Minister in mind to go before the Central Criminal Court? I presume the Minister intends keeping on the Central Criminal Court to deal with cases.</P>

It is only in very special times such as we are in at the moment and have been for some time that the Special Criminal Court is the place where the type of criminal case that the Deputy has referred to, armed robbery, is being heard, and the sentences provided for in that court and the Circuit Court are the sentences prescribed by law. There is no change in that situation and this section does not intend to change that. We are dealing with a facility to handle a very heavy workload in the High Court. I think I mentioned that the time at which I decided that it was desirable and necessary to have this new section included in the Bill at this time is not relevant.

      <P>Amendment Agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 30, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;30.&mdash;(1) The Minister may, by regulation, at regular intervals and not less than every 3 years after the enactment of this Act, vary the amounts specified in sections 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 28 of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2) In fixing the amount to be specified in subsection (1) of this section the Minister shall take into account the variation in the Consumer Price Index in the period for which the regulation is to be made and shall consult the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>(3) A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to a new section which we wish to insert prior to section 30. The essence of this is to try to bring about some sense of realism into the costings, prices, fining policy and all monetary aspects of this legislation. I consider it nonsensical that we get inconsistency about the standards of law and justice in our courts day in and day out by virtue of the ludicrous, outdated, inflation-eroded figures that are contained in our Acts of Parliament. I do not believe that the mechanism of the ministerial order, which is better than none I suppose, or the mechanism of new legislation are <Col N="141" /> appropriate to such updating, the former because ministerial orders are usually extracted unwillingly from a Minister only after he has been bludgeoned into some kind of submission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem we have over here. Secondly, new legislation is, to use a cliché, pie in the sky and because of the way this House does its business I do not know how any legislation gets enacted. It is so protracted, and I suppose we are all party to that. As long as we have this linear approach to Bills we are going to have a log-jam of legislation and I do not know how we are going to get new legislation to up-date the figures involved in this. I defy anyone to say that it is not common sense that the Minister may by regulation at regular intervals, and not less than every three years after this Act comes into power, vary the amounts specified in sections 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 28 of the Act. I could say in parenthesis that just yesterday we heard a demand from the Garda Representative Authority for updating in relation to fines some of which are as low as 5s which have been left there because nobody has bothered to up-date them over the years. That is a disservice to everybody, to the gardaí who are trying to do the job, to this House and to those people who wish to accord with reasonable standards of law and order. I ask then that a mechanism be put into this and every other Bill to remedy this. Deputy Ryan before lunch made a comment that perhaps some omnibus kind of legislation could be introduced into this which would allow a Minister to deal with this aspect of all legislation. Variations of these amounts would be commonsense variations to take account of inflation which at present, as the Minister knows, give or take a point or two, is running up to 20 per cent, certainly a lot more than it should be, and it seems it will continue to run at that level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We will let the Minister off that one. We will not embarrass him by talking about inflation at great length. However, regardless of which Government are in power, it is likely that inflation is going to continue to erode the real values provided in the Bill. In subsection (2) of the section which we propose should be added we make the commonsense suggestion that in fixing these new amounts the Minister would take into account the variation in the CPI for the period in which the regulation is to be made and should consult the Chief Justice and President of the High Court with a view to the Minister, as the elected representative of the Government and the people of this country, being able sensibly and sensitively to make adjustments to the legislation without the necessity of dragging other legislation through this House and embroiling everybody in a long and tedious debate about something that is only commonsense to the average citizen. If a figure is seen as just at a point in time in the context of a particular Bill, then to continue that concept of justice applying to it, that figure should relate to the economic context of the day and should be regularly updated automatically without making controversy and without demur from anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would be entrusted with this authority and if people were generally dissatisfied with his stewardship in this direction, they would have the option of a course of action which would allow them to comment, favourably or otherwise, on the way he did the job. In that section, thirdly, we ask that a draft <Col N="143" /> of every regulation proposed to be made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until the resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House. That in itself is a very good safeguard and one which might meet the objections of the Minister for Justice who, when he was asked, via a Dáil question, about the possibility of introducing this flexibility and taking this authority unto himself, made the point that the fixing of such fines or of such monetary limits was of sufficient importance for the whole parliament to be involved. He had another reason of somewhat similar weight which eludes me at the moment. Both reasons were almost facetious.</P>
    <P>We should be concerned here with matters of substance, of policy, of fundamental concern, not matters of updating fines to relate to the consumer price index which should be an automatic, administrative procedure. It is a joke to pretend that much of our legislation is just and fair when the amounts of money involved are derisory, having been long since outdated. This gives an incentive to those who have no high regard for the law to carry on wantonly. Take, for example, the Planning Acts. Breaches of these warrant a fine which is a joke.</P>
    <P>I am making the case very strongly that this section, or some section which embodies the sense of this proposed section, would be enacted by the Minister to take into his hands the authority and responsibility for adjusting all references in this Bill to monetary limits in line with the prevailing economic indicators. We would then get consistent standards of justice, where fines or any monetary aspect of this Bill came into play. That would give consistency of justice meaning that there would not be good economic times for getting awards or bad economic times, or that the farther away one got from the enactment of the Bill the more jocose and derisory the actual award became. For example, the stress money we were talking about this morning is an example of one of the sections referred to here. That would automatically be <Col N="144" /> updated and index-linked. We are not looking for anything revolutionary. We are looking for commonsense applied to legislation. One of the by-products of the Bill would be the streamlining to some degree of the work of this House in relation to at least this Bill. I would be happy to see this concept applied to all legislation so that we would not have to debate new fine limits, award limits or monetary limits of any kind because they would be automatic except in the rare cases where some basic revision or rethinking has gone on which indicated that there should now be major changes in that respect. I hope I am making myself clear to the Minister. It is nothing more than commonsense. I hope that the Minister will accept that and endeavour to embody our request in the legislation. I am not particularly concerned about our amendment which may not be the best technical drafting of the proposal. However, it embodies what I believe to be a commonsense approach to the legislation and to this Bill in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new section would permit increases in certain jurisdictions of the District and Circuit Courts by way of Ministerial regulation. While I accept the reasoning behind the amendment in so far as it is aimed at doing things more efficiently, there are a number of objections, both of principle and practice, to the course proposed. First, it is my view, and the view of many Members of both sides of the House, that the setting of jurisdiction limits in the District and Circuit Courts is too important a matter to be left to Ministerial order and is appropriate to an Act of the Oireachtas alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts have a very special position under the Constitution which would make changes in the scope and extent of their jurisdictions a matter which should be decided only by the Dáail and the Seanad. I recognise that the Deputy, in the final subsection of his amendment, proposes that such changes should not take effect until a resolution approving them has been passed by both Houses. Whatever advantage by way of time is to be gained by such a procedure over and <Col N="145" /> above the introduction of a Bill to deal with the matter, this would not, in my view, compensate for the Bill procedure which affords Deputies and Senators an opportunity of suggesting amendments to the detail of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>The facility for Deputies and Senators is particularly important when, as in the present case, the new jurisdiction limits do much more than merely compensate for increases in the cost of living since they were last set. Substantial, real increases are being given to the lower courts. These will have the effect of changing the relationships between the courts of first instance so that they will be better able to reflect the changing role which is required of them in society. The necessity to alter jurisdiction limits periodically to account for shifts in money values affords an ideal opportunity for reviewing this changing role and can be followed by a Bill to implement both types of changes. The provision on the lines proposed by Deputy Keating would tend to fix the jurisdiction limits of the courts and the ratio set by this Bill and permit changes based only on the consumer price index. The proposal would not obviate the need for reappraisal of the ratios from time to time and alteration of those ratios would, in any event, require legislation.</P>
    <P>Apart from these general objections to the section proposed by the Deputy, and leaving aside any technical points of drafting which arise out of this, there are one or two details on which I would like to comment. First, tying jurisdiction limits to the consumer price index in the way proposed by Deputy Keating would result in some extraordinary figures with fractional amounts of pounds. Secondly, while in any review of jurisdiction matters it is important to consult with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Keating omits the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court from the list of persons to be consulted. After all, it is in their courts that the effect of the Deputy's proposed restrictions would be most felt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing which the Minister <Col N="146" /> has said answers the essence of the proposed amendment. His arguments are twofold &mdash; first, that if there be a change in the jurisdiction of the courts it should be a matter for discussion in this House, I would agree with him, if there were to be truthfully a change in the jurisdiction. However, the changing of a figure of £5,000 to £7,000 outside of a parliamentary debate merely to take into account inflation, the updating of costs and so on, simply cannot accurately be described as a change in jurisdiction, if the jurisdiction is defined as being the true cost or the true value of the money at that particular time.</P>
      <P>I would not suggest that the Minister, or anybody outside the House, should have power to make major changes in legislation without going through the parliamentary process, but that has not been suggested. What has been suggested, no more and no less, is that we should take account of the fall in the value of money. That is all. Jurisdiction, <i>per se,</i> is not affected. It is simply recognising that the figure in itself is not the true jurisdiction. The true jurisdiction is that figure in the context of other economic indicators. That figure should remain more or less a constant; that is the argument. That constant should be automatic, otherwise we get different standards of justice. Someone who is today awarded a judgment which, let us say, is X times a certain economic prevailing value will find that in two, three or four years time, unless this section is accepted, that value has dropped.</P>
      <P>I argue strongly that on no two days in the courts do we get a consistent standard of justice, merely because we are too sluggish and too tardy in this House to accept what is nothing more than good economic sense. I am not asking for a change in jurisdiction but for an honest recognition that values change, week in week out, and in the last number of years in this country they have changed very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants recognition of that, I will certainly give it. I stated, at the outset, that there is much reasoned argument in what the Deputy <Col N="147" /> is saying. However, there are other practicalities which we must consider. One is a constitutional matter and the special position of the courts in this country. What the Deputy says may have some justification for consideration, but application of it in law might be very difficult indeed, because of the constitutional situation. I doubt if we could proceed to make the type of change proposed which, on the one hand, would be an interference with a court system and court procedure constitutionally protected since the founding of the State.</P>

No one has suggested any interference with that process and all I am suggesting is that if a particular figure is adjudged to be appropriate in 1980 it should not take lobbies and battalions of protest to Leinster House and numerous representations and the rise and fall of different Governments before that figure is once again in the fullness of time updated. I am making a strong case and I am supported in that case by the Garda Síochána and other interested parties who say that the current values of fines are derisory in many respects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish a principle whereby automatically, and without tedious debate inevitable in this House, such fines can be increased by some process or mechanism which is fair and just and does not require 148 good men and women, appropriate officials and the whole trappings of Parliament to recognise the simple fact that the pound today is not worth what it was in 1970 and will not be worth in 1990 what it is worth today. Mechanism can be introduced to do what I am asking. I do not care what mechanism it is. We have gone to the trouble of suggesting a particular one here. I am not tied to this if the Minister has a better one. A new Bill is not the way, because that would be a case of &ldquo;live horse&rdquo; and we will simply not get it. That is so far removed from reality it just will not happen and the Minister knows that in his heart of hearts. We certainly know it. It would also be unnecessarily cumbersome and unfruitful. However, even that is not being offered to us in some instances here.</P>

      <P>In the preparation of this Bill and this particular section &mdash; the Deputy will be delighted to know this &mdash; very close examination and scrutiny was given to this particular matter. What the Deputy seeks was considered inappropriate for two reasons. With the best intentions and the best will in the world we could not, and cannot hope to bring about something in acknowledgment of the Deputy's pleas which would be reasonable. But the inherent importance of the issue, many would say, justifies the full attention of Parliament itself acting through the legislative process. That was one reason. A second reason was the special constitutional position of the courts, which arguably makes it inappropriate for Parliament to seek to delegate to any other authority the right or power to determine the level of jurisdiction of particular courts and, quite candidly, of the two that was singularly the most difficult one.</P>

All I am asking is that we recognise automatically and without full parliamentary debate that a sum fixed in a certain year, which is in that year seen to be just, will simply graduate into degrees of injustice unless it is automatically updated. There is no interference with the true jurisdiction. I am sure it is the Minister's concern that there should not be, but there is nevertheless a recognition right throughout the country that to fix a limit, as we did earlier today, in relation to mental distress and pretend that that limit will be fair in ten or 20 year's time is nonsense. That must be admitted by the Minister and the Minister must therefore have some mechanism where by the figure can be updated to avoid injustice. That is all I am asking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 31, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31. &mdash;(1) This Act shall not come into operation until the Minister for Justice shall make a declaration enunciating that Court personnel, facilities and services are adequate to ensure the working of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) The Minister for Justice in making <Col N="152" /> a declaration under subsection (1) of this section shall consult with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>(3) As soon as may be after the making of such a declaration, the Minister for Justice shall cause it to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section is one that we have been hinting at throughout the debate. Its effect, if accepted, would be to ensure that this Act does not come into operation until the Minister for Justice shall make a declaration that court personnel, facilities and services are adequate to ensure the working of the Act; secondly, that the Minister in making a declaration under subsection (1) of the section shall consult the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court; and, thirdly, as soon as may be after the making of such a declaration the Minister for Justice shall cause it to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> We propose this new section because many of our courts are kips, hovels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They are places which, if they were not in public ownership, would undoubtedly have been condemned. I shall try not to repeat much of what we said earlier about the propriety of dealing with family law cases in courts that I could name which do not have a consultation room, seeing, according to the Bill now introduced, the future of a child of eight, nine or ten years of age being debated under an umbrella in the rain outside the court or in a bar across the road or in a car, places where in some cases the legal representatives of one party or the other had to bring in cardboard to try to stop the rain coming through the ceiling, where justices not usually the most provocative of men have gone on record as describing the conditions in which they have to work as disgraceful&mdash;in short, environments which . <Col N="153" /> are inimical to standards of justice which we consider appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is not as if we were unaware of this; if we are unaware of it we must be asleep. I should like the Minister to take a little time to visit, if necessary with some of ourselves, some of the court facilities we refer to. He should look, for example, at the Children's Court, which has long been a subject of abuse. Without exaggeration, it rivals on occasion, depending on the atmosphere prevailing and the number of cases, the Black Hole of Calcutta. It is not a place in which I would want any child about whom I knew or indeed any child at all to have to spend very long. We know that sometimes circumstances arise where cases, particularly in the District Court, have to be dealt with rapidly. I wonder to what extent the appalling conditions in some of those courts contribute to rough and ready justice being administered. That is no reflection on the people involved, but simply an understanding that we work best in reasonable conditions. If conditions are such as to impact detrimentally on standards of justice or the administration of law in the court&mdash;I submit they are&mdash;we do justice itself a disservice. We have an immediate obligation to allocate whatever resources are necessary to bring about improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not wish to be fobbed off with the answer that I am talking about hundreds of thousands of pounds; I am not. The idea of the court as a vast hall with columns in front and steps up which one walks and where one is usually dealt with deferentially in hushed tones is I believe, something out of the past. I see no reason why a local community building cannot be a court, or a school classroom in certain circumstances, or why we could not use badly under-utilised public buildings all over the country. All we are looking for is decent standards for the unfortunate clients who daily have to parade through these courts, the personnel who have to work in them daily and for the men and women&mdash;hopefully more and more women&mdash;we expect to administer judicial commonsense and sound judgment. That is not too much to ask. If these people were in any other walk of <Col N="154" /> life they would have gone on strike long ago.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are concerned that the increased jurisdiction which this Bill foists on the District Courts and Circuit Courts cannot but mean that as soon as the Bill becomes operational there will be an increased workload at District and Circuit Court level. In my view that argument is not open to contradiction, Yet there has not been an iota of extra resource commitment to handle this increased workload. The Minister has said that he and his senior colleagues will monitor the situation carefully. It will be part of the great national pastime of keeping matters under review, areas to be looked into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;updated&rdquo;, &ldquo;constant monitoring&rdquo; and &ldquo;regular review&rdquo;. I know what that means&mdash;that the Minister hopes it is the responsibility of somebody else in the future. I do not blame the Minister as a human being for that, but I believe we could do better without asking for major economic resources at a time when such resources are obviously very scarce. I cannot remember any time when they were not scarce, but we are told they are very scarce at present and we see the evidence all around us. We are not asking for the building of new courts but simply asking for decent facilities in which unfortunate people who are brought before the courts, and whose good or ill fortune it is to be there, can operate. That is not too much to ask. We ask it because of our concern with the standards of justice, and that is what the Minister is concerned about. He has said repeatedly that this Bill is designed to give people greater access to the District Court, people who formerly had to go to the High Court. That is great, but if the Minister is truly concerned about access he must accept that people will take the opportunity and that more cases will come before these courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take Rathfarnham, and there are similar cases all over the country. I have letters from people in the legal profession who testify that they have to work in what <Col N="155" /> one describes as a cowshed and another as a place more resembling the club room of a football team than a court. I do not know all these cases first hand. I know some because we have a certain number in my own constituency and a fair number of my constituents find themselves among the patrons of the courts&mdash;perhaps in time we may be able to change that also if we honestly believe that we can bring about these changes. I simply ask will the Minister today give a guarantee that he will recognise the increased workload of the District Court and the Circuit Court, and that he will do so by allocating <i>pro rata</i> resources that are obviously necessary?</P>
    <P>I could quote from the Incorporated Law Society's submission on the Bill and from various bodies and groups that have made representations. The Minister has these also. Suffice it to say that they are unanimous on few things more than this one. There is no point expecting two pints to fit into a point bottle. I firmly believe that, if this Bill becomes law without the necessary resources being made available, we will be doing many people a disservice and injustice will arise as a result.</P>
    <P>Why should a case of family law, about the guardianship of a child, be dealt with in a court in which there is not even room for the family to sit down and discuss with their legal advisers the right way to go about their case? That is a statement of fact. Where will that family be accommodated? How will the interests of the child be respected? Does the Minister consider it appropriate that the future of a young child is to be decided on the edge of a footpath? Are the people representing the child supposed to take instructions, give counsel's opinion, listen to counsel and discuss the case in a makeshift way? That is not good enough and nobody can accept it. I am asking the Minister to accept this.</P>
    <P>Before this legislation becomes law I want the Minister, having consulted with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, to make a declaration to this House, that the people most involved have agreed that the proper facilities are <Col N="156" /> available and that the court personnel are adequate to ensure the working of the Act. The declaration will then be published in order to satisfy everybody that the circumstances in which this Act is to be operated are satisfactory. I feel very strongly about this, not because it is a matter of industrial relations in the courts, which is important, but because quality of justice in the courts will be to some extent dictated by the circumstances, by the availability of personnel and by the resources and facilities available. At the moment they are very bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Second Stage speech at column 81 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware, of course, that legal responsibility for courthouse accommodation around the country generally rests with the local authorities and that particular problems have arisen in a number of areas in this regard. However, a good deal of essential preparatory work in improving the situation has been done and I am glad to be able to tell Deputies that I have in preparation a set of proposals relating to courthouse accommodation which I will be putting to the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to know what stage these proposals have reached? The time has come when the provision of courthouses must be the total responsibility of the Department of Justice. Local authorities have enough problems on their hands. The provision of courthouses is very low on the priority lists of many county councils and it is unlikely that they will rise on that list in the near future. I have been in many courts over the years. I have been in dance halls, bingo halls and billardrooms where courts were held and I considered the conditions in some of those places to be scandalous. In western films we see courts being held in saloons. They were like the European Court when compared sith some of the places where justice was administered in this country where there was no proper heating, seating, toilet facilities and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation will not be resolved satisfactorily until responsibility for courthouse <Col N="157" /> accommodation rests squarely on the shoulders of one person &mdash; the Minister for Justice. To this end a major policy decision is necessary. Because of the additional work in the District Courts there will have to be increases in the number of District Court clerks, shorthand typists, welfare officers and those who provide ancillary services. It is essential that major changes be made. This Bill should not become law until we make adequate provision and rapid improvements to the places where courts are held. I am particularly concerned about family matters being held in District Courts where present accommodation is so unsuitable, and I would be totally against family law matters being heard in some of our existing courthouses.</P>
    <P>We have seen a number of very funny television programmes, such as the Frank Hall programme, dealing with different aspects of life. We were very lucky the producers did not get around to visiting our courthouses, because in many cases they make a mockery of the places where our courts are held. I am making this comment more in sadness than anger. I am not trying to make a political argument, because courthouse accommodation did not get bad suddenly over the last few years. They have been a disgrace for at least 20 years. Our District Courts are a national scandal. The reason for this is divided responsibility.</P>
    <P>When local authorities build new libraries they could provide additional rooms for courthouses. If there is a breakdown in our court system it will fundamentally affect everybody. When people leave the court after a decision has been arrived at, they should be happy in the knowledge that they got a fair hearing and that everything was proper and just. At present many people have a real sense of grievance and the accommodation situation is largely responsible. I believe we should have microphones installed in courthouses. In many instances people in the body of the court are unable to hear what is being said and cannot follow the case. The Minister should examine this matter. The whole District Court situation is abominable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal for a new section is contradictory and serves no useful purpose. it is contradictory not only because it is incompatible with the commencement provisions in section 31 of the Bill, which it is not proposed to delete, but also because it runs directly counter to some of the points the Deputy has been arguing forcibly during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 is framed in such a way that some provisions of the Bill will take effect as soon as it is passed, and provides a time-lag for the remainder. The provisions which are to take effect immediately relate to the new judgment debt interest rate, the new limit for mental distress in fatal accidents and the changes in the law relating to the Judiciary. In none of these instances is it necessary to make the declaration which the Deputy would have the Minister make. Indeed the amendment which the Deputy has put down to section 28 is aimed specifically at making the change in the level of compensation for mental distress effective at an earlier date than proposed. The adequacy of court personnel, facilities and services is simply not relevant. Nonetheless, the Deputy's proposal could only delay the implementation of the jurisdiction <Col N="159" /> changes and the other provisions and would hold these important provisions up also.</P>
    <P>As regards the arrangements for introducing the new jurisdiction limits, the provisions for registering District Court decrees and extending the application of interest, section 31 provides for a time-lag for their coming into effect. This delay will permit the rule-making bodies to make Rules of Court which will be necessary in order to make the new arrangements fully effective. Having given further consideration to the likely work involved in preparing and bringing into effect these new rules, and the other likely practical requirements for the operation of the new jurisdictions, I am of the opinion that a time-lag of 12 months rather than six months would be more appropriate, and amendments Nos. 36b and 36c give effect to the revised period. This extra time will also provide an opportunity to make better progress on the accommodation proposals which the Minister referred to on Second Stage and to give detailed consideration to the administrative arrangements for the best use of the available court time and accommodation. I am satisfied that by the time the main proposals of this Bill regarding jurisdiction come into operation, the arrangements for the distribution of business in the District Court will be such that that court will be able to handle whatever increase in workload may result.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the operation of the lower courts will be kept under close review for some time after the introduction of the new jurisdiction arrangements. At the best estimate available at present, it is likely that the District Court will be the only one whose caseload will increase as a result of this Bill; demand on Circuit Court time is not likely to change significantly. However, if as a result of actual experience in either court under the new dispensation there arises a need for the appointment of additional judges, justices or court staff, I will not be slow to take whatever steps are required to fulfil that need. It is not possible to estimate the effect which the <Col N="160" /> improved access to the courts afforded by this Bill will have on the volume of business. It follows therefore, that it would be a futile exercise to make new appointments on the basis of what can only be, at this stage, guesswork.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated on Second Stage, the proposals in this Bill have been drawn up following careful consideration of the practical consequences. In saying this, I would like to place on record that consultations on these proposals have taken place not only with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, but also with the Judiciary in the Circuit and District Courts and with many other interested persons and bodies. Thus the section proposed for insertion in the Bill is unnecessary, and is opposed.</P>

      <P>It would be churlish of us not to acknowledge that the Minister has responded somewhat generously to our promptings on more than one occasion. In this case he has at least allowed the time before the Bill becomes operative to be increased from six months to 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister points to alleged contradictions in my approach. If that is the case, one is also slightly mystified at the Minister's assertions this morning that the new £7,500 mental distress figure is adequate and appropriate and will come into effect almost immediately, yet at the same time he has increased from six months to 12 months the period before the Bill will become operative. This means that it will probably be about three or four years before mental distress sums are likely to be paid.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister expect that the condition of courthouses can be improved if the Government do not give adequate money to the responsible agency? By that I mean even the same amount as was given last year, even though by definition this would not be adequate because inflation is running at 18 per cent. In effect the Minister is asking the District and Circuit Courts to take on work for which they are clearly unsuited. The result will be a further deterioration of standards. I am completely dissatisfied with the Minister's commitment. I believe he means well but his colleagues will not give him the money because it is not there.</P>

      <P>There are a number of matters that will have to be implemented in the near future such as dealing with cases of mental distress and suffering or the loss of a person which may arise under a civil liability Act and the extension of jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts. Because of the sensitive nature of family law cases we should refrain from placing such work in the District Court until work is undertaken on improving the courthouses. I will not go over that ground again because it has been dealt with quite adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Minister's proposals will be before the Government in a matter of weeks, perhaps even before 1 May. I would be very seriously concerned if the Government proceeded with the proposal that family law matters be heard in existing courthouses. That would be totally unsatisfactory and irresponsible. Such places are a disgrace and place a <Col N="165" /> question mark over the whole system of District Courts. I ask the Minister to come back to the House if possible before June with regard to the proposals. The matter is urgent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>During this discussion the Minister has made many references to reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, indicating he was guided to a considerable extent by the reports. I should like to quote one sentence from the 1970 report &mdash; the 12th interim report. Paragraph 21 of that report states:</P>
      <P>The facilities at the courthouses in many of the less important venues are unsuitable for the hearing of civil cases which take any length of time.</P>
      <P>During this debate the Minister gave considerable weight to the committee's deliberations and he should respect their findings in this case also. I could quote from comments made by the Incorporated Law Society and other organisations who are not prone to making anything other than seriously considered remarks. All of them are at one on this matter. They do not share the Minister's relative satisfaction and they have sought guarantees that the facilities be made available prior to the legislation coming into operation. Apparently that will not be the case. The people will be the losers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan) Thomas Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers and trade unions in the bakery industry have been complaining for some years about the operation of the Night Work (Bakeries) Act, 1936. That Act prohibits the baking of bread and <Col N="168" /> flour confectionery between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.</P>
    <P>The ban on night work applies to the baking operation only and not to auxiliary operations such as slicing, wrapping, packing orders, loading vans and so on. In addition regulations have been made under the Act which allow flour blending, dough making, sponge making and clearing of ovens to be carried out at night. Only a minority of bakery workers are, therefore, affected. I should also mention that only one EEC country, Luxembourg, has a total ban on night baking similar to ours.</P>
    <P>Over the years meetings have been held with both sides of industry to resolve the problems arising from the Act but no acceptable solution emerged. In February 1980 a consultative document, setting out various options in regard to the Act was issued to all interested parties in the industry. The options posed in this document were briefly as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) to change the legal starting and finishing times for baking to 4 a.m. and 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>(b) to introduce a licensing system authorising bakeries to work at night;</P>
    <P>(c) to allow night baking on a partial basis;</P>
    <P>(d) to introduce more effective enforcement procedures;</P>
    <P>(e) to increase the penalties for breaches of the Act.</P>
    <P>From the views received on the consultative document and from subsequent discussions, it became clear that action was required to be taken if large-scale redundancy in the industry was to be avoided.</P>
    <P>At its Annual Delegation Conference towards the end of last year the Bakery and Food Workers Amalgamated Union passed a motion nothing with concern the growing threat to security of employment of the union's members. The union called for acceptable amendments which would make the 1936 Act more effective or alternatively its repeal.</P>
    <P>Employers wanted greater flexibility to operate more efficiently and to be able to supply fresh bread to meet customers demand thereby helping to offset the decline in bread consumption. They also <Col N="169" /> wished to be in a position to meet, on an equal footing, competition from Northern Ireland and Britain where night baking is allowed.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year it became all the more urgent that a solution to the night baking problem be found quickly. A number of bakeries indicated that they would have to close unless they were allowed to operate more flexibly, particularly in regard to night baking. Such closures would have involved large-scale unemployment.</P>
    <P>About the same time the Labour Court heard a claim on behalf of bakeries that the unions should agree to alterations in working conditions including the introduction of night work on a rotation basis. The court ruled that it did not seem a case had been established for the continuing prohibition of all night work and if rotational night shifts were introduced the court felt that the legislation should be amended to allow this to take place where unions and employers agree.</P>
    <P>I have carefully studied all the views expressed on this problem and it is my belief that the best way to deal with the issue is to introduce flexibility of operation by way of a licensing system which will allow night baking where it is shown that circumstances warrant it. This is the main provision in the Bill before you. It provides that before licences are issued the representatives of the employers and workers concerned will be consulted.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am providing for the enforcement of the Act by the industrial inspectorate of my Department and for an increase in the penalties for breaches of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be little doubt that some action was needed in regard to night work in bakeries. First of all, we should consider the genesis of the existing Act. Back in the 1920s or 1930s there was an international labour convention in regard to this matter and the Irish delegation had a large influence in regard to it. The convention was ultimately approved by the International Labour Organisation and it was signed by us in the 1930s. I am surprised the Minister did not refer to the history of legislation in <Col N="170" /> this area, or that he did not refer to the perceived need for such legislation almost 50 years ago. There was and is a need for it. To that extent it is a matter of regret that this Bill backpedals on the provisions of the 1936 Act. Therefore I regret that this Bill has had to be introduced. But the Minister has faced a very difficult situation. This Bill is ingenious. The Minister is to some extent side stepping or maybe he is waiting to cross bridges as they arise. Perhaps that is sensible.</P>
      <P>Another area which was not referred to by the Minister, and ought to have been referred to, is the whole area of health and safety. It is a well-established and accepted fact that night work is anti-social and injurious to health. We had a long debate on this subject when discussing the Safety in Industry Bill. It is therefore a matter of great sadness to me that we have to bring in a Bill &mdash; and I accept the Minister has to bring it in &mdash; which leaves the option open to facilitate night work. Why is the Minister doing this? He is doing it because the 1936 Act is breached as much as it is observed. I have discussed this question with many people. Would it not be better to enforce the 1936 Act, to go after those bakers who are breaking the existing law by working at night? I have to admit that after long discussion I have come to the same conclusion as the Minister obviously has, that the enforcement of present legislation is difficult if not impossible. It is the realisation of that fact that prompts the bringing of this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had the choice I would retain the present Bill and enforce it, because it is a pity to take a step backwards in this area of night work where it could be avoided. But I have to accept that it is unavoidable. Having said that, I feel that we should not let this Bill pass without being severely critical of those bakers who have flouted the law by baking at night. They are breaking the law and getting away with it. Because of this they are able to deliver, as they say in one of their slogans, today's bread today. That, of course, constitutes unfair competition with the established and unionised bakers <Col N="171" /> who meet all their commitments under social and employment legislation. The result of this breach of the law is to endanger the needs and the livelihood of other people engaged in the baking industry Indeed, there is a very serious threat of a closure in Kilcock, County Kildare, with the loss of 190 jobs. If this happens Kilcock will be a ghost town. This breaking of the law has already forced and now, with the enactment of this Bill, will force many bakers to work at night, upsetting a well-established pattern without regard to the effect it will have on their health, on their own attitudes and on their family life. If I were a baker threatened with this I would be very worried and very angry indeed, and I know many are. We have to be severely critical of those bakers who have broken the law and forced the Minister to bring in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have to say the Minister has done a good job in a very difficult situation. This problem has arisen since 1965 when the bakers' union agreed to a five day week and, for the first time, the established bakers decided not to deliver bread on Mondays but would deliver it on five days, Tuesday to Saturday inclusive. That was the opening for the fly-by-night or, as somebody said, the bake-by-night bakers. They decided that they would deliver bread on Monday and that gave them an opening into the market which has developed ever since. I do not blame anybody taking advantage of the market situation, but I do blame them for doing it in an illegal way and I blame them for forcing upon many hundreds of bakers the threat of night work which should be avoided if possible. There is also a grave suspicion in some cases that many bakeries &mdash; of course not all bakeries should be tainted &mdash; acting illegally have been able to increase their market share by what is called discounts to the retailer. Very often they are able to give to the retailers a discount three times greater than that given by established bakers. Many of these bakers give a 33 per cent discount to retailers. The established bakers can only given an 11 per cent discount. Shopkeepers will, naturally, <Col N="172" /> take supplies from the baker who offers the most profit. When you add to that the possibility of somewhat fresher bread, it is certainly unfair competition.</P>
    <P>How do these bake-by-night bakeries give massively bigger discounts? One would presume when they are baking at night that they have to pay shift and night premiums. If they were doing things properly, labour costs would be higher. I would like the Minister to instigate a new public inquiry &mdash; I would like him to comment on this in his reply &mdash; into the whole bakery industry. I understand the last inquiry was in 1972. The inquiry should establish if any or all of these bake-by-night bakeries, who have been acting illegally, are paying all the PRSI and PAYE they should be paying, if any of their employees are also drawing social benefits and if there are any other irregularities. It has been put to me &mdash; I do not know if it is true, but I have a suspicion that it is correct &mdash; that some of these bakeries are flouting more than the Night Work (Bakeries) Act, 1936. If that is so, it is very annoying to think that they are breaking many of the Acts dealing with taxation and social insurance also, together with the Night Work (Bakeries) Act, and that the effect of their breaches of the law is to have won through and forced an amendment. If this suspicion is correct &mdash; I emphasise it is only a suspicion &mdash; I want the Minister to set up a public inquiry into it. If it is true that bigger discount has been made possible by breaches of the law, is it also true that these same bakeries have been getting the same subsidy from the Government which the established bakers have been getting?</P>
    <P>It is an outrageously sad situation if firms breaking the law dealing with conditions of employment, tax and social welfare are also receiving subsidies from the State. Why do they need subsidies if they are able to give the retailers three times the discount that other bakeries give? These are matters which are properly the subject of an inquiry, and the introduction of this Bill by the Minister is a suitable occasion to raise this matter. It is very important because, as the Minister rightly said, it has threatened <Col N="173" /> hundreds of established jobs by good employers. It looks as if it constitutes severely unfair competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to take to himself powers to issue regulations in individual cases from time to time and also power to revoke those regulations should the need arise. He proposes to do that after consultation with employers and trade unions concerned, which is all very correct. I would ask the Minister to go a little bit further and extend the right of objection to the public before such licences are granted under the regulations. It should be advertised in the papers and the public should be asked to comment and given the right to object.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the issuing of licences under these regulations should be as confined as possible. There is a body of opinion which says that licences should be granted only to those who are threatened by competitors outside the jurisdiction &mdash; in other words, bakeries in Northern Ireland. That was a serious factor also in creating illegal night work in the Republic, because the United Kingdom, unlike us, is not a signatory of the ILO Convention. Because of the EMS I understand the situation may now have changed dramatically in relation to the flow of bread across the Border, although I am not certain about that.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the conditions of such regulations should not permit a situation where a licensee would gain an unfair advantage over competitors in the Republic who have not got such a licence. it is very important that the Minister should include, as conditions of any licence, provisions which do not put bakers who are not working at night at a disadvantage. It is important before any licence is issued that those applying for a licence should satisfy the Minister as to their suitability to carry on a business, to the likelihood of their observing legislation dealing with health and safety, conditions of employment and so on. They should be able to show that all their workers are registered for PRSI and PAYE.</P>
    <P>It is also important that any licence issued under the regulations should cover the number of weeks in any one year that a worker can be required to work. I <Col N="174" /> understand that in the UK there is a maximum of 26 weeks in the year. I advocate strongly to the Minister that a similar maximum number of years should be included in regulations made under this Bill.</P>
    <P>That takes us to the area of penalties. The penalties provided for in the Bill are derisory. The Minister proposes a maximum penalty under section 2 (6) of £200. The section says:</P>
    <P>(6) A person who fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200.</P>
    <P>Suppose he pays the £200 and continues to commit an offence under this Bill. In the first place £200 is not a deterrent to any baker of any size today, and there is also no provision for a recurring offence which I think is an omission from the Bill and I propose on Committee Stage to table amendments in that area. I hope the Minister will himself consider increasing the penalties and making provision for penalties for recurring offences. There are penalties already but they are of no use if legislation is not put into effect, and this Bill is before the House because the 1936 Act simply has not been effective.</P>
    <P>I note in this Bill that the Minister is proposing to change responsibility for enforcement from the Garda Síochána to the industrial inspectorate. I am worried about that because the factory inspectorate are already grossly under-manned. Somebody calculated recently that with the current number of inspectors and the current number of places of employment the frequency of visits from the factory inspectorate to any one place of employment could not be more than two in a year. Clearly there is a major problem in the factory inspectorate &mdash; I presume that it is the factory inspectorate the Minister means when he talks about the industrial inspectorate. I have no faith that the factory inspectorate will have the manpower sufficient to enforce the provisions of this Bill, and it is vitally important if we are enacting legislation in this House that we enact legislation which will be enforced, <Col N="175" /> otherwise we are bringing the law into disrepute. I will have something to say in that regard also on Committee Stage. I wonder if the Minister would consider appointing a special bakery inspector whose appointment would be the subject of discussion with the bakers' union in advance so as to ensure that a suitably qualified person is appointed. I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>To get back to breaches of the law that have forced this Bill upon the House, I want to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17 March last in which there was a report of a case heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The report says:</P>
    <P>A young bakery worker, when 17 years old, worked sometimes at night for eight or nine hours before getting a 15-minute break it was alleged at an unfair dismissals hearing before an Employment Appeals Tribunal in Dublin yesterday.</P>
    <P>At Christmas 1979 he was told he would have to work at weekends from 11 p.m. on Sunday to 7 a.m. on Monday, and from 12 midnight on Friday to 8 a.m. on Saturday.</P>
    <P>I am leaving out the gentleman's name as required. He</P>
    <P>told the Tribunal he did not want to do that, but agreed to do it for the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>Later he was told he would have to do the late night work from then on. Only two &ldquo;slicers&rdquo; worked in this section at night, he said. One of the bakers would come down when he saw they were getting drowsy.</P>
    <P>Later he was told he would have to work a 12-hour shift from 7 p.m. on Sunday to 7 a.m. on Monday and started doing that around June last year.</P>
    <P>I think I have read enough of that report to highlight the outrageous breach of the law in that case, presuming the facts as stated were correct.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point but if the allegations are correct &mdash; and there is no knowing if they are but I imagine there is some substance in them &mdash; here was a young man, 17 years of age, being asked to work through the night for nine hours without a break and sometimes for 12 hours. That report itself will hightlight the sort of disgraceful operations that are going on in certain sections of the bakery trade and that is why in facilitating the passage of this Bill I ask the Minister to institute a public inquiry into this whole area.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I have to say that it is regrettable that the Minister has been forced to bring in this legislation. It is a pity that the other Bill could not be enforced and I accept the Minister's conclusion that it could not be. I congratulate the Minister because in all the circumstances he had done the best he could. I hope that when the Bill is passed licences will be granted only when unavoidable. I ask the Minister also to ensure that the fines under the Bill will be meaningful, that they will be recurring for recurring offences and that the Bill will be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister by now is fully aware of the various points raised in relation to the difficulties of enforcing the legislation prior to this Bill. Nevertheless I would like to reiterate some of the points made. The Minister proposes to introduce a system of licensing which would allow night baking where it is shown that circumstances warrant it. In the earlier deliberations on this Bill, the Minister has indicated to the principal trade union concerned, the Bakery and Food Workers Amalgamated Union, that it will be required to apply to the Minister to bake at night and that the application must include statements as to the need for such night working. The employer is obliged, in making such an application, to give the times and duration of the proposed shiftwork and <Col N="177" /> the Minister must be furnished with the number and category of workers &mdash; particularly those engaged on their rest days and rest period &mdash; and the duration for which the licence is sought. All this information must be submitted in the first instance by the employer, presumably direct to the Department of Labour. It may be argued that, in terms of the least objectionable Bill, this is the best possible approach.</P>
      <P>There is another interesting aspect to this Bill, namely that an application to the Department for such a licence must state, the name of the union representatives, or in the event of the workers not being organised in a union, the names and addresses of the workers' representatives who may be consulted. I gather that the Minister has given some assurances to the trade unions concerned that he will take into account the views of the Department's industrial inspectorate before issuing a licence if he considers this necessary. The Minister has also given an assurance that he will consult with the ICTU and the FUE in the matter. In that regard, I hope that applications for such licences will be sent to the Protective Legislation Committee section of the ICTU, to enable that section to check the application and consult with the trade unions directly concerned. Needless to remark, the Minister has final discretion in the issuing of licences and we accept that he is not necessarily obliged to act in accordance with any of the views received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that these are entirely laudable provisions, but would strongly urge that before this Act is put into operation the Minister should examine two very serious deficiencies in the encompassing legislation. First, enforcement of the Act at present is carried out by the Garda Síochána. I mean no reflection on the Garda Síochána when I say that enforcement of this Act is one of those things very far from their mind. They have no direct involvement and no real function in this matter. Under the present Act, the Garda Síochána have inspectorate powers to investigate a bakery premises suspected of breaking the law. This requires written authorisation, <Col N="178" /> as I understand it, from an inspector of the Garda Síochána. I suspect that the Garda have far more expertise in deciding whether or not we are having a jar after hours than in deciding whether or not illegal baking after hours is occurring. These inspectorial powers should be removed from the Garda Síochána and placed directly with the industrial inspectorate of the Department of Labour. This is absolutely essential. I am surprised that, parallel with the introduction of this Bill, the Minister has not proceeded to do this, which would clear the air. Getting that kind of move through involves an incredible amount of bureaucratic consultation and governmental decisions. Anyone who has ever consulted with the Department of Justice will appreciate the difficulties of getting a decision, even in principle, on such matters. The Minister should go straight ahead and do this. I have no doubt that the Garda Commissioner would be only too pleased to be relieved of an entirely unsatisfactory function. It is evident that over the years the law, in that respect, has been somewhat ineffectual. As well as vesting the powers of inspection in the Department of Labour, the right of complaint by the union or any of its members should be directly to the inspector of the Department of Labour, when a breach of the Act has allegedly been committed. There is definite and positive opposition to the Minister's proposal in this respect.</P>
    <P>Regarding penalties, the existing law provides penalties of fines of £10 maximum for breaches of the existing Act. The Minister has indicated that he is considering increasing the penalties. He should go ahead and do so. Why must we wait? Why must the perennial memoranda float around? It is a great consolation to know that it is off one's desk and floating up to the President for signature. The present fines are of a derisory amount. Imposition of a fine up to the maximum of £10 is discretionary, it is left to the bench to decide. There is not much point in passing a Bill of this nature if an employer is brought before the courts and the judge must decide whether to fine him £5, £8 or £10 maximum. Illegal parking of a car these days is just as <Col N="179" /> expensive. One could have a couple of dozen workers doing illegal night baking, which is far more serious.</P>
    <P>One case alluded to by Deputy Mitchell, quite rightly, received a degree of publicity in the newspapers, where an employer came before the Appeal Tribunal because, allegedly, a worker of 17 years of age was engaged in night baking. This was reported in the newspapers and it was alleged that the worker had to do a nine-hour nightwork shift or be dismissed. I am not privy to the proceedings of that tribunal, but it would be interesting to know if the circumstances were as alleged. There is no doubt that, in this country, there will always be the employer who is quite prepared to take a short cut, and if he can have illegal night baking he can have a substantial competitive advantage over fellow employers.</P>
    <P>The penalty should be mandatory in regard to conviction. There are too many judges, with great respect to the Judiciary, who have not the foggiest idea of the exigencies and operations of industrial employment. I doubt if some of the Judiciary would recognise a factory if they saw it. That is the reality because they come from a totally different social background. I suppose it would be difficult to find a judge who did shift work once in a lifetime whether you go to the Circuit Court, the District Court or the High Court. I think, therefore, that the penalties where people breach the law in industrial employment in this context should be mandatory. That should be that. That is the situation one finds in other areas of mandatory enforcement.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about giving a licence for two years. I would have thought that 12 months would be better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that is the maximum. I also know how Ministers' arms are twisted. Employers come in with bleeding hearts. The Minister will have representations from local Deputies to the effect that an employer will go out of business. Everybody goes out of <Col N="180" /> business when one is looking for something and, once he gets that something, you find how miraculously the firm manages to survive. I think the Minister should have a period of 12 months so that every employer will know he will get a licence for 12 months. It would be ludicrous to give a licence for any lesser period. Let the employer re-apply at the end of the 12 months. What inevitably will happen here is that everyone will go for the two years and at the end of that period there will be an application for a another two years.</P>
      <P>The particular trade union, the Bakery and Food Workers Amalgamated Union &mdash; it used to be the Bakers and Confectioners Union &mdash; did have a view, and still adheres to the view, that licences should be withdrawn where it is established that a firm is not complying with legislation governing income tax, PRSI, health and safety and hygiene standards and regulations relating to the employment of young persons. Much as I appreciate the pre-occupation of the union in that regard, there is just no way in which the two can be combined and it is up to the enforcing agency to ensure that these particular statutory obligations are also complied with. I do not see any way whereby you can combine the two under this Bill. Naturally it would be quite impossible so to do, but I think the union is correct in drawing attention to that area.</P>
      <P>There is a phenomenon which has grown up in relation to the bakery trade. I refer to the hot bread shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is near tea time. The Deputy should not get carried away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to ensure those shops come within the scope of this Bill because there is night baking. There are bakeries and bakeries and if one had a proliferation of such shops one would want to make sure that licensing should apply to them. I would strongly suggest licensing should apply across the board. A number of such establishments are non-union and in that situation they are more likely to be able to circumvent the licensing obligation. I <Col N="181" /> would urge the Minister to take a sharp look at that.</P>
      <P>The trade is not as profitable as has been suggested, though some workers have told me that one pays some of the firms a subsidy on bread when there is a degree of over-baking. I do not know how true that is but the allegations have been made from time to time. It is a matter more for the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. It does not get away from the need for a degree of subsidisation on such a basic food as bread.</P>
      <P>For the most part Irish bread is infinitely superior to what passes for bread in the United Kingdom, but it is by no manner of means superior to the bread one obtains on the Continent. It is a refreshing experience to enjoy the quality and variety of bread on the Continent. This is a point that should be made and I make it as a consumer. I am assured by the workers here and the employers that our standards are higher than those obtaining in the UK. I tremble to think what the UK experience must be. The current plastic bread and tasteless cotton wool in the Republic of Ireland is singularly unattractive. That is the reason I believe for the success of the hot bread shops, though I would have some hesitation with regard to quality. That is my personal view. Perhaps it is a fad. Indeed, bread is now so costly large families cannot afford to be too fastidious. In fact most of the community cannot afford to be, too fastidious in their personal tastes.</P>
      <P>Having made these points, I would ask be too fastidious in their personal tastes. alties and the question of the transfer to the inspectors, rather than the Garda, of the inspection processes. In that context perhaps the Minister will mollify some of the very serious concern existing in the trade unions directly concerned with the introduction of this legislation. I presume the Minister intends to take all Stages tonight?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I would say that, if anything, it is years too late. Probably many who were employed in the bakery business have gone out of it because of the restrictive nature of the hours when one could operate in the trade. The problem with the 1936 Act is that for many years it was strictly enforced. That did result in a number of smaller family bakeries going out of business. In latter years it has been enforced in a patchy manner which has given rise to great abuses, some of which have come to my notice. The sooner that legislation is got rid of the better and I am glad that is the purpose of this Bill. I should like the Minister to assure us that the new legislation will be enacted fairly quickly and in a reasonably short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to specific points that I have witnessed in the city and county of Waterford in recent months and which I brought to the notice of the Minister's Department. I refer to abuses of the 1936 Act which were not acted on when reported to his Department or to the Garda Síochána, who up to now have been responsible for the enforcement of this legislation. In our city and county there has been strict enforcement of the 1936 Act but the same has not been the case in adjoining areas. What happened in recent times is that a number of people who were in business legitimately have been put to the brink of bankruptcy and certainly have suffered serious financial loss because people operating in other counties, particularly in Cork city, seem to be getting away with baking at all hours of the night, although this is prohibited under the 1936 Act. They have been able to sell bread in counties and towns like Waterford at six o'clock in the morning, this bread having been baked earlier in the morning, while bakers who were adhering to the law cannot start heating their ovens until 6 <Col N="183" /> a.m. That put them at a great business disadvantage. They have lost many contracts and considerable business generally even to small shops and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>To accentuate the problem further the State through the aegis of the Army, of hospitals and other State institutions have been buying bread baked during illegal hours. When I reported this to the Minister's Department and to the Garda &mdash; but particularly to the Department &mdash; I got a very poor hearing. I was told that new legislation was coming in &mdash; it is before us now &mdash; and that the matter would be rectified when it was enforced. I feel there is a duty in law and on the Department of Labour to see that existing legislation is enacted and that people who adhere to the law are protected. That was not the case. There have been abuses and the Department have been very slow to do anything about it. The Garda were probably advised that legislation was pending and not to press charges against those breaking the law. That is very poor satisfaction for those who suffered financially as a result and may even have gone out of business. I should like the Minister to say how long, all things being equal &mdash; I am aware the Bill has already gone through the Seanad &mdash; it will be before this measure becomes law. It is obviously unfair competition if some people can work during hours not allowed to others. I fully support this legislation and I believe all Members do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan) Thomas Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed and I am glad of the welcome given to the Bill. I accept much that has been said about the difficulty of enforcing the 1936 Act and also the comments as to why the Garda were to enforce the Act rather than inspectors of my Department. The Department of Labour did not exist in 1936 and I would think that at that time every village or town had three, four or five bakeries and presumably you would need a team of inspectors to enforce the Act. Now, with modern trends and larger units, I can assure the House without any <Col N="184" /> doubt that my Department and its inspectorate will make sure that the Bill when enacted and signed will be enforced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned about the fines of £200. Deputy Desmond also referred to this. The original fine was £10. I am legally advised that an increase from £10 to £200, a 20 times increase, is sufficient. The Deputy was also concerned that if there was one fine of £200 you could not fine again. As Deputies know, in any similar situation on the first inspection a person is not usually brought to court. He is warned of the possibility and, subsequently, if the offence is repeated, he is probably taken to court. The House knows that under this Act there will be other ways in which we can and will ensure that the law is observed. Deputy Mitchell mentioned the possibility of amendment to provide for fining £200 and then £200 again.</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that we feel we will be able to look into that. Deputy Desmond, on behalf of the Labour Party, said he would have no objection to giving us all Stages this evening and indeed Deputy Mitchell's colleague asked us to try to get the Bill through as soon as possible. If we get the Bill tonight we should have it enacted and working in a matter of days. I think the Deputy mentioned a particular bakery not far from his own part of the city where some 194 workers would have been made redundant on 31 December last but for the promise to introduce this Bill as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also spoke about the competitive position of bakeries, discounts, subsidies and so on. This would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism. The same would apply in relation to PAYE, which would be a matter for the Departments of Finance and Social Welfare. If the Deputy is of opinion that what he has referred to is happening within the industry, I shall bring his comments to the notice of my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the general position regarding the health of employees <Col N="185" /> in the bakery industry. Nobody likes night work as such. I think the Deputy used the phrase &ldquo;anti-social&rdquo; since night time is always regarded as a time of rest or, in regard to the earlier part of the night, a time for enjoyment. In many industries today shift work and night work are part and parcel of every day life. That is one of the reasons why we decided, after consultation with the unions and the employers and in order to protect employment in the bakery industry, that this legislation was necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked what the Minister would do when he was asked to issue a licence for night work. It would be my intention to inform the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, management and the union concerned or the workers' representative. That would mean four groups would be notified when an application is made for a licence for night work.</P>
    <P>On the question of penalties, I hope Deputies will be satisfied and will agree that the increase to £200 is substantial. As I said before, there are many other ways, apart from penalties, of dealing with matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House that all Stages of this Bill be passed this evening.</P>

      <P>The section refers to property and seeks to extend the number of instances where compensation may be paid. This is essentially acceptable. Perhaps the Minister would like to develop slightly on what is meant by a &ldquo;mere pleasure or amenity&rdquo;. In so far as these are tangible it is difficult to see why they have not been included. The definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; is something one would recommend since it extends the type of vessel for which compensation may be claimed.</P>

      <P>This section provides that the Bill when enacted will not have effect in relation to damage caused or loss suffered before its commencement. When the Bill is clearly designed to improve the situation, I wonder why people should not be entitled to benefit from the date of enactment. If actions had already been initiated would it not be reasonable to ask that the legislation would apply from the date of its coming into effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to repeals. Section 107 of the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836 refers to compensation to persons maimed and to representatives of persons murdered in certain cases, namely, having given information or evidence against any person charged with an offence against the public peace. It also refers to a magistrate or other peace officer murdered or maimed on account of his exertions to bring disturbers of the public peace to justice. Offences against the public peace are either such as are an actual breach of the peace or constructively so, intending to make others break it. This includes riotous and unlawful assemblies, riots, assaults, forcible entry, challenges to fight or anything tending to incite others to break the peace.</P>
      <P>Recently I understand that a witness in a case in the Special Criminal Court was kneecapped in County Donegal. I wonder if the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted refers only to breaches of the public peace and whether it would apply in this case.</P>

      <P>Personal injuries are not provided for within the scope of the Bill. Section 106 of the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836 provides for the payment of compensation by a local authority in respect of the murder or maiming of a person who has given information or evidence against any person or persons <Col N="188" /> charged with any offence against the public peace.</P>

      <P>It provides for compensation <Col N="189" /> by a local authority in respect of the maiming or the murder of a person who has given information or evidence against a person charged with an offence.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2) (d), line 9, after &ldquo;crime&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;against the property damaged&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In so far as section 5 (2) (d) provides that damage caused for the purpose of committing a crime is taken to be maliciously caused, it simply reproduces the present law. The other element in section 5 (2) (d) is a provision that is new to the law, namely, that damage shall be taken to be maliciously caused, and therefore compensatable, if caused in the course of the committing of a crime. The main purpose of this new provision is to cover the inevitable loss that is caused to a motor car owner when his car is taken without consent or stolen outright and then accidentally damaged while being driven by the offender. Of course, if the offender deliberately damaged the car, for example, by setting it on fire, that would be malicious damage and would be compensatable without benefit of this new provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> As it stands in the Bill now, this provision is too wide in its scope and there is a real danger that it would give entitlement to compensation in situations that it was not intended to cover and that quite clearly should not be covered. For example, if a person drives his own car without displaying his tax disc or while committing some other regulatory offence, such as having no rear light, and damages another person's property, say his car, by accidentally colliding with it, that other person would appear to be clearly entitled to compensation under the provision as it stands because the person driving without a tax disc is committing a crime and the damage caused to the other person's property would have been caused in the course of the committing of that crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <P>We are dealing with the amendment first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (1) we see once again the concept that wherever the poor man is involved there appears to be a lesser standard of justice obtaining. Subsection (1) restricts the compensation for malicious damage to amounts that exceed £100 and that appears to me to be fundamentally wrong. I can see there would be a certain amount of administrative difficulty in dealing with many claims for small amounts, but it is necessary to prove in all cases that malicious damage has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people for whom a sum of £70 or £80 is a significant amount &mdash; widows, people on social welfare benefit and many others who can ill afford loss through malicious damage. I contend that such people should not be outside <Col N="191" /> the scope of this Bill and I take issue with the Minister on this point. It appears to me there is an elitist attitude about what is right and just. Obviously there are many cases where damage exceeds £100 and there is no problem there. Let us consider the situation where the property of a person is damaged to the tune of £120 while another person suffers a loss through malicious damage of £80 or £90. That latter person will be excluded by this Bill. I do not believe administrative difficulty should be used as an excuse for denying justice to such people. I do not wish to be associated with any measure that incorporates a dual standard of justice, one standard for those with major claims and the other for those with small claims. In the eyes of some people, presumably those who drafted this Bill, the claims in the latter category do not appear to be worthy of consideration. I could see where damage to property amounting to £90 could have far greater significance for the owner of that property than damage to the extent of £9,000 or £90,000 for another person.</P>
    <P>I presume the reason for setting the limit is the question of costs and also an effort to stop a large number of actions where the costs of the action might be greater than the amount awarded in compensation. However that is a separate problem. I do not believe the way to deal with the problem of costs of legal actions or disproportionately large costs relative to the sum involved is to stop such actions being taken. Two wrongs do not make a right. I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>The consequences of a minor amount of financial damages may be great. Clearly, everything is relative. Arguably this section has been devised with good intent, namely, to stop a plethora of actions being taken, but sufficient consideration and sensitivity have not been given to the importance of each action to the person concerned. Regardless of whether the amount is £90, £900 or £9,000 people have the same right. We are not talking of giving something to people that is not theirs. We are talking of restoring to them something that is <Col N="192" /> their right and of which they have been deprived. The degree to which they are entitled to that return should not be dictated by an arbitrarily chosen figure, above which a person is deemed to be entitled and below which he is not so deemed. That is unjust and it flies in the face of the constitutional tenets we hold dear, such as Article 40 which states that all citizens should be equal before the law. Apparently that does not apply here. If one is a citizen with a claim of less than £100 one is not equal before the law. The section is inappropriate and misguided and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>During discussion on Second Stage I said this section was wrong mainly because of the fact that poor people can suffer a greater loss in proportion to their worldly goods than those who are rich. If a person is fined £200 for driving a car while under the influence of drink or crashing that car, that amount will mean nothing to him if he is rich; but if a person is fined £5 and has not that amount he is in a very serious situation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately in Dublin and throughout the country vandals think nothing of breaking the windows and doors of property belonging to old people, or even setting fire to their homes. In many cases the damage may be relatively small, perhaps amounting to £40, but such an amount of money represents a very considerable sum to the old person concerned. What the Minister is proposing in this section is a mistake and I appeal to him to reconsider the matter.</P>
      <P>I am sure he has heard, as all of us have, about the hardship that can be inflicted on somebody whose property is damaged. The value of money has dropped to such an extent that £100 may not appear very much to those who have money but it is practically a fortune to those who have not got the money. Administratively this may appear to be the right thing to do but it is not the right thing when it comes to people who have not got the money to pay for the damage themselves. I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to <Col N="193" /> answer a question I raised on Second Stage, namely, why it is not proposed to alter the rule, which is not a statutory rule so much as a judicial interpretation, whereby consequential loss is not a fit subject for compensation. Not only is it not proposed to remove it but the rule enunciated by the Supreme Court is now given statutory dress in that section 5(4) expressly excludes compensation for any loss consequential on damage. In a sense the malicious injuries applicant will be in a weaker position after this Bill is passed than he is now. Although the existing law deprives him of consequential loss, that law is only judicial law-making, the result of a decision by the Supreme Court in one or two cases. I do not wish to belittle the Supreme Court. It hands down the law and must be respected as such until it is declared otherwise. In about four cases in the past 15 years, every one of them of significant importance, the Supreme Court has changed its mind on being convinced that its previous decision was wrong. I think one of the instances was in this same area. Nobody can be certain that the court might not change its mind again but there will be no room for doing that once the idea that malicious injury awards do not include consequential damage is entrenched in statute. As I said on Second Stage, if the reason is that the State cannot afford to assume the burden of meeting consequential loss, well and good. To me that is a perfectly good argument and I do not quarrel with it.</P>
      <P>The State has taken on far too much and, in many cases, for the worst possible reason, and if the answer is that the State has enough on its back and cannot take on this additional burden, I will not quarrel. However, the Minister of State should be heard to say that and it should not have been slipped through here as if it were something unimportant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage debate, a shopkeeper whose premises have been damaged maliciously may incur a relatively small loss in so far as reinstating his premises is concerned, but he may lose a great deal of business during that period and his competitors who are anxious to catch up with him may overtake him and <Col N="194" /> he will be at the loss of that custom. These are heads of damage which an ordinary civil action would take into account. I do not say that the code we are now dealing with is comparable with civil liability, but I emphasise what can be for many applicants in malicious injury cases a very important matter: a very important head of their real loss is being excluded and that exclusion is being nailed down by statutory words in a way in which it has not been up to this. At the very least the Minister owes it to the House to tell his reasons for that. If it is that the State cannot afford it, let us at least hear him say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing law in most cases compensation is payable when the amount does not exceed £5 and in some instances the figure is less. The figure of £5 was fixed in 1898. In 1963 the inter-departmental committee on malicious injuries recommended a figure of £20, and when adjusted by reference to the CPI, £20 in mid-November of 1963 would be equivalent to £91.80 in mid-November 1979. In mid-August 1980 it would be £104.61. The committee also found that the costs involved in hearing certain cases were greater than the amount of the claims themselves and they suggested that an undue number of trivial claims would likely be made. What we are doing in this Bill is raising the amount to £100. It is a cut-off point and I do not propose to change it.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Kelly's comment in relation to subsection (4), which provides that compensation shall be paid only in respect of actual damage caused and excludes compensation for consequential loss, the committee on malicious injuries recommended that compensation should be in the nature of damages at common law, that is, include compensation for consequential loss. The financial implications of that recommendation for local authorities could be extremely severe and consequently no change in the existing law in this regard is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of businesses where consequential loss would be likely to be especially serious, it is not too much to expect that most or perhaps all owners would <Col N="195" /> have their own insurance. Section 19 proposes that the Exchequer will refund to the local authority the cost of compensation in excess of the produce of a rate of 20p in the £ in any one year. At present only a small number of local authorities have had to be recouped. It is known that, if consequential losses were provided for, the financial implications would be enormous for local authorities. It would impose an extraordinarily heavy burden on the State in the ultimate. I am satisfied that protection in this Bill in respect of consequential loss would not be of any great significance in view of the insurance protection that obtains at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister twice referred to the burden that would be imposed on local authorities if the benefit of malicious injury compensation was extended to consequential loss. The Minister knows that his Bill contains provisions whereby, if the malicious injuries components of the local authorities' burden exceeds the produce of 20p in the £, it must be picked up by the State. So it is the Government who cannot meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;in the ultimate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have said it at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it. Does it make a lot of difference when I said it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why make it necessary to track it down? It is ultimately the Government who cannot afford it. I do not complain about that. I would not recommend that the law be any different. But the Minister's final argument in regard to insurance I completely fail to understand because he himself has introduced a whacking great amendment which has the purpose of recouping, of clawing back from successful applicants, the amounts of awards they may have received, even going so far as the substance of their property. There is no validity as far as damage to the substance is concerned as there is to consequential damage. If what the Minister is suggesting <Col N="196" /> is that people should insure their own property and make sure that if it is maliciously damaged they will be covered, we must appreciate that that goes equally for the substance of their property following damage to the property. I cannot see any difference between the two, and the Minister's argument would have been a great deal stronger if he had not added the final few sentences.</P>
      <P>I have frankly admitted that the Bill contains some improvements on existing law, but the Minister has admitted frankly the reason for this judicial rule &mdash; it is no more than that &mdash; laid down in a case dealing with malicious attacks on Silvermines, and his entrenchment of that rule in this legislation is working in the opposite direction: it is tending to narrow down the applicant's potential compensation. That is against the spirit of the rest of the Bill and it is only right that should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument about insurance makes the argument against the section much stronger. The people I am concerned about are very poor. They do not insure and if they suffer they will not receive any benefit because of the way this Bill is worded. Houses are damaged quite frequently at present and if people are quick enough they can make a claim for compensation. Such people normally are not insured and they are the people who will suffer most because they cannot recover the damage. People have to apply within a limited time and this is a special problem for old people whose houses may be vandalised every couple of weeks. Each such case of damage would be excluded under the £100 rule and consequently such people may be left in uninhabitable houses because they cannot pay for repairs and the Minister is making sure they will not get compensation from the Government. As Deputy Kelly said, it is the Government in the end who will be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in common decency the Minister should have another look at that. The people I have been talking about will have to claim compensation within seven days and this imposes grave hardship on them. They are people who <Col N="197" /> have not got money, who are living from hand to mouth and I am sorry to say that their situation is being worsened. If the Minister cannot manage a general section that would cover this he should alternatively make some other provision for such people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Tully and I will not repeat what he has said. The views he has expressed are shared by Deputies on all sides of the House. A discussion has been opened as well on subsection (4) of section 5. The point to be made there is on the question of ruling out consequential damage. I do not think we should take refuge in either the hope, fairly pious to some extent on account of insurance rates, or the belief or the expectation that somebody else will pick up the tab or that the burden on the local authorities would be too great. If the burden is too great for the local authorities it is an admission that there is a burden and it is really a question of who bears it. Surely the people who should not bear it are the people who have been wronged, and those who have been wronged are those against whom malicious damage or injury has been inflicted. The actual damage caused might frequently be the minor portion of the loss.</P>
      <P>For instance, if a lorry which is the sole source of income is destroyed, the owner might not be able to finance another lorry quickly and his consequential losses, that is the loss of his profits and his livelihood, are very significant. After a lot of legal hassle he will get damages for his lorry if he is lucky. It may well be that a minor amount of damage to the lorry could put him off the road for a month or so. In that event it might well be that the loss of earnings for a month are far more serious than the cost of repair which might be relatively simple but, because a part was not available or for some other reason, the lorry could not be repaired quickly. There are many examples of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So it seems to me that for commonsense reasons and, speaking on behalf of the average citizen, the famous man in the street, we should reject this curtailment of compensation. The Minister may say that it is compensation and not damages. <Col N="198" /> The point is of course that it is compensation for loss arising from the malicious injury or damage inflicted. By any stretch of the imagination it is reasonable to conclude that that damage or that injury is the immediate loss plus the losses that arise only because of that immediate loss. Let us take a situation where some kind of damage has been inflicted on the lorry that I am talking about which costs less than £100. It might put the owner off the road for six months waiting for a part to be imported and that man, under this Act, is not even entitled to lodge a claim for malicious injuries because the damage did not come to more than £100.</P>
    <P>That is not justice by any stretch of the imagination. The concept here should be damages as understood at common law and we have here an opportunity to set right a wrong. Therefore I would ask the Minister to look again. If the argument for justice not being accepted here as a right and fitting principle is that the burden on local authorities is too great &mdash; and that means the Government because they are funding the local authorities &mdash; then let us admit that, because that is a separate issue. But it is quite wrong to penalise the average citizen and of course, as in most cases in this House, the lower on the social rung the particular citizen is the more damage and the more injury and the more hurt we expect him to accept. That is not right. I know in my heart that the Minister must agree with what we are saying here. There is not just the injustice of refusing consequential damages, which is obviously improper, but also the question that some people, usually those at the lower end of the socalled socio-economic ladder, are going to be ruled out all together. Those are two wrongs embodied in this section and they should be and must be rejected.</P>
    <P>While I am on my feet I should like to refer to subsection (2) where, again, an improvement could be brought about. In subsection (2), paragraph (c), where we talk about damage maliciously caused only if caused by three or more persons unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled together, the reference to three persons being unlawfully assembled <Col N="199" /> is derived from the definition of unlawful assembly at common law. There is no logical reason why this should be retained and I would ask the Minister to justify its retention. It really should be reduced to two. Once again we can see a situation occurring where two people, unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled, could inflict malicious damages very severely; but we are told that in those circumstances the injured person would not be entitled to malicious damages. That clearly is an outdated concept which, like a lot of things in this Bill, should be changed.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what is the justification of the retention of this outdated idea. It might be argued, I suppose, that it is not logical to reduce it to one and that there could not be an assembly of one; but I would say that I would be willing to consider even that. What is important is not how many people are engaged in the act of malicious damage or malicious injury but simply the loss to the person who is suffering and the best system of mechanics for replacing or restoring that loss. The number of people involved is small comfort to the person who has suffered and it should not be a germane factor in all of this.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on a number of grounds we have grave reservations on this section both on the question of the cut-off point of £100 and on the question of the cut-off point &mdash; because that is what it is &mdash; of restricting malicious damage claims to damage caused, in the context of subsection (2), by three or more persons; and, last, the very important area of consequential damages as in the case I outlined where a person might find that the immediate loss of a vehicle or premises or working utensils are in fact the smaller part of that real loss. There is a very strong case to be made there for amendments or for remedial action on this section. I would appreciate it if the Minister would be good enough to comment on the points made.</P>

In relation to the consequential loss referred to by Deputy Kelly, in 1975 there was a case in the Supreme Court against Tipperary North Riding County Council.

It would appear that Deputy Kelly was speaking about a section 3 amendment, which we have to meet yet, which would suggest, according to what he said, that there was a clawback operation about to be effected by the introduction of this amendment by the Government. That is not the case. Anybody is entitled to <Col N="201" /> malicious damage compensation under the existing legislation or under the Malicious Injuries Act, 1980, if they qualify in the normal way and their compensation is granted to them. If they are insured, the insurance company may make a settlement with them and there is no question of payment being required to pay back any moneys that the central Government may have recouped to the local authority.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Rugby Team's Tour of South Africa: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Quinn on Tuesday, 24 March 1981:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann aware of the continuance of the repression practised by the racist South African regime and of the evil nature of the apartheid system, which extends into the world of sport, deplores the decision of the Irish Rugby Football Union to send an Irish national touring team to the Republic of South Africa; calls upon the IRFU to reverse that decision in the interests of justice and of Ireland's international reputation, and calls upon the Government to take steps to introduce an immediate and effective boycott on all commercial and trading links with South Africa.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;international reputation,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and supports the Government in their efforts, including the pursuit of internationally agreed measures, to influence South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Donoghue.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that when the Irish Rugby Football Union decided to go to South Africa, most of the people making the decisions were not fully conscious <Col N="202" /> of the appalling regime in South Africa. South Africa is one of the richest countries in the world. It is by far the richest country on the Continent of Africa. The African Continent is the poorest, least developed and most underprivileged continent in the world, due to a large extent to the fact that it is still suffering from the consequences of colonialism. In South Africa, the number of coloured people compared with white is in the ratio of five to one.</P>
      <P>The incomes of people in South Africa, in relation to white and non-white people &mdash; I do not like raising the issue of colour but I must having regard to the way in which South African society is divided &mdash; is in the ratio of 17 to one. If one knew nothing or read nothing about the philosophy of apartheid &mdash; the word in Afrikaans means separate development &mdash; one would surely have to raise a question about a society in which the income differential between peoples can be in the ratio of 17 to one. It raises further questions when you find that the ratio is dependent upon the colour of people's skin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot for one moment accept that sport in South Africa is organised on non-racial lines. Apartheid involves separation. At the time of birth people are segregated into categories of white, black or coloured, which means a combination of black and white. From the moment of their birth and that moment of legal segregation, under the laws of apartheid, a person's future development is determined. Where they live, where they work, the extent of their education, the amount of money spent upon their development by the Government, is all determined by the colour of their skin. Although the number of coloured people in relation to white people in South Africa is in the ratio of five to one, the amount of money spent by the Government is of the ratio of 12 in favour of the whites, to one in favour of people who are coloured. Segregation occurs from the moment of birth and all through the lives of the people of South Africa &mdash; they are even segregated in cemeteries because coloured people may not be buried with people whose skin was white. I <Col N="203" /> doubt very much if there is any difference in the colour of their bones. There is certainly no distinguishing mark when they arrive before their Creator. That segregation takes place and this is a society into which the Irish Rugby Football Union is going to conduct a tour and to play.</P>
    <P>I accept and I know, from contacts which I have with concerned people in South Africa, that significant improvements have taken place there in relation to sport but they are minimal compared to the size of the problem. The world's conscience has spoken out against involvement of free nations like ourselves with South Africa in sporting events. To fly in the face of world opinion and to ignore the sensitive feelings which Africans necessarily have in this area, leads Ireland to a situation in which our name is going to be dragged through the mud. In South Africa, the upholding of the racist regime has led to a situation where, in the last 18 years, 51 people have died under violent circumstances while they were political detainees. These and many other facts could not have been borne in mind when the Irish Rugby Football Union made its decision to go to South Africa. I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of those who say that one should not allow politics to decide sporting matters but, in relation to South Africa, you cannot be as simplistic and naive as that. We believe here in the principle of the free movement of people all over the world. We would like to see that respected. I would like to see an end to passports from one end of the world to the other and certainly within the European family. If there is to be the freedom of movement of people, there must be a sense of responsibility on the part of those who have the right to move freely. We have the right to move freely and I would not ask our Government to put an embargo on passports or to withdraw passports from people who want to go to South Africa, Russia, Afghanistan, China or anywhere else. If we are to enjoy that freedom, it must be matched by a sense of responsibility. It is a responsibility not to use a passport given by <Col N="204" /> Ireland in order to go to a country which is anathema to the majority of nations.</P>
    <P>The system of Government operated in South Africa is not acceptable to people who have respect for human rights. The system of Government in South Africa involves also, because of the system of segregation and separation, separation in sport. The system operated there is not acceptable to people who have regard for the equality of men and women and for the dignity of human beings. To use an Irish passport for the purpose of insulting those principles is totally unacceptable. That is why I join with representatives of all parties in making another appeal to the Irish Rugby Football Union not to go ahead with the proposed tour of South Africa. I believe they will find many other opportunities in which our young sportsmen will be able to compete with their fellows of all nations, colours and races throughout the world. If they were to step down from their decision that they have already made in this regard nobody would fault them except the segregationist regime in South Africa. The rest of the world would applaud them. I believe that the most genuine sportsmen in Ireland, not only those interested in rugby but those interested in other sports too, would applaud them for making a decision as a result, I presume, of the enlightenment which they have obtained over the last few months. This is a very serious matter. They have now an opportunity to put things right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate here has been very constructive because it is quite evident from the whole tenor of the discussion that there is a civilised unanimity on this matter amongst all of us here in this House. For that reason I regard this as a very timely and important debate coming at a very crucial period of decision with regard to this matter. I congratulate the proposers of the motion and I welcome the very valuable contributions which have been made up to now from all sides of the House and I am sure that that will be the situation until the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> At the outset I would like to say, however, that, while I agree with the basic thrust of the motion, I have reservations about the call for a unilateral trade and commercial boycott which I will explain later when I come to deal with the question of sanctions against South Africa and the amendment which the Government have put down. The debate is timely not just because of the proposed rugby tour of South Africa but also &mdash; I mean this very seriously &mdash; because I sense that we are approaching a historically crucial period over the development of Southern Africa as a whole. The actions taken by black South Africans in support of their demands for an end to the repressive system under which they are forced to live, are intensifying and so too are the counter measures adopted by White South Africians to protect the regime and system against the pressure by the majority. I believe, and all my information is to that effect, that the recent interventions by the South African armed forces in Angola and Mozambique in support of apartheid and South African's illegal occupation of Namibia are a real threat to the stability of the region and to international peace and security.</P>
    <P>How we in Ireland and the international community generally respond to the demand of black South Africa and how we react to the threat created by the policies of the South African Government will be a very real test of our adherence to the basic principles of human rights and a measure of our commitment to peace and justice throughout the world, principles which we have advocated in international fora over the years. The debate is important also because not alone does it afford the House an opportunity to express the degree of national opposition, which I welcome, to the proposed rugby tour, but it also enables us to examine the nature of apartheid and our response to it as a nation and to discuss the implications of the tour for Ireland's international reputation and for Irish sport.</P>
    <P>All speakers in this debate from all sides of the House have condemned apartheid. We should ask ourselves what it is about the apartheid system that <Col N="206" /> enables us to transcend political and party differences. Why does it evoke such a strong and unequivocal response? The answer must be that all of us here in the House recognise that racial discrimination is a threat to the whole lot of us and that apartheid, which is a wrongfully unique political expression of racist philosophies, is a threat to the very basis of human rights and to the democratic values to which we all in this House subscribe. We can change our politics but we cannot, no more than the black South African, change the colour of our skin.</P>
    <P>In South Africa an individual is classed at birth on the basis of the colour of his skin and assigned by the white administration to one of four racial groups. That decision fixes irrevocably his or her destiny and the fact of being assigned to one or other group determines once and for all the entire course of his or her life down to the smallest detail. As the system works, if he or she is classified as white he or she will join a minority of five million people, 17 per cent of the total population, who occupy 85 per cent of the land and enjoy a complete monopoly of politicial, social, economic and any other power that one wants to think of. If he or she is assigned to one of the non-white racial groups he or she will join the majority of over 20 million but will not have the right to vote or participate in Government, and will have restrictions in regard to his or her place of residence. He or she will be denied the right of any movement, assembly and association of free expression and will have to endure, as a result of deliberate Government policy over which he or she has no control, inferior housing, public health and education as well as rudimentary cultural and sports facilities.</P>
    <P>These are the facts of life in that country and that is all in the name of &mdash; a phrase used in South African terminology &mdash;&ldquo;separate development&rdquo; The South African Government again claim that this is a &ldquo;logical&rdquo; response &mdash; the word used by them &mdash; to the specific conditions in South Africa. All of us here would agree that the logic is entirely spurious and wrong. &ldquo;Separate development&rdquo; is a euphemism. The regime is <Col N="207" /> racist in philosophy, in intent and in practice. I am being factual about the situation. South Africa is the only state in the world which has built its political system on race. This needs to be emphasised. It is the only state in the world that has done so with the avowed objective of assuring the dominance of the white ruling group and of perpetuating the inferior social, economic and political status of the majority black and mixed race population. Such a system can be sustained and maintained only by repression, and this is what has happened there under the whole organisation of the state in South Africa.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder therefore, that the regime has had to construct, by reason of that, a complex network of controls and laws which permeate every facet of South African life. In pursuance of that unfortunate, ill-intentioned and malign objective they have had to have recourse to brutal security measures and these have resulted in numerous deaths, hundreds of long-term political prisoners and suffering by millions of people. This is the unfortunate and real outcome and logic of &ldquo;separate development&rdquo; or apartheid.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence as the South African government and others sometimes assert, that real and substantial improvements have taken place or are likely to take place. It is true that there have been some changes &mdash; and any change which improves the wretched lot, however slightly, of the black South African is of course to be welcomed. There have been some miniscule changes in that respect, but all the evidence suggests that the intention is not the abolition of the apartheid system but rather the adjustment of it. Whatever minimal changes are suggested, they are merely to meet the changing economic requirements of South Africa rather than any point of principle or morality, or a real approach to dealing with the problem. The fundamental principles and mechanisms of apartheid remain entrenched in the system.</P>
    <P>How can it be, one may ask, that after years of condemnation at the United Nations, countless debates and numerous <Col N="208" /> resolutions in which Ireland has participated with other like-minded sensible countries, the apartheid system remains intact? Could it be that the answer is just that &mdash; resolutions, condemnation and debates are just not enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect so. Let us be unanimous. Necessary as they are, they are no substitute for concerted or sustained action. That brings me to the question I posed in my opening remarks. How can we in Ireland help the black South African to achieve his demands for equality and justice by peaceful means? How can we help to avert an escalation of violence throughout Southern Africa with its consequent very serious risks to world peace?</P>
      <P>First, we must continue to assert that apartheid is unacceptable and that we totally reject South Africa's claims to speak for and defend our values. The South African regime must be under no illusion that the colour of their skin or a shared European history blind us to the fact that they represent a totalitarian ideology and a threat to democracy. The Government have already made this clear at the United Nations and elsewhere and I believe that this debate, which unites the whole House, will underscore this fact.</P>
      <P>Second, we must continue our assistance to the victims of racism in South Africa. The Government here for a number of years contributed to the United Nations South Africa fund and I am happy to say that we will this year be maintaining our level of contribution to these funds at £35,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, we must seek out ways at international level to increase the pressure for change within South Africa. I would like at this point to refer to the Government's amendment to the Motion before us. While I go along with the general philosophy behind the motion, I am not convinced that action of the kind proposed in the motion &mdash; that is, a unilateral Irish commercial and trade boycott &mdash; would at this time help significantly towards our objective, which is an end to the apartheid <Col N="209" /> system. That is what I am concerned with. I am being very candid here. I do not think the motion will be progressive in that direction. Indeed, it could be counterproductive and Deputy Quinn, while I respect the philosophy behind his thinking, will agree with me on this, as well.</P>
    <P>Instead of unilateral action of the kind proposed in the Labour Party Motion, we should concentrate our energies to achieving the maximum international pressure, through co-ordinated measures agreed by the international community and implemented through the force of international law. That is why Ireland has consistently supported the arms embargo against South Africa and will in the forthcoming Security Council debate on the issue, which is pending very shortly, seek to strengthen that embargo. That is why we support early Security Council action on an oil embargo and on a ban on new foreign investment in South Africa. We are prepared to consider any further action that may be proposed by the international community. However, I would emphasise that such action must be carefully worked out and properly co-ordinated if it is to win support in the Security Council and be implemented successfully. These are the facts of life which operate within the United Nations. Weak or ineffective sanctions would signal to South Africa that the world community is weak and half-hearted in its response to its policies and confirm South Africa &mdash; I say this very advisedly &mdash; confirm South Africa in its belief that it can continue to ignore the demands for change. Whatever we devise, we must have a multilateral United Nations response which is practicable and needful.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment seeks to highlight our active and determined pursuit of effective, internationally agreed measures. As such I believe it would commend itself to the House. It goes further than that. The amendment also emphasises the other efforts of the Government to persuade South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies, which brings me to the question of the action we can take here at home.</P>
    <P>We must act domestically in support of <Col N="210" /> our international efforts. The Government have taken steps at the national level consistent with their international stand. The House will be aware that Ireland does not maintain diplomatic relations with South Africa and that no official encouragement is given to the promotion of economic relations with that country. In a positive vein we have in our development co-operation programme deliberately sought to assist in the economic development of the states neighbouring South Africa, so that they can reduce their dependence on South Africa, and, if need be, withstand the effects of sanctions. Our whole thrust of development aid has been precisely in these weaker black African countries adjacent to South Africa itself. I mention Lesotho, Ruanda, Burundi and Tanzania in this context. In addition, the Government have consistently discouraged sporting contacts with South Africa and have taken action in recent years to ensure that racially selected South African teams could not participate in sports events in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why sport, it can be asked. Naturally, we are a sporting people and no one would question that. It is clear from the analysis I have mentioned and the analysis which has been made by previous speakers to this debate, that the very nature of apartheid results in racial discrimination which permeates every facet of life in South Africa and that racial principles are dominant in all areas of political, economic and social activity. In South Africa, sport and politics cannot be divorced by reason of the very nature of the system there, because genuine non-racial sport is impossible while the apartheid system lasts.</P>
    <P>But it goes further than this. Sport in South Africa is not just a passive indicator of the political system. It is an instrument of the system and is actively pursued internationally as a means of gaining international recognition for the South African Government and its policies. The visits to Ireland in recent months of apologists for the South African regime demonstrate more eloguently than words the fact that in South Africa politics and sport are inseparable. That is a fact of life <Col N="211" /> within the South African community. That is why over the past ten years South Africa has been excluded from numerous international sports organisations and from the Olympic Games, why national sports organisations have refused contact with their South African counterparts and why governments have acted to prevent South African teams competing in their country and have sought to dissuade national teams from travelling to South Africa to compete there. The successful isolation of South African sport in recent years has encouraged those working for peaceful change within South Africa and has brought home in a very concrete way to the South African Government and to the white population there that the international community will not, cannot, under any circumstances, accept the continuance of apartheid.</P>
    <P>In this context, taking what I have said into consideration and what has been said in the course of this debate, the proposed IRFU rugby tour in May acquires major significance from the wrong point of view as the first tour by a &ldquo;home&rdquo; rugby football team since the early seventies. There can be little doubt that the ending of South Africa's isolation in rugby would be widely received in South Africa as representing the normalisation of relations with countries such as Ireland. Thus, a critical test of this country's international susceptibility is one way of looking at it, and of South Africa's susceptibility is another way of looking at it. The tour is not a sporting event. That is the point I am making. It is, whether or not the players and organisers choose to regard it as such, a political act and that again, to use the common phase, is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>Since the rugby union announced their decision to proceed with the tour there has been widespread reaction throughout the country and the Government's opposition to the tour has been expressed on several occasions by myself and others. Deputy Quinn in the course of the debate yesterday evening listed numerous bodies which have publicly declared their objection. There is no need for me to itemise them now. Sufficient to say they <Col N="212" /> include almost all the representative organisations in the country, all the political parties, all the churches, the trade union movement as well as organisations involved in very constructive missionary and aid activities in which Ireland, because of our particular background and tradition, has played a very real and constructive role, not just recently but over many years.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that this sort of momentum of support should have arisen. Our historical experience helps us to identify with the victims of oppression and colonialism wherever they are found and in whatever form they are practised. The foreign policy of successive Irish Governments has sought to respond to such oppression and colonialism by supporting the process of decolonisation in Africa and Asia and the promotion of peace, justice and human rights throughout the world. As a result we have rightly earned as a nation an international reputation of which we can be proud. That reputation is now at some risk because of the attitude being adopted by the particular people who propose to go ahead with this tour.</P>
    <P>International reaction to the tour has been as loud and clear and sustained as the national reaction. The tour has been raised at the United Nations and at the European Parliament. It has been condemned by the Organisation for African Unity, by the UN Special Committee against Apartheid and the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa and by many African States, including Nigeria. The strength of this reaction should not be underestimated. The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, which organised the boycott of the Montreal Olympics in 1976, in response to a New Zealand rugby tour in South Africa has said and I quote:</P>
    <P>Should the Irish Rugby Football Union in defiance of its government and world opinion undertake a playing tour of racist South Africa this year Africa will reserve the right to reconsider her participation in all sporting events in which the supporters of and collaborators with racist South Africa are also a part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> The peoples of Africa view the apartheid system as an affront to their dignity and an insult to their worth as human beings. They cannot understand how a single sports organisation can act in defiance of representative opinion throughout the country. They are prepared to act to defend their dignity and their sense of human values. It is a basic effort and they have thecapacity to affect our interests in a very practical way.</P>
    <P>With a view to protecting our interests by taking steps to ensure that the governments of other countries, particularly Africa and the international bodies to which I have referred, the Supreme Council for Sport in South Africa are kept informed of the government's position and of the actions we have taken to persuade the IRFU to cancel the tour. We have done this through our embassies throughout the world and, in particular, in black Africa itself.</P>
    <P>That action has not been inconsiderable. I have tried to persuade the IRFU so far as one can logically. I met members of the IRFU and explained the position in detail in regard to the Government's opposition to the tour and spelled out the divisive situation that would arise and has arisen since then from their own point of view. The Minister for sport has informed the Irish union that their application for State aid cannot be approved as long as their present policy and sporting contact with South Africa is maintained. Special leave will not be granted to any State employee to enable him to participate and a further concrete demonstration of our governmental disapproval and the disapproval of the whole House was demonstrated by our decision not to attend at Lansdowne Road.</P>
    <P>It is not easy, as previous speakers have said, to ask young Irish rugby players to forego an opportunity of playing the game they love. It is something one does not like asking them to do, but I want to put the other side of the coin. I applaud the players who, as a matter of conscience, have taken a stance and decided not to participate in the tour and I want to take this occasion to thank them and applaud them for being outstanding Irishmen <Col N="214" /> in that respect. The team that travels to South Africa if the tour does take place &mdash; I hope it will not &mdash; will not have the support of the majority of the Irish people and cannot be said to be representative of the Irish people. This debate has made that clear. It is not often we have a situation in which there is unanimity in the House. I will be meeting the IRFU at a final meeting this week and I will emphasise that the outcome of the debate here reflects very genuinely and sincerely the strength of feeling among the democratically elected representatives of the people against the tour and I shall ask the rugby union not to proceed with the tour in the interests of justice, in the interests of Ireland's international reputation and also in the interests of Irish sport.</P>

      <P>While I consider it to be of the utmost importance that the IRFU should be under no illusion whatsoever as to the strength of feeling within the House about the participation in this tour, nevertheless it is important that we should also be under no illusion that there is a great schizophrenia, politically speaking, here and in the western world about what is happening in South Africa. Many politicians, including with respect the Minister for Foreign Affairs, work themselves into a white sweat of moral indignation about South Africa and we go through a ritualistic exercise in Dáil Éireann and declare our general abhorrence. Then we go to the United Nations and deliver well-rounded and impressively-worded resolutions of condemnation. By the time we finish there we have to go to the European Parliament and once again there we deplore the fascist regime. We then go to an EEC meeting of Ministers and reiterate our condemnation. Before we know where we are, we have a meeting of the Lomé Convention where we assist in a general way the countries facing the regime in South Africa and once more we declare our liberality, our objection to and condemnation of South Africa. Our capacity for self-deception grows with each successive meeting &mdash; not just the capacity for self-delusion of the present Minister for Foreign Affairs but of successive Ministers <Col N="215" /> for Foreign Affairs &mdash; because while the Minister comes in and wrings his hand in deep sorrow about the travesty of human rights, when it comes to supporting a small amendment here it is another matter. The amendment merely asks the Government &mdash; and I quote the final two lines of the Labour Party motion &ldquo;to take steps to introduce an immediate and effective boycott on all commercial and trading links with South Africa.&rdquo; We have not defined what these steps should be; we have left it broad and general.</P>
      <P>If I were in the Minister's position and had Cabinet sanction I would say: &ldquo;We import about £12 million worth of commodities from South Africa each year. We will take half of these imports, fresh and dried oranges, other fresh fruit, fruit and nuts prepared and preserved. Of these categories we import £5.4 million worth a year.&rdquo; Overnight, if this glorious country were seriously concerned about doing something about apartheid in South Africa and helping to get this odious system out of the international community we need only say to the Irish people: &ldquo;We shall now take steps to reduce by 50 per cent our imports from South Africa.&rdquo; Deputy Lenihan would go to Clondalkin and tell the ladies in the supermarkets: &ldquo;Sorry, Ireland has taken steps to eliminate 50 per cent of our trade with South Africa and from next week we will not have any oranges and you will not have other fresh fruit in the mornings. You will not have fruit and nuts for the children at Hallowee'n. This will contribute to a 50 per cent reduction in Irish trade with South Africa. We in Ireland, this glorious, Christian, liberated Republic will make such a contribution against apartheid&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister says here: &ldquo;We can only reduce the distribution of fruit and nuts from South Africa in the Republic of Ireland on a multilateral basis.&rdquo; The Minister's amendment says &ldquo;... and supports the Government in their efforts, including the pursuit of internationally agreed measures&rdquo;. Ireland must have another multilateral piece of schizophrenia in terms of doing something about South Africa. I have been personally long <Col N="216" /> involved in this area, since 1957 when I first became a trade union official and had to argue with dockers at branch committee meetings as to why we should not import slave-labour oranges into the docks in Dublin. When I subsequently became the first secretary of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement I heard the arguments over and over again. Regrettably in 1980, having seen this go on for over 20 years, I have come to the conclusion that when the blood bath and holocaust occurs in South Africa &mdash; personally I have little doubt now that it will occur &mdash; the Minister will probably say: &ldquo;My God, I never knew we were really on the wrong side. It did not dawn on me. I thought we were doing the right thing. When we went to the UN, to the European Parliament and the Lomé Convention and so on, we thought we were doing the right thing. There is no doubt that, as in the other states of Africa which liberated themselves in the sixties and seventies, in the eighties South Africa will liberate itself probably according to all the indications at this stage by way of bloody revolution.</P>
    <P>It is easy for us on the outside to say that. The decision about such a revolution will be taken within the country. It is not for us to propose that there should be a revolution. The people fighting for liberation in that country will take that decision democratically. But it looks that way. In fact, I can imagine President Reagan coming to Minister Lenihan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Freudian slip on my part &mdash; Deputy Lenihan if he is shadow Minister on the other side &mdash; and saying to the Minister of the day: &ldquo;We must support the white regime and the present democratic though admittedly minority Government in South Africa with American arms, American guns and American threats because you would never know what the Russians might do; the Russians are supporting the other side.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be brutally frank: the odds are that the majority of the black people of South Africa do not need the Russians, <Col N="217" /> the Irish or the Americans. They know what they want and they will do it just as the other independent states of Africa by and large did not have to avail of Russian help but did what they wanted themselves and were beholden to nobody. Indeed they have a jaundiced respect for the role of Ireland in that period. When the revolution finally explodes &mdash; and it is now on as is evident from any analysis of the situation in South Africa &mdash; and when the situation comes to full fruition, I have little doubt that the black majority will face the combined onslaught particularly of the multinational weaponry which will be placed at the disposal of the current regime because as everybody in Ireland knows and as every multinational company knows, when it comes to uranium, gold or the strategic geograpical location of that country, it is an international war and the war will take place on that soil. The Russians, who have gold and uranium, are not particularly preoccupied about what happens there. They know they will not lose but that the West will lose, and the West are already losing catastrophically in that area. I would like to visit that country, but I never dared even apply for a visa since the sixties. A number of us hope to have an opportunity in the eighties of going there and meeting the representatives of a democratic government. Some of us might not have to indulge in the wringing of hands in sorrow, a practice which is carried out in this country.</P>
    <P>This is the most important international test case for the international community in the history of the world. That might sound a sweeping statement but with international capital working in that country, there is the exploitation of precious world commodities of gold and uranium involved. There is a lot at stake in terms of what will emerge as the ultimate form of government in that country, whether it be an extreme form of socialism, which I very much doubt, or a national republic of a democratic social form, which I think will emerge. All these things are playing themselves out now in South Africa in the most stark form that could be imagined.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to expect the <Col N="218" /> IRFU to be preoccupied about such an issue. I do not know how we are going to suggest that their participation in this international match is a form of diluted endorsement of what is happening in South Africa now. Obviously they are impervious to that kind of political understanding and argument, and all the indications are that the tour is going ahead.</P>
    <P>We should put a number of things on record. We could congratulate the rugby players who decided, on principle, not to go. They understand the situation. We could also congratulate the many national organisations, church people of all denominations and other national and international bodies, who have decided to add their voices of condemnation in suggesting to the Irish people that they should not travel to South Africa for this sporting occasion. One has to face many different kinds of criticism when condemning this trip. I have been asked why we are being so hypocritically selective. What about Chile? What about Russia? What about E1 Salvador? What about Argentina and the World Cup? The only answer I can give is that issues must be taken as they are put before us in a particular context. I do not feel particularly selective. I go to the Council of Europe as an Irish delegate with my four fellow Irishmen and if the Soviet Union are persecuting Jews, as they are doing and have done, I have no hesitation as a Social Democrat in denouncing that form of discrimination and denial of human rights. The denial of human rights does not have a geographical boundary and therefore I do not feel I am being selective about South Africa. Those who allege we are being hypocritically selective are really telling us to be quiet and not get involved. I hope my sentiments are conveyed to some of those who are hypocritically selective, such as the American President in relation to E1 Salvador where there is a degree of selectivity and hypocrisy which we in Ireland would not accept.</P>
    <P>No matter how selective one might want to be in relation to the denial of human rights throughout the world, South Africa is the only country where it does not matter if a man is a Communist, <Col N="219" /> a Christian, a Mohommedan, a Jew, an agnostic or an Irish converted Catholic. If he is black, that is it. Ideology, political beliefs, whether you are for or against the Government do not matter. In South Africa one unique characteristic applies, namely, colour. That determines everything. On that basis South Africa is unique and deserves condemnation even, I suggest, a selective condemnation.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I support this motion. We will be voting in favour of it. I thought the Government's decision to put down an amendment was ill-advised because all we asked was that steps be taken. In my view the Minister should not press his amendment; all we are asking him to do is take steps. If he does not press his amendment we will not press a division and we could have unanimity on this matter, because unanimity is important. The Government will have to decide what steps to take. I do not think the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, is going to lose one shilling of national investment should we take the necessary steps. It is important that the international press, particularly the press in South Africa, should know that we in Dáil Éireann were unanimous in condemning this proposed trip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that unanimity should be established and I am very glad to accept that proviso quickly. It is very satisfying to know that there is competition between us as to the severity of the condemnation, expressed on both sides of this House, of racialism in South Africa. I have already congratulated the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his speech, on his consistent policy on this matter and on his position in the United Nations. I would like to remind people of the stand taken by his predecessor, Deputy Andrews, on a number of occasions which were on the same lines &mdash; a condemnation of this type of racialism and an appeal to the IRFU not to disgrace <Col N="220" /> the name of our people all over the world by going to South Africa.</P>
      <P>I am old enough to remember being advised not to go to Hitler's Germany for much the same reason because we would be spending money and supporting a racialist and anti-semitic society. The horrible sequence to that, which Deputy Desmond suggested is inevitable in South Africa, is something through which I have already lived when the horrible forces of racialism were destroyed in Germaney during the war period.</P>
      <P>I am particularly glad to support the Labour Party motion because I and Deputy Jack McQuillan made a similar suggestion about 25 years ago to the then Taoiseach, Seán Lemass. It is very satisfying that there is unanimity tonight on the idea that we must try to bring every possible pressure to bear on these people to stop them going to South Africa.</P>
      <P>Because of our historical background as a colonial society, we suffered because of our race and religious beliefs, especially during penal times, the kind of oppression which black Africans are now suffering. We have been through all this. Very few western societies have been through an experience which is such a precise microcosm of the kind of humiliation and degradation which the black African suffers at present.</P>
      <P>I recall that during the war I was moved by something which was done by a king. As a socialist it is unusual that I would find it worthwhile complimenting such a person. The person concerned was the King of Denmark who wore the star of David on his sleeve. If it were possible for us to do it we should claim to be black Africans and expect to be treated in the same way. There is no difference whatsoever, and the attempt to create any kind of discrimination on the question of colour is quite as outrageous as it was in relation to race or religion or many of the other issues we have discussed here from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if there is any way in which we can make it difficult for these people to go to South Africa. I share the Labour Party's belief that we need to do rather more than simply say that we regret the <Col N="221" /> decision of the IRFU or that we are sorry about apartheid. Sacrifices probably need to be made. As a small nation and as one of the non-committed nations we should give leadership because it is very difficult for the great nations to take up an independent position, especially when enromous amounts of money are probably involved. Moral leadership could be shown by small countries like ours. It may be idealist and Utopian but if we were in the ideal society we should not do business with these people. It is not as if we would have to deprive ourselves of goods which we buy from South Africa. There are alternative sources of supply and there are alternative markets for the goods we export to South Africa. I do not believe it would require sacrifice on our part. There is no doubt that goods we buy from South Africa are made available as a result of the use of slave labour. The development of a serious trade union movement has been prohibited or restricted and the unfortunate people who are creating the end product are doing so in conditions of such humiliation and degradation that we are depraving ourselves if we take any part in it by purchasing these goods.</P>
    <P>During the thirties many of us sought to close off the fascist countries by cutting down on trade and other relationships with them in the social or recreational sphere. There is no doubt that above any other nation we were associated with the marvellous power of the boycott movement rather than the gun and destruction.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is a semi-State body. Is it not possible for us through the trade union movement to see that these people cannot fly to South Africa or cannot travel there by our ships? I sincerely hope that this will be the decision of the trade union movement and that they will not allow these people to go to South Africa unless they walk or swim there. They should not be allowed to use any of the semi-State institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A very cosy series of condemnations of apartheid and the IRFU tour have developed in the course of this debate. I have to question the <Col N="222" /> credibility and sincerity of the Government on this issue.</P>
      <P>In December last at the general assembly of the United Nations a motion was proposed calling for an end to all sporting contacts with South Africa. One hundred and thirty-one nations supported that resolution which re-affirmed the importance of a complete cessation of all sports exchanges with South Africa in the campaign for the elimination of apartheid. It emphasised the urgent need for an international convention against apartheid in sport. It condemned sporting organisations which collaborated with South Africa. As I said, one hundred and thirty-one nations supported that resolution but in going through the list of those countries I did not see the name of Ireland. Fifteen nations abstained on that resolution; Deputy Lenihan and his Government abstained. It is important that in debating this issue we should know what happened in the name of our country at the general assembly of the UN. We have heard much talk about the commitment of this Government to the principles of peace and justice which they are alleged to be advocating in the international fora. I am ashamed that this Government did not on 15 December last at the United Nations support the resolution calling for an end to all sporting contacts with South Africa. I must say the credibility of Deputy Lenihan and the Government in speaking to the IRFU and in calling on them to cancel the tour must be very suspect to those with whom the Minister is having discussions.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have been consistent on this issue. Reference has been made to the Soviet Union where there is a major denial of human rights. At a very early stage Fine Gael advocated that this country should not support the Moscow Olympics, a view based in particular on the invasion by the Soviets of Afghanistan. Ultimately we were followed by the Government after months of dithering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this issue of South Africa, I strongly support measures to ensure that we do not support, or are not seen to support, the apartheid system in that country. If there is anyone in the IRFU who will listen to us, I join with the other politicians <Col N="223" /> in this House in a last minute appeal to them to cancel the tour. I do this for two major reasons. The first is because of human rights which has been dealt with very suitably here and we agree with the sentiments expressed on this matter. A unique system exists in South Africa where, as a matter of public policy, a society is built on a political system of race. The regime is committed to strengthening the existing system through the establishment of states of the Bantustans, by abolishing the citizenship rights of the blacks and by the forcible removal of millions of people who do not accept this racialist system. We cannot support that and we add our condemnation to what has been said about it.</P>
    <P>There is another reason I make this final appeal to the IRFU not to go to South Africa. I spent many years playing rugby and enjoyed it. I have discussed the question of the tour with many people who are still playing rugby and who administer the game. I say to them that this country will be damaged internationally if the tour goes ahead. I know that is a selfish reason but we are Irishmen and we want to do the best we can for our country. To those people who so proudly wear the green jersey at Lansdowne Road I want to give them the clear message that they are damaging the country. Even if they do not accept they are damaging the country, they must accept there is a danger they may do so. I say to the rugby men that they should not consciously damage the country or put it in danger of being damaged. For that rather selfish but patriotic reason I add my voice to those who have asked them not to go ahead with the tour.</P>
    <P>If, despite all the appeals, they decide to go ahead with the tour. I accept that there can be no question of the withdrawal of passports. The major difference between our country and countries such as the Soviet Union and South Africa is that we are a free, democratic society and there can be no question of adopting measures that would be taken in those countries.</P>
    <P>I must go back to where I began. The Government would have had far more <Col N="224" /> credibility in their appeal to the IRFU if they had followed it through in the United Nations last December and had added the name of Ireland to the 131 nations who supported the resolution for an end to all sporting contacts with South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party and on behalf of the black people of South Africa who have asked us to sponsor this motion, I should like to extend our thanks and appreciation to all of those people who have spoken in favour of the principle of non-collaboration with the racist regime in South Africa and who have spoken against the tour.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has rightly said, and as was stated by the mover of the amendment on behalf of the Government, let us recognise and celebrate the area in which we are in full agreement. I was glad to hear the Minister's announcement tonight that yet again he will meet the IRFU executive towards the end of the week. I do not doubt his own powers of persuasion but on foot of what no doubt will be a motion passed by this House, I ask him to involve the Taoiseach at some stage in this matter, to emphasise quite clearly the Government's view. I am saying this in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has taken an active role in other areas of Government policy and administration. I trust the Minister will accept this suggestion in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRFU should be left in no doubt that if they persist in going to South Africa they are not going in my name, in the name of the Labour Party, in the name of anyone in this House or in the name of the Irish people whom we represent here. The tour does not have the support of all the organisations that were referred to and after tonight it will be formally condemned by way of motion in this House. I thank the Minister for clearly identifying that and for communicating it to various countries throughout the world. I trust that the journalists and the representatives in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery will recognise <Col N="225" /> the strength of feeling on this matter by all parties.</P>
    <P>Having said that we are against the tour&mdash;I recognise that we are all agreed on that&mdash;in the remaining time I shall try to focus on the area on which we do not seem to be in agreement because the Government have seen fit to amend our motion. In consultation with the International Affairs Committee of my party and with representatives of the trade union movement here, we discussed seriously the question of sanctions to be taken against South Africa. We discussed this matter in the terms mentioned by Deputy O'Donoghue last night. There are real problems.</P>
    <P>The phrasing of the last clause in the motion which seems to have caused some difficulty calls on the Government to take steps to introduce an immediate and effective boycott on all commercial and trading links with South Africa. We are a small country and our trade is insignificant in international terms. Our sporting links with South Africa are far more significant than our trading links. The argument of the IRFU executive is, why pick on sport, why not apply this right across the board? That is a bad argument. All sporting and other links should be broken off until such time as white South Africa mends its ways.</P>
    <P>Ireland being able to argue vigorously and aggressively, whether it be from our new position in the Security Council or in the EEC or in the Council of Ministers, that we have done it, that we have imposed a trade boycott, gives us some extra leverage that we do not now possess. Though I congratulated the Government last night on their vigorous stand on 6 March on Resolution Draft L/59, it was in marked contrast to the abstention of different Ministers for Foreign Affairs, not the current incumbent.</P>
    <P>What is the import of the last clause of our motion? It calls on the Government to take steps to introduce an effective boycott. As Deputy Desmond has said, we could start by pointing out that we invented the mechanism of boycotts in Ireland. We should start by refusing to buy South African produce and replace it with other replaceable produce. Of the <Col N="226" /> £12.136 million imports from South Africa in 1979, £5.4 million worth were oranges, fruit and nuts. Surely they are replaceable. If we were to go to the Organisation of National Unity, to the group of seven countries and to the EEC and say we wish to replace these imports from South Africa on a planned basis, and if we asked them to assist us and to facilitate us, everybody knows that the alternative markets and suppliers are there.</P>
    <P>to put profits into the hands of the South Africans. This could be done without cost of Irish jobs because the same dockers would be employed to handle Israeli oranges or Nigerian oranges or Zimbabwe oranges, wherever the oranges happen to come from. If we start there our import trade with South Africa will begin to be reduced. These steps we are asking the Government to take would be co-ordinated with two principles in mind, to have the maximum effect on the South African economy so that we would bring home to the South Africans that we no longer wish to put profit into their hands, and at the same time not to add to the disastrous total of 126,000 unemployed here.</P>
    <P>Then we would have to look at the question of exports to the South African economy. Out of the £8.3 million we exported to South Africa according to 1979 statistics, exactly £3 million were pharmaceutical products. The Irish pharmaceutical industry, though it employs Irish workers, is generally controlled by the same multi-national corporations that have heavily invested capital in South Africa in the last 20 years. We might have some difficulty in preventing them from exporting to South Africa, but that should not deter us from attempting to do it.</P>
    <P>All the motion is asking the Government to do is to take steps to introduce an effective and immediate boycott on all commercial and trading links with South Africa. The Government argued last night and again tonight that Ireland on its own, acting unilaterally, will not carry much clout. As Deputy O'Donoghue argued reasonably accurately, it would do some damage at home at a time when <Col N="227" /> we cannot afford any more damage to our economy.</P>
    <P>However, we can do two things if the Government accept the resolution. We can start to take the steps, first with imports from South Africa. We would be doing that with the full support and encouragement of the African National Congress in South Africa who have called for such a boycott. Indeed our very first step should be to insist that produce coming into this country would be labelled accurately. If you try to buy orange juice in any supermarket we find it described as the produce of divers countries, which is a sure sign that it has come from South Africa. We would leave it to the discretion of the Government to decide the rate and the pace of these steps and thereby we would be beginning what I believe to be the last chapter of the struggle against South Africa. Unequivocally and clearly we would be on the side of those around the world who have made the choice that they will not in any way give tacit, explicit or silent support to the economic base of Southern Africa.</P>
    <P>Now I come to what is my fear not just in regard to this administration but to the previous administration since we went into the EEC. Because of the scale and the extent of EEC economic investment in South Africa, Ireland, whether in European political co-operation or in the Council or in the United Nations, seems to have lost its voice on this question to an extent which Frank Aiken would not recognise if he was alive today. We need to get back on board with those countries who not only claim they are neutral but who make their neutrality something that is real and perceptible to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>If we are to take advantage of the historical position of this country and our current proclaimed position of neutrality, we must clearly side progressively and actively with the African countries and the non-aligned countries in the United Nations on this issue. For various reasons and at different times, different administrations have found reason for abstention in the UN, and I exclude the present incumbent in Iveagh House in this <Col N="228" /> regard. We may agree with 90 per cent of a resolution but we find some clause in it that makes us unhappy, and we abstain. The Labour Party do not believe that Ireland any longer can afford to indulge in that kind of debating nicety.</P>
    <P>The last chapter will be written with the collapse of the <i>Cordon Sanitaire</i> around Southern Africa. Angola, Mozambique and finally Zimbabwe have rung the bell for the last chapter in the struggle for human liberation in Southern Africa. Then Southern African racism will have gone from the face of the globe.</P>
    <P>We have a very clear choice in the next 20 years. This sovereign republic can decide clearly to identify itself by deed as well as by mouth with that group of nations who will be in there at the beginning of that last chapter. The refusal of the Government to take steps to introduce an immediate effective boycott can be said to be an indication of our unwillingness to put our money where our mouth is. How will that affect the country if we want to talk foreign policies in terms of national self-interest?</P>
    <P>If we do not take a clear position on this we will be damaging the credible and perceived international identity of the country. We will be damaging our potential to act as a mediator and broker in the EEC which is the largest single trading bloc in the world. Whatever potential there is for an independent Irish foreign policy which would complement the whole North-South dialogue will be blunted and diminished by our self-censorship and subservience to the economic needs of our partners in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Irish history is full of songs, stories, tragedies of Irish people who lived in exile throughout the world and who travelled to France, Spain or America seeking assistance from those countries for the liberation of this State and this island. In some countries we got help, in others we did not. In the final analysis we liberated ourselves in the same way as the people of Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The people of South Africa will eventually liberate themselves, and as a free liberated people they will remember as a major economic power in the world countries who gave them aid and assistance <Col N="229" /> and support when they needed it and wanted it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter here tonight and to thank the Minister for coming in to hear me. I feel obliged to raise this difficult question, in view of the reply which I received to question No. 22 on Thursday, 26 February last, where I asked the Minister for Education if he would make a statement on the setting of examination papers in the colleges which are known collectively as the Dublin Institute of Technology and if he was aware of the contractual functions of academic staff regarding the setting of its examination papers. The Minister in his reply stated as follows:</P>
      <P>The Teachers' Union of Ireland, which is the recognised teacher organisation for the representation of the views of teachers in the third-level colleges administered by vocational education committee, has not informed me of a decision by teachers as mentioned in the question from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I found his reply extraordinary. By 25 February last, the dogs in the street knew there was a serious situation developing in the colleges of technology and other colleges attached to the VEC in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a letter delivered to him by academic staff dated 5 February 1981 which was signed by Mr. F.R. O'Neill, Chairman of the Dublin Colleges Academic Staff Association. In that letter, the Minister was informed that, because of a number of serious problems in the colleges which, together, constitute the Dublin Institute of Technology, members of that association refused to submit examination papers due on 2 February and that they had no intention of submitting these papers until reason prevailed in the Department. They also took up another matter in relation to examination papers and to their Easter break.</P>
    <P>I am very well aware of the historical situation in relation to the representation of teachers in these colleges. I fully acknowledge the part which the Teachers' Union of Ireland have played in representing academic and other staff in these colleges. I do not wish to be drawn into the argument in relation to the Dublin Colleges Academic Staff Association <i>vis-à-vis</i> The Teachers' Union of Ireland. I realise there is a problem, not only between the association and the TUI, but also between the association and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The association are not recognised either by the Minister or by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee as representing the staff. It is a delicate point and I do not wish to say anything that would exacerbate the situation. However, I am compelled to say that there are in excess of 5,000 full-time equivalent students attending colleges in Dublin, nearly all of whom are to sit examinations in the summer or autumn. Because of this dispute, they now face the possibility of not being able to sit examinations. The Minister has a responsibility to these students. I have a responsibility to highlight their plight. There is nothing more aggravating and <Col N="232" /> disappointing to a student who has worked hard throughout the academic year than to find at the end of the year that he or she is not able to sit an examination.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears not to want to become <i>au fait</i> with the situation, although by now he must be aware of the dispute. He has not done anything positive. He says he is awaiting the outcome of an arbitration hearing. I am satisfied that arbitration was necessary but, apparently, the arbitration hearing, as represented by the TUI, is not satisfactory to the academic staff association. I do not want to come between the association and the TUI. I do not want the Minister to represent me as being a divisive voice. My sole concern is the plight of the students attending these colleges. I want to give the Minister an opportunity of informing the House as to his intentions in relation to the setting of the examination papers and the taking of examination papers in these colleges in Dublin. He cannot ignore the present situation. There is an ongoing dispute. Whether the position is satisfactory to him or not, whether he wants to stick his head in the sand and recognise only the Teachers' Union of Ireland, he must take that decision. The House is entitled to know this position here tonight and as Opposition spokesman on behalf of the Fine Gael Party I want to know what the position is in regard to this dispute. What efforts is the Minister making to bring the two parties together in order to resolve the dispute? This thing has grown up because of an historical position in so far as these third level colleges arose really out of the second level colleges attached to the VECs. The Government down the years have got away on the cheap in respect of providing high quality third level courses in these colleges. The rates at which the college lecturers are being paid are something in the region of £2,000 to £3,000 less than those paid to their counterparts in a university college, and that is not acceptable any more. These people are providing high level courses in technology and doing an excellent job, yet the Government seem to be denying <Col N="233" /> them the level of pay which is demanded by equivalent lecturers in universities and in the NIHE. They are extremely dissatisfied with the position and will not put up with it any longer. People are also concerned about the space problem and the facilities in general in these colleges. For instance, I understand that 60 per cent of the course in the College of Commerce in Rathmines are given in pre-fabs. Surely that is unacceptable in third level education. The space available in Bolton Street and the College of Commmerce is only about 50 per cent, I understand, of the space required to ensure that the courses are properly provided for these third level students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I find in the White Paper an increase of 50 per cent in the enrolments, in the participation rates in these colleges. Tonight I am giving the Minister an opportunity to tell the House where he stands in this dispute and what course he is going to take to resolve it, and particularly to ensure that the examinations are set and that the students attending these colleges have the opportunity of sitting for these examinations about which, rightly, they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Collins for giving me an opportunity of making some points about this dispute. I crave to a certain extent his and the House's indulgence because certain positive and constructive measures are in the process of being taken now. These constructive measures of today and the next day or so will, in my opinion, bring about a resolution of this difficulty. I realise that Deputy Collins will not be fully <i>au fait</i> with such developments because they are so recent, and I appreciate the reasons for which he raised the issue in this debate on the Adjournment. I trust, however, that he will accept my assurance that all the parties with a legitimate right to be involved are fully committed to solving this problem <Col N="234" /> without delay.</P>
      <P>However, in my defence I must refute any suggestion that I have been remiss in any way in connection with dealing with these questions over the last few months. I have been very closely in touch with the situation and have made very positive interventions in the whole matter. The officials of my Department have indicated to the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the Irish Vocational Education Association during the course of various discussions my view as to how the matters at issue could be resolved in so far as they fall within the ambit of the Teachers' Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware and has mentioned that a claim in relation to salaries for teachers in the third level colleges was discussed recently at arbitration. The findings of the arbitration board have not yet been formally&mdash;I emphasise formally &mdash; made available. When they are received they shall have my immediate attention and the attention of the Government. It is open to the teachers' side to submit a claim to the conciliation council for a review of the terms of Agreed Report 14/79, provided the terms of the scheme are complied with in connection with any such submission. A meeting of the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee is due to be held tomorrow night, 26 March, and I understand that certain proposals in relation to the restructuring of the staff of the third level colleges in accordance with the terms of agreed Report 14/79 of the conciliation council will come before the committee for consideration and adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to conclude by exhorting all concerned to pay particular attention to the circumstances of the students, whose future prospects and careers should be of particular concern to their teachers. I may add that the examinations in these colleges are not Department of Education examinations. Responsibility for their proper conduct and the presentation of results is primarily a collegiate responsibility of the staff in association with the NCEA or any other relevant external professional examining body, but the failure to discharge this responsibility <Col N="235" /> will affect adversely the future of the students. It will also have lasting and detrimental consequences for the status <Col N="236" /> and reputation of the colleges.</P>

      <P>A Council decision of 18 March 1980 adopted a second programme on the management of radioactive wastes, 1980-84 to succeed a previous Community programme, 1975-79.

      <P>Following the 1973/74 energy crisis, negotiations among some of the industrialised countries, including Ireland, resulted, in November 1974, in an Agreement on an International Energy Programme. The purpose of the agreement was to strengthen co-operation on energy policy <Col N="118" /> among the participating countries. In order to administer the agreement, the International Energy Agency (IEA) was established in Paris as an autonomous body within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Ireland became a member of the agency on its establishment.</P>
      <P>The agency discharges its functions through a Governing Board and Management Committee, three Standing Groups, a number of subsidiary committees and a Secretariat. Ireland is represented on the Governing Board and Management Committee and on the Standing Groups as well as the more important subsidiary committees. Normally the Governing Body meets about four times a year at official level and approximately twice a year at Ministerial level.</P>
      <P>The three Standing Groups hold meetings roughly on a quarterly basis. Ireland has been represented at almost all meetings of these bodies since the agency was established.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the agency is to implement the International Energy Programme which provides for an oil allocation scheme in times of supply shortages, the maintenance of reserve stocks by participating countries, an information system on the international oil market, long-term co-operation on such matters as energy conservation, development of alternative sources of energy, the promotion of energy research and development, and relations with the oil producing countries. The agency carries out a review of the energy policies of participating countries on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the agency the International Energy Programme has been reviewed on a regular basis and a number of supplementary measures have been agreed among the participating countries with a view to alleviating supply difficulties in times of temporary shortages, the reduction of demand and the development of alternative sources of energy. Ireland has participated fully in these procedures and took a leading part in the activities of the agency during the two periods in which it held the Presidency of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No major proposals for the amendment <Col N="119" /> of the International Energy Programme have been made by Ireland or any of the participating countries since it was originally adopted in November 1974. Any amendment of a fundamental nature would involve the execution of a further international agreement.</P>

    <P>The EEC target ratio of 0.8 by 1985 is for the Community as a whole and does not necessarily set a target for any one country. GDP is only one relevant factor in determining energy consumption. There are a number of points which are very important in our case.</P>
    <P>1. We have a lower level of energy consumption per head of population than other more industrially advanced countries in the EEC.</P>
    <P>2. Our population growth is expected to be high.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Deasy</b> asked the Minister for Transport the action taken by Ireland on the promotion of public transport in an urban context under the EEC energy programme which was agreed in March 1976.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies are referring to the Council recommendation of 4 May 1976 on the rational use of energy in urban passenger transport, which sought, <i>inter alia,</i> to encourage the use of public transport.</P>
      <P>The Government are particularly conscious of the need to promote greater use of public transport services in urban areas for a number of reasons, including energy conservation. The greatest need and opportunities for the promotion of public transport exist in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Transport Consultative Commission, which presented its report on passenger transport services in the Dublin area in March 1980, paid special attention to energy matters. The Commission considered that the most effective conservation measures would be those aimed at achieving:</P>
      <P>(i) a greater utilisation and increased efficiency of public transport; (ii) a reduced but more effective use of private cars; (iii) improved traffic flow through better traffic management.</P>
      <P>A traffic management strategy based on the Commission's recommendations is at present being pursued by the specially appointed Dublin Transportation Task Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing measures the Government in 1979 approved the CIE proposals for the electrification of the Howth/Bray suburban rail service <Col N="126" /> which, when it becomes operational in 1983, will more than double the passenger capacity of the existing service. The choice of electric traction rather than diesel traction reflected the Government's concern to reduce dependence on oil in the urban transport sector.</P>

The distribution of the allocation will be decided as soon as possible.

      <P>It has been ascertained from the corporation that in relation to the Violet Hill Estate agreement has now been reached with the developers that the corporation will take in charge all the roads, footpaths and lanes in the estate including all underground services.

      <P>On 10 September 1980 an enforcement notice was served on the developers requiring that all outstanding works on the open spaces be completed. The time limit in the enforcement notice expired on 31 January 1981 without the necessary work on the open spaces being carried out. Accordingly, the matter has now been referred to the corporation's law agent for necessary prosecution proceedings in court.</P>
