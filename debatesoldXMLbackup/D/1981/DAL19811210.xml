    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,600,000 be granted to <Col N="1604" /> defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Energy including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the original Estimate was for the Department of Energy alone but that, with the change of Government, the industry functions of the former Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism were transferred from that Department to the new Department of Industry and Energy.  This Supplementary Estimate covers both the industry and energy sides of my Department but I think it would be helpful if I were first to deal briefly with each side separately before going into greater details about the various provisions.</P>
      <P>The additional requirements on the energy side total £3,129,000.  This sum is, however, more than offset by increased appropriations-in-aid and savings in other areas of the Vote which amount to £4,359,000 or £1,230,000 more than the total additional requirements on the energy subheads.  It is only fair to point out that had the Department of Energy remained an individual Department as it had been at the start of the year, there would not have been an overall deficit in the Vote.  A Supplementary Estimate would have been moved to cover proposed expenditure under a number of subheads, principally under the new subhead T, the FEOGA electricity programme, and the increased expenditure on Avoca, Subhead N, but only a token provision would have been required as was done in the case of the Supplementary Estimate earlier in the year for the Limerick Gas Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional requirements on the industry side total £3,830,000.  As there is a net saving of £1,230,000 on the energy provisions, the total deficit in the Industry and Energy Vote is £2,600,000.  This is very much less than the saving on the <Col N="1605" /> IDA which are of the order of £8 million. Since these savings, however, have been credited to the Trade, Commerce and Tourism Vote, it is necessary for me to move the Supplementary Estimate for £2,600,000 for my Department.</P>
    <P>The major factors giving rise to the increased provisions in the Supplementary Estimate are the additional provision for State aid for Avoca Mines Limited the provision for the FEOGA electricity supply programme, for which no provision was made in the current year, the shipbuilding subsidy, for which only a token provision had been made, and the additional grant-in-aid for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. Some adjustments in the amounts provided for other services operated by my Department were also necessary and I shall proceed to give details of all such services.</P>
    <P>The additional £275,000 sought under subhead A2&mdash;Consultancy Services&mdash;is required to meet the cost of consultancy projects on natural gas development and mining which arose during the year and for which provisions had not been made in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The extra £124,000 under subhead B1 is required to meet the increased cost of air fares, subsistence rates and mileage allowances for my Department, who have heavy commitments in relation to travel on EEC and other matters, and for additional expenditure on office cleaning and security consequent on my Department's move to new premises in Clare Street.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead C2, the additional sum required for advertising and publicity is £85,000 caused mainly by a carryover from 1980 which related to exceptionally heavy expenditure incurred during the month of October 1980 on advertising due to the oil tanker drivers' dispute.</P>
    <P>On subhead N the original Estimate provided £775,000 for State support for Avoca Mines and an additional £1,725,000 is now being sought for this purpose.  Avoca Mines Limited have been in receipt of State financial support since December 1974.  In the current year a sum of £2,500,000 has been advanced <Col N="1606" /> to the company.  It is now necessary to seek the approval of the House for expenditure of £1,725,000 in excess of the original Estimate provision.  My understanding is that at the time the provision of £775,000 was included in the Estimate the government were reviewing the question of continued State support for the mine and the provision of £775,000 was intended to enable the mine to continue in operation while the review was being carried out.  In the event, the Government decided to continue State support.</P>
    <P>My Department are engaged at present in a fresh study of the question of continued State support for the mine.  There appears to be little prospect of a return to profitable operations in the foreseeable future and the Government must have regard to the burden on the Exchequer of continued State support.  However, the Government must also weigh in the balance the serious social consequences for the area, in which unemployment is already at very high levels, which would result from the disemployment of at least 260 men who would be directly affected if the mine had to cease operations.</P>
    <P>On subhead O a sum of £100,000 was provided for a grant scheme for private bog development, to be administered by Bord na Móna, contingent on the enactment of legislation then before Dáil Éireann.  This legislation, the Turf Development Act, 1981 has since been enacted and an additional £200,000 is now being sought for this Scheme.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that our native turf resources should be developed at an even greater pace than we have managed to achieve to date.  Under their third development programme Bord na Móna are carrying out a vigorous programme of expansion of their turf production operations. There are, however, many small tracts of bogland which are not suitable for the large scale operations of Bord na Móna and, in order to encourage the development of these bogs, a new scheme of grant assistance was introduced during 1981.  The value of these boglands is considerable and they are now being developed by private interests for the production <Col N="1607" /> of turf for fuel.  The scheme was introduced with the primary aim of ensuring that boglands, which can be economically exploited for energy purposes, will be brought into production as fast and as efficiently as possible.  Drainage, access roads and turf cutting machinery could amount to such a financial outlay that it would deter private developers.  Because of this, together with the inescapable need to exploit our natural energy resources in an efficient and rational manner as fully and as effectively as possible, it is essential that a scheme of financial aid and technical advice from Bord na Móna should be available.  Approvals by the board for grant assistance under the scheme are at present close on £100,000.  A number of further applications which are at an advanced stage of processing by Board na Móna will involve further expenditure under the scheme during the current year.  For that reason I have decided that an additional allocation of £200,000 should be made available to enable Bord na Móna to meet the demand for grants which will be required to be paid before the end of this year.  In addition, there are approximately 200 other applications on hands with the board which are at various stages of processing. The major portion of these will fall due for payment during 1982.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead P, the original Estimate for the Development of Alternative Energy&mdash;Windpower Project is being increased by £20,000 to cover an increase in activity and a wider range of projects.</P>
    <P>Subhead I is a new provision to fund the FEOGA western aid development package.  Additional funds of £700,000 are required to meet the cost in the current year of the electrification element of the EEC measures for the stimulation of agricultural development in the less favoured areas of the west of Ireland. Deputies will be aware of these measures, which have been widely advertised. Eligibility for benefit under the measures is in accordance with the terms of the EEC regulation.  Briefly, the package of measures provides for aid for development in a variety of areas such as water <Col N="1608" /> supplies, roads, land improvement, and so on, which are the responsibility of other Government Ministers.  We are concerned here only with those measures which relate to the provision of electricity.</P>
    <P>Under the electrification scheme aid is being made available toward the cost of connecting and improving electricity supply to farms in the designated area, which comprises the counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan, Roscommon, Clare, Kerry and parts of west Cork and west Limerick.  Aid amounting to about £13 million will be provided over a ten-year period.  In the present year it will amount to £700,000.  Half of this aid will be recouped from the EEC.</P>
    <P>Those who qualify for aid will be required to pay only 20 per cent of the capital cost of new or increased electricity supply.  The ESB are operating the scheme on behalf of my Department. Under the plan drawn up to give effect to the scheme it is estimated that approximately 307 farms will benefit directly during the present year by way of new or improved electricity supplies.  Over the full period of the scheme it is estimated that some 6,700 farms will benefit in this way.  Many more will benefit from improvements to the electricity networks in the areas concerned.  The scheme extends over a ten-year period and priority will be given to provision of new supplies of electricity.  It is intended to concentrate resources in order to complete this particular part of the programme within about four years.</P>
    <P>The cost of extending electricity to farms in remote areas can be extremely high.  Therefore this scheme will be of considerable benefit to farmers in those areas, many of whom are simply unable to afford the cost of having electricity extended to their farms at present.</P>
    <P>In relation to new supplies, aid is being limited to cases where the capital cost of providing supply exceeds £1,000.  This will allow priority to be given to cases where the cost is such that the applicant could not normally expect to afford supply except under the terms of the FEOGA scheme.  The limit is being kept <Col N="1609" /> under constant review and people who are ineligible at present because of the limit, will be invited to re-apply if the scheme can accommodate them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It might be said that expenditure on the electrification element is comparatively small; it is only about 5 per cent of expenditure under the EEC package of measures as a whole.  Nevertheless, because electricity is a vital and essential means towards economic progress and social development, this scheme will, I believe, make a significant contribution to the western area.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead U, while a token provision only of £10 was included in the original Estimate for shipbuilding production subsidy on the assumption that no production subsidies would be payable in 1981, a sum of £1,877,000 will now be required to cover an estimated shortfall which has arisen in the case of the B+I Line's order for the new passenger/car ferry &ldquo;M. V. Leinster&rdquo; from Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>While a token provision only was included under subhead V in the original Estimate it is now proposed to provide £400,000 for the purpose of meeting the exchange losses arising on certain foreign borrowings by the Industrial Credit Company for industrial development purposes on which the Exchequer has agreed to bear the exchange losses.  An additional sum of £1,439,000 for administration and general expenses is being sought on behalf of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards under subhead W to enable that body to meet the cost of certain relativity pay claims in 1981.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead X, the original Estimate provided £640,000 grant-in-aid for Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited. An additional amount of £48,000 is required by the company to meet increased interest charges incurred during the year.</P>
    <P>In the case of subhead Y, the original estimate provided £600,000 by way of grant-in-aid for the Irish Productivity Centre.  An additional sum of £66,000 is required by the centre to meet the cost of pay awards.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased <Col N="1610" /> expenditure is £6,959,000 but there is an offset of £4,359,000 made up of savings in subheads amounting to £3,510,000 and an increase of £849,000 in appropriations-in-aid.  The savings are mainly made up of £2,480,000 in the energy conservation subheads, F.1, F.2, and F.4, and £800,000 in the town gas subsidy &mdash; subhead L.  The saving of £350,000 on subhead F.1, Energy Conservation (Publicity and General), is due partly to lower than anticipated spending on publicity and partly to the fact that the Demonstration Projects Scheme did not get under way until late in the year.  The savings of £1,400,000 in subhead F.2, Grants in respect of the Insulation of Domestic Dwellings, and £730,000 in subhead F.4, Energy Conservation Incentive Scheme for Energy Intensive Manufacturing Industry, occurred because the demand in the current year for the services provided under these subheads was not as great as had been anticipated. The saving on subhead L occurred because of the falling demand for town gas.  There will be a surplus of £849,000 in appropriations-in-aid, mainly arising from increased receipts from petroleum exploration licences.</P>
    <P>I have explained the reason for the increased expenditure in each subhead but if Deputies wish to raise any points in relation to them, I shall deal with them as far as possible in my reply.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the first thing I should say on this Supplementary Estimate is that it makes a change perhaps, pleasant or otherwise I do not know, to have the Minister of State make the statement which I crave indulgence of the Chair to quote again.  It is only fair to point out that had the Department remained an individual Department as it had been at the start of the year there would not have been an overall deficit in the Vote.  In view of the statements made in regard to Supplementary Estimates introduced here recently the Chair will bear with me when I draw attention to that because we have at least that area of contention out of the way on this Supplementary <Col N="1611" /> Estimate as far as I am concerned. That does not mean there are not areas of contention with which I want to deal.  There are, in fact, three major areas of contention with which I want to deal but, before doing so, there are some general observations I should like to make in regard to a number of items mentioned by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>First of all, in regard to the additional £275,000 sought under subhead A.2 for consultancy services, perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate a little more on the consultancy projects in regard to the development of natural gas and mining, areas covered by this additional sum sought.  I do not want to suggest I have any objection to what is being done.  On the countrary, I am quite sure it is part of the overall efforts to develop our natural resources and as such it is to be encouraged as strongly as possible but I would like to have a little more information on what is involved.</P>
      <P>In regard to Avoca Mines, I agree fully with the statement of the position as put to the House by the Minister of State. This is a very difficult situation.  A very considerable amount of State money has been expended over the years.  Unfortunately, because of unforeseen developments, which could not reasonably be expected, it does not appear that the prospects for the mine of any possible future are great.  They are, in fact, remote.  That being so, the problem that arises for the Government is whether and to what extent the Government should continue to assist by subsidising the operation of the mine.  The Minister is quite correct to draw attention to the fact that, if the Government were to cease assisting the mine in this particular area, as things stand there would be very little hope of alternative employment.  It may well be that in due course with special efforts by the IDA and other State agencies it might be possible to provide reasonable hope of alternative employment for the men concerned.  It would certainly be a major blow to the area if the Government were to cease the assistance being given at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the money being sought <Col N="1612" /> under subhead D for private bog development grants.  I wonder would the Minister be able to give us some further information as to what has happened so far, whether he is satisfied with the way the scheme is operating.  This is, of course, a new scheme and it is almost certain with any new scheme&mdash;particularly with one like this, for which there is very little precedent&mdash;that what was envisaged when it was launched may need to be altered or changed in the light of experience; whether the criteria which are operating are satisfactory; what kind of response is coming from all parts of the country; is the response mainly from co-operatives, from individuals or companies. If the Minister could give the House some information on how the scheme is progressing, it would be useful.</P>
    <P>The Minister's description of the need for the development of privately owned bogs and the reasons for encouraging this in terms of national requirements are ones with which I would fully agree, although I might have to refer back to what he has said in that regard when speaking on some other matters on which I want to make some complaints.  In so far as he has set out the reason for that, I agree fully with what he has said.  With regard to the money being sought for the windpower project, could the Minister give us some further information in that regard?  It was my understanding that the sum provided in the original Estimate of £290,000 was designed to cover four wind turbine generators being erected under the programme of the Department of Energy, as it then was, and also providing some additional money for certain other projects.  That is, of course, apart from the programme being embarked upon by the ESB.</P>
    <P>The four generators which were part of the Department's programme included one generator at Inisheer on the Aran Islands, to be erected in conjunction with Comharchumann Forbartha na nOileán and three generators to be erected under the auspices of An Foras Talúntais and operating under the direction of the Department of Energy.  One was to be operated at Moorpark <Col N="1613" /> Research Centre in Fermoy, to heat water mechanically for use in a dairy and farm residence; another was to be used at Creagh Research Centre in Ballinrobe, County Mayo, for the purpose of draining land; another was to be used to generate electricity to heat water for a dairy at Ballinamore Research Centre in County Leitrim.  I would like to know if these projects have gone ahead.  The schedule would have required them to be in operation by autumn of this year.</P>
    <P>The Estimate at the beginning of the year was designed to cover these and, in addition contributions to some other items &mdash; the installation of a 25 KW wind generator by Comharchumann Chorcha Dhuibhne in Ballyferriter, County Kerry, to provide electricity for the lighting and heating of some of the glasshouses which are operated by the Comharchumann, and also there was a proposal in regard to a water heating wind generator at Sligo Regional Technical College.  I would like to know whether any of these items are included in the programme to be assisted under the additional sum now being sought for the wind power project.</P>
    <P>We come now to the FEOGA Western Aid Development Project &mdash; that is the electricity aspect of it.  It is, of course, a wider package than that, but we are concerned only about the electricity aspect of it.  I am a little concerned that the amount being sought is only £700,000.  In May or June last, it was estimated that the total expenditure for the remainder of 1981, excluding the contributions by beneficiaries under the scheme, would be about £1.25 million.  Perhaps the Minister of State would explain why the figure now sought is considerably less than was then estimated.  This is an important programme for underdeveloped areas.  It is, of course, substantially assisted by the European Community and is of considerable importance to farmers in fairly remote areas for whom the cost of installation of electricity is now almost prohibitive. I am anxious, therefore, to see it progress as rapidly as possible.  Indeed, the Minister of State indicated that that portion of the scheme which relates to the new provision of electricity, as distinct <Col N="1614" /> from other aspects of the scheme, is one which is being speeded up.  I know that and know it is for a very good reason. Very many more farms would be served if that were done.</P>
    <P>Therefore I am concerned if there is a delay occurring this year because the sooner it is under way the more farmers will be served.  It may be that, as frequently happens, there are problems arising administratively when one is dealing with a scheme as complex as this and having to deal with the European Community and the ESB and other bodies. But I would like to know what is the situation and also to urge the Minister of State to keep up the pressure to keep that scheme going as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to comment in passing on the fact that yesterday the Tánaiste was in Belfast negotiating in connection with the possible extension of the natural gas pipeline from Dublin to Belfast.  I wish him well in his endeavours in that regard. I suppose it is inevitable that in cases of this kind one is going to get some politicians or some Unionist hue objecting and saying that this is not for the benefit of people in Northern Ireland.  It clearly is for their benefit, and it is quite unrealistic for any Unionist politician to pretend that because there is a land border between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland this affects in some way the natural resources available within Ireland.  It does not.  It makes a great deal of economic sense, particularly from the point of view of Northern Ireland, to be given access to our supplies of natural gas.  It should be recognised that in the absence of those supplies of natural gas the whole town gas industry in Northern Ireland would be closed down.  It should be recalled that the British Government made a decision a few years ago to close down the town gas industry in Northern Ireland and that a draft order in council was produced which, under the procedures now being followed in the absence of any parliament in the North, corresponds to the introduction of a Bill.  That was laid on the table of the British House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Now the position is that there is a distinctly good chance that agreement will <Col N="1615" /> be reached on the supply of natural gas to Belfast, thereby saving many jobs in the North and providing a reliable and, hopefully, steadily priced clean and efficient source of fuel to many hundreds of thousands of people in the North.  That development is surely to the benefit of Northern Ireland provided the price is right and, of course, they will not enter into a deal unless the price is right.  But there is no reason why agreement on a businesslike basis cannot be reached in regard to the price.  That will come in due course.  Having said that, I think I should also say that, while I have criticised certain Unionists in regard to their attitude to this, it is fair to say that that is not the attitude of all Unionists.  Indeed, some Unionists have been quite active in promoting this project and are acting on the basis of the interests of their constituents, and I would congratulate them on the efforts they have made and the success which is, so far, attending their efforts. There never have been, in any discussion of this project, any political strings attached.</P>
    <P>It has been discussed always on a commercial basis, recognising &mdash; and it is only realistic to recognise this&mdash;that we here in the South are willing to share this natural resource with the North where, if circumstances were different and we took a different view and regarded Northern Ireland as a totally foreign country and so on, we might well not be willing to make supplies available.  To that extent there is a political implication in it.  But that does not impose any obligation on the people in the North and the deal has been discussed and will, I hope be concluded on a commercial basis.  I would like to pay some tribute to the Unionists politicians who took a much more realistic view of the interests of their constituents and actively worked to bring about this project.  It is not complete yet, but I am quite confident that it will be.  The groundwork which has been laid&mdash;and that goes back some years &mdash;is a sound groundwork.  All the studies that have been carried out indicate that this is a feasible economic proposition from the point of view of both North and <Col N="1616" /> South.  I hope that the Tánaiste and the Minister of State will be able to conclude an agreement in regard to it quickly so that the project could go ahead as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the major complaints that I said I wanted to make, and they are threefold.  First, I want to refer to the apparent failure by the Government to protect our position in the European Community in regard to the building of a refinery.  Second, I want to refer to the postponement of the Arigna electricity generating station for four to five years and, particularly, the postponement of the Ballyforan briquette factory.</P>
    <P>In regard to the refinery it is no harm to recall what the position is.  The only refinery within our jurisdiction is that at Whitegate, and that has been closed now for a very long time.  Indeed, I think a statement from the Minister of State in regard to the Whitegate position would not be inappropriate.  There is grave concern amongst the people working in Whitegate as to the future, and that concern is justified.  But the significance of Whitegate is much wider than that of the future of the people in Cork.  It is not, in refinery that we have got.  It is not, in fact, the most modern refinery.  It does not have the catalytic cracker capacity that a modern refinery has, but it is the only refinery we have got.</P>
    <P>That being so, when I was Minister for Energy I made it quite clear to the companies operating Whitegate that, whatever else happened, it was not acceptable to the Government that this State should be left without any refining capacity.  As far as I know, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State have taken the same line.</P>
    <P>Certain things follow from that.  One has to recognise certain economic realities but it is essential that we retain some refining capacity within our jurisdiction, that we do not leave ourselves totally dependent on the refining capacities of other countries.  Being an island without oil resources of our own&mdash;at present, at any rate &mdash; for strategic reasons we need to have substantial stocks of crude oil of our own and a refining capacity which ultimately should include catalytic cracker capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> It is true that there is over-refining capacity in Europe, that some refineries are being closed down and that others are on short time.  As a result of that situation efforts are being made in the EEC to discourage the construction of refineries.</P>
    <P>That is perfectly understandable if it is applied to countries which already have an overcapacity, but it is not understandable if it applied to us.  Being an island is a difficulty for us in regard to getting supplies.  The only refining capacity we have is far below our requirements, is outdated and has not been working for months.</P>
    <P>This is a serious position for us.  I have been talking about stocks of crude and refining capacity and I should like to know what are the prospects for having adequate stocks of crude and the refining capacity of Whitegate being made available to us as soon as possible.  However, that is only a background to my complaint, which relates to an issue referred to in a report in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, on the front page, on Friday, 4 December last.  It is headed &ldquo;EEC Anger at Tarbert Refinery&rdquo;.  I will quote from that report because it illustrates our problem:</P>
    <P>Energy experts at the EEC Commission are highly critical of plans to build a new oil refinery in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Such plans were unveiled on Tuesday by Aran Energy Ltd., when it made public its request for planning permission for a £330 million refinery in Tarbert, Co. Kerry.  The plant would create 2,000 jobs during the construction stage and continue to offer substantial employment later on when oil finds in the Atlantic will hopefully be flowing ashore.</P>
    <P>Commission officials say they are totally unaware of Irish plans to build a new refinery.  They have neither been informed nor consulted about such plans, which they consider inappropriate at a time when the Common Market is advising oil companies in the ten member states to cut down drastically on refining capacity.  Guidelines to this effect emerging from Commissioner Etienne Davignon's Energy <Col N="1618" /> Department were adopted by a Council of Energy Ministers last October.</P>
    <P>Commission sources say that at the time the Irish delegation mentioned the problems surrounding the Whitegate refinery but never mentioned any plans from public or private companies to extend capacity.</P>
    <P>Later, the report states:</P>
    <P>Major oil companies in Milford Haven, Wales, which count among important suppliers of the Irish market, yesterday also reacted negatively to plans to build up refining capacity in Ireland, several of these companies are coping with severe problems, and a reduced access to the Irish market could end up in closure for them.</P>
    <P>At the outset I refer to the apparent failure of the Government to protect our position in the Community in regard to a refinery.  I say &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; because I am referring to that report and, if I take it at its face value, it would be a very severe indictment of the Government.  Therefore, I invite the Minister of State, if he can do so, to refute the allegation contained in that article because it suggests that our representatives at the Council of Ministers of Energy accepted guidelines which would prohibit the creation of new refining capacity in Ireland, with a reservation in favour of Whitegate, but no other reservation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the announcement by one company in regard to plans for a refinery in the Shannon Estuary which prompted this story, we know that there is another and more advanced proposal being dealt with by the Department of Energy for a substantial refinery in Ballylongford on the Shannon Estuary.  If it is true that no effort was made by the Government to preserve our position in that regard and if the Government have accepted guidelines which would prohibit us from going ahead with at least one of those projects on the Shannon Estuary, the Government would be guilty of a very serious and grave dereliction of duty, because, as I have indicated, our position is not <Col N="1619" /> the same as many EEC countries which are now pressing to prevent any new refining capacity being created.  Our position is that we do not have refining capacity other than the unused capacity at Whitegate, which is in need of modernisation and which even then would be below half of our requirements.  From a security and supply point of view we cannot accept that position and we should be trying to get new refining capacity installed in addition to Whitegate.</P>
    <P>Nobody in his senses would think of investing the huge sums of money now required to construct an oil refinery unless he had guaranteed access to adequate supplies of crude oil to make the operation of the refinery viable.  A lot of the trouble for many of the refineries with overcapacity in Europe at the moment is that their owners do not have access to adequate supplies of crude oil.  In the case of at least one of the projects for the Shannon Estuary the promoters have access to crude oil and that is the reason for the effort to build it there.  We have a number of natural economic advantages for such a refinery, because of our location, because of the availability of deepwater facilities and because of our location in relation to both Europe and the eastern seaboard of America and the markets in both of those areas.  In fact, the advantages we have in this regard were urged on me as Minister for Energy by one of the best-known figures in the oil world from the Middle East earlier this year.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, although we need refining capacity, the cost involved is such that the Government would have to think very hard before embarking on it.  In any event, even if they were willing to do so, since we have not got access to crude oil it would not make any sense.  If there is access to crude oil, and if people are willing to invest the necessary funds in building a refinery here because of economic advantages which I have just touched on, the Government should be encouraging this as strongly as possible. It would be deplorable if the Government were to allow arguments coming from some countries in the European Community <Col N="1620" /> who have a problem of overcapacity to operate to have a circumscribed guideline in the Community which would prohibit us from having such a refinery.  I trust the Minister of State will be able to refute categorically the story which appeared in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> to which I have referred.  I have to say some information I have privately suggests that story is correct.  I am not saying that positively because I do not know.  I hope the Minister will be able to refute it.</P>
    <P>The next item to which I want to refer is in regard to Arigna.  The ESB Chief Executive, in a letter dated 30 September to the Chairman of Arigna Collieries, indicated that the electricity generator which was to be built there, and for which I had given approval in principle in April of last year, is to be postponed for a period of four to five years as far as I can see.  It may not be quite obvious on the face of it how serious this is, and I should perhaps explain that electricity is generated there at the moment.  The source of the electricity generation is local coal.  It is running out and this new project would have been phased in just in time to maintain the employment of miners and others concerned.</P>
    <P>This is a very interesting use of natural resources which would not have been possible some years ago.  What is involved is called crow coal&mdash;locally it is called &ldquo;craw&rdquo; coal &mdash; which contains about 55 per cent stone.  Some years ago it would not have been possible to think of utilising this at all.  Application of the fluidised bed technique to this, with a number of experimental efforts by the ESB and people commissioned by them, produced a method of burning this crow coal which would be sufficient to enable a new generating station &mdash; not a very large one, about 45 megawatts &mdash; to operate.</P>
    <P>It was estimated that the supplies of crow coal would last for at least 25 years. I gave a decision in principle authorising the go ahead for this generating station in April 1980.  I find it very disturbing that it is now being postponed.  I should like to quote from the letter from the ESB:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> At the present time the bulk of our finance for capital development has to be borrowed abroad at high interest with substantial currency risks.  We must curtail our borrowing to the minimum which is unavoidable.  We would not be justified in going ahead with a project which is not needed to meet electricity demand and which has no cost/benefit advantage for the ESB.  If there was not capital scarcity, indeed development of distribution and transmission systems would have a higher priority than Arigna.</P>
    <P>That is a view expressed by the ESB.  It may make sense within the narrow confines of the ESB's terms of reference.  I do not want to get into an argument about that, although perhaps it could be argued that that is not so.  Accepting that within the ESB's narrow terms of reference that is so, the question arises: is that the way this whole problem should be approached by the Government as distinct from the ESB?  Surely the Government should take a broader view of the situation.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that if this project went ahead as planned, it would fit in very well locally with the problems arising from the running out of the existing coal supplies.  From the point of view of the area concerned, the building of this generating station and the provision of crow coal for it would provide jobs for miners and workers on the construction of the generating station.  What are these workers supposed to do now if it is postponed for four to five years?  Are they expected to live on the dole for that period?  If they can get away that is what they will do, and they will not be there if it is decided in four to five years to go ahead with this project.</P>
    <P>All that is involved is a small generating station of 45 megawatts.  However small, it represents a use of our indigenous resources.  It represents a reduction in imports of either oil or coal.  Therefore it makes economic sense.  Perhaps a more disturbing aspect of this is that this matter was raised recently in the House by Deputy O'Malley and the Minister for Finance replied to him.  I should like to <Col N="1622" /> quote something he said as reported in the Official Report of 1 December 1981 at columns 758 and 759:</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to matters concerning electricity.  The decisions which have been taken, or may be taken, in regard to electricity, do not come within this motion.  As a nation we cannot ignore that our existing capacity to produce electricity results in a production of 40 per cent more than our needs, that we use only about 60 per cent of our capacity.  That gap is wider here than in most countries.</P>
    <P>The money we are using to increase our capacity to generate electricity is being provided by the European Investment Bank and other such bodies, and they will naturally ask whether we need this additional capacity at this time, whether we need this additional investment in electricity generation, and whether we have the ability to generate the income from the use of electricity to enable us to repay the debts incurred to build the additional capacity.  If average use is no more than 60 per cent of existing capacity to generate electricity there are arguments for at least being careful before committing ourselves to raising capacity even further, possibly widening the gap between use and capacity.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister for Finance is now dictating energy policy&mdash;I hope it is not so&mdash;but, if it is, it might explain what is happening in this regard and in regard to Ballyforan.  I cannot believe for one minute that any Minister for Energy, knowing the score, would subscribe to what is happening in regard to Arigna.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance is wrong in what he said, in what I have quoted, both from the point of view of energy policy and indeed economic policy. All the international advice available to the Government, and indeed common sense, stresses that top priority for productive investment should be investment in energy projects which will reduce imports and our dependence on foreign supplies.  If we add the problem about jobs in the area of Arigna&mdash;where there are few, if any, alternatives available for <Col N="1623" /> employment, at a time of an unemployment crisis in the country generally&mdash;if one adds that to the other economic reasons it becomes obvious that all economic and energy policy would indicate that small as is this project it should be gone ahead with as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>Furthermore I do not know where the Minister for Finance got his figures but I do know that any electricity undertaking must have, as a very minimum, spare capacity equal to the largest generating station it runs.  If one thinks about that for a moment one will see why&mdash;if that goes out of action they have to be able to replace it.  That is true of any electricity undertaking.  That is the absolute minimum. In practice more than that is required.  That is not excess capacity.  It is simply a necessary and essential part of operating any electricity undertaking.  If one takes that into account I doubt very much if there is any accuracy at all in the figure given by the Minister for Finance of our having 40 per cent more capacity than we need.  Even if that were true the kind of logic about which he is speaking does not make any sense to me but, if his logic is upheld, then why not stop the building of the Moneypoint electricity generating station which is very much bigger?  Arigna would not add very much to our capacity.  If one expects some kind of growth at some time in the future &mdash; which would add slowly to our capacity &mdash;Moneypoint would add enormously to our capacity.  That is the logic of the case put forward by the Minister for Finance. But Moneypoint is not being stopped.  I am not advocating that we should stop Moneypoint, on the contrary we should go ahead with it.  What I am saying is that a project designed to use native raw material, to generate electricity and at the same time to answer an acute unemployment problem in a remote part of the country&mdash;which would, even in a small way, reduce imports of oil or coal&mdash;is one which from an energy and economic policy point of view makes absolute sense. It does not make sense to postpone it.  I call on the Minister of State and through him, on the Tánaiste to direct the ESB to reverse their stance on this because there <Col N="1624" /> is no justification at all for it from any point of view and it is not something the Government should accept.  It may be that it makes some kind of sense within the ESB's narrow terms of reference&mdash;I doubt it&mdash; but whether or not it does it makes no sense at all under the Government's terms of reference, and the Government should direct the ESB to proceed as fast as possible with the project at Arigna.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar situation arises in regard to Ballyforan where a new briquette factory was due to be constructed. In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 25 November last the Minister for Industry and Energy, replying to a question from Deputies Kitt, Callanan and Leyden in regard to Ballyforan, gave details of the employment which would be involved and went on to say:</P>
    <P>The bog development programme of Bord na Móna is being re-examined by the board in the light of the board's projected capital needs in 1982 and, accordingly, it is not possible to say until this examination is carried out when work on the factory is likely to commence.</P>
    <P>Although that is vague the message that comes through quite clearly is that this project is being postponed.  How long it is being postponed is not clear but it is clear that it is being postponed.  I might say in passing that there is a marvellous bit of circular reasoning involved in that, if I might read that last sentence again:</P>
    <P>The bog development programme of Bord na Móna is being re-examined by the board in the light of the board's projected capital needs in 1982.</P>
    <P>If they were going ahead with this obviously that would be a part of the board's capital needs for 1982.  If they are looking at their capital needs this does not come at the tail-end.  They must decide whether this is one they are going to do or not and then find out what are their capital needs.  However, that is merely an observation in passing.</P>
    <P>In this case, according to the Minister's reply, this briquette factory when in full production would employ a number of the order of 200 and the total number to be employed on the Derryfadda Bog and <Col N="1625" /> in the factory would be of the order of 600.  Therefore the question of the provision of jobs, again in an area which is fairly remote, where there is little if any alternative source of employment, clearly arises here as in Arigna.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there is, as everybody knows, a huge and unsatisfied demand for turf briquettes.  Indeed the building of this factory was part of the effort being made to remedy this. Another part of it was in Littleton, County Tipperary where a factory, I think, had gone into production this year producing briquettes.  But we also need the factory in Ballyforan to get anywhere near satisfying the demand for briquettes. I need hardly say that briquettes are perhaps one of the most attractive forms of fuel available based, of course, on our native resource, turf.  The more briquettes we use the less money we spend on imported fuel.  It is as simple as that.  We should be pushing ahead and trying to get this under way as soon as possible.  I want to pose a question to the Minister of State, and indeed to anybody else in this House: could there be a more productive or sounder investment than that in a factory producing turf briquettes for sale in this country?</P>
    <P>However one looks at it, it is a sound, sensible and productive investment.  Far from there being any question of a postponement, the Minister of State and his senior Minister should be breathing down the neck of Bord na Móna to ensure that they get on with the job.  It makes sense from the overall economic point of view in that it will reduce imports, and it makes sense from the point of view of employment and energy policies.</P>
    <P>I must say that I find this indication of postponement of the Ballyforan project and the positive decision of the ESB to postpone the Arigna project most disheartening. Apart from these cases themselves, if this is the way the Government think their financial difficulties should be tackled there is very little hope of any growth in the economy or any worth-while attack on our unemployment problem. The basic thinking behind the decision in those cases seems to me to be so perverse and so contrary to commonsense <Col N="1626" /> that it leaves one with little hope for the future under this Government if that is the kind of thinking that prevails.</P>
    <P>It may well be that this kind of thinking will produce a neatly balanced set of books in due course but that is all it will produce.  Certainly it will not produce growth or have any impact on unemployment. Neither will it advance in any way the energy policy that was taking shape in a way that I understood had general support and consensus on all sides of the House.  I must say that I suspect, and I hope I am right in my suspicions, that the reasons for the two decisions lie not in the Department of Industry and Energy but in the Department of Finance and when I say Department of Finance I mean the Minister for Finance.  I had experience of that Department and the civil servants concerned are quite capable of expansionist thinking with regard to our economy when that is appropriate.  If the Minister for Finance is so set on acting as a book-keeper, without any sense of economic development or any intention practically to tackle the unemployment problem, it is time this was exposed.  It is time that the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister of State stood up to this.  They have an unanswerable, cast-iron case for insisting that the Arigna and the Ballyforan projects go ahead with all possible speed.  Nobody can put forward a rational argument for not doing this.</P>
    <P>I conclude by calling on the Minister of State to give us some hope that these decisions will be reversed.  Whatever he has to say in this House, he must ensure that behind the scenes some commonsense will prevail in the approach to what are admittedly difficult problems on the financial side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne (Dublin North-West) Dr. Byrne (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I wish to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment to the Department of Industry and Energy and also to congratulate him on the comprehensive statement he made when introducing the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on subhead C.2. which refers to money for advertising and publicity for the Department.  No doubt <Col N="1627" /> part of this money will be spent by the IDA in advertising on RTE regarding the setting up of small industries in suburbs of Dublin where unemployment is at a very high rate and no doubt this money will be well spent and is very necessary. However, the Minister of State should be aware that while money is being spent on publicity to encourage the setting up of small industries in the suburbs, RTE are producing programmes, as was done last week, which undermine the confidence of industrialists here, in Europe and in the United States.  These people might well be considering setting up industries in places such as Finglas where the rate of unemployment is high compared with the national average.  Yet an RTE programme was screened last week &mdash; allegedly a factual programme &mdash; which fraudulently misrepresented the situation. Later today I shall be seeing the Minister for Justice on the matter.  He may be getting in touch with the Attorney General with a view to having the background of the programme, the material used in it and the behaviour of the producers, referred to the DPP to take the correct action.  It is ridiculous to ask us to vote money for publicity, for the IDA to encourage the setting up of small industries in areas of high unemployment while, at the same time, the decent taxpayers and people of Finglas have their lives completely undermined, socially and culturally, by an irresponsible programme. May I take leave to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy takes any more leave, he will appreciate that, while the Chair has absolute sympathy with him on this matter, the Chair must point out that on this Supplementary Estimate the Deputy should not develop to any great extent his criticism of RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I was going to mention that I was not in any way criticising RTE for their excellent contributors to the programme who readily come to mind, particularly Brian Farrell and Olivia O'Leary, whose reputation, <Col N="1628" /> integrity and tenacity are beyond all doubt.  One was referring merely to the faceless people behind this programme who are not mentioned and who do not come readily to mind or project the same degree of integrity and tenacity as has been heretofore presented by the programme.</P>
      <P>It is sad to have to mention that recently Dublin County Council rezoned a large acreage of land in Finglas for the purpose of setting up industries.  Not too long ago Dublin City Council rezoned approximately 50 acres for the setting up of small industries in the Finglas area. Recently the Minister for Energy on a visit to the US made a statement there to the effect that one of the larger factories in the Finglas area would be expanding in the immediate future with the provision of an extra 500 jobs.  The massive Lyons industrial estate, the Finglas industrial estate and the massive Unidare complex all give excellent employment. These and the Cabra industry surround the area of Finglas, which is part of the constituency that I am privileged to represent. When people from Finglas who follow that programme venture outside the immediate area to seek employment and when the employer sees their address they no longer stand a chance of employment. I have represented the area of Ballymun since 1969 and I have seen the adverse effects an address can have on an applicant looking for a job outside his immediate area in banking, the insurance business and catering.</P>
      <P>It is not in any way objective for our institutions, be they the IDA, the ICC or RTE, to misrepresent or to undermine one another.  The good work that one of them is attempting to do should not be undermined by another in an ill-judged, ill-timed, totally irresponsible and untrue programme.  That programme heretofore has always presented a very objective, factual approach to current affairs.  They could go back to a 1968 <i>Panorama</i> programme and put it on their programme as they did last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the heading, &ldquo;O. &mdash; Grants for Private Bog Development, £200,000&rdquo;.  I would say with all humility and sincerity that the faceless people <Col N="1629" /> behind that programme should be taken out of RTE, brought down to that bog at the expense of the Department of Industry and Commerce and buried in the bog&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have mentioned industrial strife, the lack of infrastructure and good roads and the great traffic jams in the city of Dublin. All of these can have adverse effects on the setting up of industries in the Dublin area and on the confidence of potential employers and industrialists.  If it is worth saying once it is worth saying ten times that we have enough problems in trying to run the country without having sections of our society trying to cut the legs from under us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of extra money for the IIRS who do very good work and are very necessary in our industrial set-up.  Any local authority houses built must be passed by the IIRS before the materials can be put into them.  It is well known in Irish society and in the Irish building societies that very often the standards of local authority houses and the component parts of them are higher than those relating to private housing. The work of the IIRS in achieving these high standards is much to be praised.  I am a member of a local authority who plan and build many housing estates which are of great importance to the homeless people of Dublin or those unable to provide their own housing by private means.  In turn there is a feedback into the building industry.  Any houses or housing estates that will be built by Dublin Corporation will be planned in great detail to give the optimum occupancy and they will be planned by the best brains and talents available to the local authority, to the best designs that exist at the time.  There have been errors in the past but these were at times the world solutions to the crises that existed.  One could do no better than take the advice of the best authorities in the world with a view to remedying defects <Col N="1630" /> in society.  Ballymun estate was one of those unfortunate European errors, but the south Finglas housing estate was not and should not be projected to be so.</P>
    <P>I compliment the IDA on the great work they have been doing over the years in providing industries for Ireland.  I would like to see a much happier worker-employer relationship and fewer strikes and the Achilles tendon of the IDA protected.  When they offer the packages they are in a position to offer they should be encouraged in every way. The ICC are involved in this brief also. One can do nothing but admire the efficiency and tenacity with which they deal with the responsibilities allocated to them.  It was remiss of me to mention the IDA &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I read the Minister's opening statement with great interest.  He referred to the Irish Productivity Centre.  I would like to see him pay special attention here to the north city which has a high unemployment rate.  Would he give a grant-in-aid to industries there which have fallen on hard times?  One of the worst things that ever happened was the break with sterling. Talking to a banker at the time the break was made he thought his clients should be advised to change from sterling into punts.  Actually the opposite happened. Some 95 per cent of business transactions take place with the United Kingdom.  In present circumstances there is no encouragement to people to expand or even to continue in business.  That is particularly the case where those engaged in small family businesses in the inner city are reaching their declining years.  The tendency is for them to pack it in and get compensation for road widening and so on which will enable them to live on an income for the remainder of their days. The break with sterling and the fall in the punt may have been good for exports but I still regard the break as the greatest <Col N="1632" /> setback we have suffered.  I do not blame anyone in particular for the break.  I was against it at the time and I am still against it.  The change was made and as a result, we have lost many small industrialists.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to look at the hotel industry.  A recent study by authorative people indicates that hotels produce an export <i>per se</i> by bringing people into the country.  This comes within the ambit of the Department of Industry and Energy.  In the same way as new industries are tax free for ten years perhaps a similar concession could be given to hotels to help tourism.</P>
      <P>Once more I congratulate the Minister. I listened with great interest to Deputy Colley's contribution.  I am wiser as a result of that contribution.  I sincerely hope that what I have said about the media will bear fruit and that in future the ambition will be to project a fair representation of conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that these Supplementary Estimates have to be discussed within such a brief time scale.  First of all, I would like to refer to the savings on the IDA.  It is quite remarkable that we should have savings in respect of the IDA.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, this is the first time for many years &mdash; perhaps the first time ever &mdash; that any savings were achieved under the heading of the IDA, particularly on the capital side.  When one thinks of the situation of industry today, it is rather remarkable that it should happen now.  On my walk this morning from here to my office in Molesworth Street, I met no less than three groups of distressed Irish industrialists in the space of about a hundred yards. These are people who I know are in severe difficulties.  We are told that State agencies do not have any money to help out some of these distressed industrialists and at the same time this House is asked to note a saving of £8 million.  That is the biggest individual saving under any Estimate any time this year in any Department. It struck me as one which was the least appropriate at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been discussion in the House, for example, about the financial <Col N="1633" /> difficulties of the Clondalkin Paper Mills. A lot less than the £8 million being saved here would ensure the continuation of these mills which are of strategic importance to this country because they are the only remaining white paper mills here. The outlook for them at the moment is very bleak indeed.  When I raised this matter on the other Supplementary Estimate two weeks ago, I was told that these were matters that would more properly be discussed under this Supplementary. The Minister of State told me that he had no responsibility for industry and did not want to deal with it and that this remarkable saving came about, for the most part, not by deliberate efforts to cut back, but by virtue of the fact that companies who had entitlements to instalments of grants were not now taking them up.  I do not know whether that is true.  Whichever way it goes, it is, to say the least, ominous. If, as the Minister said, companies are not taking up their entitlements to grants, it is very disturbing because it means that for the first time ever we are in a situation where the IDA are not able to give money to companies &mdash; the companies do not want it.  That betokens a very worrying and unhealthy future for industrial development here.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if that is not true and if a deliberate cutback is being made by the Government &mdash; and one suspects that might possibly be true &mdash; certainly the place where they are cutting back is the very last one they should choose. Whichever way it goes, it is ominous and worrying.  If the Government are not cutting back deliberately under this heading regarding this very substantial sum of £8 million, it is more ominous in the long-term because it means that the companies are not taking up their grant entitlement and are not going ahead with projects for which they have been passed or to which they were committed.  I recall clearly, for each of the last four years the Department of Industry and Commerce, in November and December, at the request of officials in the IDA, having to give verbal assurances to companies that they would certainly be paid the next instalment of their grant, which was then due, on the following 1 January.  The reason <Col N="1634" /> for this was that the pressure on IDA capital spending and the growth and vitality were so great that the IDA were out of money by mid-November or early December in each of those years.  They could not make the payments then falling due and I had to underline the assurances they were giving to these industrialists that they would be paid immediately on 1 January, when the new financial year commenced.  That is clearly not the case this year; indeed, the very opposite.  The IDA are now in the position to make all the grants they want, so much so that they are handing back to the Exchequer £8 million, which is unparalleled and a matter of deep concern.  It serves to underline the despair which is expressed nowadays by the Minister for Industry and Energy who is talking with a resigned air about the inevitability of 145,000 people being out of work shortly and about a figure certainly not below 125,000 for five years.  This matter bears that out.</P>
    <P>By far the most interesting aspects of the Supplementary Estimates are the savings. It is worth-while drawing the attention of the House to the savings on F.1, F.2 and F.4, all of which relate to energy conservation, which I would have thought was very important at present, in the light of the enormous cost of oil.  The one which disturbs me most is F.4, where there is a saving of £730,000 in the rather inadequate provision made of £1.46 million for grants to industries which are heavy users of energy and, in particular, oil.  In the early part of this year, I had the feeling that £1.46 million was so small that it would be of only very limited benefit to a small number of companies.  I find now that only exactly half this amount is being paid out this year.  That calls for an explanation.  In one county alone, I can name two firms in severe difficulties as a result of their heavy use of energy &mdash; one in Drogheda, a very capital-intensive firm which needs considerable assistance and, clearly, is not getting it now, if all firms which are in this position are only going to get £730,000; another firm in Castlebellingham, County Louth, which uses oil as a raw material which constitutes the great bulk of the cost of its product.  I find it <Col N="1635" /> incomprehensible that a saving of 50 per cent is achieved on an amount which was only going to scratch the surface in trying to avoid the difficulties which had been created by the heavy increase on the duty on oil.  On the £1.9 million allocated this year for insulation for energy conservation, £1.4 million has been handed back, which again seems rather remarkable. Why this money is not spent, I do not know.  This is the wrong way to save it.</P>
    <P>On the general heading of energy conservation, there is a saving of £350,000, which is a pretty big proportion of the original amount made available.  There are many other aspects of this Supplementary Estimate on which I would like to talk but, unfortunately, I have no time to do it.  I protest in the strongest terms at the situation in which we find ourselves, that the IDA are handing back £8 million at a time of unprecedented difficulty for industry in this country.</P>

      <P>In regard to the FEOGA electricity programme, I would like to know how many people have applied and, more particularly, how many have been approved.  Perhaps the Minister of State would contact the local authorities to let them know that this scheme is available to housing applicants in rural areas who are on the list and waiting to be housed by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add to what Deputy Colley has said in regard to the peat briquette factory at Ballyforan and to compliment and thank him for the interest he showed in Derryfadda when he was Minister; indeed, he visited the plant.  Since this project was approved in 1979 by the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, there has been a lot of progress in bog development. The site has been obtained by Bord na Móna, the workers have been brought in to the Bord na Móna operation and we were all hopeful, in my constituency and in Roscommon, that the work would have started by now.  It was to start in September-October this year.  I have a letter which the then Minister, Deputy Colley, sent to Deputy Leyden stating that it would start.  Now we are told that it is going to be re-examined.  It is a source <Col N="1636" /> of great disappointment in our area that work was not started.  I would urge the Minister of State to do all he can to get the Minister for Finance to loosen the purse strings and give us this much-needed briquette factory in Derryfadda near Ballyforan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £9,006,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport, including certain services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The main feature of this Supplementary Estimate, the second for my Department this year, is the provision of an additional £11 million subvention for CIE.  The previous Supplementary Estimate for my Department in July last provided £9 million additional subvention for CIE.  Taking both of these Supplementary Estimates together with the original provision of £65 million, CIE will this year receive a total of £85 million in subvention.  This will not be sufficient to meet in full the board's estimated deficit for 1981 but is the maximum that the Exchequer can provide at the present time.  The board estimates that the deficit on subvention activities will amount to £92.53 million and the shortfall of £7.53 million will be met by temporary borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major factor in the requirement for the increased subvention in the current year arises from the actions of the previous Government who fixed the original subvention provision at an unrealistically low level and, in addition, failed to approve the increases in CIE fares which had been sought from January 1981. Unforeseen increases in costs which <Col N="1638" /> arose in the course of the year also added to the deficit.</P>
    <P>CIE's financial position is, to put it mildly, alarming.  As Deputies are aware, CIE's situation is being reviewed in the light of the McKinsey Report and, as I recently informed the House, I intend to have this report debated in Dáil Éireann in the near future.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £611,000 is required to meet the extra cost of salaries, wages and allowances arising mainly from acceptance in February 1981 of the findings of the Civil Service Arbitration Board on claims for certain general service grades and also the settlement of other claims at conciliation.</P>
    <P>Provision is made under subhead H of this Department's Vote for expenditure in connection with the provision, installation and maintenance of electronic equipment for civil aviation and the marine coast stations and for power supplies.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the safety and regularity of civil aviation and to continue to meet our international obligations, as well as improving maritime communications, it is planned to replace equipment and navigational aids at the State airports and marine coast stations.  The allocation for 1981 for this work is £1 million but it is now expected that expenditure will reach £1,265,000.</P>
    <P>Expenditure for 1981 arises mainly on the replacement of the approach radar at Dublin Airport and the message switching computer at Shannon Aeradio Station, Ballygirreen, and the provision of a maritime VHF pilot network scheme.  A large proportion of the total expenditure will be recovered from airlines through communications and route charges.</P>
    <P>Subhead P provides for grants towards the cost of providing regional and local air services.  The grant in this instance is for the operation of the Dublin to Derry scheduled air service.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-aid are now expected to yield £16,893,910, as compared with the original Estimate provision of £14,799,910.  The surplus arises mainly in respect of recoupment from the Eurocontrol Organisation of en-route <Col N="1639" /> facilities cost and from a cost-sharing arrangement between this Department and the UK Civil Aviation Authority for a radar station.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £11,950,000, but there is an offset of £850,000 in savings on other subheads and a surplus of £2,094,000 on appropriations-in-aid.  Accordingly, the net amount required is £9,006,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has outlined in the Supplementary Estimate in regard to the amounts involved is, to a large extent, the same view which I held in dealing with this Estimate at the start of the year.  It is significant to note that, apart altogether from CIE, there are savings on various subheads of £850,000 and additional expenditure of £950,000 which clearly illustrates the very detailed work which went into the preparation of this Estimate at the start of the year.  I am surprised that the Minister has not outlined the various savings that were made and for what purpose.  Perhaps he will get the opportunity before the time is up to give us some idea where they come from. I can only speculate on some of them.</P>
      <P>In regard to CIE, the Minister takes the same view as I do, and this has been proved by the Government decision that the total allocation to CIE subvention this year will be £85 million.  The Minister says that this will not be sufficient to meet in full the board's estimated deficit for 1981 but is the maximum that the Exchequer can afford at present.  CIE are a major problem for the economy and in relation to budgetary estimates.  When preparing this Estimate at the beginning of this year I took the view that it was time to signal to CIE that they would have to adopt a better approach and that there was a fundamental responsibility on them to effect some savings so as to correct the deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am on record as expressing appreciation of the fact that it is very difficult to gauge the success or otherwise of CIE management when their deficit is dealt with in this way.  During my short time in <Col N="1640" /> the Department of Transport I said that CIE have a social content and that that social content should be identified, that a price should be put on it and it should be shown above the line in CIE's accounts so that this House or people outside it who would be scrutinising the performance of CIE would be able to see at a glance how the commercial management is faring in such a very large organisation.</P>
    <P>The day has come &mdash; I have said this many times &mdash; when the blank cheques cannot any longer be handed out to CIE or other semi-State organisations.  We cannot go on indefinitely paying out taxpayers' money.  Indeed taxpayers are the first to say that they are not getting the services they are paying for.  Generally, people do not mind paying for services if they feel they are getting value for money.  In an attempt to set the ball rolling for CIE, as it were, when I was Minister for Transport we set a subvention figure of £65 million.  I knew at that time, and I said it here, that savings would have to be effected by CIE in this year's operations. At that time, when looking at CIE's subvention figures for previous years, I found that something in the region of £4½ million or £5 million was due directly to industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Following that I had two meetings with the CIE union groups inside and outside Congress.  I told them exactly what my views were and conveyed to them the concern of the Government and of all sides of this House that something would have to be done.  I told them at those meetings that the Government of the day were looking for a contribution from management and from the workers to a joint effort to effect some savings in the years to come.  The trade union group in CIE, inside and outside Congress, accepted that a new approach had to be taken in the whole operation.  I pointed out to them the cost of industrial disputes in previous years and that the figure I mentioned earlier could be saved if all the unions involved and the management worked out a peace formula to which they would all be signatories in an effort to ensure there would not be any lightning or official strikes in the following <Col N="1641" /> year.  I told them that in that way they could all make a decent contribution to reducing the deficit.  I do not know how that policy has been proceeded with since I left the Department.  I attempted to raise the matter during Question Time but I was ruled out of order.  I attempted to ask two questions that would give me some information for my contribution here today but on those occasions as well I was ruled out of order, even though when I was Minister for Transport most of the questions in this respect were taken by me.  However, I have made the point. I accept the ruling of the Chair on those occasions.</P>
    <P>To get back to the subvention to CIE which is the main part of the Supplementary Estimate, I appreciate that in Dublin traffic conditions are chaotic.  No matter who operates the Dublin city bus service he could not efficiently make the system work in present conditions.  For that reason I took the first step to tackle this major problem.  I took an immediate decision on the report of the Transport Consultative Commission.  A Government decision was announced within seven days of its receipt to set up the Dublin Transportation Authority and give them all the functions they required to co-ordinate all the traffic and transport services throughout the larger city areas. I decided to have them taken out of other Departments and to put them under the aegis of the Department to which they rightly belong, the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the legislation to do that has not come to the House yet.  I recall the Minister saying he would introduce it early in the next session, and I should like now to express the hope that the Minister fully appreciates that in setting up the DTA he will have to give it the proper teeth they will need to do the job properly and effectively.  I hope he will appreciate that certain functions will have to be transferred from the Department of the Environment, from CIE and from the Garda Síochána to the DTA to ensure that they will be able to do their work effectively.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at a reply to a question in the last few weeks that despite a <Col N="1642" /> pledge given in the Fine Gael general election campaign the Minister has not got proposals to transfer functions from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Transport.  Obviously the right thinking was there before the general election but minds have changed since.  If the Minister does not go the full road along which the setting up of the DTA was the first step, he should go part of the road and give teeth in legislation to the DTA.  The functions in regard to Dublin traffic are dispersed too broadly between the Departments of the Environment, Labour and Justice and the Garda authorities and CIE.  That wide dispersal of functions has contributed to the ineffective action taken in this area.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the setting up of a proper Dublin Transportation Authority with the proper teeth and powers to ensure they will be able to do their job effectively to try to solve the Dublin traffic chaos.  Bus lanes, which many people thought would not be effective, were introduced and have been successful. The task force did a magnificent job. Despite many obstacles put in their way, they kept going and introduced a pro gramme of bus lanes which are working. I was glad the Minister gave me an assurance in the last two weeks that he will keep under consideration the observance of these regulations.  It is only in that way they will be effective and enable CIE to run their services on time.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, when the DTA have been set up and are working effectively the public will turn to public transport, because if they can genuinely feel that they can get from A to B on time they will not be bringing their cars in to choke up the city: they will gladly move towards public transport and public transport will get the priority it deserves in Dublin so that we can have a better city.  Otherwise this city will choke itself to death.  We must remember the damage being done to the environment and to the atmosphere because of the amount of lead being poured into the air from all the cars being used excessively.  We must also think of the high cost of energy.  In such circumstances is it not good economic sense for any Government to promote <Col N="1643" /> fuller use of public transport, which is more efficient?  As I have said, if the public feel that public transport is being run efficiently they will support it.</P>
    <P>There is a major programme going on, the Howth to Bray railway line electrification, and that in itself will provide an opportunity to show the advantages of public transport to the people of those suburban areas who at the moment are not getting value in relation to comfort in travelling.  We all recognise the fact that the carriages are not in a good state. Some people have described them as cattle wagons.  I hope that when the new carriages and the new service come on stream they will make a significant contribution to taking more and more people off the roads and make a better contribution to CIE's finances in the years to come.</P>
    <P>When that service is introduced, which we hope will be in 1983, we will be able to assess what contribution a further extension of the electrification services can make.  In the tight economic situation which exists, and which everybody recognises, it is foolhardy to talk about a rapid rail system for Dublin.  That will come in the future.  An assessment can be made of the Howth-Bray line by the introduction of feeder buses and the provision of car parks at the stations.  We will then be able to assess how far further down the line of electrification we should go.  In the satellite towns which have been built up around the city it is time commuter services were introduced where there is an existing asset which is not used.  I recognise that the carriages on that service are temporary for the moment.  They will serve in the interim.  It would be interesting to know how many people used that service in the bad weather conditions of the past couple of days.  I am sure it will be used widely.  It has been welcomed by all sections living on the western side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In my time I asked CIE to give me an estimate of the cost of serving Clondalkin and Tallaght with a rail service.  Clondalkin has an existing rail network out to it which should be extended to Tallaght. That is the only sensible way of trying to <Col N="1644" /> bring that expanding population into the city.  When the electrification service comes on stream a better assessment can be made of providing a commuter rail service.  We all recognise that there is not enough money to do it now.  We would all like to think there was enough money to do all the things we would like to do. The constraints are there.  Nevertheless the Department of Transport have taken a considerable step forward in many areas which lay dormant for far too long and which should have been tackled many years ago.</P>
    <P>The real problems of CIE developed in the seventies when more and more people bought their own cars which, I suppose, was a reflection of the rising standard of living.  The taxpayers, the Government and people in this House are now asking how long more CIE can remain in their present situation.  I had hoped that during this session we would have had an opportunity to debate the McKinsey Report.  The longer this matter is left undebated and unresolved, the more of the taxpayers' money will go down the drain.  It is time that as responsible politicians we came to grips with this difficult and complex problem.  I accept that many submissions did not come in as early as expected.  All the submissions are in now and it is time we got down to the complex problem of sorting out the affairs of CIE to see how we can make better use of public money.  Perhaps in next year's Estimate the Minister will be able to put a figure on the social aspects of the CIE services.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the Minister's statement that he and the Government take the same view as we did.  Earlier this year we told CIE that we could not subvent the total amount they needed for their deficit.  The Government said that approximately £7.5 million will have to be raised by borrowing.  That is the same philosophy I expounded in my time. Until somebody grabs this problem by the throat, the reaction will be to try to produce some areas of possible savings which are very highly politically sensitive. Let us be honest and realistic about it.</P>
    <P>I remember CIE saying to me that they would cut off the services to the North, <Col N="1645" /> at a time when discussions were going on about more and more economic co-operation between North and South.  Surely that service should not have been cut off at that time.  I asked CIE to reappraise all their bus services.  I suggested there might have been areas with a frequency of bus services they did not require.  I know they have been waiting for some years for new rolling stock.  I was glad to announce a Government decision last April to start the construction of new carriages at Inchicore.  The expertise is there to do the job, and the carriages are badly needed.  My colleague Deputy Flynn will be only too anxious to see the new super train going to the west as soon as possible.  It is a welcome new industry.</P>

      <P>I was coming in from Ringsend in the past three days and I noticed what I believed &mdash; and I am not a technically minded person &mdash; to be a new bus, not a Bombardier bus, on that route.  Is there a new bus on test in that area and, if so, why?  Is there a problem with the new double decker Bombardier bus?  I am not aware of it I heard rumours recently.  Would the Minister confirm whether there is a new bus on test on that route?  It appeared to be a new type of bus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard accusations many times in this House about the lack of capital for CIE.  I am glad that in my short time as Minister for Transport that accusation did not stand up.  It has not been made by the Minister, but it was made by many <Col N="1646" /> of his cohorts.  This year we provided capital to the tune of £49½ million for a new bus fleet, for electrification and for many other improvements on the railways.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us how he followed up the recommendations in relation to the Buttevant railway crash. Have the recommendations been implemented? If not, why not?  Will they be implemented?  If some of them are not to be implemented, the general public and the House should be made aware of why they will not be implemented.</P>
    <P>The savings made under the various subheads were not detailed.  I see there were savings on subhead O.  Where are those savings?  The Minister and I have a personal interest in an amount of approximately £200,000 which was included in a Supplementary Estimate last June for the further development of the Abbey-shrule air strip.  If that money has not been spent this year, perhaps the Minister can tell me whether it will be spent next year.</P>
    <P>I also recall a figure of approximately £150,000 for Farranfore Airport development to enable it to take its place in the network of regional airports which we were glad to initiate when we were in Government.  They can contribute very usefully to the regional development policy we were pursuing.</P>
    <P>As we all know, Farranfore serves an area which demands long journeys for executives to get either to our capital city or to export markets.  I understood that, in consultation with a private air company, they would be very willing to provide a regular air service from Farranfore to Dublin at no cost to the Exchequer.  I notice an additional amount here also for the air service to Derry, initiated in my time as Minister.  I want to make it clear that while £1,000 was included under that subhead it was done deliberately for the reason that negotiations were proceeding with various companies and tenders had been invited for the operation of this service.  Had the figure of the estimated cost of this been included in the Estimates it would be clearly seen from the debate in this House and outside operators <Col N="1647" /> would know exactly what we had in mind for its subsidisation.  We all know that in a commercial situation &mdash; especially in regard to a figure coming from the Exchequer &mdash; that is the figure for which everybody will look.  I am sure the Minister and his officials fully appreciate the reasons behind that.  Everybody was aware of them at the time.</P>
    <P>I come now to another figure included under subhead O in relation to the Connacht regional airport.  My colleague, Deputy Flynn, will have an opportunity to add his words in support of this project. There has been a very sinister propaganda campaign to knock this project from day one.  I accept that the Government of the day have every right to change their minds about any project to which they feel they are not committed or which should not be proceeded with. But they stand indicted on the sequence of events in relation to this project.  On 15 September 1980 this project was approved in principle when no voices of objection or concern were raised, good, bad or indifferent.  In the Estimates for 1981 a new subhead, Subhead O was created in the Department of Transport Estimates to provide for the initial expenditure on this project.  Everybody will recall and accept that all the various planning had not been done at that point. A reasonable figure was put on the project because nobody really knew how far it would be advanced during the year. Subsequent events have illustrated that this project received early approval. Indeed on 2 May I announced the Government decision for a 6,000 foot runway at a cost of approximately £8 million &mdash; this part of it is very important &mdash; at 1980 prices, a factor that has been ignored by everybody, especially those who tried to present a wrong picture in relation to this project.  I repeat, at 1980 prices, it was estimated to cost £8 million.  It was obvious then that work was proceeding fairly quickly.  Consequently a Supplementary Estimate was prepared of £2.2 million and the Government of which I was a Member approved that Supplementary Estimate.  This Government, on their first day in business &mdash; and I sat on <Col N="1648" /> this side of the House watching &mdash; allowed that Supplementary Estimate pass through this House unanimously, not a single word being raised in objection to the expenditure of the £2.2 million.</P>
    <P>We all know the promises and commitments made during an election campaign. I have already recognised that the government of the day always are entitled to change their minds.  But, having waited until September until a spokesman was found to hoist the banner and flag against this project and to give out selective information &mdash; I say selective because that is what he used &mdash; to denigrate this project from day one is not good enough. The Minister himself did not take part in those deliberations but selective information and propaganda were used in relation to this project.  Then we had the hatchet finally fall when the Government themselves admitted that £6 million had now been committed to the project.  I ask this House: is it not wilful neglect and wastage of public money to have waited until Thursday evening last to decide that they were not now in favour of that project? Everybody was in favour of it earlier this year during the general election campaign, and if the government of the day had any misgivings about this project it was their responsibility to stop it before £6 million were spent.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the final scenario in this respect &mdash; the Government said that it can be left there to be continued perhaps at a later date.  It is quite clear that the Government have abandoned this project.  In so doing I want to ask them and get a direct answer: have they carried out an assessment of the money spent, have their technical advisers informed them that this project cannot be left in its present state because weather conditions will totally dissipate the gravel compounded on the site?  Furthermore if at any stage in the future this project is to be taken up again it will have to be started practically from scratch, from day one.  All of this means that one will wind up with a gross misuse of public money, no proper assessment having been carried out before the decision to call a halt.  If that runway is not sealed <Col N="1649" /> against weather conditions my information, not alone from the technical advisers on the site but from independent technical advisers, is that it cannot be left in that state or else, as some pressman has said, it will be a runway to nowhere.  In my view the Government stand indicted in relation to a project costing £6 million already.  They must have had doubts in their minds despite the fact that they hung out a poor Minister for the Gaeltacht to dry time and time again by allowing him make public announcements.  When he spoke undoubtedly he had to do so with full knowledge of the commitment to collective Cabinet responsibility.  At the same time it entailed the wastage of £6 million of public money.  I should like to hear an explanation.  I know that Deputy Flynn will go into this in more detail.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport have a number of semi-State bodies under their control, one being Aer Lingus.  I endeavoured to get a question on the Order Paper in relation to whether or not the Government had decided to take up more equity in Aer Lingus and, if so, what amount.  Perhaps the Minister would avail of this opportunity to inform us whether the Government have reached such a decision.  We are aware that legislation must be introduced to provide for more equity.  We are reaching the end of the calendar year and, if such a decision has been taken, we have not any knowledge of it.  We would be most interested to know.  It is interesting to note that events following on the July budget demonstrate that the Department of Finance now accept &mdash; as has been confirmed by Paul Tansey, a commentator in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; that £132 million did not constitute savings at all but rather were transferred for decision next year. I have held the view, and said here on the Financial debate, that the figures did not add up at all.  Quite clearly they did not because the Department of Finance now accept &mdash; and one can read this in a contribution of Paul Tansey in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; that those figures were transferred for decision to next year.  That is the type of information being poured out from time to time.  As time goes on the true facts of the situation emerge, and <Col N="1650" /> they are not as was represented back in June or July.  The figures I have been asking to be quantified have never been quantified, and here is another one affecting the present situation.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the B &amp; I have experienced a difficult year.  We are aware of the price war existing across the Irish Sea.  I noticed recently that Sealink was going to be sold to another ferries operator.  I wonder if the Minister followed up my earlier discussions with the then British Minister for Transport, Mr. Norman Fowler MP when I went over to London and expressed our interest in taking a share of Sealink if it were to come on the market.  He was not then able to tell me what the Government might decide in relation to it.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me if that move was followed up and if so, whether they decided that Sealink was of no further interest to us notwithstanding the fact that it is a vital link between Ireland and England.  The fear is that if it goes into other hands our interests may not be fully protected.  I have no doubt but that the B &amp; I at the time would have been interested to have a stake in it.  In that way they would be fully aware of what the future might hold in regard to these services or any changes to be made in them.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited are an excellent semi-State body doing an excellent job worthy of compliment.  I am glad to note that they have engaged in negotiations on the possibility of operating the P &amp; O service, or the now non-existent P &amp; O ferry service, from Belfast to Liverpool. I expressed that view some months ago. I hope they will be successful because it will demonstrate to the people in the North of Ireland that we are serious when we say we want to improve economic co-operation and economic links between the two parts of Ireland.  As I said at the time, this was an area where the Government could demonstrate their good faith.  I hope the negotiations are successful and that the Irish Shipping flag, run as it is always on sound commercial lines, will be able to take up the ferry service from Belfast to Liverpool. It would prove to the people in the North that we are serious when we say we will <Col N="1651" /> give them our economic co-operation in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>It has been a difficult year for tourist traffic and international travel.  Nevertheless, I look forward to Aer Rianta having a successful year, much more successful than last year.  Shannon Airport has been used as a reason for not proceeding with the Connacht regional airport.  Everyone looks at the two years when the downturn came but nobody wants to do a decent analysis of the performance of Aer Rianta and Shannon Airport in the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>Circumstances changed for Shannon Airport in 1978.  I took steps, and I know the Minister will proceed on the same lines, to develop new sources of business for the airport.  That is the way forward. The Aeroflot installation is proving even more successful than was originally thought and it will bring additional business. Other projects are in the pipeline and we hope they will be attracted to Shannon.  I mention the Federal Express project which would be a boon to Shannon, and there is also the pre-clearance project.  I know the Minister has had the report for some time on where the balance of advantage lies, with Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta naturally making their own arguments in relation to the US Customs pre-clearance project.  I do not know what is in the report.  Perhaps there is a valid reason for the Minister not to disclose what is in it but it is my view that we are entitled to know.  That project would be a major boost to the economic development of Shannon and would bring it back to the good old days when it did solid business which some people apparently now want to forget.  We know of the faint-hearted people who were around when Shannon Airport was first being considered.  At the time it was said by people of the same philosophy who knocked the Connacht regional airport that &ldquo;it will be a rabbit park for Rineanna&rdquo;.  When one considers what has happened in the past 20 or 30 years, can anyone say these people were right in their criticism?  If we had not men of courage to take such decisions, there would not have been any development at <Col N="1652" /> Shannon or in the mid-west region.  If the Minister has the courage to take the same action with regard to the Connacht regional airport, in 20 years time he will be seen to have made the right decision. Our approach has always been that the Connacht regional airport would be an instrument of regional development that would bring better communications to the area.  We all know that there will not be a proper road network in the west in our time because the hundreds of millions of pounds necessary for such infrastructure will not be available.  The spending of £12 million would have been a morale boost to business people in the west.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the NESC Report No. 59 which drew attention to this fact.  As a result of a field test, it emerged that one of the greatest obstacles was for executives to get to the international export markets as quickly as possible. They put that factor on a par with good telecommunications.  In the past two weeks the EEC Commission warned the Government that they should be very selective in their cuts in public expenditure and not to have such cuts that would hinder the development of the less well-off regions.  The decision last Thursday night flies in the face of the warnings of the EEC Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC will be very interested to hear that they have been quoted as being in favour of Knock airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That was contained in the submissions to the recent London Summit.  Will the Minister state if any application has been made to the Regional Fund for money in respect of the Connacht regional airport?  It is not Knock airport, as Deputies on the opposite side would like to label it.  The only reason it was called Knock airport is that it is situated near that shrine, which is our only international Marian shrine. That is an added bonus.  I wonder if the people who denigrate this project visited Lourdes 20 years ago?  Do they realise that 5 or 10 per cent of the traffic going to Lourdes would make this airport viable? <Col N="1653" /> Have we no confidence in our ability to market this airport and attract 50,000 passengers per year, which is small when one considers the pilgrimage traffic. What we need in this country are builders, not the demolition squad.  We need people who will take courageous decisions to help us out of our problems which are shared by many other countries.</P>
      <P>We have responsibility in this House to make decisions not only for today but for the future.  That is what the Government were elected to do.  I hope they will see the folly of their way regarding their decision on the Connacht regional airport and that they will protect the investment already made before it is destroyed by the weather.  If they do not reverse their decision it will be the hallmark of a bad decision.  I do not know if that decision was taken in vengeance or to suit the whims of certain individuals in the Government.</P>
      <P>Slide-rule economics will not solve the problems of our economy, and decisions based on such economics without regard to the repercussions will not help us. When economists put forward the data on which they base their decisions, the effect of such decisions should also be considered.  The next 12 months will show that many of the decisions taken at the whim of the economists will be to the detriment of this small economy.  Our economy needs help and nourishment to get through difficult times.  Are we to apply the same policies that have been seen to fail across the water and that are seen to be failing in America?  The director of the budget there resigned only in the last couple of weeks because he saw it was going in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my contribution to the Supplementary Estimate.  It is clear there is no difference of opinion between us, that the major factor in this Estimate was more subvention to CIE.  The Government are not giving them the full amount needed to pay for the full subvention.  I did not give it to them either because, like the present Minister and Government, I believed that the time had come to stop the blank cheque.  An effort has to be made to effect savings in this area but we cannot deal with it in isolation. <Col N="1654" /> We need a debate on the McKinsey Report and on the Transport Consultancy Commission Report &mdash; they are interlinked &mdash; in solving this complex problem of our transport needs of today. That is the only way to approach it.  I hope the Minister will take the very earliest opportunity in the next session to allow us to debate the matter in this House and let us know where we are going.  It is interesting to know by the savings that could be effected that this Estimate was not gerrymandered, as many people labelled it earlier.  It was done properly and effectively.</P>
    <P>Finally, a Supplementary Estimate was introduced in this House for £9 million for CIE last June.  Contrary to what spokesmen on that side said, that we decided that we would not give CIE a fare price increase because a general election was looming, the Minister is aware that we decided in May, not in June, not to give them an increase.  The increase was sought from the beginning of the year.  I personally was opposed to giving them that increase.  I took that stand at the Cabinet table because I did not believe that was the time to increase CIE fares when their bad buses were breaking down &mdash; not through their fault but because the buses had outrun their usefulness. That was not the time for a good commercial approach to a situation where we wanted to attract more people back to public transport.  Furthermore, when the Government were putting their anti-inflation programme together I was able to convince them that this area would contribute to the reduction of inflation and, that that was the right decision at the right time.  The Chairman and General Manager of CIE were informed personally by me &mdash; and I regretted to hear them make statements in public that we did not give them a fare increase &mdash; in the Minister's office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

I do not do business behind doors.  I do it out in the open and I will be the man to admit anything out in the open in the House or anywhere else.  I resent that sort of cheap political propaganda and their attempt to twist around the situation as they did with the ESB also.</P>

When the Ceann Comhairle left you a note that Deputy Flynn was next to speak nobody on this side was offering and Deputy Flynn would appear to have been the next Member offering in accordance with the order because there was nobody on this side. Because somebody on this side has now come in, in accordance with the order of the House that obviously must supersede the fact that the Deputy from the other side was offering.

Fitzgerald, is aware, <Col N="1661" /> listed in a particular supplementary estimate: Subhead B., Travelling and Incidental Expenses, £94,000; subhead C., Post Office Services, £1 million; subhead F., Law Charges, such as fees and awards, £76,000; and subhead H., Subscriptions to National Organisations, £2,000, making a total of £1,172,000 which is partly offset by a saving of £25,000 on subhead B.2., Office Machinery and other Supplies and an increase of £47,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>Vote No. 8 has grown substantially in recent years because of changes in the method of collection and in collection itself.  To what extent does the embargo on recruitment apply to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners? Have posts been left unfilled since 31 July?  That is not in the national interest from the point of view of the collection of tax.  It would be unpardonable from the point of view of State finances that this embargo should have the effect of leaving posts designed to facilitate the collection of revenue unfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been four appointments of non-civil servants at a cost of approximately £46,000 minimum.  That is only part of the total package because 40 posts have been filled from outside the civil service, such as advisers, personal assistants, public relations people, information officers and press people.  All those add to a figure of almost £500,000 in salaries and wages.  That does not take into consideration the costs of travelling and subsistence <Col N="1662" /> and the overheads.  There is a total cost of almost £493,900 approximately and that does not include consultancy. I can cite one consultancy which is not included, a consultant jointly between Finance and Health.  He is not included.  I am sure there are many others. We know there is one appointment to the Government at a cost of £32,000; to the Taoiseach's Office of seven at a cost of £103,500; the Tánaiste has five at a cost of about £60,000; Defence has one at £7,500 approximately; Fisheries and Forestry have one at a cost of £9,300; Social Welfare have one at £7,400; Finance have four at about £46,000; Labour have two, £17,000; Public Services have two at a cost of £25,000; Transport have one at a cost of £14,500; Posts and Telegraphs have one at a cost of £7,400; the Gaeltacht have one at a cost of £7,400; Justice have three at a cost of £27,000; Agriculture have three at a cost of £25,000; Foreign Affairs have two at a cost of £17,000; Education have five, at a cost of £54,000 and retainers on a PR firm, Heneghan and Herlihy, in respect of two Departments &mdash; Environment and Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; at a combined cost of about £24,000.  That brings the total to almost £500,000.</P>
    <P>Do not get me wrong.  There may be times when one would need to make appointments of advisers but the magnitude of these appointments is disturbing, to say the least, particularly in view of the Taoiseach's recent statement to the press that Ministers are busy people and that he believes these appointments are justified.  Surely that is an indictment of the very fine people available to advise in the civil service and public service administration here?  It is an indictment that the Taoiseach should consider numbers of that magnitude necessary to maintain the ordinary administration of Government.</P>
    <P>On the salaries, wages and allowances section, I appreciate the need for more staff.  To what extent has the embargo affected this and how in these circumstances, can the appointment of so many be justified, considering the availability of the expertise within the civil service &mdash; excellent expertise which is available in every Department.  That kind of <Col N="1663" /> expenditure is merely jobs for the boys and girls of the Government party.</P>
    <P>On the section regarding international organisations, I wanted to ask the Minister of State what the additional sum required was and what specific organisation was involved.  However, I appreciate the necessity for moving on to Votes 14 and 15.  I have nothing more to add.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Fitzgerald, subhead A.1. for salaries, wages and allowances, came in total, to £6,088,000, out of a total of £7.188 million.  The main bulk of the £6,088,000 arises in relation to the applicable grade awards in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners which, as the Deputy knows, are backdated to 1 September 1980.  That is the cost of the pay increases for which sanction was issued but for which no provision could be made in the 1981 Estimates, being inappropriate at that time, because the dates of sanction were in 1981, backdated to 1 September.  Of the £6,088,000, £5.2 million related to serving staff and other moneys related to determination of reassignments, allowances in the nature of pay, overtime and increments.  The money is straightforward in relation to pay and additional PRSI.  On the non-pay side, travelling expenses and Post Office services are accounted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing exceptional in the amount being sought by way of this Supplementary Estimate.  I refer to the Post Office services which are perhaps somewhat high at £1 million, but that is accounted for by the revision upwards by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of the amount to be paid for postage in 1981, due to increased charges and volume, both in 1980 and 1981, and increased telephone charges in 1981.  It might be suggested that the percentage increase is exceptionally high.  This is because the original Estimate for postage <Col N="1664" /> in 1981 took account of a credit of nearly £2 million, due to the postal strike of 1979.</P>
    <P>Certainly, as regards the other points made by the Deputy, I can assure him that the Supplementary Estimate for 1981 takes fully into account, in the different subheads of the different Departments, the particular increases in staff. That is the main point in relation to Vote 8 &mdash; Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The additional for salaries is in line with what the Minister has said and for paper and publications is £690,000, bringing a total of £807,000, which is correct mathematics, and then of course, the savings of £300,000 taken from that.

But this is not a clerical error because Pl.241 and Pl.355 contained different items and the major item is the reason for the £100,000 difference now that we have seen Pl.355 is an increase in appropriations-in-aid which were not on Pl.241.  It was more than just a clerical error; it was a mistake in the preparation of the Supplementary Estimate.  I want to know what procedures the Minister will adopt to eliminate any danger of a recurrence of this kind.  It might just as well have been £1 million that we were talking about.  We come in here prepared to discuss Supplementary Estimates as circulated to us and find that when we arrive here that Pl.241 as circulated is now defunct and is replaced by Pl.355 with no explanation other than the note on top of it that this Supplementary Estimate is a substitute to the Supplementary Estimate already circulated.</P>

      <P>It was a printing error on the original Estimate which was circulated and it has been corrected.  The original Estimate was £2.308 million.  The Supplementary Estimate is now £790,000 and the subhead provides for the purchase of stocks and supplies of paper, envelopes and miscellaneous paper items and for the purchase for immediate delivery to Departments of special requirements such as punch cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the increased cost in 1981 of these items.  It is a substantial increase of 34.2 per cent on the original Estimate.  If there was an error in estimation it was in the original Estimate which I would say was under-estimated by 34 per cent.</P>

On 1 December Deputy Walsh asked a question about the total value of the paper from January to 27 November.  The value was £1.294 million.  It is difficult to estimate the amount for a full year but I can give a monthly breakdown.  In January, the amount was £60,000; February, £62,000; March, £72,000; April, £29,000; May, £165,000; June, £191,000; July, £192,000.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate of £1.164 million is to meet trading losses and other costs arising from the operation of the McCartin Group of companies in receivership, in the period from 19 March 1980 to 3 February 1981.  These funds were advanced to the receiver by the Agricultural Credit Corporation consequent on a Government decision that the receiver should be provided with the funds necessary to enable him to meet the outgoings involved in keeping the group's businesses in operation until his examination of those business had been concluded.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, following consideration of the receiver's report the Government decided to ask Fóir Teoranta to examine the position of the group.  On 3 February 1981 the Government announced that, having considered the results of Fóir Teoranta's examination, they had decided that the receivership should proceed in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount which I am now asking the Dáil to approve is comprised as follows: Group losses for the period 19 March 1980 to 3 February 1981, including receiver's management charge of £276,500, £982,766; receiver's remuneration for report on financial position and viability of the group, £40,000; interest <Col N="1673" /> to the ACC on the foregoing amounts for period 4 February 1981 to 30 November 1981 £141,344.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused at times when I read and hear in the House criticisms of us when we were in Government. No Government in the history of the State has done as much as we, in the face of serious economic recession, to try to keep economic activity on a par with that of our EEC partners.  We succeeded far better than any of our EEC colleagues in keeping unemployment rising more slowly and economic activity at as high a level as it ever had been in Ireland, due to our decisions as the Government and our anxiety that jobs should be protected. We were faced with an extremely difficult situation because of the position in the west and because of the position in Leitrim. As the Minister of State pointed out, certain decisions were taken to ensure that every reasonable effort was made to protect jobs in that part of our country where we believed such jobs were needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has spelled out the position in regard to the provision of finance.  We believed this was a position which could not continue indefinitely. We needed to save jobs, and we wanted to take every reasonable measure to do that in the interests of the area and in the interests of the workers.  There were other contributory factors which made it important for us to examine the position in a detached manner with the sole purpose of taking decisions best suited to the needs of the area and the people in it.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that in that group there were certain political interests. Whether that political interest be the Government's or the Opposition's, as it was in this case, obviously the Government had to be seen to be taking decisions which were cold, reasonable, sensitive and detached in the interests of the community. We did that.  We had to be seen to be taking those decisions independently, and we did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister of State to tell me what has happened since the change of Government.  What steps have been taken, if any?  What involvement has <Col N="1674" /> there been by the Minister of State or the Minister for Finance?  The House is entitled to know what the position is.  We also want to know whether meetings have taken place between the ACC and the company or the ACC and the directors. Is there co-operation from the directors? Is there co-operation from all sides? What are the prospects?  Has the Minister a view on what the final outcome will be? What is the present cost in money terms? Is it £14,000 a week and, if so, since when?  The Minister of State must let us have the answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>Can he indicate to us when negotiations, discussions, consultations and efforts to sell portions of the company as going concerns will be concluded, what the number of jobs will be, and how many will be saved?  How soon will final decisions be taken?  What steps are being taken to reach a conclusion?  Those are the basic questions I want to put to the Minister.  This was a matter of some concern to us, and understandably so. Because of the concern of the Fianna Fáil Government for the workers of the west, a part of rural Ireland we all believe in supporting, the Minister is obliged to spell out for us clearly what the present position is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is a very involved subject covering a very complicated financial situation and covering eight companies and many employees. I appreciate what Deputy Fitzgerald said about the difficulties of the area in which these industries were located.  I am not sure whether there is a tradition in this House that one should declare an interest.  If it must be put on the record that I have some interest in this matter, my interest is that I was a director of all the companies which are the subject of this discussion.  I am not directly involved now because of the fact that the companies are in receivership.  I am not engaged in either buying or selling these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back to the beginning of the problems raised by Deputy Fitzgerald, it is true to say that the area in question needed more than just pious gestures of goodwill and concern about emigration. <Col N="1675" /> We are talking about a county in which the population dropped from something like 60,000 to 30,000 over a period of years during which the country was governed by various Governments, but mainly by Fianna Fáil Governments, who presided over the liquidation of the youth and strength and vitality of a county and a community.  I refer not only to County Leitrim but a wider area including west Cavan and parts of Donegal and Sligo and north Longford.  Leitrim is the only county which is entirely within that severely handicapped area, the Drumlin Belt.  Therefore, as a county our figures show up worse than others while other communities and areas and parts of other counties suffered similar disadvantages.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the directors, with the agricultural advisers, with the goodwill and assistance of a helpful community, with the participation of a work-force second to none, built up these companies to a level where they provided something like 320 jobs at one stage.  That was the peak.  Over a period of years good wages were paid and steady employment was provided by the group and the associated activities for 300 people.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge the total amount of industrial development grant paid was around £150,000.  No public services were provided.  Roads were built privately.  No advance factories were provided. Water and sewerage facilities were provided privately.  No housing schemes were looked for.  In co-operation with each other the workers built their own houses.</P>
    <P>It was a difficult situation over the years.  It was a difficult position on which to build something of this sort.  Of course it was not planned.  Of course there was no blueprint.  Of course there was no agreement from financial institutions before the jobs started.  Financial institutions would have said it was not possible to do it, and that would be that. Naturally we were not working to a master plan developed over the years.  By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the community, the workers, the directors and everyone involved. The IDA were of assistance in so far as <Col N="1676" /> their limited resources permitted them to be.  There was a very inadequate agricultural advisory service which did the best with the resources available to them.  If 300 people throughout the country had made a similar effort and had the same level of success, we would have no unemployment in Ireland today.  At one stroke 300 similar efforts would have solved our whole unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the IDA grants.  We are not blaming any one.  Perhaps the directors are to blame for the fact that more grants did not come.  Normally industrialists make careful plans and do not drive a nail, or lay a brick, until they are positive that they will get State assistance. The directors at Newtowngore had resolved to solve the unemployment problem in their own area with or without outside assistance.  If all the loans made available by the Agricultural Credit Corporation were added to the grant assistance, if one sought to solve the unemployment problem throughout the country by that sort of financing, and if those loans were not repayable but a free handout, the jobs would still have been provided at half the cost of creating industrial jobs in the west.</P>
    <P>Therefore we find a minimum of State investment, reasonable success with the provision of jobs, and an industry which it cannot be denied was, for the directors and the workers, like taking a currach out into the Atlantic in all sorts of weather.  It is not easy.  Nobody will pretend that the directors or the workers involved were perfect managers or perfect employees but I contend that in difficult circumstances those people did the best they could to solve the unemployment problem and create something which, in my opinion, could have survived the storm with a little more timely and careful consideration.  I shall not go over that ground.  I do not do so unless I believe there is something useful to be gained therefrom.</P>
    <P>I will say, however, that there was one industry only in the group which had serious problems &mdash; that was T. and J. Farms &mdash; a company which was totally borrowed, an agricultural enterprise. Most of us will agree that in the agricultural <Col N="1677" /> industry at the best of times one cannot afford to pay more than perhaps 10 per cent on money borrowed.  At the time that company went into receivership 20.8 per cent was the rate of interest being charged.  It was not possible to meet that then or at any other time.  We have a subsequent report from the Irish Agricultural Institute.  I am sorry, Sir, if I am creating a problem, please tell me.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy G. Fitzgerald, the Chair would like to explain his problem.  The Chair's problem is that the Whips have agreed to a debate to take place within one hour. <Col N="1678" /> On the other hand, the Standing Order which covers that same debate is one which applies to a debate where time is unlimited, and the Chair must do that.

      <P>The final point I wanted to make is that it is widely recognised at this stage that interest charges of the magnitude about which I have just spoken could not be met.  I should like to refer the Minister to a report from the Agricultural Institute on the company concerned which might enlighten him to some extent.  I have not discussed this with him or any other Minister. I want merely to refer him to that report.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a few points because I was involved to a large extent with the Government at the time. Deputy G. Fitzgerald has explained quite clearly what was our position then and I do not intend to go over that ground.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a few questions of the Minister and give him an opportunity to reply.  Indeed, it is a pity we have not more time because this is a very important subject.  The figures concerned are those mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate, which was up to 1 February last only and the interest up to November only.  As I understand it, the cost of the continuing receivership works put at approximately £14,000 a week, since 3 February last.  We have not been providing any money since then other than for interest to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. That would leave an additional cost of £602,000 which has not been taken into account in this Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the primary concern of everybody in this, from all sides of the House, at all times was the protection of all possible jobs in the area.  Questions must be asked, and replies must be given, about <Col N="1679" /> the lack of co-operation by the people concerned on the ground with the receivership and the Agricultural Credit Corporation since then.  Nobody anticipated that this problem would continue practically two years after the first involvement of the receiver.  The time has come for the conclusion of this matter, bearing in mind that the priority in the involvement of the Government at that time was the protection of jobs in rural areas.  We must have some elaboration on the Minister's ideas as to when this involvement of the receivership will conclude, to what extent jobs have been, or will be, saved and the amounts of money that will be lost in the overall group of companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make just a few comments.  The direct involvement of the Government in relation to the receivership, as we know, ended on 3 February 1981.  Therefore all issues in relation to the companies in receivership are matters at this stage solely for the parties directly concerned.  It is correct that the cost of keeping the receivership in operation is £14,000 per week.  But that is not a matter which directly involves the Government as such.  It is an ACC cost and that cost will be borne by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Government involvement did cease on 3 February last and the conduct of the receivership since then is a matter exclusively for the ACC since the Government decided that the receivership should proceed in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion &mdash; and I am expressing a personal opinion here &mdash; the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, indeed the Taoiseach himself, displayed enormous generosity and understanding and made every human effort to assist in this situation.  In other circumstances they would have been entirely justified in taking an entirely different course of action.  It would be entirely remiss of me today if I did not say that I found incredulous &mdash; that is the only word I can use &mdash; the contribution by my colleague, Deputy McCartin, who decided of his own volition to make a contribution to <Col N="1680" /> this debate.  I believe he has a great deal &mdash; and I underline a great deal &mdash; to answer for, together with his co-directors, in relation to the outcome of this situation.  For the record I felt that must be stated.  It is the minimum that should be stated here today in relation to £1.164 million of taxpayers' money, not to mention the other substantial sums involved in this whole affair.  In charity, and perhaps in a lot of other contexts, I would be wise to leave it at that at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism in view of the £6.3 million profit made by the Electricity Supply Board this year, if he will now withdraw the 80 per cent <Col N="1684" /> increase in the fuel variation charge which the Government sanctioned with effect from 1 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fuel cost variation surcharge operated by the ESB is the mechanism which reflects increases or decreases in fuel costs to the board.  It is intended to help balance revenue with fuel costs and it does not generate any profit or loss.</P>
      <P>The rates of surcharge, which are subject to review every four months, are examined in detail by the National Prices Commission and any increase in rates must have Government approval.  The latest review, undertaken by the National Prices Commission in October 1981, revealed that no reduction in the present rates of surcharge is warranted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase in the rates of surcharge implemented from the August-September 1981 billing period, I should point out that a factor which contributed significantly to the level of that increase was the necessity to recoup increased fuel costs incurred by the board in the period from February 1981 when a decision on revised rates of surcharge was postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the 80 per cent increase will mean an increase of £100 million in revenue to the ESB and is he saying that this additional revenue is entirely necessary?  Further, is the Minister aware that this increase has meant practically a £3 increase per week for the average consumer and that consumers who are heavily dependent on electricity will pay even more?  Does he consider this a reasonable charge to apply now or is it part of the general decimation of the middle income group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood the content of the reply. The reason for the size of the fuel cost variation surcharge agreed upon last summer was that the increase which the ESB had sought from the National Prices Commission in February last in relation to allowable cost increases, and which <Col N="1685" /> had been approved by them, was not approved by the previous Government. Because of the serious situation in which that placed the ESB by the summer of this year it became necessary not only to adjust the EEC rate of surcharge which had been recommended by the NPC in early February 1981, but to adjust it in such a way as to raise the surcharge on electricity charges for one year in order to recoup the shortfall because of the failure of the previous Government to provide sufficiently for the ESB's fuel surcharge cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that after that decision was taken by the Minister for Finance the ESB declared a profit of £6.3 million?  Is the Minister suggesting then that, had the ESB been given the increase that they sought earlier in the year, that profit would have been £15 million?  How can the Minister come to the House and tell us at this stage that it was necessary at that time?  This is a factual situation.  The ESB subsequently declared £6.3 million profit.  If they had had the increase that the Minister says was necessary for them to recoup themselves at this stage they would have £15 million profit.  I refer the Minister to their figures.  I ask him to look once again at that 80 per cent surcharge which is causing extreme hardship and difficulty outside. The ESB revenue is just over £400 million and this is an extra £100 million on £400 million which in any terms is enormous.  From that extra £100 million which the ESB will take in as a result of this increase, would the Minister consider giving some money to improve supplementary welfare and to assist the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul who at present are in extreme difficulty?  The Minister must be aware of this now.  I recognise that the Minister's mid-July budget put increased taxes on the fuel cost to the ESB and of that £100 million perhaps £60 million is being recovered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion between accounting periods in the question posed by the Deputy.  The ESB accounts for the year ended 31 March <Col N="1686" /> 1981, which were not published until September 1981 show that the board had achieved a surplus of £6.3 million, as the Deputy said, on electricity sales in excess of £400 million.  However, that surplus merely enabled the board to reduce their accumulated deficit from £21.3 million to £15 million.  The Government had decided in late 1979 to allow the ESB to reactivate their surcharge in respect of fuel cost variations because it was felt at that time that the reintroduction of a surcharge would allow the ESB to recover the escalating fuel cost increases quickly.  The NPC recommended at that time and the Government of the day accepted that the surcharge be reviewed on a four-monthly basis.  Those periods fell in February, June and October of each year when the actual and likely cost of fuel to the ESB is taken into account. Consequently, the surcharge is a mechanism which enables the board to match revenue against fuel costs.  Any over-or-under recovery in the operation of the surcharge in any period is taken into account in the next review.  Consequently, the surcharge mechanism does not generate either profit or loss for the board.  In accordance with the arrangements which the previous Government had entered into, the ESB submitted in late December 1980 the review of their fuel surcharge to take effect from February-March of the 1981 billing period.  That was based on unrecovered costs amounting to £61.99 million.  The NPC accepted that, because of the projected increased cost in fuel for the financial year April 1981-March 1982 together with under-recovered costs for the previous financial year and some other once-off costs, that additional £61.99 million in respect of fuel cost variation surcharge ought to be allowed.  The Minister at the time accepted the NPC recommendation and conveyed his decision to the then Department of Energy whose responsibility it was to obtain Government approval for the increase.  However, the Government of the day decided not to authorise the increase, consequently in summer of this year the ESB's accumulated deficit was considerably larger than it would have been had the <Col N="1687" /> increase recommended by the NPC and the Minister been accepted by the Government that time.</P>

From the extra revenue being taken by the Minister for Finance, would the Minister not make further moneys available to sustain supplementary welfare which is under great pressure at the moment and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul who are paying an increasing number of ESB bills?  The Minister should recognise also that if this increase had been given at the time, then the ESB's profit instead of being £6.3 million would have been £15 million.</P>

He has referred to the two months during which Fianna Fáil should have increased the price which was in the old accounting period of February and March.  If it had been increased in February and March in effect their profit would have been £15 million.  That is the point I am making.  I am not confusing accounting periods.  It is purely a matter of information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1981 money was provided under the special Border area programme fund administered under a special subhead in the Department of Finance Vote.  The programme was financed jointly by Ireland and the European Commission.  The money is paid from the fund to each Department and agency from the Department of Finance fund in accordance with each one's responsibility under the programme.  In this respect Bord Fáilte receive money for tourism projects in Border counties.  The 1981 allocation to Bord Fáilte under the special Border area programme fund is broken down as follows: promotion £100,000; accommodation £575,000; amenities, £250,000, to make a total in all of £925,000</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitution of Bord Fáilte Éireann is set out in the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1979.  I have no plans at present to seek changes in Bord Fáilte's constitution.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy in referring to regional tourist boards has in mind the eight regional tourism organisations. These organisations are public companies limited by guarantee and run by boards of directors who are appointed in the main by local interests.  The question of their constitutions is not a matter for me.</P>
      <P>In December 1980 the NESC, in its Report No. 52, expressed certain reservations about the effectiveness of these bodies and, at the same time, my predecessor announced that the Government had decided to review their activities. That review has not yet been concluded, but additional resources to enable the work to be carried out more expeditiously have recently been provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister is not here because this is the only chance we have of asking a question in this session. On 30 November the Minister said in Sligo that the Exchequer would be withdrawing its present contribution to the regional tourist board.  I wonder what he has in mind.  Why is that money being withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1980 the then Minister announced that the Government <Col N="1692" /> of the day had decided to carry out a review of the RTOs and established a Departmental committee for that purpose. That committee had not really got off the ground and the new Government decided on an overall review of tourism which would naturally include a review of the financing and future structure of the RTOs.  I would assume it was in reference to that the Minister for Trade and Tourism was speaking in Sligo.  I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to the House for the absence of the Minister through illness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that the original intention was that the regional tourism organisations should become financially self-sufficient over a period.  That in fact never occurred and as time went on the input from Bord Fáilte formed an increasing part of the overall expenditure of RTOs.  If a review on tourism policy generally was being carried out an integral part of that would be the future financing of RTOs and I assume it was in that context the Minister was speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that reports, such as the NESC report and others, seem to be creating an anti-regional climate and that is really why these questions have been tabled?  Members are worried that the Government are in the throes of an anti-regional philosophy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should mention that on 2 April last in reply to questions from Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Begley the Minister of State at the time pointed out that his Government had announced last December that they were going to carry out a review of the regional tourism organisations and had established an inter-departmental committee for that purpose.  The question of reviewing the <Col N="1693" /> organisation of RTOs is not one that was arrived at last summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can assure me there is no such anti-regional philosophy developing in the Government, which would affect the regional board in the same way as other projects have been affected, I shall be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured the Government have equal responsibility for all parts of the country and any suggestion of favouritism between one part as against another, which might perhaps be suggested about the past, would be quite untrue and fallacious. The Government intend to administer the affairs of the country on an equitable basis.</P>

The Minister is quoting precedents, well-established practices and so forth, without the Chair having made any comment on that part <Col N="1700" /> of it.  I know that the Chair is not responsible for the replies, but suggest that the Chair surely has a responsibility that the Minister reply to the questions on the Order Paper.  The Minister has refused on the specious ground that there is a legal action pending and that it is <i>sub judice.</i> It is not, in fact, <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He is taking them individually.  He has already stated that Question No. 14 will not be answered by him because of a threatened legal action. It is a tradition of the House, and I can see a sound and valid reason for it, that matters which are <i>sub judice,</i> because of the protection we have in the House, should not be discussed or debated or be the subject of any kind of wrangling in this House.  This matter, however, is not <i>sub judice</i> and anything which is said here cannot affect any kind of judicial process whatsoever.  For that reason, the Minister is obliged to answer the question as put down to him on the Clár.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister refuses to answer, or gives the answer which he has just given, the Chair has no say in the matter and the Deputy must accept that.  If he is dissatisfied, he has an opportunity to raise the matter on the Adjournment, when the Chair has examined his request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

But the Chair will be aware, and Deputy Wilson should be aware, that the advices given to me are long-standing and relate not just to this matter but to other matters in the past when similar action was taken and similar decisions were made by Ministers.  I did endeavour to point out to the House, when I tried to take these questions collectively, that it was in the interests of the expeditious business of the House that they should be taken collectively.  The House did not agree and I was asked to deal with them <Col N="1702" /> individually.  That I now propose to do, with the permission of the Chair.</P>

      <P>Congress declares that the Organisation shall seek a Declaration in the Courts that the Minister for Education is in breach of contract or has induced breach of contract with teachers in National Schools.</P>
      <P>I then went on to say that, following long-established precedent in relation to matters of which notice is given that an action may be taken in the courts in regard to them, I consider that I am precluded from offering comment on the issues raised in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

      <P>Let me repeat my request to the Minister, so that some sanity might be brought into this situation.  Will he allow the meeting that I suggested to take place to establish clearly precedents that are in accord with the traditions of the Chair and of this House in the past?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All of this matter was debated some ten minutes ago.  I suggest strongly to the House that the most expeditious way of dealing with this matter is to have one reply put forward, because of the very difficult situation in which I find myself which is not of my making and not of my desire.  I would far prefer to be in a position to answer each of these questions individually.  Because of that situation I felt that it was better that the questions ought to be answered collectively. The House chose that they be answered individually.  The Chair asked if I would do so and I agreed.  With the permission of the Chair, I will proceed to do that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to take the question of precedents and have it discussed with our front bench spokesman?  I would also like to point out that we have exercised great restraint in view of the Minister's failure to give us a comprehensive reply and in view of the specious reason he gave that this is a <i>sub judice</i> situation.  We cannot accept the situation that has emerged in the House this evening.  I am asking the Minister again to agree to a meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Chair saying that, if we accept this first question, we will have to accept all of the questions, because all of them are connected with Circular 24 of 1981?  What we are being <Col N="1704" /> asked to do is buy a pig in a poke.  That is not fair to the people concerned on this side of the House.  It is not fair to the people throughout the country who are vitally interested in the subject matter of these questions.  There is sleight of hand here to get over the answering of these questions or the facing up to these questions, and nobody in the House should be in aid of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an established practice in the House whereby a number of questions are answered together.  Deputy Wilson, as a former Minister, knows it very well.  He also knows that the Chair has no control over the reply given by a Minister and if the reply is not to his satisfaction he can raise the matter on the Adjournment. They are the only devices open to the Deputy at the moment and the Chair cannot facilitate him in any way further than that.  I have been very lenient with the Deputy and I must now go on to the next question.</P>

      <P>I realise that the Chair has a problem.  I realise also that the Chair has not had an opportunity to study in detail what happened in this House once before when an attempt was made to answer 17 questions together.  It outraged both sides of the House and a decision was taken to have the questions answered on the following day.  If the questions were postponed until Tuesday, the Chair would have an opportunity to examine that precedent and see how it relates to the problem that we have now.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I would propose to discuss the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Labour, for the Office of the Minister for the Public Service, for Superannuation and Retired Allowances and for Remuneration together.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Labour has five components; an additional £255,000 under subhead H &mdash; Resettlement Allowances; an additional £104,500 under subhead O &mdash; Grants for Trade Union Education and Advisory Services; an additional £300,000 under subhead U &mdash; Work Experience Programme; a sum of £20,000 under a new subhead, subhead Z &mdash; Training and Employment of Young Persons including Youth Employment Agency; and to balance the foregoing an increase of £679,490 under subhead Y &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resettlement assistance scheme provides financial assistance to persons changing their normal place of residence to take up employment offered through or approved by the National Manpower Service where vacancies cannot be filled <Col N="1741" /> locally.  In 1979, the Manpower Consultative Committee proposed a skills recruitment campaign abroad to attract key workers who were at that time in short supply here.  The campaign was duly carried out and there was a further similar campaign in 1980.</P>
    <P>The Committee saw the resettlement assistance scheme as a vital instrument for attracting such skilled workers and, to this end, the scheme was adapted to offer special inducements to these persons. A higher level of grants was offered to skilled workers coming from abroad and a special disturbance grant was introduced for key workers taking up employment here as a result of these campaigns. Eligibility for this grant continues for two years after settling to take up employment here.</P>
    <P>There is an inevitable time lag in attending to removal formalities and, as a consequence, applications from eligible workers who responded to the recruitment campaigns are still coming to hand. Since mid-1979, about 640 workers have resettled from abroad with the assistance of the scheme to date; of these some 400 may qualify for the special grant. Expenditure under the resettlement assistance scheme has risen from £138,000 in 1979 to £415,000 in 1980 and prospectively to £475,000 in 1981, due mainly to resettlement from abroad in which these campaigns referred to have been a major factor.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions receives an annual grant from the Labour Vote towards costs incurred in its education, training and advisory services.  It has been decided to supplement the level of this grant in 1981 arising from the enactment of the Safety in Industry Act, 1980.  This Act makes compulsory the establishment of a consultative system between employers and employees on matters of occupational safety and health.  The relevant part of the Act came into operation on 1 April 1981.</P>
    <P>Workers were given the right to make within the following six months, up to 30 September 1981, the necessary appointments from their side to a safety committee or, if appropriate, having regard to the number of persons employed, to <Col N="1742" /> appoint a safety representative.  If the workers failed to exercise their right by 30 September an onus of making the appropriate arrangements falls on the employer to do so within the following three months, up to 31 December 1981.</P>
    <P>All safety committees are joint employer-employee bodies.  Safety representatives, regardless of who appoints them, are drawn from the workers' side. Because of the requirement in the Act as regards the involvement of workers in the systems provided for, ICTU and affiliated unions have undertaken extensive publicity and training programmes connected with these committees and safety representatives.  The extra grant of £104,500 under the subhead is intended as a contribution by the State towards the additional costs incurred by the trade unions in this work.</P>
    <P>The Work Experience Programme has been in existence since 1978.  Average weekly participation in 1980 was approximately 2,122 young people ranging from about 1,800 to 2,500 persons per week. In 1981 to date, weekly participation has ranged from 2,050 to 3,032 with an average of 2,349 per week.  The original allocation under subhead U for 1981 is £2.1 million and this has not proved adequate to cater for the demands being made on the programme.</P>
    <P>Apart from the continuing success of the programme, I am glad to be able to say that about 80 per cent of the participants obtained employment during or on completion of their assignment under the programme &mdash; about 50 per cent of these with the employer who provided the work experience opportunity.  The additional allocation of £300,000 now sought is a measure of the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware from the recent debate on the Youth Employment Agency Bill, it is the intention that the Work Experience Programme will be funded through the agency from 1982 onwards and will, I hope, be considerably expanded by it.</P>
    <P>As regards the funding of the Youth Employment Agency and the training and employment of young persons, Deputies will appreciate from the discussion <Col N="1743" /> on the Bill that it is necessary to provide for some preliminary expenditure in 1981, primarily in making arrangements for setting up the agency.  A new subhead is accordingly included in this Supplementary Estimate for the purpose and a provision of £20,000 is proposed.</P>
    <P>A token Supplementary Estimate only is required to finance the additional expenditure because appropriations-in-aid will exceed the provision provided for in the original Estimate.  The increased appropriations-in-aid arise from receipts from the European Social Fund.  I might mention that expenditure under both the work experience programme and the resettlement allowances scheme qualified for European Social Fund assistance, the effect of which is that the net cost to the Exchequer of these services is considerably less than the gross amounts provided for under the related subheads.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for the Public Service is to meet additional expenditure on four subheads of the Vote &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances; Office Machinery and other Office Supplies; Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí and a grant-in-aid to the Institute of Public Administration. The total sum required for this additional expenditure is £615,000, of which £248,000 can be met from savings elsewhere on the Vote and from an increase in appropriations-in-aid.  The net amount required, therefore, is £367,000.</P>
    <P>On subhead A.1. &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances &mdash; the extra amount required is £515,000.  This is to meet the cost of pay increases and also of a number of new posts, mainly in the computer central unit of my Department, for which provision was not made in the original Estimate although in the case of the new posts most had been created before the Estimate was finalised.  Provision for pay increases was, however, included in an allocation provided in the budget to cover possible pay increases in the public service generally.</P>
    <P>An additional expenditure of £5,000 arises on subhead B.2. &mdash; Office Machinery and other Office Supplies &mdash; and is <Col N="1744" /> needed to meet the cost of replacing certain equipment and to allow for increased prices generally.</P>
    <P>Is mar gheall ar leathnú ar réimse agus saghsanna cursaí i nGaeleagras atá an cúig míle (£5,000) breise ag teastáil faoi fó-mhircheann F. den Vóta.</P>
    <P>The remaining increase of £90,000 is in respect of the grant-in-aid to the Institute of Public Administration.  Again, this is to meet the cost in 1981 of pay increases for which provision was not included in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the various increases have been offset by savings on other subheads, mainly £62,000 on subhead B.1. &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses &mdash; and by an extra £176,000 obtained as receipts under appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Vote 21, the Vote for Superannuation and Retired Allowances, for which a net sum of £2.51 million in addition to the sum of £27.355 million originally estimated, is required to meet unavoidable outgoings in the current year.  This Vote covers the cost of pensions and lump sums for civil servants and widows of civil servants and the Judiciary together with the increased cost of pensions under the annual pensions revision.</P>
    <P>As levels of expenditure are determined by factors not under the control of the Vote it is difficult to predict the pattern of future expenditure.  The basic reason for the additional provision now sought is to meet the increased pension costs resulting from various pay awards, the full extent of which could not be foreseen by Departments at the time the original Estimate was prepared.  Also, some of these awards involved payment of arrears for significant periods.</P>
    <P>The printed Supplementary Estimate for Remuneration as circulated is incorrectly numbered.  The Vote number is 54, not 53.  The amount of £1.484 million is required to meet the cost of pay increases on six Votes.  The Votes concerned and the amount required for each Vote are set out in Part III of the Supplementary Estimate.  The amount sought is required to meet the following increases &mdash; (i) the cost of certain miscellaneous pay <Col N="1745" /> increases and (ii) the increased cost of employers' pay-related social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Estimates Volume did not make provision for these increases as they did not arise in time for inclusion in the volume.  The amount sought in the Supplementary Estimate is the cost of increases on the Votes mentioned, offset by savings on the Votes where such savings are available.  In other Votes similar increases are either being met from savings or are being included as separate items in Supplementary Estimates for the Votes concerned.  Particulars of such increases are also given in Part III of the Supplementary Estimate for Remuneration.</P>
    <P>If Deputies require any further information on matters dealt with in these Supplementary Estimates I shall be pleased to furnish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that we should be debating a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour in a week in which there has been an announcement from the Central Statistics Office that the number of people unemployed has reached a figure of over 133,000, which is the highest rate in 45 years, or indeed since the year 1936. What has amazed us all, and indeed the public and Press, was that those figures were issued without any comment from any Government Minister or from the Taoiseach himself.  It has been a tradition that when figures were released about unemployment, whether they showed an increase or decrease in the numbers unemployed, the Minister for Labour made some comment on why they were so high or why there had been a reduction. To my knowledge this is the first occasion &mdash; and I hope it is not setting a precedent for the future &mdash; that the Government have refused to comment on figures released from the Central Statistics Office regarding the number of people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to say that the last occasion on which I had to comment on the numbers unemployed was in respect of the figures for May of this year when there was a reduction of 2,500.  That is a far cry <Col N="1746" /> from the announcement on Monday evening last that there had been an increase of almost 4,000.  Statistically it is correct that since the present Government took office there has been an increase of 10,000 in the number of people unemployed. That has continued without comment. It is obvious that whatever programme was worked out by the Coalition parties, in consultation with one or two Independents, in order to form a Government, it has not been successful.  I sincerely hope that the Government will take a look at the situation that arose here yesterday in which an Independent Deputy, Deputy Sherlock, was suspended from this House because of his concern about the situation obtaining in the meat processing industry.  He made a very good point in so far as employees are concerned.</P>
    <P>When we debate a subject like this we must examine all aspects of the problem. Therefore, we must think of the producer also.  In this case the producer of the raw material to be processed is the farmer and we know that over the past couple of years farmers have had a lean time. Nobody in this House, outside it or anywhere else could blame a farmer for selling his cattle at the highest price he can obtain, and also the people &mdash; the barons, as they were referred to yesterday &mdash; to whom the cattle are exported.  That is any salesman's job and one to which nobody can object.  But, if that is the case, why has nothing been done about it?</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock and the Minister for Agriculture were on television last night and there was disagreement about the subsidy paid by the EEC towards the export of beef on the hoof and processed beef.  In that interview the Minister for Agriculture said that the difference in the subsidy between exporting beef on the hoof and exporting beef in processed form was only £18.  If that is the position the matter should be considered again, particularly when we know that jobs are so scarce and that an increasing number of people are joining the dole queues. We have the necessary raw material for the products we export to Libya and elsewhere and we should take advantage of that.  The same situation applies with <Col N="1747" /> regard to vegetables and other foodstuffs. We have the land and the climate but in the past few months in my area and elsewhere plants have closed down. This has happened even in the case of a semi-State body such as Erin Foods.  It is time for the Government to wake up and do something about this matter.</P>
    <P>When debating a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour we must come back to a major problem which was the concern of the leader of our party when he was Taoiseach, namely, industrial relations.  I wish to correct a statement made by the Minister in this House and outside it.  It was in connection with the intervention of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, the then Minister for Finance and formerly Minister for Labour, and myself in the oil tanker drivers' dispute.  If I recall correctly, the Minister said our intervention delayed settlement of that dispute.  For the record I want to state exactly what was the situation.</P>
    <P>Both parties were in dispute, the employers and the unions.  The Labour Court called them to the table but one party refused to go on the terms of reference laid down.  Strike notice was issued and the tankers were grounded. The Government then took a decision that proved correct, that I and the former Minister for Labour should do our part to bring both parties together.  It was not a question of our suggesting a means of settling the strike or of specifying any money terms.  We met both parties to try to get a formula.  I did the same thing with two other Deputies in the Sugar Company dispute in Carlow.  After four days of discussions between both parties, to the credit of the Labour Court they issued a recommendation within 24 hours and to the credit of the employers and the trade unions they acted very quickly. The unions were obliged to have a national ballot but the result was out within 24 hours and shortly afterwards the tankers were rolling again.  I did not like the suggestion of the Minister that our intervention had delayed settlement of that dispute.  Because of that Government intervention there was no panic <Col N="1748" /> buying.  People got their normal supplies of petrol and the economy did not break down.  Our only objective was to get the parties together because a national problem had arisen.  It was a good decision by the Government and I was very pleased to be a member of that team.</P>
    <P>In discussing a Supplementary Estimate for this Department we must comment on industrial relations.  We must improve our industrial relations and this must be a priority.  I have always maintained that legislation in itself in this area is not the answer.  However, I am sure all Members of the House will agree that there are defects in our present system and legislation can be effective in that connection.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in the past ten years two out of every three strikes were unofficial.  We cannot condone the action of workers, usually a minority, who, having joined a trade union and having elected their leaders, disregard not only that leadership but also the laid-down and agreed civilised procedures. Unofficial strikes undermine the trade union movement, they create problems of discipline and cause the entire trade union movement to be unjustly blamed. We must ask the question why there are so many unofficial strikes and we must look for the reasons.  The answer may be lack of communication.  It may be that in many firms there are not proper public relations officers.  It is often the case that the person in a company who is delegated the job of public relations officer just waits in his office and has not proper consultation with the workers.  There are also workers who do not communicate sufficiently with their unions.</P>
    <P>Some months ago on television I saw a worker who was on unofficial strike being asked by an interviewer what he thought about the national understanding and its clauses.  The worker said that the lads on the floor wanted to know nothing about that.  Such problems can occur.  The Minister, in answer to a question of mine and on some other occasion also, said in the House that he intended to introduce a Bill to amend the 1906 Act but only in so far as it refers to the coverage <Col N="1749" /> of law for people in the public service.  That is in the 1981 national understanding.  He has now got the report of the Commission on Industrial Relations. It was regrettable that the ICTU withdrew from that over the very problem now facing the 1981 national understanding. Many unions made their submissions. I have not read that report in full but I am aware that it contains some excellent recommendations as regards the structure of the Labour Court and many other matters.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to rush this through the House that is OK, but I think the whole lot should be taken together. Amendments should be introduced to improve the machinery for solving disputes. That is not a criticism of the Labour Court because we all understand their difficulties.  Two-thirds of our strikes are unofficial and many times they have brought about the eventual closure of industries.  I and this House know that our future depends on good industrial relations.  The Minister will have the support of this side of the House in anything he brings before this House which in our opinion will improve industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H. &mdash; Resettlement Allowances &mdash; the additional sum required is £255,000.  The Minister said that this money is required because of the number of people we have re-imported, so to speak, into this country for the purpose of taking up employment.  That is partly because through our educational system we were turning out too many doctors and too many Arts graduates and so on and we were not turning out enough technicians to man the jobs that are becoming available in this technological era.  We will need to change our educational system to some extent.  When we were in Government the Ministers for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Education and I met the HEA for discussion on this major matter, which involves not alone the Minister's Department but also other Departments.  As I said in the debate on the Youth Employment Agency Bill, if we were in business in education and we started to turn out more people with medical degrees, Arts degrees and so on than were needed, we <Col N="1750" /> would go out of business because nobody would want our product.  That is looking at the matter from a business point of view.  Today we need more technicians because we are in the micro-chip era.  In this supplementary Estimate the Minister requires more money for people coming over here to take up jobs and needing resettlement grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the House would be aware from the recent debate on the Youth Employment Agency Bill that it is the intention that the work experience programme will be funded through the agency from 1982 onwards and would be considerably expanded thereby.  Does that mean that the work experience programme will be funded fully from the 1 per cent?  Will the other agencies be fully funded from the 1 per cent?  In other words, will the Minister save the Exchequer the £40 million plus that comes from the Central Fund or the Exchequer?  I would like him to confirm that because it would appear that this 1 per cent is now to be used to fund several schemes that are already in operation and that the Youth Employment Agency will be the umbrella operation.  We on this side of the House will be very concerned if this mini-budget introduced with the Youth Employment Agency Bill, which we welcome, is going to save the Central Fund a certain amount of money.</P>
    <P>These are the points I wish to raise on this Supplementary Estimate.  I have one other comment concerning subhead O&mdash; Grants for Trade Union Education and Advisory Services.  I welcome that.  The Minister must be aware that in 1980 the figure we had in the Estimate for the grant for trade union education was £300,000.  We increased it in very difficult times from £300,000 to £450,000 and I am glad to see that the Minister has increased it still further, in particular knowing the reasons he had to do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I do not think that I have spoken in the House since he was appointed.  If I were in a more friendly mood I would commiserate with him because he has a very tough job to do.  Deputy Nolan referred to arbitration, <Col N="1751" /> negotiation and conciliation.  I feel that a Minister for Labour is often at the crossroads when an industrial dispute takes place.  Should he interfere?  The action that Deputy Nolan mentioned was justified.  It ended the strike that he referred to.  Any Minister must make up his mind as to the correct action, whether to interfere or otherwise.  The only suggestion I can make to the Minister is to take whichever action settles the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly I will not condemn the Minister on the industrial scene as it is today, but I suggest that these Supplementary Estimates have come too late with too little.  I do not want to be a prophet of doom, but I believe that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse could well ride next year unless the Government tackle the social problems facing them.  Many of these problems originate in the industrial sector because of strikes.  We can all condemn unofficial strikes and say that they should not occur.  Of course they should not.  People should not become sick either.  Not to understand the unofficial strike is a disservice to industry and commerce and the people involved.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to try to perfect the organisations such as the Labour Court and other conciliation bodies.  We should, as we are doing here, give the ICTU more money to enable them to perfect their organisation.  The FUE should be enabled to do likewise.  On reading about negotiations arranged in order to settle a strike, very often one is appalled at the attitude of both sides. When an unofficial strike starts the television cameras are on the spot immediately. A striker is interviewed and he says that they will not give in unless they get all their demands.  That man may not mean what he says then, but he feels that because he appears on television and says that he must stay with that view-point. When strikes start they should not be publicised as they are at present in the media.  I am not saying that the media should close their eyes to the situation but we should not have utterances from either side, employer or workers, given in the heat of the moment.  They keep on and on to try to justify not the demand <Col N="1752" /> they sought but what they said to the public at large that day.  Having said they will seek £10 or £20 a week, they feel they must stick to that.  If they do not stick to it they feel they may lose face.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister's point about technical abuses and there are people who will say he is quite right to take that line but, whatever the proper line may be, the groundwork must be done beforehand by perfecting our institutions, whether it be the Labour Court, some conciliation body or some negotiating body.  If that is done we may some day become so broad-minded that we will have arbitration willingly accepted.  After all, if both sides agree to something, that will save a great deal of suffering.  With our mounting unemployed we must really get down to things and try to solve the problem or, as it were, ease the labour pains in the industrial sector at the moment.  That is essential if the nation is to survive.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it almost looks as if we are growing fatalistic about things.  We say we can do nothing.  Look at the English scene.  Look at the motor companies there.  That is the wrong approach.  We want an Irish answer to Irish problems. We have not got the mighty industrial arm that Britain has.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to leave these important matters lying on his desk. We have mounting unemployment, some caused by worldwide recession and some by our own actions because of a certain indiscipline.  All my life I have been a member of a trade union.  I do not blame the trade unions for what happens because I have seen some dreadful management in my time, management which could manage nothing but trouble.  I have known trade unions who worked hard to bring about a better nation from the industrial and commercial point of view.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister he is up against it at the moment but, having said that, I will not excuse the Government for many of the mistakes that have been made.  First of all we had the wild promises. When we were in Government people on the Government benches now used come in here and screech about increasing unemployment.  They did not examine the reasons for it.  They simply <Col N="1753" /> blamed the Government.  It was a silly thing to do.  We, in opposition now, are not rushing in to condemn the Government for causing unemployment.  We condemn it for not dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the employment of youth.  Unless the Government wakes up and takes strong measures to reduce youth unemployment we will have some very serious trouble here. We have seen the terrible situation in the North.  Had the Northern economy been strong enough to absorb the people there who wanted to work &mdash; I am sure the vast majority did &mdash; they would not have today the terrible conditions that exist there.  The right to employment is a basic right and if that right is denied disaster must inevitably follow because those concerned feel the injustice.  All of us would wish to see injustice removed and, if our Government do not change the system and give a lead, we will end up next year in dire trouble.  When I hear the Head of the Government going on a crusade to change the Constitution and look around at all the young people with no jobs I wish he would get his priorities right and do something to bring about a better society here within our present Constitution.</P>
    <P>If I had more time I would examine the figures in more detail.  There are moneys that are not being spent.  After the budget next year I and my colleagues will devote a great deal of time to discovering why all the moneys left there by the last Government have not been expended.  We are dealing here with Supplementary Estimates and some of these are too little and too late.  We have just passed a Youth Employment Bill in the hope that it will do some good.  I am somewhat cynical about this myself.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to stand up to his reactionary Fine Gael colleagues.  If the Minister allows himself to be used by the Minister for Finance, who is a complete reactionary, the wages of his weakness will be social unrest such as was never seen here before.  The unemployment in some continental countries is as low as 5 per cent.  The Minister is probably doing his best.  The top priority is <Col N="1754" /> unemployment.  But there are other social problems.  Day after day more jobs are being lost and people are losing hope. When they voted in the last election and Fianna Fáil were defeated &mdash; I do not say the Government parties won the election, but we lost it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to stand up to his reactionary Fine Gael colleagues.  They have brought in the most hidebound, out-of-date economic policy.  Some years ago the Labour Party brought out a document entitled &ldquo;The New Republic&rdquo; and I could not believe my eyes when I read it.  I could not believe that any party claiming to be socialist could suggest using outdated socialist principles which had been cast aside by practically every country in Europe. Today unfortunately their policy is much the same.  They do not know where they are going because they have not brought forward any worthwhile document.  They brought forward the Gaiety Theatre document. During the great years of that theatre, we saw many great comedians there, but we never saw as many as earlier this year when the Coalition went to the Gaiety Theatre to unite on policy.  In coalitions, the best policies are thrown out in order to reach agreement.  Edmund Burke, in so many words, said about coalition government &ldquo;Find the lowest common denominator on which you can unite&rdquo;.  The best of the policies of Fine Gael and of Labour have been shed because they were found to be too radical for the other party.  They settled on a policy of <i>laissez faire</i>, not intending to do anything drastic but to promise much. We now see the result of that policy. Unemployment has reached a figure never reached before and which will, I hope, never be reached again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we get back into power we will <Col N="1755" /> tackle the problems, especially of the young boy or girl leaving school and looking for employment.  There is at present little hope of employment for this category and it gives me no pleasure to have to say that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in his office for only a few months and I will have more to say after the budget.  He has the goodwill to do what is necessary, but will not be allowed to.  He must assert himself over the Fine Gael party, or they will bring him down along with themselves. They always were, and still are, a conservative party and a conservative party will not solve the problems facing this country.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied about the amount of money allocated under the Vote.  A further point is: has the money allocated to job experience been expended?  If the Minister can answer that it has been, then enough was not expended on it.  We are now in the depths of great unemployment but will reach a stage when this process will be reversed.  Job experience gives some hope to the young people.  The Minister should re-examine those figures. He may be right and I may be wrong, because I have not had much chance to examine the figures.  But every nerve must be strained to find employment for our youth.  Could the trade unions and the employers initiate a scheme of trade apprenticeships?  I know very well that trade unions are rather jealous about not producing too many apprentices who would qualify while there was not employment for them. Young people trained in a trade get some wealth into their hands.  The time will come when a job will be available and they will be trained for it.  In the city at present there are many untrained young people who, even if prosperity came tomorrow, would find it hard to get employment.  Under the present Government's policy, the unemployed are becoming the unemployable.  The little training offered them is not enough.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to AnCO and the other training bodies for their excellent work. However, they are not being properly financed.  A new body should be set up, <Col N="1756" /> composed of trade unions, employers and the Government, to ensure that any young person who wants to go into a trade will have that opportunity.  Third level education is availed of generally by only one section of the population.</P>

      <P>Look at the amount we spend on third level and on primary and vocational level education.  There is a great difference there.  Unless we spend more on the training of young people in vocational trades, as against the present emphasis on the academic, many of our young will have no future.  When we come back into power we will prepare a scheme which will offer hopeful prospects to young people of good employment and ensure that they are trained in some trade.</P>
      <P>Included in the Public Service Estimate is the amount spent on bringing people-back from abroad who are highly trained. We can say with credit that we are building up a good labour force in the higher echelon of labour, people who engage in the highly technical jobs.  That is what we must aim at.  It has always been Fianna Fáil policy that third level education would be available to all who want it and who have the ability to benefit from it. Hopelessness is facing our youth at present, but I would like to be able to tell them that we will change this system and ensure that they get jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One-third of our population live in this city and the poorest of the poor are found in our great cities.  The problems of Greater Dublin are vast.  I do not intend to be parochial when I say that this city must be given more money in order to train the many thousands of young unemployed people who have little hope of getting employment.  A Government should create conditions in which employment will be generated and the economy will rise.  We must pass a vote of no confidence in the Government, on the unemployment situation alone, although they have failed in many other ways also.  Their greatest failure has been in the field of employment where they <Col N="1757" /> failed miserably to project any form of image.  People are losing faith, not alone in the Government, but in our democratic institutions.  When that happens, it is time to look out for trouble.</P>

      <P>I have been posed a great number of problems.  In one minute I could not possibly begin to make a case on some of the points put forward.  But if we agree on nothing else, we all agree that unemployment is by far the greatest single problem facing the country.  One would have to agree that it did not start on 21 July this year.  It started with the onset of the recession in 1979 and there have been sharp increases in unemployment figures up to now.  There may be apparent reductions for seasonal reasons from month to month, but when compared with a similar period in the previous year there has been a much smaller reduction than would normally take place.  Unemployment figures are rising rapidly and have been for the past two years.  It is not a problem in Ireland alone but in the whole Western world.  In the European Community alone, the fact that ten million people are unemployed is causing great concern.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann fully approves of Ireland co-sponsoring, with France, Denmark, Netherlands, Greece, Sweden, Yugoslavia and Algeria, the resolution on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in El Salvador tabled by Mexico in the United Nations General Assembly; expresses its deep concern at the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador, especially in view of the deaths of thousands of people and the climate of repression and insecurity which prevails in that country; requests the parties concerned in the conflict to extend co-operation to and avoid interfering with the activities of humanitarian organisations dedicated to the alleviation of suffering caused by the conflict and to apply a minimum standard of protection to the affected population as provided for in the Geneva Convention of 12 August, 1949; appeals to all States to abstain from intervening in the internal situation in El Salvador and to suspend all supplies of arms and any type of military support; urges the Government of El Salvador to adopt the necessary measures to ensure full respect for the human rights of the population by creating conditions which could lead to a political solution to the conflict through the participation of all representative political forces in <Col N="1760" /> that country in genuinely free and democratic elections.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Chair will allow me the two minutes that I have lost during the previous matter.</P>
    <P>Initially I should say that today is a most appropriate day to have a motion of this nature before the House because, as everybody present knows, it is International Human Rights Day.  The problems of El Salvador are uniquely concerned with human rights.  It is important that we put the problems in perspective. In doing that I intend to look briefly at El Salvador and the situation as it is at present.  El Salvador is one of the poorest countries in Latin America and certainly the poorest in Central America.  There are about four-and-a-half million people living on a portion of land that is, effectively, the size of Munster.  The main political and economic power in El Salvador, as stated by many independent sources, appears to be vested essentially in the hands of 14 extremely wealthy and powerful families who have become known as the Oligarchy in that portion of the world, and there has for many years been a need for social and economic reforms of a radical nature in that country. The present problems of that country have to be put in that perspective.</P>
    <P>A major problem is the unequal distribution of land.  Sixty per cent of rural peasants in El Salvador effectively own no land whatsoever.  Two per cent of the population own 58 per cent of the land. El Salvador has the lowest calorie intake <i>per capita</i> in all of Latin America. Seventy-five per cent of children in El Salvador under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition.  Fifty per cent of the population are illiterate.  Thirty-seven per cent of families in El Salvador live effectively in what I think can properly be described as one-room shacks. Thirty-five per cent of the population is unemployed and, according to a report by the International Labour Organisation in 1980, 20 per cent are underemployed. So it is fair to say that widespread poverty is endemic in El Salvador.</P>
    <P>The problems of El Salvador which <Col N="1761" /> have received so much publicity in the last two years relate to the repression and violence of that country and which people living in that country have experienced. Repression is not new in the history of El Salvador.  Over the decades the history of El Salvador tells of a struggle by people to seek to assert political rights and human rights and of a basic conflict between the interests of a minority who live in that country and the interests of the majority in achieving an acceptable degree of social justice.  The violence in El Salvador has, in the past two years, escalated in a manner never previously experienced.  The violence is such, and so much of it has been at the hands of the junta or the result of acts of persons who support the ruling junta, that in El Salvador there is virtually &mdash; and I do not believe it is unduly dramatic to say it &mdash; organised genocide.</P>
    <P>The situation in El Salvador has been well documented.  I must pay tribute to the work of Trócaire in this area, not only in trying to provide assistance for the people in El Salvador but in seeking to publicise a grave situation as it exists in that country.  All of us in this House are indebted to members of Trócaire and other groups who have worked in this way.  But not only Trócaire work in this area.  Amnesty International, the Roman Catholic bishops both in El Salvador and the United States, and the United Nations have all given expression to the extent of the violence there, have publicised it and referred to it.  There are conflicting figures about how many murders there have been in El Salvador, but all of these figures portray a horrific picture.  In the report produced following the visit to El Salvador by Bishop Éamonn Casey and a delegation on behalf of Trócaire it is stated that, between 1 January and 31 July 1981, 9,933 people were murdered. In that report it is also stated that 15 to 20 of those murders take place every day in the capital.  The report states that this is a horrifying increase when compared with the total of murders in the first six months of 1980.  The evidence of murders in El Salvador and the facts concerning the numbers of people who have disappeared off the streets never to be seen <Col N="1762" /> again have been meticulously collected by the Human Rights Commission and by the legal aid office of the Archdiocese of San Salvador; and, according to the reports of that body, the vast majority of these murders were carried out by the combined security forces, sometimes assisted by armed civilians.  From the documentation that is available, there is little doubt that the government of the country, either directly or indirectly, have been involved in the murderous acts that have taken place.</P>
    <P>A report produced since Bishop Casey's visit to that country referred to the existence of a Government death list which included the names of considerable numbers of people, some of whom have since died, who were to be done away with.  The majority of the names on that list were of members of the Social Democratic Party, ex-Christian Democrats, civilians who resigned from the junta in January and March last, when it was clear that the initial reforms that had been hoped for would not materialise, priests and lawyers.  Six were staff members of the legal aid office in the Archdiocese of San Salvador.</P>
    <P>We all know that no one in that country has been protected or immune from acts of violence.  There is no need to go into or to describe the circumstances of the death of Archbishop Romero or the four American nuns whose situation and experience and whose deaths have been so well publicised and documented.  In the UN General Assembly in October a report of the Economic and Social Council testified to the level of violence and death taking place in El Salvador.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion before us is to call on all parties who have been involved directly or indirectly in that country to give the people of El Salvador an opportunity to resolve their problems internally without outside interference. The level of the arms build-up in El Salvador has contributed to the creation of the present problem which has been greatly exacerbated.  It is something that we in Ireland wish to have stopped.  Much has been said about the role of the United States in El Salvador, and it is hoped that this motion, and the work done in the <Col N="1763" /> motion that was before the UN Security Council recently, will act as some pressure or will be a call from us to the United States to cease to supply arms to that region, indeed to cease to provide the level of support they have so far provided to the junta.</P>
    <P>It is worth saying that more military aid has been provided to El Salvador in the past two years by the United States than in the previous 29 years.  This is a call not only to the United States to stay out of the internal affairs of El Salvador, but also to other countries.  It is hoped that the problems of El Salvador will be resolved ultimately by the holding of proper free democratic elections, elections that are genuinely democratic and in which all representatives of political parties and forces in El Salvador will be given a real opportunity to participate.</P>
    <P>In this regard concern should be expressed about the elections that are to be held in El Salvador in March next.  In the context of present conditions there I do not believe that any kind of proper, free elections can take place.  All of us in this House would like to see such democratic elections, but they can take place only when the conditions which will enable them to take place are brought into being.  Such elections should be monitored properly on an international level. No doubt the UN have a role to play in this.  I congratulate the Minister, Senator Dooge, for the work he and the Department have done in this area.  It has been a significant contribution on the international plane towards finding a solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted for the record that the fact that there are not many Deputies here today does not signify any lack of interest in the motion, as illustrated by the numbers of people who attended briefings on the issue in the past number of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, also, should like to congratulate Senator Dooge on the manner in which he has dealt with this situation, particularly through the UN and the Mexican resolution we are supporting in the UN.  I should like to think that this motion arises <Col N="1764" /> directly from that resolution.  Ireland's contribution to human rights in the UN traditionally has been strong and independent. We should like to make it clear to our American friends and allies that this is not in some way anti-American.  I want to assure them it is not.  It is like the situation when a member of a family acts out of turn and does things we would regard as undesirable and anti-social.  We are inclined to call to see him and bring him to heel.  On this issue, I believe the Americans have a grave responsibility for what is occurring not only in El Salvador but throughout Latin America.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have been accused of opposing for the sake of opposing and I am glad that all parties have been able to reach agreement on this strong and forthright motion, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that we have an obligation in this House to include some consideration for the world outside our own local and national boundaries, and in doing so our discussion should lead to some awareness of the relationship between local, national and international affairs.  I do not think we have enough such debates.</P>
    <P>The preamble to the Constitution of UNESCO states: &ldquo;Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.&rdquo;  One obvious reason for debates of this kind is an attempt by Members to counter parochial attitudes and to try to stir the minds of our constituents outwards from important parochial issues and their understandable concern for local and national issues.  The prejudices and sometimes unsympathetic attitudes of adults to Third World development are far less prevalent among young people.  I welcome the concern being shown by university students and groups of young people throughout the country.  El Salvador is not a million miles away.  It is part of Third World development.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to have been associated with the resolution now before the House.  Indeed, I am glad that my suggestion that a motion agreeable to all parties in the House has won the warm approval of all sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> El Salvador is a small country about the size of Munster, but with a population of close on five million.  We have heard a great deal, through the press and television, about the happenings in El Salvador; pictures of such horror, stories of such frightening massacres, that we could hardly believe it.  Could it be true?  Had not President Carter withdrawn all aid from Samoza and destroyed his dictatorship, thus handing Nicaragua back to the people?</P>
    <P>Was not Duarte being forced by Mr. Carter's administration to respect human rights, to hold free, democratic elections, recognising the genuine political forces protecting the people who were entitled to participate in a negotiated settlement culminating in free and open elections not like the charade the people are being asked to go through next year where the only winner is the Junta.</P>
    <P>Within weeks of assuming power, President Reagan went along with Secretary of State Haig &mdash; shades of Nixon/Kissinger and Vietnam &mdash; and resumed arms shipments, helicopters, advisers, dollars, and even uniforms. Since then more than 35,000 El Salvadorians have died in the worst atrocious circumstances.  Many of us felt this could not be true, that it could not be happening. In a world which is so used to violence we were shocked at what we were shown on television and in the newspapers and what we were told by the most independent of journalists, including writers in Time magazine, the <i>New York Times</i> and by the American Conference of Catholic Bishops.</P>
    <P>It was important, therefore, that Trócaire sent a delegation to El Salvador including the chairman, Bishop Casey, Brian McKeown the Director, and Sally O'Neill the Head of Projects.  In four days they discovered what the situation was in El Salvador.  They came to certain conclusions which are contained in the report which has been referred to already.  The first conclusion is:</P>
    <P>In the light of what we have witnessed: because of the denial of human rights; the brutalising policy to the point of genocide which the present <Col N="1766" /> Government of El Salvador is perpetrating; we are more convinced than ever that it, in particular the security forces, is not capable of being reformed and could never bring justice, peace and stability to El Salvador. We are also convinced that any longterm solution must involve a demobilization and restructuring of the security forces.</P>
    <P>That is not happening and it will not happen as long as arms are provided to a very elite group in El Salvador.  The second conclusion reads:</P>
    <P>The increased oppression which we have experienced is proof, if needed, that U.S. militiary aid to the present Government merely prolongs and intensifies the oppression of ordinary people and takes us from a solution. We therefore reiterate our call to our Government, and to all those interested in peace and justice for El Salvador, to bring every possible pressure to bear on the United State to stop forthwith all military aid to the Junta and to seek rather a negotiated, peaceful solution.</P>
    <P>That seems to me an eminently sensible objective.  Their conclusions reached in El Salvador were confirmed for me at a colloquy in Madrid, &ldquo;Europe and Latin America: The Challenge of Human Rights&rdquo; sponsored by the Council of Europe.  There we heard all sides of the argument.  We head about Duarte's people.  We heard people from Guatemala, Chile, Bolivia, and so on.  They indicated that what was happening in El Salvador is probably, next to Guatemala, one of the worst cases of violations of human rights.  During the three days the evidence was an overwhelming indictment of the junta and the military support being poured in by the Americans.</P>
    <P>It may appear that I am being a little harsh on the Americans.  I do not intend in any way to be anti-American.  Far from it.  I recognise our need for the support of the Americans in Western Europe to provide safeguards for democracy.  It is very important that the blame should be laid squarely where it belongs.  If President <Col N="1767" /> Reagan had continued President Carter's crusade, the situation would not be as bad now as it is in El Salvador.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to our missionaries who are working out there.  I want to pay tribute in particular to the Poor Clares and the Franciscan Orders and the human rights activists who are working out there at great risk to their own lives. They are not working to support Communism, or the leftists, or any political ideology, but to help the people on the ground, to serve them and to preach the word of God.</P>
    <P>Apparently the American State Department have been unable to pursue to a conclusion the deaths of the nuns who were raped and killed on 2 December 1980.  Last Sunday <i>The Sunday Times</i> reported that no conclusion has been reached and no court case is pending. While the people responsible for these murders were identified sufficient evidence could not be obtained to bring them to trial.  That was not the case according to a reporter who suggested that there was sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>I have to rush through this because I realise my time is limited.  The Church in Latin America was for a long time a conservative political force.  During the sixties there was a marked change in the Latin American church which espoused the cause of progress and human rights. The Latin American church is paying with the lives of its priests for its devotion to those ideals.  In ten years large numbers of priests and nuns have been killed, arrested, kidnapped or sent into exile.  I should like to pay tribute to the courage of those great people who are the new martyrs of the eighties.  I want to pay tribute to their principled and courageous stand.  I want to urge the Americans, for what it is worth from me, to reconsider their actions in El Salvador.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to say a few words about El Salvador.  Despite the sparse attendance in the House, this is a very important motion.  We are a small country and people may say our influence is very small and hardly worth bothering about.  I do <Col N="1768" /> not take that view.  Our influence in these affairs is not insignificant.  It is important that our voice should be heard loudly and clearly, not only in this House but in the United Nations and the EEC and in every forum possible where human freedom can be expanded and pushed forward.</P>
      <P>We have a lot in common with El Salvador, which is a small country like our own, with a small population of 4,500,000 people.  More than 300,000 people have fled that country and are now refugees because of the regime there under Duarte.  It is only right and proper that we should be seen to take a proper and democratic stand in support of the motion of Mexico and the other countries who sponsored it at the United Nations. The importance of the earlier Franco-Mexican motion was that it broke the international conspiracy of silence on this question.  It is high time that we moved in behind the other countries who sponsored the motion on El Salvador at the United Nations.</P>
      <P>We cannot claim that we do not know what is going on in El Salvador, because it is a very long way away, and we have other things to contend with.  We have the clear and independent testimony of journalists, social workers, priests and nuns, who went to El Salvador and saw for themselves, and reported what they saw in the newspapers, on television and on the radio.  Many of them are still living in El Salvador and sending back reports to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Dáil today the reports of two journalists. One is John Snow of the British Independent Television Network who has just come back from El Salvador and shown on television a series of searching but objective programmes on life and conditions there.  Many Deputies may have seen those programmes.  I submit that no impartial viewer of John Snow's programmes could say that life in El Salvador is free and democratic, or that human liberty and human aspirations are respected.  He has especially exposed the brutality and murder campaign of the army in El Salvador in its suppression of free speech and any kind of normal political activity or democracy there.  He <Col N="1769" /> showed very clearly how a whole village and its people had been wiped out by the army without any attempt to bring those people to justice.</P>
    <P>Another journalist whose work comes to mind &mdash; and she comes from nearer my home &mdash; is Ann Daly of RTE.  She has been sending back reports which have been honest and searing in their indictment of the El Salvador army.  Nobody could call that RTE journalist a subversive or radical of any kind.  She has gone out to see for herself.  Certainly she has no axe to grind and cannot be accused of having any kind of a chip on her shoulder. She has merely told the story as it has happened, and as she has seen it, in El Salvador.  She has merely reported what she has seen at first hand.  I have heard and read her account.  I have also seen her on television.  It is a vicious and ugly story about the denial of democracy and freedom there.  It is about a reactionary attempt to stamp out or stifle people's rights to liberty and self-expression.  If the testimony of those two journalists is not sufficient we have also independent reports of countless social workers, priests and nuns who have been there and have told us what it is like.  I have heard some of them myself.  People may contend that those stories are not true; I, for one, believe them.</P>
    <P>Therefore we cannot bury our heads in the sand any more, contending that El Salvador is a long way away, or that we have other things to contend with.  We know now what is going on there and it is time we took a stand.  We have been told by the Duarte regime that elections will take place next March and that things will be all right thereafter.  We should not be fooled by this undertaking because these elections, if they ever take place, will be sham elections; they will not be fair or free.  Nobody could describe them as anything more than a cosmetic exercise or camouflage, an attempt to fool the outside world.  Even if observers from the UN could be put in for a short period that would do nothing whatsoever to change the character of those elections.</P>
    <P>Approximately five new parties have been formed in El Salvador in recent <Col N="1770" /> times.  These are bogus, spurious, right wing parties, set up to fool people into thinking there is some sort of vigorous opposition to the Duarte regime.  It is just another cosmetic exercise and camouflage to fool people into thinking that normal democracy will obtain in that country.  The only real opposition there is the liberation struggle taking place. Unless we recognise this opposition, through the liberation forces, no progress can be made by anybody.  If eventually there are to be some free and democratic elections there must first be a negotiated settlement.  After peace has been restored &mdash; if it can be &mdash; the army in El Salvador must be reformed immediately and the murderers within that army brought to justice.  That must be a first priority.  When the opposition &mdash; and I am talking about the real opposition there &mdash; are recognised, then there could be a negotiated settlement.  It would be a mistake for anybody listening to me to think that a call for a negotiated settlement constitutes and expression of weakness on the part of the liberation forces, because it is not.  They are the democratic element there.  They have said they will recognise the right to private property after peace has been restored and democracy obtains.</P>
    <P>It is as well for us to understand that democracy will rule in El Salvador.  The Americans or anybody else can step in there but they cannot stifle people's rights because the people of El Salvador will assert themselves.  Democracy, freedom and liberty will rule there as sure as I speak in this House today.  That is the first lesson to be learned by the Americans.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the American involvement in El Salvador.  I think it is a mistaken involvement.  It is negative, destructive and has nothing whatsoever to offer the people of El Salvador.  If the Americans want to involve themselves in that country they should put in money, and money only, to help eradicate poverty, injustice and lack of fair play there. That is the only positive role America could play there.  Putting in military observers is a mistaken and foolish policy, one doomed to defeat.  It must be <Col N="1771" /> remembered that that is how America became involved initially in Vietnam &mdash; sending in a small corps of observers and specialists &mdash; and we know what that led to.  It is time America dropped its burden in El Salvador and got to hell out of it, giving some positive support by contributing some money.  That is about the only useful role they can play there.  It would help also in recognition of the opposition as being the true spirit of the El Salvador people.</P>
    <P>We must shout loudly here today that we will keep pushing until democracy and liberty are restored to that country.  We must also press for freedom of speech, real freedom of election and above all, the participation of the opposition in that process.  That is the only way forward, to recognise and support the participation of the opposition in the whole democratic process in El Salvador, not merely at prospective election times but now.  That is the first and most positive step to be taken.  Unless we in this country make our stand for freedom and human dignity there it will redound to our shame throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I have had quite an amount of contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in other places.  I found him to be a liberal, fair-minded man, progressive in other departments.  I wish him well in his new assignment.  I hope he will have listened to what we have said here today.  I hope he will retain his liberal, progressive qualities and demonstrate them in this House and also at the United Nations.  I hope he will use his voice there and within the EEC to articulate the viewpoint put forward in this House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should say that the original motion, which was signed by myself and endorsed by all of the Members of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported the Mexican-French Declaration in its original terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with other speakers in drawing attention to the seriousness of the present situation in El Salvador.  May I say something very blunt about this matter.  In 1981 we would think it disgraceful if we <Col N="1772" /> read in the reported debates of an Assembly that somebody had ignored the conditions of the Irish Famine in the last century, that somebody had ignored the brutal murder of Irish civilians.  Yet, at the same time I find it difficult to understand why so few people are interested in the fact that conditions in El Salvador, which are so atrocious &mdash; I think the number of people who have been murdered and who have gone missing must be understood and expressed as a percentage of the total population &mdash; should excite so little concern among public representatives on this occasion in this House.</P>
    <P>It is an important principle in my relationship to this Assembly to acknowledge concern where it exists.  I want to place on record my appreciation of the inter-party spirit in which Deputy Niall Andrews has articulated his concern on this issue.  It is an issue that concerns humanity: 45,000 people are dead, many more people are missing without trace. When we cut through the rhetoric and language we know that when evening falls in the country about which we speak an uncertainty is generated among its population, an uncertainty that is unusual in so far as it brings death, absence and not only death and absence but the later witness of mutilation.  It is important that an assembly like this, which is privileged in the Western world to enjoy the freedom to discuss conditions of debate and difference, should not be silent on this issue, that we should speak unequivocally and strongly on it.</P>
    <P>I want to locate this rather descriptive statement of mine to a more analytic principle, one of foreign policy.  In relation to foreign policy the position of Ireland always must be that rights issues take precedence over every other issue. Our historic experience indicates that this is the appropriate position for us to take. We have a residual historic experience of colonialism.  We are today people who are dependent in a number of ways on foreign investment.  I know it has been an explanatory factor in the silence of a number of people on the present issue that people think that because we need American investment in our economy we <Col N="1773" /> must be silent on this issue.  It would be disgraceful if we were silent on this issue. The fact is that a small community is caught in the middle of a confrontation of super-powers, that people are dying every day and are missing every day.  It is very important that our voice be heard and be stated unequivocally.</P>
    <P>In the brief time available to me I want to ask a question that is frequently raised in the media, namely, are statements on El Salvador left-wing statements?  Let us be clear about the motion before this Assembly this evening.  This is the unanimous statement, I hope, of all the elected representatives of this country on an important issue.  It is not a sectional statement but is the unanimous statement of an elected parliamentary assembly that lays down fundamental principles, expresses the hope that there will be a return to democracy, that such a return to democracy will involve the participation of all parliamentary forces, that expresses its repugnance to interference and its rejection of the right of any super-power to give assistance that will result in military aid.  That is what is involved.  It is not just some casual statement late in the week by the Irish Parliament. It is the strong, unanimous statement by the Irish Parliament which stands behind our Minister and I congratulate him on taking the position he has taken.  This motion urges him to say that on this issue the Irish people, speaking through all their elected representatives, want to put the issues of life, of non-interference, of the right of a country not to be interfered with militarily, before every other right.</P>
    <P>My support for this motion is not offered apologetically.  The position of the Labour Party relates to the position taken by the Socialist International and by the Confederation of Socialist Parties in the European Parliament.  Those assemblies condemned the American interference in El Salvador.  I will not put a tooth in it.  I believe that outside interference in the affairs of El Salvador &mdash; American aid in this case &mdash; is supporting murder, repression and the suppression of democracy.  It must be ended.  It is important to recognise the historic significance <Col N="1774" /> of what is taking place this evening. We are putting Ireland's position on record.  It is unusual to have a principle of foreign policy debated in the parliamentary assembly in such detail as we are witnessing in the case of El Salvador.  We are instructing our Foreign Minister to say that, irrespective of every other consequence, the rights issue be given predominance in considering the question of El Salvador.</P>
    <P>I began by saying we would find it insulting on reading even now an historic reconstruction of our own experience of famine or oppression if people had been silent.  Is it not curious we have such little interest in this matter this afternoon?  I would have wished there was a better attendance in the House.  I welcomed the fact that Deputy Niall Andrews had indicated all-party agreement on this subject. However, there is another point that is important, namely, that having had the courage to take an unequivocal position on a principle of foreign policy we would not be so apologetic as to erode it entirely.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position in relation to the El Salvador problem must be related to our attitude to development within Latin American Politics in general.  As an elected representative who lives in conditions of freedom, I cannot apologise for the fact that people in El Salvador who are fighting for freedom, are left-wing, that they are people who describe themselves as guerrillas.  The truth is that all over Latin America the matter of power in society is being questioned by many combinations of popular forces.  They choose not to call themselves neutral forces.  In many cases they are left-wing forces.  Let us be perfectly clear that Duarte himself has at times been in co-operation with such forces.  They have a legitimacy within Latin American politics in general.  Latin American politics has every right to give its own stamp to its historical experience and to reject American interference.</P>
    <P>I have been going through all the many press reports circulated by the American Embassy on this question.  They suggest that the people of El Salvador can be held as a pawn in international politics. <Col N="1775" /> This is to subject a people and a population to expedient foreign policy that is imperialist in its tendency and in its effect and I reject it.  The attitude of the Social International and of the Confederation of Socialist Parties in the European Parliament has been to reject this in its principle and in its entirety.</P>
    <P>In supporting the joint statement that this motion represents, I want to state clearly the position of the Labour Party. We support the liberating forces in El Salvador.  We support the right of the Opposition to be involved in parliamentary elections and we support the restoration of democracy.  However, I must ask myself a question.  Would it not be very easy in an elected assembly and in conditions of freedom to simply say we are in favour of the restoration of human rights and democracy in El Salvador. How distant that is from the reality.  The fact is that we must completely and unequivocally oppose the forces that are interfering in El Salvador.  I recall when I spoke about this matter on the first occasion that people said others like myself were silent on other issues of interference, for example, by the Soviet Union in different parts of the world.  My party have condemned these.  We condemn them again, but here there is no room for fudging the issue.  Our position as a nation must be clear.  We realise that the position in El Salvador which results in loss of life and in uncertainty for people living there is simply untenable.</P>
    <P>I look to the total volume of correspondence from the American Embassy. Does this mean that elections are promised? Elections have been the usual dressing of dictators in such circumstances. I urge the Minister that there be no compliance by Ireland with any monitoring of elections that are not really participative. The appropriate position of Ireland on this question on elections must be considered in relation to the conditions that precede the elections.  For example, do conditions in El Salvador allow for the regular participation of all the opposition forces or are they simply a dressing?  On that question we may have an opinion.  With the elections having <Col N="1776" /> been organised, our going along to attend and offer some opinion would be complicity in a fraud, in this case not about a normal election but an election succeeding murder, the disappearance of people and the suppression of democracy.  We have a role to play in this.  We should visit El Salvador and should offer our opinion there on the conditions that precede the elections, but our presence should not be to dress up some undemocratic pretence.</P>
    <P>Let me say, in conclusion, something about the position of the Labour Party. Our support for this motion is based on the fact that the principles of our original motion derived from the Socialist International and the Confederation of Socialist Bodies are broadly met by this resolution. As well as this we do not want people to confront us with the suggestion that we have been silent on the suppression of democracy in cases of interference by super-powers.  This is an immediate issue before us and on this the position of the Labour Party is that they support this motion and are delighted to congratulate the Minister on taking a position for Ireland which puts issues of rights and principles before issues of economic expediency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. Deputy Higgins pointed to the remarkable unanimity in the number of individual Deputies who sponsored the motion who are quite clearly across the party divide. If anything was to emphasise the importance in which they hold this issue of El Salvador, it surely must be that very feature of this motion: that it is so unanimously supported by all parties when we find it so difficult to get any kind of agreement on any other issue in this House.  It is a tribute to people that they can submerge differences and be at one in condemning the present regime in El Salvador.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details of the position in El Selvador have been made clear already and I do not intend to go through them beyond the query to the House, to what extent is this to be of any real effect? Deputy Higgins talked about rhetoric and language.  As one of a generation <Col N="1777" /> who watched this kind of thing going on for many years, through the time of the League of Nations before the Second World War and afterwards, I would like to find out from the Minister if he feels, in taking our protest station here so far away from the problem, we are likely to have any real effect on it.  It is quite obvious that there are two components to the repression in El Salvador.  One is the attempt by the 14 families to hold on to their privilege and possessions against the wishes of the ordinary people in El Salvador.  That is a phenomenen common enough in the world's history and the history of Europe, Africa, of East and West.  The second component is this question of the US influence.  The US find themselves involved in the cold war, in the struggle against what they consider to be the hostile forces of the Soviet Union and the Eastern socialist countries. An attempt is made by them then to defend their position.  In Latin America one's difficulty is that if you take one side against the other you are either pro-American or pro-Soviet.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as a person horrified by what we hear from El Salvador.  Deputy Kemmy has referred to the influence of the journalists.  Like us politicians, journalists come in for much criticism, most of it adverse.  In this case it is quite remarkable &mdash; rather like this House on this motion &mdash; how unanimous has been the reporting back from El Salvador of the independent journalists.  Included in this must be the journalists from the US, and that is a tribute to the US.  The fact that one reads about the horror, torture and inhuman treatment of man by man in El Salvador, much of it critical of the United States, underlines this.  We have the magnificent reporting by John Snow on ITV and the very moving, marvellously courageous, clear and compelling evidence of Ann Daly on RTE.  Her dispatches from the front line are a remarkable tribute to her talents as a journalist and her great personal courage.  They convey her sense of indignation at what she saw and her insistence that she go there and report back to us.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in this case, as in the case of Vietnam, the contribution <Col N="1778" /> of the journalists is wonderful.  Many US journalists, some British and French, in the television services mainly, showed us the horror of Vietnam and must have made a great contribution to the creation of the public opinion which eventually brought the Americans to withdraw from that country.  A feature of our times is the immediacy of the capacity of the journalists to put the case before us all and in that way help us to become involved, as we are in this tiny little country so far away.</P>
    <P>It appears that the intensity of the horror of El Salvador is comparable with the horror of Vietnam.  It is a tiny place about the size of Munster, with about four million people.  About 45,000 people have been murdered there in the last three years.  To that extent we know about the problem.  Unlike my generation, which watched in Auschwitz and Buchenwald the extermination of the Jews, this generation cannot offer any defence whatsoever for remaining uninvolved. Indeed, apropos, and again in defence of the United States, may I draw attention to the remarkable contribution they made in the Second World War compared with their inexplicable aims on this occasion.  Everyone was aware during the Second World War of the remarkable contribution made by the United States in the air, on sea and on the land, and the enormous sacrifices by the finest of their young people, not counting the cost. So their action now simply cannot be dismissed.  All we can do is wonder how they can behave in this inexplicable way in this tiny little country in view of their past record in the defence of freedom at a time when that defence cost them so much.  There does not seem to be any doubt whatsoever that they are deeply involved, that they are providing the arms, the information and the support for the wealthy vested interests.  The leadership of the United States will do that anyway because they are defending what they believe to be their own interests in Latin America.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility of elections. From what we gather nobody seriously believes that elections have any value or any merit whatsoever in establishing a <Col N="1779" /> democratic society.  As we see things, no election to determine a democratic society could take place in the circumstances presented to us by the Junta.  It is interesting to note that truth, which is usually the first casualty in a war, has not been a casualty on the media in this war.  Despite the powerful disclaimers put out by the American Embassy, and no doubt the very considerable pressure imposed on virtually everyone in the United Nations to accept the American point of view on this issue, very few of us have any doubt whatsoever but that the United States is deeply involved.  I would like to pay tribute here to Senator Dooge for his courageous stand because I am quite certain, if precedent is anything to go by, he must have been subjected to the kind of pressures to which so many other countries succumbed.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to this motion in any anti-American spirit whatsoever.  I subscribe as someone who has a great admiration for them in their contribution to anti-fascism but, as they are developing at the present time, El Salvador is becoming the United States death camp in Latin America.  It is becoming the Auschwitz and Buchenwald of Latin America run by the United States.  For these reasons we must do whatever we can to try to shame them away from that particular policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is unusual in this House for one brother to pay tribute to another brother but the credit for this debate rests squarely with Deputy Niall Andrews and Deputy Michael Higgins who has been consistent in his support of what I describe as the Andrews committee on El Salvador.  A great deal of work has been done through this committee, through the attendance of cross-party support over in the Setanta building.  The preparatory meetings have been very worthwhile in relation to this debate in producing a unified approach to El Salvador.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> We have been speaking for the last hour on this particular subject and, while the contributions were excellent one thing which concerned me in these meetings to which I referred, was the courageous people we met.  One thing uppermost in the minds of the people who addressed us at these meetings was a solution to the problem.  The talking has to stop and the killing has to stop and the time has come to find solutions.  We must find solutions to this very serious problem confronting El Salvador.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean ourselves and other countries who have shown concern for the pitiless manner in which the people have been treated by their present masters, the Junta.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider solutions to the problem, immediate solutions.  Urgent solutions are required. The Minister in his short time as Minister has shown himself to be liberal and approachable and his action on the recent resolution in the United Nations reflects his generous sincerity in respect of this particular problem.  The Minister has in his Department excellent officials.  An immediate solution may be to get his officials to meet with the various agencies which have concerned themselves in this country with El Salvador.  Here I think of Trócaire, Amnesty, and the religious and lay organisations.  Perhaps he would get his officials to sit down with these and take a new look at the situation in the light of the debate here this evening.</P>
    <P>In paying tribute to the role played by Ireland at the United Nations it is fair to say that the main thrust for Ireland's attitude there came from the genuine and courageous part played by Trócaire, Amnesty and the other religious and lay people who have interested themselves in El Salvador.  Bishop Casey must rate very high in the league of courage, as do the Franciscan nuns and priests who have gone out there and the Poor Clare nuns, together with the excellent reports coming back from El Salvador through the courageous lady, Ann Daly, who has been mentioned already in this debate.</P>
    <P>We have an important role to play on El Salvador in the United Nations.  As Deputy Michael Higgins said in his well <Col N="1781" /> thought out contribution, we are not a big country in USSR and USA terms but in the context of colonial domination we have a strong role to play in international affairs.  In that context we are above suspicion. I believe we are listened to particularly by those Afro-Asian countries with a colonial-dominated past like our own.  We were a British colony for many hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that 35,000 have died in El Salvador over the past number of years.  One must be clear that this is not an anti-American debate.  One is not anti the American people but is concerned about that Government's role&mdash;and particularly President Reagan's role &mdash; in this whole squalid, sorry and obscene affair.  The thrust of American foreign policy, particularly related to that area, is in containing the balance of peace.  As long as peace is contained within the countries of Latin America, stability is maintained in the area and difficulties do not flow outside the borders of those countries.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, many thousands of people are being murdered by the regimes which are containing and maintaining this balance of peace in these areas.  This is where President Reagan must have a lot to answer for.  There is irrefutable evidence that arms have been reaching the Junta through the American Government.  It is also fair to say that there is irrefutable evidence that arms have been reaching the anti-fascist or anti-Junta forces, from whatever source. We in this House are not anti-American, but pro-human rights.  We are pro the right of people to live in peace and harmony in their own country.  If people are being dealt with on a genocide basis, surely it is the concern of the rest of the world, and of Ireland in particular, to play its part.  We have had our share of troubles.  President Reagan's attitude is very difficult to explain.  While President Carter was a weak enough man in many ways, he had a plank in his platform in relation to human rights.  It did not appear to do him much good, however, when it came to seeking re-election.</P>
    <P>The anticipated March 1982 elections in El Salvador have been mentioned and <Col N="1782" /> one can only have the deepest and gravest suspicions.  It is proper, if the elections are to be held and if the charade is to be continued in the name of democracy, that the United Nations might as well monitor them.  Whether the United Nations will be given the necessary facilities to ensure that the elections are carried out in atruly democratic fashion is open to question. At the end of the day, the obscenity of the Junta will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings have been held outside this House, which have been attended by members of all parties in large numbers.  The fact that there are few people in the House this afternoon is not a reflection of a lack of interest.  The interest in this situation is ongoing.  It has been suggested that a small group of three or four Deputies from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour should go to El Salvador during Christmas.  The House has an obligation, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to give that delegation every possible support and, more particularly, to ensure their safety.  One need only look at what happened to certain delegations in the recent past.  I pay tribute to the intended delegation from this House.  They are courageous people who are doing a service, not only to the House and to Ireland but to the people of El Salvador.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to this debate, I urge him to address himself to finding immediate solutions.  From the time that this resolution was set down in the Dáil office up to this very moment, many people have been murdered.  The time has come to stop talking and to find solutions to this urgent problem.  It would not take very much grey matter to indicate to the Americans that they have a very important role to play in bringing about a solution for the El Salvadorean people.  Certainly, the United Nations has a role to play but, in the final analysis, the blame and responsibility for the ongoing tragedy in that country must lie with the American administration.  Whatever influence the Minister can bring to bear on the United Nations or on the United States Government to find a solution to the problem should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the part of the motion which refers to the expression of deep concern at the violation of human rights in El Salvador.  I agree also with the part which calls, I presume, on the El Salvadorean parties concerned to stop interfering with the activities of the many excellent humanitarian organisations working there, or trying to work there, and with the part of the motion which calls on the Government of El Salvador to ensure full respect for human life of the population and to try to ensure that free and democratic elections are brought about.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about that part of the motion which calls on countries to abstain from intervening in the internal situation of El Salvador and to suspend all supplies of arms and military support.  It may not be appropriate for us to look far afield at a part of the world where the economic interests are held by a number of countries.  A reference has been made to El Salvador being about the size of Munster.  Let us put it in that context.  If we were in a part of the world near a Munster which was involved in a civil war, inflicting much death and ill-treatment on the population, the rest of this area being a foreign country, with deep economic and security interests at stake, would we not think we might perhaps have a right to involve ourselves in some respects in what was going on in Munster in that situation?  When we talk of the interference of countries, our own history has seen situations where people whom we now look upon as our representatives at certain critical periods of our history welcomed the French and the Spanish to these shores.  If the French and the Spaniards had succeeded in intervening in this country at those critical times, would we not have looked upon them as our saviours?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As Deputy Shatter said in moving this motion, it is most appropriate that it should be discussed by the Dáil on this day which has been designated Human Rights Day by the UN.  In a world which has regrettably become accustomed to the most blatant violations of human rights, the suffering and deprivation of the people of El Salvador has drawn a unique response from the Irish people.  The widespread media coverage which this conflict is receiving has meant that the almost unimaginable horrors of daily life in that far-off country have intruded into our own living rooms.  The campaign of Bishop Éamon Casey of Trócaire, based on his personal observations, and the fact that we have a number of courageous and dedicated missionaries in El Salvador have both helped to focus the attention of Irish people even more sharply on events in that country. I am glad of this opportunity, on behalf <Col N="1785" /> of the Government, to pay tribute to Trócaire and to the Irish missionaries in El Salvador, the Franciscan priests and nuns and the Poor Clare Sisters, for the work they have done under very difficult, and at times, dangerous circumstances in channelling assistance to where it is most needed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noel Browne has asked what we can do.  A poor country like us must answer frankly &ldquo;not much&rdquo;.  But we have done what it was within our power to do. Deputy Kemmy seemed to indicate that what had been done on behalf of this country had only been done recently in response to the Franco-Mexican Declaration. I do not know if he meant to convey that, but if he did it is a mistaken view.  I would like to state quite clearly that the previous Government have acted in the same way as this Government are now acting in regard to El Salvador.</P>
      <P>This Government, like its predecessor, has done and will continue to do everything within its power to help promote a full settlement of the tragic conflict in El Salvador and to emphasise the need for all parties to the conflict to show respect for human rights.  For some time now we have been making our voice heard in various international fora on the question of El Salvador.  At the May 1980 session of the UN Economic and Social Committee in New York our delegation made a substantive reference to the situation in El Salvador in its statement on human rights.  Ireland supported a resolution calling for human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador at the UN General Assembly in December 1980 and we co-sponsored a similar resolution at the March 1981 session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  As a result of that resolution a special representative of the UN was appointed to examine the situation in regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador.  That special representative reported in October 1981, having visited El Salvador and having discussed the matter with representatives of the Junta and with representatives of the FDR.  I have arranged for a copy of that report to be placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies and Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> Additionally, within the EEC we have raised the El Salvador problem at various levels of European political co-operation, including ministerial level, and we pressed strongly and successfully for a Community aid programme to assist the many refugees in El Salvador who are the innocent victims of the conflict.</P>
    <P>In the past few months the Government have allocated £100,000 to the relief operation in El Salvador, £50,000 of which will be channelled through Trócaire and the rest of which is to be allocated to the International Commission of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  This contribution reflects, in a practical way, the concern of this country for the suffering of the people of El Salvador.</P>
    <P>In my address to the UN General Assembly on 30 September last, I expressed the concern of the Irish people at the widespread violations of human rights in El Salvador and stressed the desirability of a negotiated settlement of the problem.  These remarks, and our acceptance of the principles underlying the Joint Franco-Mexican Declaration, were regarded in the UN and elsewhere as a constructive and important contribution to finding a solution to the El Salvador conflict.</P>
    <P>The motion before us asks Dáil Éireann to approve fully of Ireland's cosponsoring of the resolution on El Salvador tabled by Mexico at the present UN General Assembly.  This resolution is in many ways the culmination of a number of efforts that have been made in international fora to work towards a solution to the conflict in El Salvador and its provisions correspond to the specific matters mentioned in the present motion.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that the resolution was adopted by the Economic and Social Committee of the General Assembly on 3 December by 65 votes in favour, 21 against with 54 abstentions. The resolution will now go before the Plenary Session of the General Assembly where a vote is expected before the end of this month.  In addition to the other EEC countries which cosponsored the resolution with us &mdash; Denmark, France, Greece, Netherland &mdash; the <Col N="1787" /> motion was also supported by Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom abstained.</P>
    <P>Deputy David Andrews asked if we could do more than express our horror. He suggested that we might take a new look at the situation.  This is what we are always attempting to do.  He suggested that we get in contact with the various bodies in this country who are interested in the problem and knowledgeable about it.  I would like to assure him that we are in constant contact with such bodies as Trócaire and the Ireland/El Salvador Committee.  Both myself and officials of the Department met the representatives of the FDR on their visits to this country and we will continue to maintain such contact.  But what can we do?  Is there an instant solution to this problem?  We are a small country.  We can do little more than what has been attempted in this House today, to express our concern, to indicate our dismay at seeing a small country, struggling with appalling economic and social problems, being sucked in to an East-West confrontation.  This is what we must continue to do in the international fora where, though our voice is not a loud one, we are listened to.</P>
    <P>I will end by thanking the House for the manner in which they have dealt with this motion.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the 20 minutes which I have be divided equally between my constituency colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan, and me.  I am disappointed to note that the Minister for Education has not seen fit to be here to answer the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for bringing forward this question is to try to elicit information on behalf of parents in the Knocklyon district of Firhouse and Rathfarnham.  The Minister is a very busy man and a debate on a Thursday at 6 o'clock may not be suitable for him, and I would understand that he might not be able to be here and that Deputy Keating might take his place.</P>
      <P>The decision to postpone the opening of the school at Knocklyon until 1986 was yet another arbitrary decision such as Circular 24/81 which we have had so much discussion about.  It was taken without consultation with the interested groups, parents, teachers and the other groups concerned in the development of the community in Knocklyon.  The reason given in letters to parents, after the decision had been made, not before, and only after the information had been elicited at a meeting of the Knocklyon Post-Primary Committee, is that the Department of Education were having some difficulty in purchasing the site.</P>
      <P>I and everybody in the area know that there are always difficulties purchasing a site for a school of any kind, but I cannot see why suddenly the Minister decided that he or his officials were having difficulty purchasing this site.  That gave him an excuse to get off the hook because he did not want to open the school until 1986.  I should like the Minister to let the House know in detail about the alleged difficulty in purchasing the site.  I should like him to answer the allegation made that the Department offered the owner a price based on the agricultural value of the land although Dublin County Council had identified the site on the Scholarstown Road and had it zoned for educational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the allegation is true, I want the Minister to clarify for the parents involved, if the owner has indicated his asking price and if so what is it.  How does the price being asked compare with prices <Col N="1789" /> for second level school sites elsewhere? Is the Minister responding yet again to demands being made for cutbacks in his budget by the Minister for cuts and Finance Deputy Bruton?</P>
    <P>In 1977 when Fianna Fáil returned to government, all the problems relating to the Ballally community school which the previous Government had used to delay its approval were overcome in a short time and the development and the building of the school went ahead and it was opened on time.  That school is now a magnificant example of the type of educational institution community schools have become, in this case in Ballally, under the superb principalship of Mr. Pat Byrne and his staff.  It is a school not just serving the children but the whole community. It serves a wide range of community activities until 10 o'clock every night: that school is open from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson, gave an undertaking that the Knocklyon school would be opened in 1983 and when giving his approval he indicated that he did not see any difficulty between the officials and the site owner, that it was only a matter of discussion between them to reach agreement on the price.  Suddenly, overnight, apparently unknown to his Cabinet colleague, Deputy Kelly, the Minister for Education made a decision that the school would not be opened until 1986.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister for the Fine Gael general election manifesto an extraction from which reads:</P>
    <P>While school size would not normally exceed 800 pupils, Fine Gael believes that social needs must be considered and other economic considerations before any decision is taken about school establishment or school closure.  The criteria of viability should be flexible enough to take into account more than cost factors alone.</P>
    <P>Note the word &ldquo;viable&rdquo;.  What about the social needs on which I will dwell for a few moments?  That sentiment in the Fine Gael manifesto is very worthy, but alas the social needs of the Knocklyon community are not to be taken into consideration <Col N="1790" /> on this question.  The fact is that public transport is practically non-existent in the area.  The Killaninny community school and the school at Orwell are too far away for young children to walk to and there is lack of transport, inadequate road structure, no paths, no lighting. In addition, all the private schools in the area are either financially out of the question, even if the parents financially could afford to send their children to those schools, or they do not want to by choice or they prefer the concept of a continuing community in a school.</P>
    <P>Knocklyon has a very viable community. The people have proved their capacity to organise and to develop their own schools and to build their own church. The figures are there to show that the school is needed.  The people of the area are anxious to have a continuity of community within the district, and sending their children to schools in other districts will not help to consolidate the community spirit that is evident among the people in Knocklyon and Firhouse.  It is a very strong, forceful community anxious to maintain the development of the community.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Knocklyon Committee on 28 October 1981, Deputy Kelly caused considerable shock when he announced he was the bearer of bad news.  Unfortunately he did not have the full details of the bad news, and a public meeting was called, which he did not attend.  I do not want the issue to develop into a squabble between the Minister and me.  I merely ask him to reply to the questions I have put to him.  I want to appeal to him on my own behalf and on behalf of all my colleagues from all parties to reconsider his decision.  All my constituency colleagues from all parties agree that the school should be opened in 1983.  They agree there is a case for a school there.  They say it is not a political issue.  The community need the school and the community should have it.  After all, Deputy Fennell is concerned about the community.  I know she has been in touch with the Minister about it.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to reconsider his decision and to go ahead with the purchase of this site and open the school as <Col N="1791" /> scheduled in 1983.  If it is not opened, politicians on all sides of the House will have failed in our obligation to the people of this district who unquestionably have proven their viability as a community, despite the haphazard development of telecommunications, road and transport infrastructures over the years.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accede to my request on behalf of the Knocklyon Post Primary committee and the parents of young children awaiting places in a school of their own, in their own district, within their own community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister owes me 30 seconds.  I want to get to the heart of this matter.  As Deputy Andrews said, it is causing shock and fear in the Knocklyon area of South Dublin.  Before we leave the House at 6.30 this evening, I want the Minister to tell us when will the post-primary school be opened for classes in the Knocklyon area.  If the Minister is fidgeting about with it, if he is cutting back on it, if he is having difficulties in the Cabinet about money, we should be told the truth.  We want to be able to tell the people who are depending on a promise given, which I will quote in a moment, by the Department of Education.  When will the Minister for Education open the new school in Knocklyon for classes? That is the central issue in this discussion. If the Minister cannot answer that question, this debate will have been in vain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a rumour that the hold-up in this school is caused by site difficulties.  I <Col N="1792" /> have a letter from the Minister for Education which mentioned something about difficulties with site acquisition.  What is the nature of the problem about purchasing this site?  Is it a legal problem?  Is it that the title is not correct?  Are there legal difficulties about the transfer of the site?  Is that the problem?  If it is, I want to be told about it.  Is there a difficulty in reaching price agreement with the vendor? Is it a squabble over price?  If so, we should be told.  We are entitled to know about it.  Could it be that the vendor is backing off and is not offering to do business? If the site is the problem, will the Minister please tell us the nature of the problem.  Is it legal?  Is it money?  What is it?  We want to be able to tell the people of our constituency what the problem is.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the Minister confirms that the difficulty is a site problem, will the Minister tell us what legal options are open to the Department to overcome the difficulties?  What are the Minister's options if he wishes to acquire the site urgently?  Is he examining those options? How is he examining them?  When will that examination be concluded?  I should dearly love a direct reply to these questions. I should like answers and not a series of platitudes.  Will the Minister of State confirm on behalf of the Minister that there is no backing off this project, that there is no cutting back on this school?  I want to quote from column 281, volume 323, of the Official Report of 21 October 1980 where the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to build two new schools to cater for the Knocklyon, Ballyboden and Marley areas.  The first of these two schools is intended to be built on a site on the Scholarstown road.  This school will accommodate 800 pupils and it is scheduled to open in September 1983.</P>
    <P>That was before the Minister, Deputy Wilson, left office.  I want to know if the Government are moving away from the decision taken by the previous Government to supply the Knocklyon area with a school.  Are they backing off that project? If they are, the Minister should tell us.  We and Deputies on the Government side of the House have to face another <Col N="1793" /> public meeting in a short time with many hundreds of parents who want to know the specific answers to these questions.  It will not do for us to bring them a list of platitudes.  They want direct answers.  If we do not get them here today, we will use every means at our disposal to pursue the Minister until we get them.  I do not have to go into all the reasons.  There is a huge population in the area.  It is bursting at the seams.  The growth in that part of the suburbs is absolutely enormous. Thousands of new families are moving into the suburbs every year.</P>
    <P>Constitutionally the Government have a responsibility to provide education.  A massive demand is there.  The Department have pointed out time and time again that they agree the demand is there. Yet there is no clear move to provide the necessary facilities.  As my colleague, Deputy Andrews, said, all of a sudden this bombshell arrived.  First the new Government arrived, and then there was this bombshell in their wake that the school will not be ready in 1983.  There were no details about why it will not be ready and why there is this change in policy.  Is this part of the Government's financial cutbacks?  If it is, we want to know the truth so that we can tell the people.  If Deputy Andrews and I and Deputy Shatter and everyone else who is involved in this, leave the House with a list of platitudes and no clear answers to these questions, I assure the Minister that we are in for a hot time in this House, and we are also in for a hot time in our constituency.  If the Minister is backing off the project he should tell us the truth.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister of State, my colleague and I must register a protest that the Minister for Education is not available to answer questions on this most serious matter. That is no reflection on the Minister of State.  On a matter of this nature we must protest because the Minister has not come into the House to speak to us.  At a public meeting recently, Deputy Andrews and I suggested that we should have an all-party approach to the views I am expressing.  I understand Deputy Shatter, Deputy Fennell, Deputy Kelly, Deputy McMahon and all of us involved <Col N="1794" /> in the area, and all the people in the area, agree that this school should be opened as promised by the Department of Education in 1983.  I take it that this is an all-party request to the Minister to carry on the policy as agreed in this House on 21 October 1980.  In the absence of any interruption from the other side, I take it that what I am saying is agreed by all the Deputies who represent the area.  I would ask the Minister to give me specific answers to those questions and I thank Deputy Andrews for giving me some of his time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as anxious as anybody else to see a post-primary school built at Knocklyon. I have been committed to this for a number of years.  My commitment dates back to the time when Deputy N. Andrews served on the same committee.  I am aware of the difficulties that have been encountered in procuring a site there, as indeed should Deputy N. Andrews, seeing that he served on the same committee.  I am glad that Deputy Andrews has adopted a tamer attitude here today than that he took at the recent public meeting in Knocklyon.  I regret I was not present for his contribution.  Many people have been in touch with me since.  I regret very much <Col N="1795" /> that Deputy Andrews saw fit to make that an occasion for a vicious attack on the Minister for Education and an official of his Department.  I hope he will redress that position at the next public meeting. It was totally uncalled for, because both men are well known for their activities with regard to the provision of educational facilities in County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Department of Education are doing all in their power to procure a site, but I will leave that for the Minister to say.  I have no doubt that a site can be procured.  A site has been identified in consultation with the town planners of Dublin County Council.  As I said at the recent public meeting, I am satisfied that the members of Dublin County Council will ensure that this site remains zoned as one to provide educational facilities.  Whatever ideas the owners of the site may have of having a higher value on it, we in the county council are determined to ensure that it passes from agricultural zoning to educational purposes.  I think I can say without any fear of anything else happening that that will be so.</P>
      <P>It is important that this area should have a post-primary school.  It is a community in itself.  There are many householders in the area who bought their house on the understanding that a community school would be provided there. Many people have spoken to me over the last few years, people who would not have moved had they thought a post-primary school would not be provided in the area.</P>

For some weeks past now there has been a consistent attempt at misrepresentation on the part of Opposition Deputies in relation to the acquisition of a site and the planning and provision of a post-primary for the Knocklyon area.  The facts of the matter explicitly contradict the contention that has been made locally and mischieviously in the Knocklyon area that the Government have in some way abandoned the second level school building programme.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  By the end of this year I am confident that a sum of over £38 million will have been spent on the building of second level schools generally.</P>

The position&mdash;contrary to any of the stated contentions recently made&mdash;is that a possible opening date of 1983 had been mentioned in relation to this school.  But it is clear from the relevant official correspondence that that date was based on a hope that a suitable site could be obtained in time.  As it turned out negotiations for the purchase of the site have proved to be exceedingly slow and have not yet concluded.  How exceedingly slow is exactly this: these negotiations have <Col N="1797" /> been going on literally for years, literally years, prior to 30 June last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the rate of £13.55 a week, being the maximum rate of £27.40 less notionally assessed means of £11.15.  This is the appropriate amount of unemployment assistance payable to a married smallholder in a specified area the PLV of whose land is between £10 and £15 and whose means are notionally assessed at £11.15.

      <P>In reply to a previous question <Col N="1715" /> regarding the person concerned given by me on 25 November 1981, I stated that payment of disability benefit had been made to 21 November 1981.  Since that date only one medical certificate, dated 27 November, has been received and as the RSI number quoted was not clearly written it was credited to another claimant. It has however been confirmed that the claimant is still incapable of work and payment of benefit has accordingly been made to him to the 12 December 1981. The claimant has been advised to write the RSI number, which was recently assigned to him, clearly on all medical certificates submitted to my Department.</P>

      <P>An extended children's allowance was paid to the person concerned in respect of her school-going daughter up to June 1981.  Due to an oversight the allowance for that child did not issue when the 1981-1982 books were being renewed.

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 1965 to 16 November 1981.  At that stage her claim was being considered for transfer to invalidity pension.  Due to an oversight, however, payment was suspended <Col N="1736" /> temporarily.  Payment has since been resumed and all benefit due to 9 December has been issued.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 8 May to 25 May 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  Due to an oversight, however, payment did not issue at the time.  All disability benefit due on the claim has now been paid.</P>
      <P>He claimed occupational injury benefit for the period 9 July 1981 to 15 July, after which date he resumed work.  Pending the outcome of inquiries regarding the nature and origin of his injury he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis. On completion of these inquiries it was accepted that his incapacity for work arose out of his employment and his claim for injury benefit was allowed.  The adjusting cheque for £4.65 which was issued on 19 October represented the difference between the amount of injury benefit payable and the amount of disability benefit which had been paid provisionally on the claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to June 1981, pupils of the three families referred to by the Deputy had home pick-up points on the service to High Street National School, Belmont.</P>
      <P>However, due to an increase in the number of post-primary pupils offering for transport in the Ferbane area it was necessary for CIE to re-organise post-primary transport services in the general area.  This affected services to primary schools in the area including High Street National School.</P>
      <P>The eight children are at distances of 1.4 miles, 0.4 miles and 0.3 miles from the present pick-up point at Moystone Cross.  This standard of service is within the limits of acceptability for the Scheme as a whole throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restoration of door-to-door facilities to these pupils would necessitate the advancement of the time-table of the post-primary service also operated by the vehicle concerned, which would detrimentally <Col N="1740" /> affect the standard of service enjoyed by the post-primary pupils.</P>
