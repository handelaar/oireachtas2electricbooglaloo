    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have preferred to have seen incorporated in this Bill and particularly in this section provision for the automatic statutory indexation of basic personal allowances on the same basis as was done in Canada in 1973.  The provision there is that allowances are adjusted upwards in line with an index of prices and this is done automatically without the necessity of introducing a Bill in Parliament.  It is a fair system because it provides that the allowances will maintain their real value and the actual burden of taxation will not be increased simply because of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I acept that in many budgets the increases in allowances that have been granted have exceeded the inflation rate in the previous year, this has not always been the case.  In the past 20 years the increase in allowances has been well below the rate of inflation and the result <Col N="2190" /> has been an increase in the burden of taxation, in particular on people with middle to low incomes.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable for the Minister for Finance to provide a statutory means whereby the allowances and the bands for tax would be automatically adjusted without making it appear to be a gift of the Minister.  It is not a gift to compensate people retrospectively for the fact that the real value of their allowances has been diminished by inflation.  That cannot be claimed by any Minister as <i>largesse</i> on his part.  There should have been provision in this Bill for indexation of the allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We live in a period when inflation is at a high level.  This year it is reckoned our rate of inflation will be in excess of 18 per cent.  The cruel logic of granting allowances that do not increase automatically with the rate of inflation is that over a period of time that benefit is eroded and before the end of the year the taxpayer finds he is back where he started.  I have some amendments which provide for tying allowances and exemptions to the consumer price index and I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this point.</P>
      <P>At the moment inflation appears to be unchecked and it is important that we have a built-in safeguard to ensure that the real value of exemptions given to the taxpayer will be protected as much as possible.  If we were in a situation where a real attempt was being made to hold the line against increasing inflation these steps would not be necessary but, unfortunately, it appears to be a mark of the general retreat of this Government from all serious issues on the economic front that the fight against inflation has been given up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down some of my amendments more to show a difference of principle between us and the Government than for any other reason.  I do not expect the Minister to come forward with any agreement on these matters.  I should like to know what his attitude is.  I should like to hear once more whether he adheres to the attitude previously expressed by Ministers that they did not see much point in <Col N="2191" /> this kind of inbuilt guarantee.  The case is made for this kind of step by the current rate of inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House the section we are dealing with refers to the exemptions introduced for the first time here last year by my predecessor and increased in this year's budget.  Last year's Finance Act introduced general income tax exemption limits and exemption limits for aged persons.  This section increases these limits and extends the exemptions to somewhat larger incomes than were covered by last year's Act.</P>
      <P>In the case of a single person, a widowed person or a married person who is assessed to tax as a single person, the general exemption limit is raised from £1,700 to £2,000, that is, over £38 per week.  Where such a person is aged 65 years or over, but under 75 years, the exemption limit is increased from £2,000 to £2,300.  Where he is 75 years or over, the limit is raised from £2,500 to £2,800. In the case of a married person, the general exemption limit is raised from £3,400 to £4,000.  Where either spouse is 65 years or over, but under 75 years, the limit is increased from £4,000 to £4,600. Where either spouse is 75 years or over, the limit goes up from £5,000 to £5,600. In addition to that, marginal relief is available for those whose total income does not greatly exceed the appropriate exemption limit.</P>
      <P>I want to be very specific.  We are talking about the exemptions introduced for the first time last year and increases on those limits for the categories of people to which I have referred.  Later we will have an opportunity of dealing with the indexation referred to in amendments which have been put down in some of the other sections.  This novel provision exempting people at that level of income and with the age allowance, was well received.  It was a major step forward last year and it is improved upon this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that the increases in the limits affected by this section will result <Col N="2192" /> in 37,000 people, who otherwise would be liable to pay income tax for this year, being exempted from paying income tax. We cannot ignore that.  It is a very significant number of people.  In addition, 20,000 others qualify for marginal relief for 1981-82 who would not otherwise be entitled to it.  This year the number qualifying for marginal relief will be doubled.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 138A of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is referred to in the table concerning an additional allowance for widows and others in respect of children.  The allowance is granted in respect of a widow, or a widower, or a person who is not entitled to the deduction first mentioned in subsection (1) of section 138.  Do I take it that means this allowance is also available to single parents who are single parents for reasons other than being widows?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position.  I want to set out what section 2 is concerned with.  This section sets out in the usual tabular form the adjustments now being made in the personal reliefs. Part 1 of the First Schedule to the Bill makes the necessary textual amendments in the basic sections governing the grant of the allowances.  Briefly what it means is that the PAYE allowance is being increased from £400 to £600.  The one parent family allowance goes up from £500 to £650.  The incapacitated child allowance is being raised from £390 to £500.  The allowance for a housekeeper taking care of an incapacitated taxpayer or his incapacitated spouse is being increased from £330 to £500.  The blind person's allowance goes up from £330 to £400 and, where both spouses are blind, from £660 to £1,000.  Basically that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the blind allowance goes back over some time.  I wonder why people with other handicaps <Col N="2193" /> which may be equally incapacitating cannot claim this, for instance, people who are deaf.  I imagine they have the same problems working as people who are blind.  I wonder whether such an allowance has been contemplated at any stage for such people.  One could make a case for having a general allowance for people who are handicapped in specified ways rather than confining it to people who are blind.  I am not in any sense trying to minimise the seriousness of the handicap of blindness, but there would seem to be something of an anomaly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never say that because this has been the tradition it should not be altered.  I share the Deputy's concern on this point.  Having examined it very deeply I realise it is basically an operational difficulty.  In the case of blindness, it can be established.  I would be the last person to say that people with other incapacities or disabilities have not got difficulties.  Deciding on degrees and so on would make it impossible to extend this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister cannot be serious.  Is the Minister saying it is not possible to tell if people are deaf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is never anything but serious in this House or in the administration of his Department. The Deputy will appreciate surely that there are varying degrees of deafness, or incapacity, or disability.  This is the Year of the Disabled and I was the first Minister in modern times who recognised the necessity to introduce certain benefits and allowances for disabled people. Naturally I looked at the whole spectrum. I can assure the Deputy that, after detailed examination, what I say is absolutely serious and factual and is the reality of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about social welfare benefits which are a separate issue from a special allowance for the blind.  The Minister's argument is that it is more possible to establish blindness than it is to establish other handicaps.  I do not accept that.  It is equally possible to establish deafness.  It is possible to <Col N="2194" /> establish mental or physical handicap. The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, accepts certificates from doctors to the effect that people are handicapped in one way or another.  If these certificates and others are acceptable to the Minister for Finance to establish whether persons are blind, surely certificates from doctors would be acceptable to the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to establish that people are deaf, mentally handicapped or physically handicapped or handicapped in some other way which makes work more difficult for them.  I do not think there is any substance at all in the Minister's argument that one is justified in giving an allowance to blind people on the grounds that it is administratively more simple to administer blind allowances than, for example, a deaf allowance. The Minister has said that people are either blind or not whereas there are degrees of deafness but I am sure that the Minister, if he reflects for a moment, will realise that that is a misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>There are degrees of sightedness.  People can be completely blind and people can be partially blind just as they can be profoundly blind just as they can be profoundly deaf or partially deaf.  The argument as to the degrees of handicap obtaining in one case but not in another is not an argument for retaining this discrimination as against other forms of handicap in favour of blindness.  If the Minister had said that this was the tradition that existed for years and that he had not got around to changing it this year but would have something done about it in the future, I would not be making a song and dance about this matter.  However, the Minister sought in some off-the-cuff way to defend that anomaly without even thinking about it and I am not inclined to accept that from him.  The Minister should address himself to this subject and tell us what are the real reasons for maintaining a discrimination against other forms of handicap in favour of one particular form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not in the habit of making off-the-cuff defences of any situation.  I have outlined <Col N="2195" /> the difficulties.  I claim to have been the first Minister for Finance in recent times to consider the difficulty of disability not only under the social welfare system but in other areas.  I can assure the Deputy that there are serious difficulties of the type I have outlined to him.  Certainly, it is of concern to me to see how I can possibly extend the allowances the Deputy referred to, increase existing ones or extend them to other categories.  In the case of blindness it happens to be easier to define and once one goes to other categories there are various degrees.  For example, the Deputy referred to mental illness which brings us into a whole new area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to mentally handicapped and not illness.  The latter is different from mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a whole new area of assessment.  I am sincere when I say that I will have an open mind on the points the Deputy makes in relation to this but there are serious difficulties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not told us what the difficulties are and he is asking us to accept that there are difficulties. I am surprised that he has not explained the situation.  In order to give the Minister an opportunity to collect his papers on the subject I will defer pursuing this but I will be putting down an amendment for Report Stage with a view to achieving less of a discrimination in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with some other points in relation to allowances. There is an allowance known as a housekeeper allowance.  It originated in 1949 and it is granted in respect of a resident female relative taking charge of a child of a widow or widower or married man living apart from his wife or separated who is in full-time employment or business or a resident female relative taking charge of a brother or sister of an unmarried person.  As far as I can see that allowance was introduced at £100 in 1949 and it now stands at £165.  It should have been increased in line with inflation and inflation <Col N="2196" /> has risen by a lot more than 65 per cent since 1949.  I am anxious therefore to see that the Minister increases it.  I am also anxious to see that there is no discrimination in this housekeeper allowance. There is reference to a resident female relative being the only person who can claim and that seems to be contrary to the spirit of modern jurisprudence in the matter of discrimination in respect of the role that one or other sex may perform in the home.  That allowance should be increased and any discrimination in the matter of it being confined to a female relative should be removed.</P>
    <P>The dependent relative allowance should be substantially increased.  That allowance is granted in respect of each relative incapacitated by old age or infirmity or widowed mother or mother-in-law maintained by the claimant.  It is also claimable in respect of a son or daughter resident with and maintained by the claimant whose services the claimant is compelled to depend upon because of his old age or infirmity.  That was introduced in 1956 by the late Gerard Sweetman as Minister for Finance; the housekeeper allowance was introduced by the late Paddy McGilligan.  The two gentlemen concerned were Ministers for Finance and members of my party.  The dependent relative allowance was £60 in 1956 when it was introduced and it was only increased to £95, barely a 50 per cent increase.  There is no doubt that inflation since 1956 has been far more than 50 per cent.  There is a strong case for increasing that allowance substantially to encourage people to ensure that their relatives who are incapacitated in one way or another stay at home with their own family rather than require care in a residential institution, whether it is operated by the State or otherwise.  The increasing of that allowance radically would be a very desirable social step.  I urge the Minister to make such an increase.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give me an explanation in respect of section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969 which refers to an allowance which was at £165 in 1975-76, was later increased to £330 and is now being increased to £500.  That allowance <Col N="2197" /> is claimable if the taxpayer or his wife is totally incapacitated throughout the year of assessment and employs a person to take care of himself or his wife.  This is less generous than the dependent relative allowance because it is only confined to a claim in respect of one's spouse.  One must prove that a person is totally incapacitated whereas the dependent relative allowance does not require that the person be totally incapacitated, it merely requires that the person is incapacitated by age or infirmity.  Concentrating attention on increasing this much narrower allowance which is confined to the spouse and which requires total incapacity is a wrong policy.  The Minister should return to increasing the dependent relative allowance which was introduced by the late Gerard Sweetman rather than this much narrower allowance which was introduced in 1969.

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's intervention is interesting at the moment. He has his problems.  In response to what <Col N="2198" /> Deputy Bruton said regarding the various allowances, of course as Minister for Finance I always look at those and will do so in the future, but obviously not in the context of the present Bill.  The Deputy raised some specific points.  For example, he referred to the allowance for the incapacitated. I believe that it is right to provide this increased allowance to the incapacitated person, particularly in this Year of the Disabled when surely these people do deserve recognition that they had not been getting in the past.  I, too, would dearly like to increase every single allowance, but there is a limit to what any Minister for Finance can do in any one year.  However, I will certainly bear in mind in the future the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should answer the question that I asked him, which is why he is increasing the allowance which is confined to be claimed only in respect of the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the taxpayer where total incapacity must be proved, rather than increasing the dependent relative's allowance which is a more liberal one granted in respect of anyone incapacitated by age or infirmity who is dependent on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons, basically the specific consideration for the incapacitated person plus the fact that there is and has been to some extent an abuse of the dependent relative's allowance.  In the case of the incapacitated person nobody would disagree with the need, and I hope that the Deputy is not saying that that increase should not have been given.  I believe that that category of people deserve to be treated as generously as this country can treat them, particularly in this year.  The dependent relative's allowance has been found to be abused to a large extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The dependent relative's allowance means that the claimant should be maintaining that dependent relative.  The Deputy must know that many times the taxpayer seeks to claim for the relative although the relative is not dependent on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on the dependent relative's allowance.  I am a bit surprised at the Minister's attitude that the allowance should not be increased because there may be some abuses of the system whereby people claim under this heading.  Surely those who claim legitimately under this heading should not therefore suffer because these abuses are not eliminated.  It seems an extraordinary proposition to suggest that because there is some abuse of a system those who claim legitimately under that system should suffer and be limited in the amount they can claim.  The figure when originally introduced was £60 and is now £95 after a period of 25 years.  It is obvious that the original intention of the late Minister, Deputy Sweetman, has been lost in the passage of time.  In 1956 when this was introduced £60 was a considerable amount of money, whereas in the context of inflation the sum of £95 is becoming irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at this whole question of the dependent relative's allowance from a much broader point of <Col N="2200" /> view.  From my experience down the country it seems that the cost of maintaining our old people in homes and hospitals, in homes in particular, can run up to £200 a week.  All our efforts must be devoted towards trying to encourage as far as possible that such old people are maintained in the bosom of their families. This can be done in a number of ways, not all solely under the jurisdiction of the Minister and not all solely in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of the dependent relative's allowance is purely one factor. There is the prescribed relative's allowance under the Department of Social Welfare which is very restrictive.  There is the question of the home help allowance which can be obtained from the health boards.  I suggest to the Minister in the context of this dependent relative's allowance that there should be an acceptance in principle by the State that every reasonable encouragement that can be given towards maintaining our old people within their family environment must be given.  Once we have that general principle we can then put it into effect through the various procedures open through the social welfare system, the health boards and income tax allowances that are available.  On this point I suggest very strongly that the Minister should consider a substantial increase in the dependent relative's allowance.  From the point of view of cost to the State ultimately, it is my belief that if we can encourage an extra number of people to be maintained at home merely on the basis of their relatives being able to claim the dependent relative's allowance for so doing, in net terms it will be a saving to the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, on that point I cannot accept the Minister's response that this allowance should not be increased because there may be some abuses of it.  If there are abuses of it, let us go about eliminating those abuses, but let us not dilute the original principle established by the second Inter-Party Government by merely letting the figure be eaten away by inflation so that the general purport and intent of the provision will be totally lost.  I encourage the Minister strongly to undertake <Col N="2201" /> to this House that the views presented here will be considered between now and Report Stage, and if he is not able to give an absolute commitment at this stage he may be able to provide an amendment then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want to reply to Deputy O'Keeffe?  No. 1 feel that if there is abuse the Minister should eliminate the abuse.  If it is possible to have false claims in respect of incapacity it is equally possible to have false claims in respect of total incapacity.  They are simple degrees of interpretation.  The claim for increasing the allowance for total incapacity by leaving the one for incapacity static on the grounds of abuse does not stand up.  I have made that point and I will be pursuing it if this House has an opportunity of debating this Bill on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I would like to turn now to section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969 relating to the allowance for a housekeeper taking care of an incapacitated person.  This allowance is now being increased from £330 where it now stands to £500.  The provisions of the 1969 Act are as follows:</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, an individual who, in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Acts makes a claim in that behalf, makes a return in the prescribed form of his total income and proves&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) (i) that, throughout the year of assessment, he was totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, or</P>
      <P>(ii) that, being a married man, his wife was, throughout the year of assessment, totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, and</P>
      <P>(b) that for the year of assessment he has employed a person for the purpose of having the care of the person (being the individual or his wife) who is so incapacitated, shall, in computing the amount of his taxable income, be entitled to have a deduction of £100 made from his assessable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was increased to £165 under the 1975 Finance Act, and is now to be increased to £500.  The point I would like to make <Col N="2202" /> here is in respect of section 3 (a) (ii) of the Finance Act, 1969.  It refers to a married man whose wife was, throughout the year of assessment, totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity.  Can a married woman whose husband was, throughout the year of assessment, totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity claim the allowance?  It seems to me that unless the section has been amended or unless there has been a Supreme Court judgment which says that in all cases a &ldquo;married man&rdquo; includes a married woman as the case may be, just as &ldquo;he&rdquo; means &ldquo;she&rdquo; as the case may be, it would seem that there is discrimination here in that a married man may claim an allowance in respect of a wife who is incapacitated whereas a married woman may not claim an allowance in respect of a husband who is incapacitated.  There is no justification in modern circumstances for any such discrimination in view of the fact that so many married women are working now in contrast even to the situation that obtained in 1969.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Bruton regarding what he alleges is discrimination, the position is that this allowance refers to a housekeeper. But if the husband and wife are, as they can now be, on separate assessments, the wife can claim her portion of the allowance as tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, whenever an allowance is being granted the Revenue Commissioners are required by standing practice to apply the strict interpretation of the law.  They are not allowed, in the case of an allowance, to grant more of an allowance than is strictly allowed by the legislation.  It seems that here the law strictly confines the claim for this allowance to a married man in the case of the wife being incapacitated. There is no mention of a married woman being able to claim for her husband.  If the matter were contested and the Revenue Commissioners were not to allow such a thing, I would feel that the courts would have no option but to hold as far as the law itself goes, whatever about the Constitution, that this allowance may <Col N="2203" /> never be claimed by a married woman. Why should it be necessary for a husband and wife to go on separate assessment if the wife wants to claim whereas, if the husband is claiming, they do not have to go on separate assessment?  I said already that I doubt that what the Minister said is correct in the light of the clear statement in the relevant legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is correct regarding separate assessments.  If it is the husband who is incapacitated the wife can, of course, claim the full allowance just as the husband can in the case of the wife, so discrimination does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister square that with section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969, which is quite clear in that it says that that allowance may be claimed by a married man but it does not say anything about it being claimable by a married woman?  Will the Minister look at section 3?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, in the inserted Table Part I, to delete &ldquo;The first £1,000...25 per cent.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The first £2,500...20 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2204" /> The amendment suggests that we should reduce the rate of tax in regard to the single person from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and raise the tax-free portion of earnings from £1,000 to £2,500.  What I am suggesting in this amendment is that half of what would be the average male wage in the country, £90 to £100 per week at present, would be free from tax.  For married people we are suggesting that the threshold be raised to £5,000 and that the rate of tax be reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the arguments supporting these changes in this House previously. I believe that a good deal of the industrial unrest that we have witnessed in the last few years is due not so much to problems contained within industry itself but to the general discontent on the part of PAYE earners about what they perceive as their over-taxed condition.  In making these suggestions I am attempting to reduce the pressure on the real wages of wage earners who are forced to seek compensation for their over-taxed condition in higher wage claims.  Our population is predominantly youthful and the cost of housing bears very heavily on these young people among whom there is a very rapidly reducing marriage age.  If we do not, in our budgetary policy, reduce their burden of taxation, more and more we are going to see people being forced to seek compensation in higher wage claims with the result that we will have a concomitant extension of industrial unrest.  I know there is a commission sitting on income tax at present. I do not know whether there is an interim report expected.  The amendments that I have put forward today are no different from previous amendments I have put forward in this matter.  I put these figures forward in an effort to reduce the pressure on wages which is a prevalent feature of our bad industrial relations.  The suggestion is that we would raise the threshold and the Minister, in his own suggestions in this part, has increased the tax-free portion of income.  I suggest that the band should be reduced from 25 to 20 per cent.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on these proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of tax were last restructured by section 8 of the Finance Act of 1980.  Section 3 of this Bill proposes to alter those rates by increasing the standard rate &mdash; 35 per cent &mdash; band from £4,000 to £4,500 for single and widowed persons, and married persons assessed to tax as single persons, and from £8,000 to £9,000 for married couples when the assessment is based on their combined incomes.  The cost of this increase is estimated at £9.7 million in 1981 and £15.4 million for the full year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment proposes to reduce the rate of tax from 25 to 20 per cent and to increase the bands of income chargeable at that rate from £1,000 to £2,500 for single and widowed persons and married persons assessed for tax as single persons, and from £2,000 to £5,000 for married couples assessed on their combined incomes.  I can give the Deputy the scales of rates as proposed by section 3 as it stands, but the cost to the Exchequer &mdash; which is the important point &mdash; of accepting the Deputy's proposal would be £100 million in 1981 and £154 million for a full year.  This compares with the cost of the proposal in the section to which I referred earlier &mdash; £9.7 million in 1981 and £15.4 million for the full year &mdash; and the cost of the total income tax changes announced in the budget of £66 million in 1981 and £94.5 million for the full year.  The cost, obviously, is prohibitive. I have often heard the Deputy mention in this House the lack of progress in this whole area, but very substantial progress has been made during the period of office of this Government.  As he himself says, the Commission on Taxation is still sitting, not yet having reported back. As I said recently, I understand that they are working well and will be reporting later this year.  I, too, am committed to an equitable tax system, which is a very important objective.</P>
      <P>I want to mention some of the substantial increases in the main personal income tax allowances over the past few years.  In 1975-1976 a single person got an allowance of £575 and this year that allowance is £1,115, or an increase in the period of 94 per cent.</P>

      <P>Within the confines of this argument, reducing the burden of taxation on the lower paid, which is what my amendment is about, would cost X amount of money.  If my argument is right, there is a direct connection between the amount of industrial unrest and the overtaxed condition of the majority of wage earners.  There would be solid social benefits following on the industrial peace that would result if we could lessen this burden on our wage earners.  There would also be the not inconsiderable byproduct of a reduction in our rate of inflation.  There is no doubt that our industrial costs are increasing at an alarming rate and incomes are a proportion of those costs.  If we could reduce the burden or pressure of the wage rates by reducing the rate of income tax, benefits would flow from this.  I know the Minister's attitude on the matter and do not wish to take up the time of the House but I hope for a broader venue in the very near future to discuss this.</P>

In fact, that contradicts the argument raised by the Opposition against the improvements in our tax structure in recent years.  They have claimed that our helping of the lower paid, because it extends to the higher paid, is designed to help more the higher paid.  That is exactly in line with Deputy O'Leary's amendment, so he cannot claim on this occasion that he is moving this amendment to assist the lower paid and at the same time charge us with introducing certain improvements in the tax structure which help only the higher paid. He cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, the amount of rent paid by an individual on a principal private residence, which exceeds £10 per week, shall be deducted from the total income of that individual for the year 1981-82 and any subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other parts of this Bill there are deductions made which we will come to later.  I am suggesting here that, in respect of those who pay rent, there is no section of this Bill which helps in the main young wage earners&mdash;we do not know the exact number&mdash;in the principal urban areas of the State who pay amounts of rent which are large in terms of their total proportion of weekly income and who cannot claim any tax allowance in relation to those payments.  I am suggesting here that a sum for rent which exceeds £10 per week in respect of a principal residence &mdash; to ensure that a person who was in the way of owning a good deal of rented property could not benefit from this amendment &mdash; should be deducted from the total income of that individual for the year 1981-82 and subsequent years of assessment. This would have the twin advantages of again reducing the burden on wage earners, single for the most part but many married people of course, young married couples attempting to save for a house who must pay very high rents at present for which they get no return.  Like other parts of our social policy, the house occupier is able to offset against his or her tax liability the amounts paid in interest on house mortgages.  I am seeking a similar right for people who pay rent and who are attempting to build up capital in an effort to join those who own houses but who are being held back in their <Col N="2209" /> efforts by reason of the amount of rent they are paying coupled with the fact that they are not able to claim any tax concession in respect of those rents.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to bring about a situation whereby the amounts of reliefs and allowable deductions on the total income of an individual for income tax purposes be increased by the percentage figure as represented by the CPI.  As I mentioned earlier, we should try to move away from this situation of spurious claims that there have been real improvements.  Allowances should be linked to the CPI.  I shall be interested in hearing what is the Minister's attitude to my proposal in respect of income tax allowances for the payment of rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in respect of allowances for the payment of rent.  There has been a substantial diminution in the availability of rented accommodation during the past 30 years. I saw figures recently which showed that the number of rented dwellings available has been reduced by approximately half during this period.  Obviously the main reason for this is that in respect of an owner-occupied dwelling one is not able to claim tax allowances in regard to the interest paid on the loan for the purchase of the premises.  Neither is there any allowance in respect of rent payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very strong economic argument for encouraging more use of rented accommodation.  This would make for a more flexible form of housing and would alleviate the problems involved in moving house from one part of the country to another in the event of people moving because of the availability of jobs in areas other than the areas in which they are normally resident.  From his experience in the Department of Labour the Minister will be well aware that there is a considerable shortage of skills in certain parts of the country in certain types of industry and that it has been found more easy to attract people back from England than to attract them to move from one part of the country to another in which their particular skill might be needed badly.  I would argue that one of the main reasons for this reluctance to move to <Col N="2210" /> another part of the country is that people own their houses in the areas in which they were resident originally.  The amount of tax that would be involved by way of stamp duty in selling a house and in buying another would be sufficiently great to offset any advantage in terms of the remuneration they might receive by moving to a job in another area.  If they were living in rented accommodation they would not incur any of those costs.</P>
    <P>Because of the obsolescence in various skills and jobs in modern society, we must face the fact that people will be moving from one part of the country to another in order to find employment.  To help such mobility it is economically desirable that housing accommodation is available and that is why the provision of rented accommodation would make a valuable economic contribution.  Therefore, I support Deputy O'Leary's proposal and I should like the Minister to indicate to us, when replying, what would be the approximate cost of implementing this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in support of this amendment.  On the question of cost, I would ask the Minister not merely to throw out a figure to the House but to bear in mind the probability that the introduction of such an allowance would result in a considerable amount of tax intake by the State.  I say this because the claiming of an income tax remission in respect of rent paid would result in many of those who are in receipt of those rents having to make returns.</P>
      <P>From talking with country people who are living in the city I am aware of the substantial rents now being paid for accommodation here.  There are bedsitters rented by two people at rents of £30 per week.  In one case of which I became aware there were four people in what was no more than a big bedsitter for which they were paying £60 a week.  I was shocked at those figures and the thought occurred to me as to whether the recipients of that kind of money were making their returns to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important side effect of Deputy O'Leary's proposal would be that the <Col N="2211" /> person paying the rent would be in a position to claim an income tax allowance for amounts in excess of £10 per week while the tax people would be in a position to make inquiries regarding the recipients of those rents.  Subsequently, there would not be a substantial burden on the State as a result of the income tax allowances since the people in receipt of the high rents would be brought within the tax net.  The net benefit to the State would go in large part towards providing for the cost of this provision.  On that basis the proposal makes sense both in social and in economic terms and I strongly support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if this proposal were acceptable in principle there are a number of very practical grounds on which it could not be accepted.  First, the implementation of the proposal would give an unjustified tax relief at the higher rate of tax to those who pay big rents for accommodation.  In addition it is unlikely that a tax deduction in respect of rent paid would result in any benefit to any tenant because it would be passed on except in the case of rent-controlled dwellings.  Undoubtedly many landlords would increase rents by amounts equivalent to the tax reliefs.  They would be in a position to do this because, generally speaking, rented accommodation is in short supply.  It is possible that there would be an upsurge in demand in the event of an income tax concession on rent and this would provide a further bonanza for those landlords.</P>
      <P>This will not arise in the case of local authority tenants, but such tenants are already subsidised highly.  The cost of implementing this proposal would be of the order of £50 million in a full year. Obviously, such cost would be of major concern at this time; and, if landlords were to take advantage of any such provision by increasing rents, the cost of the relief would be increased substantially.  It could then be as high as £70 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of a scheme of deduction for rent paid would be expensive for the State and troublesome for the <Col N="2212" /> taxpayer.  It would be troublesome also for his or her employer.</P>
    <P>In addition a large number of those cases would have to be reviewed annually and this would increase the number of amendments of certificates.  The increase in documentation and the policing of the receipts procedure would be extremely difficult.  There was a time when I believed that what is proposed was a direction in which we might move, but I am satisfied now that any such move would inflate the rented accommodation market and would work as much, if not more, to the benefit of the landlord and that it might or might not benefit the tenant.  There are many reasons why any revenue which such a scheme might yield would be more than offset by the cost of the scheme.  Progress is being made on the revenue intake front in respect of people renting out accommodation.  Basically, if it were accepted in principle, the practical difficulties and the unlikely event of its being acceptable or helpful to anybody would make it an impractical suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At some stage there will be an amendment of this kind incorporated in the Finance Bill.  All the Minister has said here today about its impracticability, the reasons it cannot be introduced, will be taken back at that stage by whichever Minister is standing over there.  My belief that a provision along these lines will be incorporated is because of the growing numbers of young people in urban centres living in rented accommodation who, for reasons referred to by other Deputies, are paying rather high rents.  I do not believe the figure of £50 million given by the Minister. I do not know on what basis that was calculated in the Department.  I imagine there was a good deal of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Padding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;padding, fake, certainly with little scientific data at the back of it.  I am sure the Minister and his officials know that this is very much unknown territory with very little related data.  We do not know the extent of <Col N="2213" /> rented accommodation in the State.  As other Deputies have said, I doubt if there are any satisfactory returns at all on the matter.  We seem to deal in figures of £50 million at present in relation to anything, but I doubt that figure very much.  The Minister may not think much of the idea now, but he has not been very long in that post.  As a new Minister I would advise him to investigate this area seriously, because it is one in which change will inevitably occur in the future.</P>
      <P>Neither am I convinced that the landlord will be the chief beneficiary.  It is not beyond our wit to devise a scheme under which that will not happen.  If we simply say that the very prosperous will benefit as a result as well as the single, young, wage earner, again that is an argument that could be addressed to many other schemes of social reform introduced in this House for the best of reasons.  It was addressed to the question of food subsidies quite recently, but now the Government have seen fit to accept arguments from the Opposition on that matter.  It is not beyond the collective wit of this House to devise legislation to ensure that the people whom we intend to benefit from this&mdash;namely, young people living in uncontrolled rented accommodation who cannot claim anything at all in relation to the rent payable&mdash;will do so.  That is absolutely unfair when one considers that others in the housing market are entitled to claim allowances and deductions under our tax code.  It is clear that demographic facts will dictate that we will introduce an amendment of this kind, because young people are in the majority in this country.  In large urban centres it will simply be a matter of young people realising that this is a justifiable claim on their part, that they should seek and be entitled to the same kind of tax allowances as are others in the housing market.  If there is to be real benefit to the person in rented accommodation &mdash; I agree with what the Minister says on this&mdash; then we should consider the possibility of having some controlled section in the rents area.  Again, that indicates that there are ways of ensuring that the person in rented accommodation will be the chief beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2214" /> I am not satisfied with the Minister's response to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pleaded four points in his defence.  He advanced four reasons for rejecting this amendment. The first was on the basis that the introduction of such a provision would be of greater benefit to those on a higher rate of tax than those on the standard rate.  Has the Minister not considered that the equivalent type of provision in regard to mortgage and interest payments similarly applies?  I have taken those two because they relate very largely to the housing situation.  If we accept a system for the moment&mdash;and possibly this should be investigated further &mdash; under which those paying a higher rate of income tax pay more because of the benefits in regard to mortgage and interest payments, then introducing that as a defence in rejecting Deputy O'Leary's amendment is not justifiable.</P>
      <P>The second ground of defence advanced by the Minister was in relation to the fact that landlords could benefit rather than tenants.  At first sight this would seem to be legitimate, because the natural reaction of any landlord if forced to make payments out of his rent&mdash;and in this case it would be payment to the Revenue&mdash;would be to jack up the rent. I see no reason whatever why the introduction of such a provision should not be coupled with the setting up of a rents tribunal, which in any event is probably necessary in regard to rented accommodation. One of the aims of that tribunal would be to ensure that any increases authorised would not be related to the fact that a landlord had to pay tax on his income from rented accommodation the same as everybody else.  On that ground I feel the second line of defence used by the Minister is not sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third ground advanced by the Minister was in relation to the question of cost.  He pulled a figure of £50 million out of the air, but he has not dealt with the point made originally.  That was the corresponding benefit to the State of having all these landlords making their contribution to the State out of their income from rented accommodation.  I am sure <Col N="2215" /> the Minister knows very well that a very large proportion of them are not so doing at present.  Probably it is impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that they do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Then obviously the Minister is the only exception.  The Minister will see that the point I am making is a valid one, that the figure of £50 million or whatever it is would be offset very largely by the corresponding increase in revenue occasioned by the making of returns by those landlords.  On that basis I believe that the third ground of defence in regard to the question of costs is not sustainable because it is not a true figure. The net cost to the State, I would suggest, would be much lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's last ground of defence was on the basis of the troublesome administration as far as the tenant was concerned.  That must be rejected out of hand.  If a tenant wants to claim income tax relief, let us not pamper him entirely. The very least such tenants can do is to ensure that they retain the appropriate receipts and have them available for production to their inspector of taxes.  If they <Col N="2216" /> do not want to do that and do not want to claim, well and good.  But I would be very surprised indeed if there would even be a single one who would not ensure that the necessary documentation was available to enable them to claim such relief.  The rents some of them are paying are so high in relation to their incomes that I have no doubt there would be a rush to purchase receipt books immediately any such provision was introduced. Therefore that does not constitute an answer either.  On the side of the Revenue Commissioners and inspectors of taxes, certainly they will have to inspect these receipts; but, of course, they have to seek the corroboration of virtually all claims under the income tax system.  I have no doubt that a simple system could be devised to enable a person properly to claim this relief, to document it and have it inspected by his inspector of taxes. Therefore, the fourth ground in regard to problems of administering such a system is not a sustainable defence.</P>
    <P>On all of those grounds I reiterate my support for Deputy O'Leary's amendment. It has many benefits and would contribute to the development not alone of our economy but our social development far beyond what appears at first sight.  I strongly urge the Minister to indicate that he is prepared to give due consideration to the arguments raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our excessive reliance on owner-occupied accommodation has built a serious rigidity into our economy which does not enable us to adapt as flexibly to changing circumstances as do other competing economies.  The measure proposed by Deputy O'Leary would encourage rented accommodation and would be consistent with another measure contained in the budget which gives people tax allowances to build rented accommodation.  That relief goes directly to the landlords.  For the Minister who introduced such a measure to benefit the landlords to refuse to introduce this measure on the grounds that some of the benefit might go to the landlords rather than to the tenants conveys a certain inconsistency in his policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that benefit would <Col N="2217" /> go to landlords because rented accommodation is scarce and any incentive to increase demand would lead to an increased price which would totally transfer the benefit of the incentive to the landlord.  The same argument could be made about the increase in new house grants.  If the Minister can claim that an increased allowance to encourage more demand for rented accommodation benefits the landlord he must claim that the allowance recently given by the Government in the form of increased grants for new houses will be solely enjoyed by the builders.  The Minister would not make such a claim and therefore his argument is revealed as being spurious.  It is much easier to increase the supply of rented accommodation than to increase the supply of new dwellings as existing houses can be converted relatively quickly whereas to build a house one must buy a site, get planning permission and so on and it would take from two to three years to build a new house.  A stimulus to demand for rented accommodation can be responded to within four or five months but a stimulus to demand for new accommodation will not be responded to for two or three years.  Consequently the period when a supplier would enjoy a supplier's market would be much less in the case of rented accommodation than in the case of new accommodation.  I would argue that an allowance for rented accommodation is much less likely to be enjoyed by the supplier than an allowance for the purchase of new house accommodation.  I would urge the Minister to have another look at the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a figure of £50 million and I would like to know the basis on which that was calculated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Leary, future changes may well be needed in this whole area but not just at present for the reasons mentioned.  The Minister for Finance may well look at the developments but he must first of all look at the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe may think that I was being jocose when I said that if he had any evidence of the type of people he mentioned, and I do not deny that they <Col N="2218" /> exist, I would welcome it and pass it on to the Revenue people concerned.  During my time as Minister I have followed up what my predecessors were doing.  I too am determined to encompass all the people referred to by the Deputies opposite within the tax net.</P>
    <P>In relation to the section of the Bill which refers to moderate cost rented accommodation there is an advantage from the Minister's point of view in that those people will be known and it will be possible to trace them.  The Revenue Commissioners are actively pursuing this whole area and are making substantial progress and I would encourage them to continue their progress.  I am sure all sides of the House agree that this is one area where equity must be achieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy O'Leary's point, something may have to be looked at in the future but a serious problem exists at present in relation to rents.  The Rent Restrictions Act is being challenged in the courts and the outcome of that poses a difficulty for all of us.  The Government are looking at that seriously to ensure that when a decision is made the situation can be controlled.  Deputy O'Keeffe said that my arguments were invalid but I do not agree with him.  I am satisfied that it would take a lot of policing and administration and in our present situation it could work to the detriment of the person whom we are trying to help.  Deputy Bruton said that that argument was tantamount to saying that the benefits could be passed on to the builder in the housing subsidies.  This is not so.  The subsidy is designed in such a way that that cannot happen.  Deputy O'Keeffe should know from his experience that there are limits on mortgage relief, £2,400 in the case of a single person, £3,500 in the case of a widow and £4,800 in the case of a married person.  Deputy O'Keeffe should know that that limit prevents the giving of excessive benefit to those on higher taxation levels.  These are the points I made on the amendment.  I accept the case made by Deputy O'Leary.</P>
    <P>The cost has been challenged but I said that it was a tentative cost of £50 million, a cost that could be pushed higher by the activities of the landlord.  Despite anything <Col N="2219" /> that may happen in the future it is not practicable to accept the Deputy's amendment even if we agreed with it in principle.  Deputy Bruton wanted to know how the figure was arrived at but, as I said, it is necessarily tentative.  The figure is based on the best information available to the Revenue Commissioners who have made considerable progress in recent times.  I hope they will make further progress in ensuring a return of income from the type of people referred to by the Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which has been referred to in previous Finance Acts, that the deductions allowable, the amount of relief should be related directly to the CPI.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is framed to come into operation in 1982-83 and its purpose is to index on the basis of the consumer price index personal allowances <Col N="2220" /> allowed in that year and subsequent years.  This proposal has major budgetary implications and will be considered in relation to next year's budget. It would not now be appropriate to pre-empt the decisions that will be made in 1982.  The subject of indexation is being considered by the commission on taxation and any move to bring in indexation at this juncture would involve an anticipation of the commission's findings in advance.  The question of indexation was discussed in the debate on last year's Finance Bill and was referred to again in the budget debate and in the debate following the budget this year.  I will point out what had happened in recent years having outlined the reasons why we should not pre-empt what might happen in the 1982 budget and what might be recommended by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the real situation of the changes since 1978.  The allowances given in income tax reliefs in the 1978 Budget up to 1981 totalled £500 million.  If the full year cost under indexation were taken as a criterion for the period of those four budgets, the allowances would only have come to £324 million &mdash; a difference of £176 million. Should that not be borne in mind?  It would obviously be impossible for me to pre-empt anything that might happen in the 1982 Budget.  I do not believe it would be advisable for me to pre-empt any recommendation that might be made by the commission.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates my reason.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;Income derived from the payment of an old age pension to a person qualified under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, shall not be assessed to tax for the year 1981-82 and any subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was referred to previously. The amendment proposes that the old age pension should not be assessed for income tax.  The pensions of many elderly people are subject to tax and this causes a hardship.  There are many elderly people who are living alone on their pensions.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say with regard to their position.  He may say that since this is not subject to a means test it would benefit those the amendment is not intended to benefit.  The answer to that is that the rest of the income of a person in that situation would be subject to income tax and this amendment would not be contrary to the concept of progressive taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, for the first time, we introduced exemptions, which I am sure the Deputy agrees was a very welcome move because it assisted people who had an income up to a specific figure but which could not be regarded as a high income.  The Deputy's amendment does not refer to non-contributory old age pensions because they are subject to a means test.  The amendment only refers to contributory old age pensions.  There is no question of the non-contributory old age pension being taxed.  If the old age pensioner has a very substantial income, is it a fair approach?  I would prefer to follow the policy lines of the Government by including people on incomes, such as old age pensioners and others up to a certain level of income, for exemption from the tax net or marginal relief if they slightly exceed those incomes.  If we were to accept the Deputy's amendment it could in effect mean the introduction of assistance for people <Col N="2222" /> who could have very high incomes such as investment incomes.  That would not be a wise move at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the contributory old age pension is included in income for tax purposes whereas the non-contributory old age pension is not. The difference between a contributory and non-contributory old age pension is very small and is not sufficient to compensate the people who contributed to the social insurance scheme throughout their working lives.  They would be almost as well off if they had not been contributing.  To add now to that discrimination by saying that the contributory old age pension will be included in the tax liability, while the non-contributory old age pension will not, seems to be compounding an existing injustice.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to indicate the basis upon which the non-contributory old age pension and other allowances of that nature, such as disability and unemployment benefits, are excluded from consideration as being income for tax purposes.  I have been looking through the relative passages of the 1967 Act and cannot find the provision which for instance, exempts non-contributory old age pension but does not exempt contributory old age pension. In my view the failure to allow the exemption of contributory old age pensions seems to constitute an injustice.</P>
      <P>There are people who claim we should exempt all pensions, including contributory pensions outside the social welfare system, but they forget that people who contributed to a private pension scheme are allowed tax exemption in respect of their contributions while at work, and to allow them to be exempt from income tax on what they receive from the fund to which they contributed would be to allow them to benefit twice.  That would not seem to be justifiable.  The same argument does not apply in the case of social welfare pensions.  I would be grateful if the Minister could assist me in this matter and consider favourably the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Leary.</P>

      <P>The non-contributory <Col N="2223" /> pension is means tested.  They are both chargeable to income tax but the non-contributory pensioner will not have to pay tax because when the means test is applied his pension will be reduced to nil before it exceeds the exemption limit.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy has been to look at this whole area of exemption.  A married couple, 66 years or over, with a contributory pension will get about £2,600 or £2,700.  Their exemption limit, for income tax purposes is £4,600.  This means they can have a further income of about £2,000 before they become liable for any taxation.  The Deputy must realise that there is no reason why a contributory pensioner could not have an investment or other income which might bring his income into a higher bracket.  In other words, the income limit of the contributory pension for a 66-year old couple is approximately £4,600 and they can earn an additional £2,200 before they come into the tax net.  Primarily the principle suggested by the Deputy could be dangerous because there is nothing to prevent a contributory old age pensioner having an income of £20,000 a year. Would he be justified in being exempt from tax?</P>

      <P>Social welfare benefit is exempt from inclusion as income for the purposes of determining a person's taxable income and it is not means tested.  I cannot see how one can consistently say that unemployment benefit, which is a social welfare benefit, not means tested, could not be included in the sum when determining a person's taxable income while a contributory old age pension should be included.  Can the Minister refer me to the section which exempts such things as unemployment benefit?</P>

      <P>Section 109 of the 1967 Income Tax Act is the relevant provision. That is the charging provision and it does not include unemployment benefit. I have outlined the position to Deputy O'Leary.  There are conditions governing the qualification of a person for relief. Old age pensioners may earn £2,000 more than the £2,700 exemption before <Col N="2224" /> they are chargeable to income tax.  Even after that there are marginal reliefs.  Is the Deputy suggesting that a pensioner who has an income of £20,000 should be exempt?</P>

However, his unemployment benefit in the first half is exempt for calculation for income tax.  It does not seem to be consistent to exempt unemployment benefit but to include contributory old age pensions for determining tax liability.  As I have said, it is inconsistent.</P>

However, self-employed people pay income tax on the total sum earned by the end of the year.  It is simply inconsistent to say that income received from unemployment benefit should not be counted for tax purposes whereas contributory old age pensions are counted.  Both incomes are based on a title gained through contributions to the Social Insurance Fund. Would the Minister explain how he can be responsible for these two apparently discriminatory provisions?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 6, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>6.&mdash;(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>`relevant payment' means any sum paid on or after the 6th day of April, 1981, by the Minister for the Environment to an individual under a scheme providing for the payment of a special mortgage subsidy to first-time owner-occupiers of certain houses;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`specified loan or loans' means a loan <Col N="2226" /> or loans in relation to which a relevant payment is made;</P>
    <P>`relevant tax repayment', in relation to an individual, means, subject to subsection (3), the amount of tax which, apart from this section, would fall to be repaid to the individual under the provisions (hereafter in this section referred to as `the relevant provisions') of section 496 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for a year of assessment on the amount of interest paid on a specified loan or loans by the individual in the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>(2) Where, for any year of assessment, in the case of an individual, a relevant tax repayment would fall to be made, that relevant tax repayment shall be reduced by the amount determined by the formula set out in the Table to this subsection, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the Income Tax Acts, the amount of tax as so reduced, and no other amount of tax, shall be repaid under the relevant provisions to the individual on the amount of interest paid by him in the year of assessment on a specified loan or loans.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P Just="Center">(R+S)&mdash;P</P>
    <P>where&mdash;</P>
    <P>R is the relevant tax repayment,</P>
    <P>S is the aggregate amount of any relevant payments made to the individual in the year of assessment or the amount of any relevant payment made to the individual where only one such payment was made in the year of assessment, and</P>
    <P>P is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an amount equal to (R+S), or</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of any payment, or the aggregate amount of any payments <Col N="2227" /> where more than one payment was made, made by the individual in the year of assessment by way of repayment of the principal of any specified loan or loans or by way of payment of interest on any specified loan or loans.</P>
    <P>whichever is the less,</P>
    <P>(3) For the purposes of this section, in the case of an individual who, in the year of assessment, in addition to interest on a specified loan or loans, has paid other interest, the amount of the relevant tax repayment shall be the amount determined by the formula&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">A&mdash;B</P>
    <P>where&mdash;</P>
    <P>A is the amount of tax which, apart from this section, would fall to be repaid to the individual for the year of assessment under the relevant provisions on all interest paid by him in the year of assessment, and</P>
    <P>B is the amount of tax which would fall to be repaid to the individual for the year of assessment under the relevant provisions if no interest on a specified loan or loans had been paid by him in the rear of assessment.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a relevant payment is made in respect of any period, that relevant payment shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be made in the year of assessment into which the period falls:</P>
    <P>Provided that where the period falls partly into one year of assessment and partly into another year of assessment, the amount of the relevant payment made in respect of that period shall be apportioned to each year of assessment in the proportion which the part of the period falling into each year of assessment bears to the whole of the period and the amount so apportioned to a year of assessment shall be deemed, <Col N="2228" /> for the purposes of this section, to be paid in that year of assessment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed amendment is to implement paragraph (iv) of the special mortgage subsidy scheme for first time owner-occupiers of grant size houses announced by the Minister for the Environment on 16 April 1981.  That paragraph states that the subsidy, plus income tax relief, would not exceed the amount of the annual loan repayments and that, subject to this, income tax relief would be allowable in the normal way&mdash;that statutory tax relief limits would apply.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section will ensure that in any case where the subsidy plus the income tax relief in respect of the interest paid on loans coming within the ambit of the scheme exceed the total loan repayments the income tax relief will be reduced by the amount of the excess.  In no case will any reduction be made in the subsidy payment by virtue of the provision in the proposed section.  Section 496 of the Income Tax Act provides for the giving of relief by way of repayment of interest paid subject to certain restrictions on the amount of the interest which may qualify for relief.  These restrictions are not being changed.</P>
    <P>It has been customary in the case of persons liable to tax under PAYE to provide relief for interest under section 496 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, not by way of repayment but by an appropriate increase in the tax free allowances.  This practice will continue unaltered and any reduction in tax relief under the present section will be effected by review of the taxpayer's liability after the end of the year of assessment to which the subsidy payments relate.  The review for 1981-82 will take place some time after the end of that year.  Before the review takes place the full amount of subsidy for that year will have to have been received by the taxpayer from the Department of the Environment and any reduction in tax relief for that year of assessment will be effected by an appropriate reduction in the tax free allowance for 1982-83.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It amends the legislation contained in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, relating to subcontractors in the construction industry. That subsection provided that principal contractors must deduct tax at 35 per cent from payments made to subcontractors and remit that tax to the Revenue Commissioners. Such a deduction does not arise where the subcontractor holds a certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners authorising him to be paid in full and where certain other conditions are fulfilled.  This amendment is rendered necessary because it has been claimed that the obligation to deduct tax does not apply to a principal contractor such as a manufacturer of building materials because he is not a builder.  As regards payments made to subcontractors on or after the date of passing of this Act the amendment ensures that the subcontractors legislation will apply where those payments are made by a person whose business includes the manufacture, treatment or extraction of construction materials. Payments made by a person connected with a company engaged in the production of such materials or with a building company are also brought within the scope of the subcontractors' legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies, we are all familiar with small builders looking for the tax number so that they will be able to receive the money themselves and deduct their own tax rather than have the <Col N="2230" /> tax deducted from them at source by the person employing them if they are subcontractors. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the requirement to deduct at source is extended not just to include main contractors who are builders but main contractors who are builders' suppliers, and other such people, which seems to be a perfectly reasonable proposal.  I would like to raise a more general question which you, Sir, may wish to rule out of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a generous fellow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by assuming the Minister is generous.  In deciding to refuse certificates to people, the Revenue Commissioners usually apply two criteria, whether a person has his own place of business and whether or not he supplies his own material for use on site.  If he neither has his own place of business nor supplies his own material, he is considered to be, in effect, an employee of the main contractor and not a subcontractor. Hence he does not benefit from the privilege of collecting his own tax. The tax is collected from him by the main contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in regard to the provision of one's own material as a restriction is sensible.  I am not too clear why this restriction applies in regard to having one's own place of business.  Many people operate from their own homes.  It is not unreasonable that they should do so.  It is probably more economical.  I should like to inquire how the Revenue Commissioners apply this provision as far as having one's own place of business is concerned.  I also think it would be useful if a guide was published explaining more fully the basis upon which one can claim such a certificate.  I have had great difficulty in trying to find out the reasons for refusing certificates.  I received a standard letter from the Revenue Commissioners simply saying they were not going to grant a certificate in a certain case.  It is <Col N="2231" /> very hard for a TD to explain that to anyone.  There should be clearer guidelines as to when a certificate will or will not be granted and the exact conditions that need to be complied with to receive such a certificate.  I would like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will try to explain why it is necessary that there should be a fixed place of business.  As the Deputy is aware, the scheme for taxing subcontractors was enacted to cope with widespread tax evasion which was taking place arising from a situation where large numbers of workers engaged in the construction industry were changing status from employees under PAYE to subcontractors under Schedule D.  In the main, these operatives provided neither significant materials nor plant but were engaged on a labour only basis.  The old lumping arrangement was a great example.  For this reason they were extremely mobile and experience showed that it was virtually impossible to bring them into the tax net.  That, basically, is why the concept of the fixed place of business was designed to permit the issue of certificates.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's problems at constituency level.  I am not so sure that the constituent who comes to me &mdash; I will not comment on the Deputy's constituency &mdash; is always as honest as he should be, which is another problem.  I will ask the Office of the Revenue Commissioners if they will consider having some simple presentation for Members of the House and the public to show what is involved in trying to get a subcontractor's certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  If the Minister succeeds in doing that it will make our work a lot easier.  In regard to subcontractors coming from Northern Ireland and working here as subcontractors, it has been suggested, particularly in my part of the country, that southern subcontractors are having difficulty in getting work because they cannot compete with subcontractors from the North. Although there are, supposedly, fairly <Col N="2232" /> close connections between the two authorities to avoid tax evasion by people who are resident in the North receiving income in the South, it is easier for people resident in the North and working in the South to avoid paying their Northern tax than it is for people living and working in the South to avoid paying their Southern tax.  This has meant that people in the building industry, particularly in my part of the country which is relatively near to the North, have found themselves losing out by virtue of heavy competition from people coming across the Border who, it is suspected, are not complying with all the relevant requirements of the Northern tax authorities.  It is suspected that in some cases they are claiming unemployment benefit in the North while working in the South.  I took that up with the Minister in the last few days.  He wrote back saying that if I had any cases to prove this I should get in touch with him. I think the Minister was being a little native in saying that because I do not have that kind of information.  Nobody has that information.  One cannot prove, with the sort of information which is available, that people from the North are claiming unemployment benefit.  One cannot prove they are not paying their full tax. There is some suggestion they may have certain advantages over domestic people in the building trade.  I would ask the Minister to look at that and see if, in conjunction with the authorities in Northern Ireland, anything could be done to prevent any artificial advantage being given to subcontractors from Northern Ireland in competition with bona fide subcontractors from the South who are paying their full tax liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the point raised by the Deputy.  I have had correspondence on the matter from him and other Members.  The Deputy will appreciate that one of the difficulties is to establish whether a complaint is real or otherwise.  I would be very concerned if the people referred to by the Deputy were getting an unfair advantage. I appreciate the Deputy represents a county much nearer to Northern Ireland than my constituency.  When such complaints <Col N="2233" /> have been made to me I have asked for some solid evidence that could be pursued.  However, I will discuss the matter with the Revenue Commissioners. As the Deputy is aware, it is often the case that allegations are made but when investigated are shown to be without foundation.  Any concrete proof with regard to this matter would be appreciated. Unfortunately the allegations and complaints made are of a very vague nature.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that many small contractors are suffering hardship because they cannot get registered and, for example, when they do a job for a local authority tax is deducted from them at the rate of 35 per cent.  I suggest to the Minister that he or the Revenue Commissioners should issue clear rules about when a person is entitled to be registered and when he is not so entitled.  I know small contractors who have a place of business, who supply materials and who are genuine, but yet they cannot get registered.  As a result, they are deprived of their money for a long time and are suffering hardship.  I want the Minister to spell out clearly what is the position.  I want the Revenue Commissioners to issue rules and regulations that will enable the legal profession and Deputies to know when a person is regarded as a PAYE taxpayer and when he is regarded as an independent contractor who should have his profits <Col N="2235" /> assessed and taxed in the ordinary way.

      <P>The Deputy asked why the necessity for the section and I answered him.  As the Deputy is aware, the scheme was introduced on a temporary basis in 1979 and it was continued last year.  Part of the reason why it was continued last year was that it was felt that the scheme had not been long enough in operation and perhaps it had not been given adequate opportunity to get off the ground.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to why it was decided to extend it this year.  As the scheme progressed, it seemed to arouse greater usage or interest.  I was faced with a decision as to what was the right thing to do.  While not completely satisfied that it should continue indefinitely, I was satisfied on the evidence before me, particularly the evidence of the latter part of 1980, that it should continue for another year in order to monitor its progress and to give me an opportunity at budget time next year to decide whether it should go ahead on a permanent basis.</P>

      <P>This is a good scheme and it has many merits.  That is why we were arguing on Deputy O'Leary's amendment that it would be a desirable activity and would catch tax evasion.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the idea of making it a permanent feature.</P>

      <P>It seemed to take quite some time before it became known. At the end of March 1980 the number of claims received was 910.  At the end of March 1981 that figure had gone up to 5,600.  Before March 1980 it was used less and less.  It has become better known, or the interest in it increased over that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard people saying that when they go to a registered contractor, with whom they can claim the tax allowance, they are charged a price which is higher than the price they would be charged by an unregistered contractor to the extent of the relief, if the Minister follows me.  In fact, the taxpayer gets no benefit because of the higher price being charged by the registered contractor.  I do not know how we could eliminate that anomaly.  If the scheme were to become <Col N="2237" /> permanent we would need to find some way of preventing registered contractors from taking an artificial advantage of the situation.  I suppose the best way to do that would be to catch the unregistered people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister not agree that the explanation is that many of the smaller contractors are not registered, and they are not inclined to take on these jobs in case they would have to register and thereby draw the attention of the Revenue Commissioners to them? Would the Minister not also agree that it is the bigger firms who are registered and obviously they make higher charges because they have to pay management and they have other expenses which the smaller man has not got to meet?</P>
      <P>It was introduced in 1979 and apparently in the first year it did not take off very well.  It has now gone up to 5,000.  If I want a painting job done on my house or some minor repairs to the tune of a few hundred pounds, and I ask a small contractor to do the job for me, if I tell him I must get a certificate from him which I can submit to the Revenue Commissioners, he will not take the job.  That does not apply to all of them, but it applies to a great many of them.  He will disappear and that is the last I will see of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I go to the large building contractor in the town who builds churches, schools and IDA factories, he will do the job for me.  But because his overhead expenses are bigger and because he is involved in management and other expenses which the smaller man is not involved in, he will charge me considerably more.  As Deputy Bruton said, what I win on the swings I <Col N="2238" /> lose on the roundabout.  The net result is that it would be better for me to give the job to the smaller man and forget about the tax allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is really getting at&mdash;giving it to the smaller man depending on who the small man is and what rules he is breaking. I would advise any Deputy to be very careful of what kind of small man he is talking about.</P>
      <P>Interest in the scheme has increased among contractors.  It was slow in getting off the ground in 1979 in that area as well. At the end of March this year the number of registered contractors had gone over 2,000 for the first time in the lifetime of a scheme.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is asking whether you go to a small man or to a registered contractor.  The emphasis in the introduction of this scheme was on creating employment opportunities.  I want to encourage employment opportunities with registered subcontractors who are paying trade union wages, who are paying their social welfare insurance and all the other contributions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> By a small contractor I mean a contractor who may be employing nobody but himself, or a contractor who is employing one or two people.  These people find it difficult to get registered. The Minister seemed to suggest there was some sort of an onus on the householder to see to it that the man was paying income tax.  I do not think he has any such obligation.  He employs somebody to do the job.  He pays the person for doing the job and that is that.  There is no doubt that many people are not availing of this section for the reasons stated. If they go to a small man he will do the job cheaper than the large contractor to such an extent that the allowance against his income tax will not be sufficient for him to pay the large contractor instead of the small contractor.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 8 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="2239" /> SECTION 9.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is concerned with the new provisions for income averaging for full-time farmers.  It refers to income averaging for farmers over three years.  Because of the fluctuating nature of agricultural incomes from one year to the next it is more appropriate to take farm incomes over a period of three years than one year.  The farmer may be pushed up into the 60 per cent band in year one. He may not have taxable income in year two, and he may go back into the 60 per cent band in year three.  The result is he is paying more tax than he would be if he achieved all that income on the same average basis over the three years, taking the bad year into account with the two good ones.  That is a very reasonable proposal and is something that has been promised for some time.</P>
      <P>Income-averaging will apply only where the individual elects for it.  It will not be available to any farmer who, or whose spouse, is also engaged in another trade or profession.  While it is fair enough not to allow it to a taxpayer himself or herself if he or she is engaged in another profession, it seems unfair to deprive the taxpayer of the right to claim this if it is simply a case, for example, of a male farmer whose wife has a job as a part-time nurse or a teacher or a job which is less regular.  I cannot quite understand why the averaging should not be available in that situation.  If, for instance, the work of the spouse was such as to earn a very substantial income I could see the point, because the need for it would not be very great, but the case I feel badly about is where a wife takes up part-time employment outside the farm.  I do not think the fact that she has part-time employment should stop a husband claiming the provisions for income-averaging.  I should like to get more information on how this is going to work.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2240" /> Would the Minister like me to repeat the question?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, if the spouse of a farmer is engaged in another trade or profession the farmer may not claim income-averaging.  If the spouse is earning a substantial income from a full-time job, I can see the point because the need would not be as great in that case as it would in the case where the sole income coming into the house was from the farm. However, if this has the unintended effect of stopping wives from doing part-time work outside the farm, people who have been doing such work in the past, simply by virtue of the fact that if she continues her husband will not be able to claim income-averaging, it would seem to be unfair.  Does the concept of the spouse engaging in another trade or profession include part-time work in such trade or profession by the spouse?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy accepts the point where full-time employment is concerned and the danger of manipulation there.  The position of other temporary employment is covered in the arrangements that have been made.  For that reason I should like to give some background on this whole question of income-averaging.  Lengthy discussions were held between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners regarding the introduction of a suitable and acceptable scheme, because there were many areas of difficulty.  I am pleased that the farming organisations accepted this scheme as being a reasonable scheme of income-averaging which they can operate.  In fact, they were most complimentary of the approach of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where in the section is the provision which excludes from income-averaging the case where a spouse has another trade or profession? Is it included in line 28 where there is a <Col N="2241" /> reference to an individual to whom section 16 applies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer who is excluded from income-averaging is one whose spouse, in the case where the individual is a married person, is at any time during that year of assessment a director of a company carrying on a trade or profession and who is either the beneficial owner of or able, directly or through the medium of other companies or by any other means, to control more than 25 per cent of the ordinary share capital of the company.  It refers to the Finance Act, 1974.  A farmer whose spouse is in that situation is the only one excluded from income-averaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is in the explanatory memorandum.  The explanatory memorandum does not confine the exclusion to people who are directors of companies.  It states: &ldquo;Any farmer who, or whose spouse, is also engaged in another trade or profession&rdquo;.  It does not say whether that trade or profession need be carried out only on a part-time basis for the exclusion to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I said that other people were excluded, but the Deputy is now talking about part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the best thing to do is to refer the Minister to the explanatory memorandum which, in relation to section 9, states:</P>
      <P>Income-averaging will apply only where the individual farmer elects for it but it will not be available to any farmer who, or whose spouse, is also engaged in another trade or profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I accepted that that was a reasonable restriction where that trade or profession was engaged in by the farmer, or his spouse, on a full-time basis; but I am concerned that it would prevent part-time work by the spouse in a trade or profession.  Perhaps the appropriate method would be to say that income-averaging only can be availed of where <Col N="2242" /> the work by the spouse or the farmer outside the farm is not above a certain figure, say £2,000 per year.  To have a blanket statement that all work by the spouse outside the farm, regardless of how little is earned from it, will remove one from the entitlement to claim income-averaging would seem to be going too far.  Will the Minister refer me to the section in the Bill which amplifies what is contained in the explanatory memorandum in order to see how the matter is defined in the section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, that is the point. That is why I said the appropriate way of dealing with it would be to say that if the spouse or the farmer himself is working outside the home they will be able to claim income-averaging as long as their earnings from the work outside the farm do not exceed £2,000.  That would in a sense put a monetary limit on the amount they could claim from it and would effectively achieve what I want to achieve, which is to allow the wife, usually, to do a bit of part-time work.  To take an example that could be very useful, she might be doing home help for a neighbour who is sick.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is Deputy Bruton's method not the simple method of dealing with it? That is to put an income limit on it, and there are several precedents for this in the grants system that we have now.  A <Col N="2246" /> man is not deemed to be a farmer if his outside earnings are &mdash; it used to be between £3,000 and £4,000 &mdash; now £4,500.  Here you have a case of a farmer's wife who is a dressmaker making dresses for the ladies in the neighbourhood, or she is a hairdresser, as very often happens, and she is doing a spot of hairdressing in her house for the neighbours. Under the Minister's ruling that farmer would be excluded.  That is hardly reasonable.  We want to get at the lady doctor or lady solicitor who is practising her profession, but in the language that the Minister has used he is going to exclude the dressmaker, the hairdresser, and if I had time I could think up several other categories of people who are doing this sort of work to augment the family income.  The husband, even if he has a substantial farm, is going to be excluded here if he and his wife are honest or if the inspector of taxes gets to know about it through the anonymous letter from the neighbour with whom they have had a bit of a row.  The obvious thing to do is to accept Deputy Bruton's suggestion and say that the benefit of averaging shall not apply if the spouse is earning over &mdash; I would not think £2,000 a year sufficient; I would take the figure prescribed for the farm modernisation scheme which was £3,500 and now is something like £4,750.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 goes back to 1974.  No problems have been experienced under that section.  Now the same criteria are being used for income-averaging. The Deputy will appreciate that the danger in adopting or introducing an income limit at all is a danger of manipulation between the trade or profession operated by the spouse and the farming income.  It could be very difficult to control.  Furthermore, in discussions that farming leaders have had with the revenue people, which have been extensive and prolonged, the farm leaders have accepted the criteria laid down and are happy with the situation regarding income-averaging.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, a wife operating farm holidays, as is done in some of our constituencies for part of the year; her farming husband would not be excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We could go on and on.  The Deputy is trying to tell me what I should do about introducing an income limit.  I am telling him that it would be manipulated and interfered with and impossible to control.  A section exists in the 1974 Act and no problems have been experienced.  Why introduce problems now?  Prolonged discussions have taken place, and in my presence the farming leaders expressed their appreciation of the approach of the Revenue Commissioners and they have now accepted it. Why interfere with what we all know to be an extremely difficult and delicate area?  I would be absolutely afraid that the £2,000 limit or £4,000 limit or £10,000 limit or whatever it is would be manipulated by some people and it would be impossible to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much point in dragging this out.  But what I feel is a bit unfair is that the whole idea of introducing income-averaging is to ensure that people will not lose out because incomes fluctuate in farming. The case for saying that if people have another income as well as their farming income they should not get the benefit of the special averaging provision is that their income from the other source is likely to offset the fluctuations in the farming income and that therefore there is not likely to be all that much of a fluctuation in the total income.  That is fair enough so far.  But then to come <Col N="2248" /> along and say that if the income from the other source is from self-employment rather than from employment they will lose the averaging claim seems to be inconsistent.  The Minister says he is concerned with the elimination of fluctuation. But there is more likely to be fluctuation in income from self-employment by the spouse than from employment by the spouse.  Consequently I feel that the Minister is being inconsistent, and maybe in a sense over-generous, in saying what he has said.  If I was employed by a company and earning £20,000 a year I would be allowed to claim averaging.  But if I was earning £1,000 a year from doing some part-time work for someone in a professional capacity, in other words, if I was self-employed, I would not be able to claim averaging.  That seems to be unfair discrimination in favour of employed people as against self-employed people so far as claiming this is concerned.  It is particularly anomalous in view of the fact that it is fluctuation we are trying to eliminate and fluctuation is more likely to occur in self-employment than in employment.  That is the way it is, I suppose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make one point.  First of all, this criterion has been in operation and the main difference here between the self-employed person and the employed person is that the earnings of the employed person are absolute and are known and cannot be manipulated whereas the earnings of the self-employed person are not.  There is a distinct difference and this is accepted by the organisations concerned.  If this discrimination were removed we would be introducing an element that would make it impossible to control.  There have been no problems and I would ask the Deputy to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree with Deputy Bruton on the principle of this.  It is no use enacting a law in this House and saying that the inspector of taxes and the Revenue Commissioners are going to turn a blind eye to it and that it is not going to be enforced the way it is in the Act but is going to be enforced in a flexible way that will <Col N="2249" /> exclude this, that and the other.  That is bad in principle.  That is not what we are doing here.  We have no control over an Act once it leaves this House.  It means what it says and it is not going to be enacted in some friendly, kindly sort of way.  Things do not work that way.  The Minister says that this provision has been in operation since 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and it has not given any problems.  I have a feeling that there are many sleeping dogs in the files of the Revenue Commissioners all over the country because the Office of the Inspector of Taxes is under-staffed and cannot get around to doing the work.  But when some bright, young inspector of taxes takes up a file and finds out that there is a liability on him if we send this Bill out of this House as it is, there is nothing to prevent this young inspector of taxes from spending a day or two on the file and raising this hare and chasing her to a successful conclusion.  If we mean that the farmer will not be deprived of the benefit of the averaging provision, then we should spell that out in the Bill.  If the Minister says that an income limit will not work, what he is saying is that the people will not tell the truth and will not disclose the amount of the income, that they will dodge and that it is not workable. If it is not workable, it is not workable and it should not be put into the thing at all.</P>

During the past three years the IDA have approved 205 industrial projects for Galway with a job potential of 3,800 at full production.  In January last the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism announced that 12 new factories with a total area of 40,000 square feet would be constructed in Galway and on 27 April the Minister announced a new project for Clifden with a potential of 25 new jobs at full production.  The Galway county development team who are responsible for promoting indigenous small industries have a target of 350 for 1981 but they hope to exceed that target.

      <P>Drainage of the Island river which is in the river Suck catchment could be dealt with by the Commissioners of Public Works only as part of a comprehensive scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for that catchment.  At this stage it would not be possible to say when a scheme might be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The 1945 Act was specifically designed so that arterial drainage works would be carried out on a catchment basis.

      <P>It is proposed that a revised capitation grant of £13 per pupil per annum in ordinary national schools should be paid in respect of the school-year commencing 1 September 1980, subject to a local contribution of not less than £4 per pupil.

As far as the primary system is concerned, I told the House what my priorities are.  I would like also to call the attention of the House to the fact that those who study for the Batchelor of Education degree now study psychology and are in a position to advise referrals.

      <P>I regret the Minister's refusal to acknowledge the role the Department of Education can play in the registration of pre-school playgroups.  Is he aware that these playgroups can play a vital part in the education of young children, especially in underprivileged areas of our towns and cities?  Does the Minister not intend to have any system of registration of playschools or to lay down any guidelines for pre-school playgroups? It is disgraceful if that is the case.</P>

      <P>I would like to call the attention of the Deputy and the House to the fact that Ireland is virtually unique in accepting four year olds in our primary schools, where they have fully qualified primary teachers available.  Parents need have no worry about their qualifications. Unlike any of the European countries, we take them at four years of age.  There is a section on this in the White Paper, if the Deputy reads it, where I indicated that there are two schools of philosophy about the actual content of the education course at that age for pupils.  Some continental countries are very much for a structured course and others are for the learning through play idea.  Our teachers are fully <i>au fait</i> with those methods and are using a mixture of them from four years on in our primary schools.</P>

I also referred to having a re-examination undertaken of the terms of the circular <Col N="2281" /> concerning improvements in one- and two-teacher schools so as to ensure immediate sanction for necessary minor works, the simplification of procedure attached to the payment of grants and the application of the terms of the circular to all schools where essential improvements which were not of a major or structural nature had to be carried out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that informed parents or representatives of secondary schools feel that the secondary system is discriminated against in the matter of staffing or finance.</P>
      <P>In 1977 the ratio by general reference to which the number of teachers to whom incremental salary may be paid in secondary schools is calculated, was improved from one teacher to 20 pupils to one teacher to 19 pupils.  The principal, vice principal and in some categories of school a guidance teacher and a remedial teacher may be appointed outside the quota.</P>
      <P>Since 1978 the tuition grants to secondary schools have been increased on three occasions.  As from the commencement of the school-year 1981-82 the grant is being increased from £70 to £77.  The tuition grant has accordingly been increased since 1977 by 54 per cent.  The capitation grant was also increased from £30 to £32 in 1979.</P>
      <P>Additional substantial aid was given to secondary schools in 1980 through the fact that my Department assumed responsibility for the amount of the employers' contributions under the pay related social insurance scheme.  The provision in the Estimates for 1981 in respect of such charge is £4.2 million.  Since 1980 also the Department of Education recoup the full cost of substitute teachers in certain cases as against a recoupment of two-thirds of the cost in the immediately preceeding period.</P>
      <P>I may add that my objective in the apportioning of the financial resources available to me for educational purposes is to do so in such a way as to enable each type of school to fulfil its functions satisfactorily.</P>

Referring directly to his reply, is he not aware of representations made to him by the <Col N="2285" /> secretaries of secondary schools about the funding of secondary schools, especially in relation to the capitation grant in lieu of fees?  Is he aware of the representations made &mdash; I think he met them &mdash; by the Catholic School Parents' Association who were quite vociferous about discrimination against secondary schools in relation to funding and the provision of teachers?

      <P>Before the break we were discussing the averaging of farming profits and of people engaged in a trade or profession. I just want to say that the position is different in such cases from that of persons employed.  Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out activities in which spouses might be engaged in work.  I repeat that the Revenue Commissioners have had discussions with the farming organisations to try to arrive at an acceptable solution and I believe it has been achieved.  The 1974 Act has operated well and I should like to correct an impression the Deputy appeared to give to the House in regard to flexibility.  I did not refer to flexibility outside the legislation but about the flexibility the legislation gives, for instance in relation to farmhouse holidays.</P>
      <P>I would refer, for the benefit of Deputy Bruton, to the shop or store-owner who would be selling seeds, fertilisers and so forth.  I referred earlier to the possibility of manipulation in regard to the transfer of profits or in regard to prices charged.

People in employment can earn as much as they like outside the farm and can still qualify for averaging, whereas in a trade or profession one could be earning a tiny amount but cannot qualify for averaging.  That seems to me to be unfair and contrary to the intention of the averaging provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not answered one point made by both Deputy Fitzpatrick and me.  It refers to farmhouse holidays. I take it people engaged in that activity are regarded as being in a trade.  It is not an employment and there is no contract of employment.  Therefore it must be a trade or profession.  If there is flexibility which allows people who are engaged in a trade or profession for two or three <Col N="2294" /> months of the year to avail of income averaging, in cases of people engaged in farmhouse holidays, the same concession should apply to others who work for only two or three months of the year.  That would invalidate what the Minister said earlier when he said how difficult it would be to determine whether a person was working part-time, a certain number of hours per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making a similar judgment here in saying that a person providing farmhouse holidays is only working part-time for two months a year.  The Minister has to decide how many days of the year such people were open and how many guests they had to determine whether it was part or full-time trade.  I would like to know what the position is. In a sense it is an important point to establish because it applies not only in this case of income averaging but also in determining whether a person is eligible to pay income tax if he is a farmer, because a person who is engaged in a trade or profession, with a valuation of less than £40, is required to pay income tax, whereas a person engaged in employment but with a valuation of less than £40 is not obliged to pay income tax on farming profits.</P>
    <P>The same criteria apply in that case as in the case of eligibility for income averaging. What legal basis has the Minister for saying that people who provide farmhouse holidays would not lose income averaging, whereas people in other trades or professions would?</P>

      <P>There is a distinct difference between a person in employment whose income is established and which can be assessed as taxable under normal income taxation and the person engaged in a trade or profession.  The Deputy asked what legislation covers farmhouse holidays which he gave as an example and which I could not see extended to areas to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred this morning.  It is section 16 (1) (b) of the 1974 Finance Act, to which I referred this morning.  I will read the section for him:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 is concerned <Col N="2297" /> with the abolition of the resource tax for future years.  However, it is still being charged in respect of the last tax year, a year in which farmers suffered unprecedented losses.  It is inappropriate that a resource tax should be charged, much of which remains to be collected, in respect of last year.  This resource tax should not only cease in future years but the liability for it should be abolished and any moneys collected refunded to the farmers who paid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is fully aware of the discussions, both here and elsewhere, on the budget and in other debates.  He must appreciate that resource tax was charged on persons other than charities who occupied farm land with a rateable valuation of £70 or more.  The rate of tax was £3.50 per £ of rateable valuation.  The tax was intended as a top-up to the taxation of farming profits which had been regarded as inadequate. This section discontinues the resource tax and substantial progress has been made.  The Deputy referred to the past year.  I have no plans to amend the section as it is now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there was ever any need to &ldquo;top up&rdquo;, to use the Minister's words, the amount collected from farmers in income tax in perhaps the worst year in recent times for farmers as far as losses in their businesses were concerned.  To base the method of topping up on an archaic valuation system which bore and bears little relationship to the actual earning capacity of a particular farm and which has to be levied whether or not the farm made any income in that year, was a most crude and unfair system of taxation.  It bring the whole concept of taxation into disrepute if taxes which have so little relationship to any standard of equity can be introduced and become the law of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these points were made on this side of the House when the tax was being introduced.  We argued it should never have been introduced.  By abolishing it, the Minister now recognises that it should never have been introduced.  The conditions last year, in which it was introduced, <Col N="2298" /> were not such as to provide any justification for its introduction.  Therefore, the Minister should refund the money collected and say that no liability remains on farmers who have not yet paid this tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section requires incorporated businesses to pay one and a half years' tax in the immediate year coming.  It will not have any long-term effect with regard to improving the revenue position of the Government in that it will not raise the long-run yield of taxation from this or any other sector of the economy but it will cause serious liquidity problems for many businesses.  The businesses that will be most affected will not be in the manufacturing area which is already subject to a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and which has many means of reducing its tax liability through various concessions that have been made. The burden of one and a half years' tax in one year will fall mostly on the services sector of the economy, the sector that has been the most dynamic in recent years in employing more people, but the House and the Government appear to ignore the contribution that the services sector has made with regard to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure will make the work of those engaged in the services sector even more difficult.  Already they are paying the full rate of corporation tax and at that full rate they will have to pay one and a half year's tax in one year.  This year the rate of inflation is very high, as is the rate of interest.  As a consequence it is very costly to hold stocks as people who are self-employed and in business must do. This makes for serious liquidity problems and that situation is now aggravated by making them pay one and a half years' corporation tax in one year.  It is false economy.  It will not improve the revenue position of the State and is merely designed to get the sums right on paper for one year only without any lasting <Col N="2299" /> benefit.  Indeed, in the following year less tax will be available because the extra amount collected this year will not be available next year.  We will be crowding in more revenue in one year and widening the deficit in the following year.  In my view this is not the kind of action the Government should take.  It is not genuine and presents all the difficulties I have set out.  It is my view that the Minister should not introduce this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the record straight on a few points.  This section amends section 6 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in order to give effect to the decision announced in the budget, that the interval allowed to companies for payment of the second instalment of corporation tax would be shortened by three months but not so as to make the due date fall earlier than the due date for payment of the first instalment which is normally nine months from the end of the accounting period.  This change will apply to the second instalment of tax in respect of accounting periods ending on or after 6 April 1980.  For most companies affected in 1981, the revised due date will be 1 October 1981 instead of 1 January 1982, but with the existing two-months period of grace interest will not accrue if those companies pay their tax on or before 1 December 1981.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments do not increase either the rate of tax or the amount of tax payable by companies. What is involved is merely a three months advancement in the normal date of payment of the second instalment which at present can vary between nine months and 21 months after the end of a company's accounting period.  I want to emphasise that it does not increase the rate of tax or the amount of tax payable by companies&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It merely advances by three months the payment of corporation tax.  Advancing the date of payment of each second instalment by a mere three months could only have a marginal <Col N="2300" /> effect on the cash flow of companies and after the first year in which they are affected companies will be in a position to accommodate themselves to the new pattern of payments.  The present measure was foreshadowed in the second White Paper on company taxation and follows the change in dates of payment of tax for unincorporated traders which was effected last year.  An additional point is whether it is fair to ask unincorporated traders to be in a less favourable position than incorporated traders.  Companies will be in a more favourable position in that they will still pay their tax in two instalments whereas individuals in business have to pay the full tax for the year on 1 October in the year of assessment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spent some time in answering points I did not raise.  I did not say there was any increase in the rate of corporation tax; in fact, I said specifically there was not.  If there was the Minister might have some grounds for saying it would improve the revenue position of the Government.  I pointed out that because there was no increase in the rate the deficit will be reduced this year but will be widened next year.  It is purely a timing issue so far as the dates are concerned.  It will impose liquidity problems this year without making any long-term improvements in the finances of the Government.  It does not make sense.</P>

I accept that there may be an uneven spread of cost to companies and corporation but I have no doubt that some companies will be able to meet this demand out of existing resources.  I accept that in other cases in order to pay they may have to borrow for a short period &mdash; three months at the most &mdash; but the interest charged will be allowed for tax purposes.</P>

      <P>The section refers to the Employers' Temporary Subvention Fund.  The Minister is proposing to give a tax exemption to payments made from this fund.  As this is a body which disburses quite substantial sums of money, I wish to inquire if the Employers' Temporary Subvention Fund was ever statutorily established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in a different Department at the time, although I was <Col N="2302" /> deeply involved in its introduction.  The Minister for Labour played an important part in it.  I think the answer to that question is that it was not statutorily established.  The Deputy is aware of the history of that scheme.  In 1978 the Government introduced what was known as the Employment Maintenance Scheme to aid vulnerable industries.  That scheme was allowed by Brussels or by the EEC at that time.  Subsequently a date limit was set by the EEC when it would have to end because they claimed we were distorting competition as compared with the UK.  As a result, when the Employment Guarantee Fund was set up under the first national understanding a sum of money was set aside jointly by the employers and the Government for that fund.  Because of the difficulties being run into in the Government funded scheme in 1978 and 1979, arrangements were entered into by which a scheme acceptable to Brussels was instituted.  That is the history of the Employers' Temporary Subvention Fund.</P>
      <P>I am providing that payments made to employers in respect of employees out of that fund should be disregarded for tax purposes.  It is fairly evident why one would feel that should be done.  There is no doubt that those schemes helped to maintain a certain level of employment in vulnerable industries which might otherwise not have been maintained.  That fund was established formally in 1980 and provided for payments covering the period from April 1980 to December 1980.  The fund is administered by a committee representing both sides of industry. Under this scheme payments in arrears quarterly are made to employers in the clothing, footwear and textile industries in respect of insured employees. This section proposes to exempt the employers from income tax and corporation tax in respect of the payments he receives under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking not so much from the point of view of the policy involved as the parliamentary propriety. I am not happy that a fund should be set up and that money should be paid into that fund through the social insurance scheme, which is a statutory scheme with all the force of law behind it, and that the fund and its administration should not also be governed by statute.  I feel very strongly that where money is collected &mdash; quasi-taxation as this money was in that it was compulsory and the employers had to subscribe &mdash; and expended the expenditure of that quasi-taxation, if such a term is appropriate, should not take place without statutory authority laying down quite clearly the criteria on which that money should be spent and the accountability necessary for that to be done.</P>
      <P>I accept that it is sensible to exempt those payments from taxation in view of the purpose for which they are being made, but I do not accept that they should be made without due statutory authority.  This provision is giving retrospective taxation clearance for payments made from the fund without the fund itself being statutorily established.  This should not happen.  These makeshift arrangements which are made outside this House without statutory authority set a very dangerous and damaging precedent regardless of how well-intentioned they may be.</P>

The Employment Guarantee Fund was established in 1979 under the national understanding.  It was contributed to jointly by the Government and the employers, with the employers' portion coming through the social insurance system. <Col N="2304" /> Statutory authority was taken in this House for that contribution.  It had to be done that way.  I explained the history of the need for this temporary subvention fund and the way it was organised through Brussels.  That was a contribution from the Employment Guarantee Fund towards the subvention fund for specific application to the vulnerable industries I mentioned in the clothing, textile and footwear areas.

I answered several questions about the fund in this House when I was Minister for Labour. It was set up for a very good purpose.  I do not think the employers or the affected industries would welcome the Deputy's nitpicking.  The contributions through the social welfare system had to be statutorily cleared through the House. This is another effort to help industry and ensure there is not an imposition of tax on them.</P>

The exemption is granted where the work in connection with the devising of relevant patented inventions is carried out in the State.  The purpose of the provision was to encourage research and development here, a necessary thing.  The section proposes to close a loophole in section 34 which could in certain circumstances enable inventions which were developed abroad to qualify for the exemption.  If the Deputy wishes I can give him further information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (7) (b), line 14, after &ldquo;house&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;in qualifying period&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;before the commencement of the qualifying period (but in the current year)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the allowable investment as provided for in subsection (7).  In that subsection the Minister provided that:</P>
      <P>Subject to paragraph (b), where expenditure is incurred in the qualifying period on the construction of a house and before that house is used it is sold, the person who buys the house shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to have incurred in the qualifying period expenditure on the construction of the house equal to the expenditure actually incurred on the construction thereof or the relevant price paid by him for it on the sale, whichever is the lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably all this was intended to assist the construction industry.  One may differ in the opinion as to whether it will be as helpful as was suggested in the section. My amendment suggests that, if the intent is to assist the building industry, an <Col N="2307" /> industry which is in need of some extra assistance at present &mdash; it is the largest employer in the country and has been feeling the draught of the recession in a severe way &mdash; the tax advantage given in the section should be extended to the beginning of the year rather than the date set down in the Bill.  Some small firms in the building industry have a significant proportion of units on their hands at present and my amendment is intended to assist them in getting those units off their hands and into the market.</P>

      <P>I indicated in the course of the debate on Second Stage that the intention of the section was to stimulate new investment leading to new building activity and employment creation in the construction industry.  To allow past construction work to qualify would clearly be inconsistent with the overriding objective because of the work already being carried out.  New capital allowances have normally operated from a date not earlier than budget day with the result that earlier expenditure has not benefited from the allowances.  Perhaps I will be going part of the way to meet the Deputy if I tell him that I propose to introduce an amendment to the section on Report Stage which will make it clear that any expenditure related to work done in the qualifying period will qualify for relief.  Accordingly houses in the course of construction on budget day will attract a measure of relief under the section.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister talk to his construction experts when drafting the amendment for Report Stage.  I go along in principle with the idea that assistance is needed for the construction industry.  Earlier, when dealing with other sections, I put forward the view that assistance was needed by other sections of the community and there was not as much acceptability on the Minister's part, but in this case I am mainly concerned about employment.  The construction industry is one of the largest employers in the country.  There is a great amount of unemployment in that industry and it has suffered a great deal as a result of the recession.  The intent is to ensure that builders with party constructed schemes on their hands can benefit from this allowance given under this section.  The Minister indicated that if the schemes were in course of construction on budget day they would qualify.  Therefore, I take it that the criterion to be adopted is that they were in course of construction on budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a point which may be of value to the Minister in his drafting of the revised section and that is the definition of &ldquo;qualifying lease&rdquo;.  The reference here is to a lease as defined in the Income Tax Act, Part IV, chapter VI which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;lease&rdquo; includes an agreement for a lease and any tenancy, but does not include a mortgage,...</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, probably the most common form of tenancy in this city in bedsitterland is what is known as a weekly agreement which is not in fact a lease at all, as far as I know, in the accepted sense of the term.  There is no written agreement.  It is purely an agreement to let the person use the place for a week at a time and it can be terminated at any stage.  I would like to know if that form of agreement, which I am sure is rather unsatisfactory for the tenant in many cases, comes within the type of agreement which will be subject to the concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Good, that is consoling. The point I wanted to make is that there is a case at least for saying that the type of agreement to which I have referred is unsatisfactory in that the tenant has practically no rights at all.  I agree that if one goes too far in giving rights to tenants you will not have the leases at all.  Giving too much protection can be counter-productive. If it is the view of the Minister for the Environment that this type of arrangement is not satisfactory at the moment, there might be a case for saying that this concession will be available only if certain rights are given to a tenant, rights regarding the standard of repair in which the building will be maintained, or a rent book being made available where the rent is entered in and the book publicly available to various people to inspect, including perhaps, the Revenue Commissioners.  These points have been made very frequently by representatives of flat-dwellers, and there might be a case for saying that only if certain requirements are met in respect of such agreements will the concession be allowed. This would have the effect of improving the position of tenants on the one hand as well as giving a boost to the building industry which the Minister is seeking to do.  I agree that if he goes too far in putting restrictions on the thing the entire scheme will abort, but if the Minister for the Environment and himself can come to an agreement as to what is the most important additional right the tenants need in the type of situation that I have described, if he could get that installed without jeopardising the scheme and at the same time make an improvement in the position of tenants, it is an opportunity which should not be lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  He is referring to what is a delicate problem in trying to get a proper balance and full details of the scheme.  Regarding subsection (9).  I am quite prepared to debate this in committee form on Report Stage.  The subsection says:</P>
      <P>(9) A house shall not be a qualifying premises unless&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> (a) it complies with such conditions, if any, as may be determined by the Minister for the Environment from time to time for the purposes of section 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, in relation to standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services therein, and</P>
    <P>(b) it is open for inspection at all reasonable times by persons authorised by the said Minister.</P>
    <P>That may well be going far enough at this stage rather than laying down within the Bill firm lines that may be difficult to implement or may be found afterwards to be not really the correct ones.  I am not quite sure, but I draw the Deputy's attention to subsection (9), appreciating the validity of some of the points he is making.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no. Nobody who might be benefiting from this has had any part in the drafting of the section.  Secondly, yes, there have been some inquiries or expressions of <Col N="2313" /> interest.  The section provides that the expenditure incurred after budget day but before 1 April 1984 on the construction of the car parks for use by the general public will qualify for the same scale of capital allowances as that available for factory-type industrial buildings constructed for leasing to industrialists, that is, an initial allowance of 50 per cent of expenditure and an annual writing-down allowance of 4 per cent.  This special extension of capital allowances for buildings which must be constructed over the next three years and which will be wholly used for the purposes of providing off-street car parking will be an incentive to the private sector to participate in the provision of an essential amenity in our larger cities.  The Department of the Environment has indicated that both Dublin and Cork Corporations are considering the provision in their areas of multi-storey car parks and interest has been expressed by developers in participating in such schemes provided that a generous depreciation allowance for tax purposes is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference here is that it is not a capital allowance.  The allowance in relation to multi-storey car parks is a capital allowance.  This section provides for an incentive by way of relief from income tax and corporation tax for private sector investment in the provision of toll roads for or on behalf of local authorities.  The term &ldquo;toll road&rdquo; is widely defined in the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979 and includes a bridge, viaduct, subway, fly-over and so on in respect of which a toll scheme is in force.  The relief will consist of an allowance not exceeding 50 per cent of capital expenditure incurred by a person after <Col N="2314" /> budget day but before 1 April 1984 on the provision of a toll road by virtue of agreement made between that person and the road authority under section 9 of the toll road Act.  The allowance may be set off against taxable income arising under such an agreement by the person who incurred the capital expenditure. That is the difference between the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I would hope that for the type of roads, bridges, viaducts and fly-overs we are speaking about in this and for the type of construction involved, a three year period would be adequate.  The main thing is to get it started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have gone a bit further in terms of time because, while this is all right for schemes that are ready and for which CPOs have already been got by the local authority and in respect of which the local authority has a project ready to hand over to the private developer, a project which is only at the stage of being talked about or thought about will involve a lot of formalities which will take at least a year or two complete.  Consequently the road building might not start for about two years and the likelihood of it being finished in the remaining 12 months is quite small.  The Minister would have been better off to have had 1986 or 1987 as the cut-off date.  The worst type of situation is where people do not know exactly where they stand as far as tax liability is concerned and they have to reply on the Minister giving an assurance and nods and winks of one sort or another and saying that if they do find they are running out of time the period will be extended.  It would be better to extend the period at the outset rather than mess around and have to extend it by one year and then another year and take up time here.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="2315" /> to consider making the date 1986 or 1987 and be done with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose this section. This section is increasing substantially the price of petrol which is used by people going to work.  It is also increasing <Col N="2316" /> the price of diesel oil which is going to substantially increase costs in industry. As the Minister and the House are aware these measures are most regressive and will discourage people from travelling to work, they will discourage mobility in our economy and encourage people to remain at home unemployed rather than travel a distance to work, particularly in view of the provisions of our PAYE tax code where people in the PAYE category are not allowed to claim the cost of travel to work because the definition of expenses applying to PAYE people is more narrow than the definition of expenses applying to self-employed people. Travel to work is not considered to be part of the work even though it is absolutely necessary to the work.  The taxpayer therefore has to pay the full cost of travelling to work and the increases in the price of petrol introduced by the Government in this budget discourages people from travelling to work and taking up employment within our economy.  This is something that has been greeted with very serious reservations by large sections of the public and perhaps it is the one element in the budget which attracted the greatest opprobium from practically everybody in Ireland.  We all know the price of petrol has gone up enough as it is as a result of the increased prices imposed by the oil supplying countries. For our Government to come along and increase the prices even more strikes a very heavy below to the production sectors of our economy.  When accompanied by very high rates of motor insurance, it is something which should not have been introduced.  I argue strongly that this is an undesirable section and was an undesirable aspect of the budget.</P>

      <P>The general effect of the section is to increase the rate of duty on petrol, the rate of excess duty on diesel oil and the rate of duty on liquid petroleum gas or LPG.  The Deputy said that these increases were extensively criticised. I would not deny that there was some criticism, but that was the only area in the whole budget package which caused some concern.  I want to make some valid points here.  First of all, as I <Col N="2317" /> pointed out at budget time, the Minister was faced with raising a certain extra revenue to meet certain payments, the most important being the substantial increase in payments to the social welfare sector.  He looked at the whole area of indirect taxation.  The foregoing sections have covered the areas of increased taxation and this section does also.  Basically, the reason behind the imposition of extra duty there was that money was needed to meet payments to a very considerable section of our community which has not the muscle, power or lobbying capacity of other sections and for which the Government have always shown a concern.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister and his colleagues were in the predicament he has described of considering the options before them and that this was one which they in the circumstances considered they had no choice but to take.  However, the overall strategy of relying on increased indirect taxation has the unfortunate effect of increasing the consumer price index and therefore bringing greater pressure to bear, leading to increased demands and wage claims.  All these follow when one is forced into this strategy in a budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution of the increased price for petrol which is essential for getting people to work, has played its part in increasing the cost of living this year. There are many parts, not alone in rural Ireland but in Dublin city, where people going to work must provide their own transport.  The housing complexes of the city were not planned to be adjacent to work places and people living on the north side who work on the south side and <i>vice versa</i> are forced to use their own transport.  They cannot claim any allowance for this compulsory expenditure in getting to their place of work and this had led to a widespread feeling among wage earners that they are hard done by when it comes to the burden of taxation they are asked to shoulder.  The position of the self-employed, when it comes to <Col N="2318" /> deduction of their tax, is easier, because there are more deductions which can legitimately be claimed under the code. Whatever the Minister may say, he should be in no doubt that this was one of the most unpopular features of the recent budget.  It is appropriate that the House should mark its opposition to that rather mistaken policy.  I understand how it has come about, that at the end of the day the Government's housekeeping arrangements are awry.  They were forced in the circumstances to look for revenue in this very undesirable way, considering the effects that this measure has had on the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  As I have pointed out, people have to travel long distances to work owing to the historic nature of the settlement of Ireland with people spread out over very substantial areas.  In some of the poorest parts of Ireland, such as County Leitrim, the number of families with cars is proportionally larger than in many richer parts in town centres. They must have a car to live a normal life; and for these people, and those who must travel long distances to work, petrol is not a luxury.</P>
      <P>For someone resident in the centre of New York, petrol is a luxury because he or she needs to use a car very infrequently. I have heard of someone living in New York who takes his car out once a month even though he is very well off because he can do everything he wants on public transport.  That is not the case in Ireland.  For Irish people petrol is essential in many cases, both to get to work and to live a normal life.  The increased taxation imposed on petrol is a very severe burden on very many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most obscure section so far as trying to understand what it means is concerned.  There is a reference to paragraph 5(1) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 236) (Excise Duties on Motor Vehicles, Televisions and Gramophone Records) Order 1979 and various other statutory instruments.  I would like to know precisely what is the increase being levied on the excise duty on televisions, from what to what and how much revenue will be obtained as a result of that increase.  I think £600,000 is the revenue but I should like to know something about the rate of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2321" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain to the Deputy and the House that the effect of this section is to raise the excise duty on televisions with effect from 29 January 1981, by between £10 and £2, depending on the size of the screen and whether the television is colour or monochrome. For example, in the case of a colour television with a screen size of between 17 and 24 inches &mdash; that is the most popular category &mdash; the increase in the excise duty is £8.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the effect on revenue.  The resultant increase in excise revenue for the current financial year will amount to approximately £0.6 million, or in a full year to £0.7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it this will bring the maximum State tax on televisions to £89 per television set.  That is a lot of money to be collecting on a television. It is now well accepted that practically every household, even the least privileged in our community, has a television as a means of keeping in touch with the outside world.  It has become accepted as part of living in the second half of the twentieth century; it is no longer a luxury.  The State tax here of £89 per television, maximum &mdash; I know that in some cases the tax would be considerably less &mdash; is a very large impost on something considered by most people to be part of living in this era of our civilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware I did not oppose the increased taxation on tobacco, beer, spirits or wines because I feel that those are commodities not at all essential, indeed in many cases they are highly undesirable.  But televisions do not come within the same category at all and people need a television to keep in touch with what is happening in the world.  I know from my experience &mdash; and I am sure the Minister does also from canvassing and visiting homes &mdash; that even the least privileged section of our community, feel they should have a television. I feel therefore that the increase in this duty does not constitute a progressive move.  I feel the Minister should have found the money either by a further <Col N="2322" /> increase on taxation on tobacco, spirits and wines, but not in the way he is now proposing to find it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me what percentage of the retail price the various rates of duty would usually represent? I am not as familiar with the various prices of televisions but it would appear to me that the £89 duty on a <Col N="2324" /> screen with a maximum dimension which exceeds 24 inches would be somewhere in the region of 10 to 12 per cent of the price.  I should be grateful if the Minister would indicate to me, if that is so, if a similar percentage would apply in respect of the rates of duty on other types of televisions?  What is the position in regard to secondhand televisions sold through retail avenues where such a market exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to give full details of the increases on all of the various makes and sizes of sets.  The duty imposed in 1981, which was an increase of about 12 per cent on the previous level, no more than kept pace with the increase in the cost of living and the overall increase of the level of duty since its introduction, 28 per cent, compares more than favourably with the CPI increase over that period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the £2 on the up to 17-inch screens of monochrome sets and that is a very small duty impact.  The £10 on the maximum colour set is not much for people who buy these sets.  In reply to the Deputy's last query there is no excise duty on secondhand sets.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister referred to the £2 increase for the black and white television set.  The position now is that an elderly person wishing to purchase a black and white television set must pay £28 in tax to the State and in respect of another set £18.  The Minister might have left these sets alone as many elderly people living in rural Ireland have only a television for comfort or entertainment, although it is not always amusing for them to hear of the increased cost of living on these sets.</P>

      <P>Section 33(1) of the Bill would bring squashes and cordials within the scope of tablewaters duty at the general rate of £0.372 per gallon.  It is intended in clause (2)(b) of section 33(1)(a) to provide a second and higher rate of duty, £0.744 per gallon, on such concentrates exceeding three-and-a-half to one.  Various trade interests whose products border on or slightly exceed this limit have now represented that this charge could have a serious effect on their business since competing products, including imported products, which have a dilution rate of three-and-a-half to one or less would qualify for the basic rate of £0.372.  The amendment is to ensure that the normal run of squashes and cordials will become liable to the ordinary tablewaters duty.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister said that, were it not for this amendment, squashes and all the rest of it would have been brought from a category which is subject to a charge of £0.372 to a category where the charge is £0.744.  If that is right it is as near as does not matter to doubling the tax and it certainly was another shoddy performance coming immediately on top of the effort to tax black and white television sets.  I am glad that, even before the Bill becomes law, the Minister has been shamed.</P>
      <P>When we are talking about excessive drinking by young people nothing is more calculated to drive young people to drinking alcoholic drinks than to tax the non-alcoholic drinks very heavily.  That has been the tendency for some time past. Up to recently this was the type of tax which slipped through without any adverse comment.  In the interests of moderate drinking and in the interests of young people in general I am glad the Minister has introduced this amendment to ease the tax on non-alcoholic drinks. It is a pity he did not reduce the tax instead of leaving it static as it was last year.</P>

      <P>I was trying to achieve a balance between the original section and the desirability of extending the excise duty on table waters to squashes and cordials and improve the rebate scheme to assist small manufacturers. I mentioned this on budget day. The proposals in this section are designed principally to achieve those purposes by extending the present definition of table waters to include syrups or other liquors intended to be consumed wholly in a diluted form and by increasing both the rates of rebate and the quantities entitled to rebate.  As I explained, the reason for the amendment is because of the balance that has to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> The reason I shook my head when the Deputy was speaking was not a question of at any stage doubling or increasing the duty on table waters.  Because of the duty that had been imposed on table waters, this was an effort to find a balance and to ensure that concentrates, squashes and so forth were not gaining significantly at the expense of table waters.  You had to balance whether you related it to a diluted squash, a cordial or a concentrate. The original figure of £0.744, as the Deputy said, was double the duty on table waters.  It did not apply to the table waters but to squashes and cordials.  I am bringing in an amendment to the section because of the difficulty, which then became apparent, of ensuring that £0.372 is the applicable rate for the table waters and for the squashes and cordials.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The reason I asked the Minister to tell me what is involved in this is that when this was provided for in the budget the Minister and his party went to great lengths to say it was not a tax on cars, that it was a registration fee.  I cannot help noticing that the marginal note reads &ldquo;increase of excise duties on licences for mechanically propelled vehicles&rdquo;.  If that is not a tax on motor vehicles I do not know what is.  This is another part of the budget the Minister should be thoroughly ashamed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2331" /> I do not want to make a long speech at this juncture but the one thing that can be said about the 1977 manifesto is that it appeared to be simple.  It said there would not be any tax on motor cars.  That was the short formula for canvassing. Immediately Fianna Fáil got into power they imposed a tax of £5 on motor cars in the category as mentioned.  That £5 has now rocketted to £20 and this year petrol was increased by 20p a gallon and last year by 15p a gallon.  There can be no doubt that the motorist now &mdash; leaving out insurance and repairs needed because of the deplorable state of the roads and confining our attention to the tax on cars and petrol &mdash; is infinitely worse off in real terms than he was before the 1977 budget.  How the Minister can tell us that the budget he introduced a few months ago was one of the most popular ever is beyond me.  He must think the people have extremely short memories.  This is perhaps an opportune time to remind them of what happened to the motorist with a 16 hp car this year.  His tax was doubled from £10 to £20 and an additional tax of 20p a gallon was put on petrol, on top of the 15p a gallon imposed last year.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself.  The cost of keeping a car on the road has jumped by leaps and bounds because our roads are not in a fit condition to carry cars.</P>
    <P>Recently I wrote to a local authority on behalf of a young man who had been let go before Christmas on the understanding that he would be re-employed to work on the roads this year.  I got a letter from the local authority saying, in plain language, that due to lack of funds they could not re-employ that man.  That may not be directly the concern of the budget but it is an indirect concern.  The fact that that young man cannot be re-employed means our roads are worsening, the potholes are getting bigger, the damage to cars is increasing and the cost of repairing cars is increasing.  Under those circumstances, the Minister should not increase the tax on cars from £10 to £20, in defiance of the manifesto promise, <Col N="2332" /> and he should not increase the price of petrol by 20p a gallon.  These points are very relevant to this shameful proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an increase in registration fees and for the purposes of this Bill excise duties cover both registration fees and motor vehicle duties. There is no question of restoring road tax.  If road tax was still in force on the same basis which applied at the time it was removed, and at the same rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The attempt by the Minister to describe this excise duty as a fee and not motor tax is deceptive in the extreme.  The normal practice is to describe money collected by the State as a fee rather than as a tax when the amount collected covers the cost of the service provided.  The service provided in this case is that of ensuring that cars on the road are properly insured and are registered as being entitled to travel on our roads.</P>
      <P>The position here is that the cost of administering this service, namely motor vehicle registration, comes to less than £2 million.  The money being collected in fees to cover that is £13.5 million, leaving approximately £11 million profit.  Profits of that nature &mdash; something in the region of 600 per cent &mdash; qualify to be described as a tax, and not as a fee.  If it was a fee the revenue would cover only the cost of administering motor vehicle registration. It does far more than that and therefore this is a motor tax and nothing else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is arises as a consequence of the increase in registration fees from £10 to £20.  Section 1(2)(b) of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, as amended by the Finance Act, 1980, provides that only licences costing more than £10 per annum can be taken out for a period of three months, six months or 12 months.  Thus the registration fee of £10 on cars of 16 h.p. or under was payable on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to continue that arrangement in respect of the new £20 rate it is necessary to provide that only duties greater than £20 per annum qualify for quarterly or half-yearly payment. Because of the considerable administrative costs involved, it would not be justified to provide for the payment of a registration fee of £20 per annum on a quarterly or half-yearly basis. In any case, an annual payment of £20 could hardly be regarded as unreasonable in 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give notice that I intend to raise on Report Stage a question in regard to the collection of value-added tax on imports.  The present method of collection of VAT on imports gives an unfair advantage to imported products over domestically produced products.  In the furniture industry VAT is not collected on imported furniture until it is sold to the consumer and that may be 18 months or more after it is first displayed in the shop.  On the other hand, in the case of domestically produced furniture VAT must be paid by the retailer as soon as he buys it from the manufacturer or wholesaler.  This means there can be a difference of up to 18 months in the payment date between imported furniture and domestically produced furniture. Having regard to the high rate of interest prevailing, this gives a distinct incentive to retailers to stock imported furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not apply only to furniture but to any major item that is likely to be in stock for a considerable time.  Obviously large items such as furniture tend to have a relatively slow turnover.  The way VAT is collected creates this artificial discrimination against Irish goods in favour of imported goods.  It is my opinion that a change should be made in this area.  I put forward the case with particular force in view of circumstances in my <Col N="2339" /> constituency where we rely heavily on the furniture and furnishings industry as a means of livelihood for people in Navan and other parts of County Meath.</P>
    <P>I shall put forward an amendment on Report Stage to change the method of collection of VAT on imports to ensure that the tax is collected when the goods are imported, whether it be off the ship or in a lorry coming across the Border, to ensure that the same method of collection will apply as in the case of domestically produced furniture and other items.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> My constituency is also affected in the way set out by Deputy Bruton.  I believe that Counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan produce most of the home-manufactured furniture.  Because of the method of collection of VAT in respect of imported furniture, the importers are at a decided advantage over the home manufacturers.  If the Minister is serious about preserving jobs and creating more employment he will make the necessary change.  This, is not the first time this matter has been raised with the Minister and his predecessor.  I have raised the matter with them in written representations and by way of statements in this House.  It is an intolerable imposition on Irish furniture manufacturers.  They are doing a very good job but we are discriminating against them.  I should like to seek the guidance of the Chair on whether I am in order in dealing with VAT on services under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the points made by Deputies Bruton and Fitzpatrick.  Deputy Bruton has said he will raise the matter on Report Stage and I will discuss it with him then.  Before the House goes on to discuss all kinds of other matters, perhaps I should inform the House what the section proposes.  It is a relieving provision.  It extends to certain structures of the prefabricated type <Col N="2340" /> the benefit of the 3 per cent effective rate which applies to ordinary building work. The section is intended to removed doubts as to whether some structures constructed on land are within the meaning of building work as normally understood and is, accordingly, giving retrospective effect to the commencement of VAT on 1 November 1972.  The provision confirms what has largely been the existing practice since 1972.  Therefore, it will not involve any appreciable cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received strong representations to the effect that agricultural contractors should be allowed to use the lower rate of VAT which is applicable to the building trade, namely, 3 per cent rather than the 10 per cent which applies generally.  Would the Minister consider the position in regard to machinery services and land drainage?  Certainly land drainage is analogous to construction work.  Would he consider applying the 3 per cent rate in those cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I receive representations from all groups for a reduction in VAT.  There must be revenue to the State.  Revenue must be collected through various taxes.  What we are trying to do here is to remove a doubt. This is a relieving provision.  What we are now confirming has been largely the practice since 1972.  For that reason it is completely different from any other sector or group.  We are removing a doubt as to whether there is a difference between prefabricated buildings and ordinary straightforward buildings work.  I do not think I would be justified in bringing any other group under this section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to give notice of my intention to raise another matter on Report Stage.  This is the correct time to do that. Part III deals with value-added tax.  In section 38 &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; is defined as the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  I take it that is the Act which deals entirely with value-added tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows another small but rather important group are in trouble <Col N="2341" /> with value-added tax.  A number of traditional Irish circus families who have been operating here for generations now find themselves under severe pressure from foreign circuses who come here and operate on terms which are unfavourable to our native circuses.  A number of Irish circus families provide a very valuable, attractive and healthy form of recreation for young and not so young people.  I had occasion to go to a circus a few Sundays ago.  It is the first one I was at for many years.  I enjoyed myself and I participated&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Foreign circuses come here for a short season.  We have no effective way of collecting VAT from them.  They leave without paying VAT.  Therefore they can operate on much more favourable terms than Irish circuses.  If these people are coming here for a short time they should have to deposit a certain amount of money as security for the payment of VAT before they leave.  If they leave without paying VAT, there is no way in which we can follow them across the water and collect it from them because foreign courts will not assist other countries to collect their revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason why we cannot change the law to make sure that people who have no fixed abode here and who come here for a short time and incur a liability for tax are obliged to give security for the payment of VAT.  I will be seeking to draft such an amendment for Report Stage.  The Minister seems to be in quite a good humour today.  He would facilitate me very much if he would have such an <Col N="2342" /> amendment drafted and bring it in himself on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not discrimination against the Irish manufacturer in the collection of VAT as outlined by Deputy Bruton?  The Irish manufacturer, because of his input locally, pays VAT as he buys in his raw material as against the importer who is zero-rated.  We have all had representations from the groups operating Irish circuses.  They made a very good case as to how they are being discriminated against.  There is an anomaly which the Minister might look at to see if it can be rectified.  Foreign circuses come here during the peak period and they operate to the detriment of the Irish circus families.  I would ask the Minister to see if it is possible to rectify that anomaly on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Irish operators are at a great disadvantage. They are zero-rated on the essentials which they cannot purchase locally.  That is somewhat contradictory to the point we are trying to make.  There is a list of essential imported items on which it is to our advantage to have a zero-rating as against items which are imported but can be supplied locally.  The Minister might look at that aspect which has been the source of very constructive lobbying of Members on all sides of the House.</P>

Deputies will appreciate that we are straying far from the section.  I will also be prepared to discuss Deputy Lawlor's point with him on Report Stage.  I do not think the VAT system favours the situation to which he refers.  I would be inclined to think the position would be the reverse. Deputy Fitzpatrick said the Minister was in good humour.  As he knows, the Minister is always in good humour.  That is par for the course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seeks to treat grandchildren as children in respect of certain marriage settlements.  There is nothing objectionable about the proposal, but what is objectionable is that the Government have not made any move this year to revise upwards the <Col N="2344" /> thresholds or the bands for capital acquisition tax.  There is no doubt that if the assurance given by the previous Government that every three years the bands and the thresholds for this tax would be revised upwards in line with inflation had been honoured in full by the Government we would have had fewer problems with this tax than we have.  The Minister may say that the number of farmers who pay this tax &mdash; I am speaking about farmers who are worried about this matter &mdash; is not significant in terms of the total number of farmers in the country but I should like to point out that a substantial number of cases have not been settled.  It takes a long time for those cases to be settled as far as determining the value of the estate, the Schedule under which the payment should be made and so forth.</P>
      <P>We do not realise how much fear has been engendered amongst the farming community about the financial consequences of transferring their property, in life or in death, to their offspring as is usually the case.  The fact that this tax exists in the way it does without the thresholds being revised upwards in line with inflation in full is progressively discouraging the transfer of lands to younger members of the families by older members. The Minister should have made substantial increases in the thresholds and bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree with what Deputy Bruton has said about the need to increase the thresholds.  When this measure was introduced an assurance was given by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, and by myself when I stood in for him on a number of occasions, that the threshold would be revised every three years to have regard to inflation.  The threshold for a child was fixed at either £125,000 or £150,000.  The Government since the revision was due in 1978 have refused point blank to increase the threshold in so far as a child is concerned.  As a result transactions are now being made subject to capital acquisitions tax which was never intended to attract that tax.  There can be no doubt about that.  If the Minister revised the threshold in 1978, and <Col N="2345" /> again this year, to take account of inflation it would be over £300,000.  The Government have adopted a very unfair attitude. They changed the capital gains tax because experience showed it was working harshly a bit and it is likely that that was done because of pressure from some of the friends of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government have refused point blank to interfere with this tax and I am calling on them to honour the undertaking given that the threshold would be revised upwards to ensure fair play. There is an oversight in the original provision which works out as an absurdity.  If a parent transferred property to a child there was a generous threshold if it had been revised upwards &mdash; it was certainly more than £100,000. If, as sometimes happens, that child dies while the parent is still alive and the property passes back to the parent there is some miserable threshold which means that the parent must pay huge capital acquisitions tax.  That was never intended but I am sure those who drafted the Bill did not anticipate that a child would be transferring very valuable property to a parent.  I am aware of at least one case where the parent transferred to the child, the child died at about 40 years of age while the parent was still alive and that child did not make a will.  The property went back to the parent but the parent was saddled with a very substantial capital acquisitions tax.  I checked that and I am satisfied it is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1979 the price of land has fallen.  The threshold for farmers increased last year with the increase in agricultural relief.  The farmer's sons' threshold is now £300,000.  Only 20 farmers have been liable to the tax since 1975. Wealth tax was abolished.  There is a genuine necessity to introduce a relief in respect of certain marriage settlements where anomalies were found to be the case, and this is the reason for this amendment.  It has been pressed for some time because of the difficulties that were found, particularly in some areas of the country.  For Deputy Fitzpatrick to stand up on that relieving section and make the points he did is carrying it very far.</P>
      <P>The position is that settlements made in some parts of the country meant that the eventual grandchild or the issue of a particular marriage was, one could say, discriminated against because of the type of will that has been made.  This section is merely a simple one intended to end that anomaly and to let that issue have the same entitlement as if the asset had been passed down through the normal channels, through direct line of descent.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If the Minister thinks it is not causing any problem he should have a chat with the IFA and the farmers' organisations, because this is giving grave concern. The last time the Minister stood up I understood him to say that the threshold for a child was now £200,000.  I knew that that was not so and that threshold had never been changed in spite of an undertaking given by Deputy Ryan and by me. If the Minister wants to talk about all the things that were done for farmers he could talk about resource tax, about the agricultural relief grant being reduced in respect of those farmers and about several other things, but they are not relevant on this.  I would like also to have the Minister'a views on the tax payable when there is an involuntary transfer from child to parent, where the child, having got the property, is killed or dies and the property goes back to the parent.  The parent has to pay huge tax that never was intended.  It is a mistake, an oversight in the drafting of the Act, and I would like to have the Minister's views on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will get facts rather than views.  It is obvious that over the last hour-and-a-half in this House we have strayed from the Finance Bill. The performance of the Opposition today showed absolute lack of interest in the bones of this year's Finance Bill simply because their interests were guided in another direction.  The last hour-and-a -half are absolute proof that all Deputy Fitzpatrick is interested in is trying to make points that are not at all relevant to the Bill.  Let me put the record straight and give him some of the facts.  I referred to the White Paper <i>Capital Taxation 1974</i> issued during his time in Government.  I will read the relevant paragraph: his <Col N="2348" /> memory might be short but that of the people is not.  The paragraph says:</P>
      <P>Review of thresholds.</P>
      <P>122.  The Government recognise that, in time of inflation, capital taxes may over time be taking a bite of capital which represents an increase in nominal values as distinct from a real increase in asset values.  To cope with this problem, the thresholds set for the new capital taxes would need to be reviewed at regular intervals; such review would, however, be less necessary in the case of the threshold for liability to capital acquisitions tax by the immediate family in view of the high exemption figure proposed.  As regards the proposed capital gains tax it should be noted that allowances is already being made for the inflation factor...</P>
      <P>That is factual, but what Deputy Fitzpatrick is trying to get across in this House this evening is that there was a Government who did something.  I say to him that the Irish people's memory is much longer than his.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is no doubt that the Minister is now quoting from the White Paper.  The White Paper was introduced as a White Paper, a discussion paper, not like the multi-coloured papers that have been introduced by this Government.  A White Paper is a discussion paper and that was introduced before the Bill was introduced.  I am talking about the discussion in this House while the Bill was going through and I am talking about the response to the debate from the other side of the House in regard to recommendations made by farming organisations and others and solemn assurances given in this House that the threshold would be increased in respect of children in order to have regard to inflation.  The Minister will not even make good the error that crept into the Bill under which the parent is liable for huge taxes.  What the Minister was reading was a discussion paper and it is not relevant.</P>

      <P>What is the revenue which will be derived from the increase in the stamp duty on cheques?  In the interest of security there should be greater encouragement for people to use cheques rather than cash as a means of payment.  Therefore any increase in the duty on cheques is not desirable from that point of view. We should try to reduce the number of cash transactions in our community and substitute non-cash transactions for them.  An increase in the stamp duty on cheques is therefore a retrograde step and I would ask the Minister if he would consult with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on this matter because I am sure that the commissioner will bear out what I am saying about the desirability of moving towards non-cash money transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This increase has been in operation since May 1980.  The Deputy has asked some questions.  I will give him the history of the rates of duty on bills and notes.  I agree with the points he makes about the necessity for or desirability of payment by cheque and so forth.  The increase was from 1p to 3p. Let me give the Deputy the history and significance here.  When this was first imposed in 1891 it was one old penny; in 1918 it was 2d; in 1961 it was 3d.  When decimalisation was introduced in 1971 it was 1p or 2.5d.  When one looks at this in 1971 as against 3p today, it is indeed defensible.  It is in operation since May of last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked me about receipts and the net receipts of stamp duty under the head of bills of exchange or promissory notes, which comprises in the main duty on cheques for the year 1980 at about £2.20 million.</P>

People can use these Diner's cards &mdash; I do not know what the generic term for them is &mdash; instead of paying by cheque.  I think everybody knows what I mean when I refer to Diner's cards.  To have one method bearing a revenue-generating stamp duty and the other not would seem to be anomalous.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Administration of Department of Social Welfare: Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Tully on 5 May 1981:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
    <P>deploring the chaos which has <Col N="2352" /> arisen in the Department of Social Welfare in respect of the payment of, and applications for, benefit and assistance;</P>
    <P>recognising the totally inadequate level of staff and facilities in the Department; and</P>
    <P>having regard to the unprecedented level of unemployment in the economy,</P>
    <P>calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to resign forthwith in view of his failure, despite repeated requests, to manage his Department efficiently, and calls on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to provide all the resources necessary to enable the Department to discharge its responsibilities fully and humanely towards those who are the most socially and financially vulnerable in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Never, since the foundation of this State, has the Department of Social Welfare been in such disarray.  Virtually every Deputy &mdash; and I speak from conversations I have had &mdash; whether that Deputy be a member of the Labour Party, of Fine Gael or, indeed, a backbench member of Fianna Fáil, is unanimous in criticism of the manner in which payments are being made to recipients of social welfare benefits, but particularly <Col N="2353" /> disability benefits.  It is not without significance that on 8 December last the then Junior Minister in the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Nolan, felt it necessary to write to Deputies and Senators and I quote from his letter:</P>
      <P>With reference to your representation regarding delays in the payment of social welfare benefits, including disability benefits, I wish to let you know that I have again, at the request of the Minister, personally inspected the work of the section of the Department dealing with these benefits, in order to ascertain the cause of any delays.  I examined the post coming into the section and studied the manner in which medical certificates, claims, etc. were being handled.  As a result of my examination, I am satisfied that the very large backlog of work resulting from last year's postal dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>There, we had the Minister telling us that the delay was caused by the postal dispute.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and its aftermath has been cleared.  Consequently, the staff are now in a position to deal with all claims immediately on arrival in this Department.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that on 8 December 1980 the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare felt it necessary, as a result of all the complaints which were made &mdash; I suppose mostly by members of his own party, because he has paid little attention to any representations from me or from any Member on this side of the House, &mdash; but he wished to allay the fears and anxiety on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; to send a circular letter to all Members of this House.  I will not quote the letter completely, because it is out of Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales, but the Minister did say in the first page:</P>
      <P>Consequently, the staff are now in a position to deal with all claims immediately on arrival in this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How wrong he was.  The crisis did not start until January.  I have had the experience of going to the public offices in this city and talking to people queueing outside <Col N="2354" /> these offices waiting for sickness benefit. I have in my pocket a letter from one young woman whom I met on such a visit complaining that from the month of November her husband has not been paid sickness benefit, despite the fact that this is the first time he has ever been unemployed. It so happens that that young woman was brought up in England, of Irish parents, married to an Irish husband. She compares the system, and cannot help but do so, as it operates in the United Kingdom with the system here in what she would term the country of her parents.  There is no defence for the present situation.  The Minister for Social Welfare stands indicted.  He is a very friendly type of person and I am not saying anything against him personally, but he has his priorities all wrong.  He believes that being in public life is a matter of publicity, of getting one's photograph in the front page or even on the inside page of the national newspapers, that public relations is 85 or 90 per cent of public life.  Those are the priorities which I see in the present Minister for Social Welfare and this reflects in his performance as Minister.</P>
    <P>Never before, in the 20 years I have been in this House, have I had so many consistent complaints from people appealing to me, asking how they are expected to provide for their wives and children or their sick husbands.  It is an appalling disgrace.  Words fail me in my criticism.  I have had the frustration of trying to communicate with the Department of Social Welfare and being told by civil servants, who are acting in good faith and are trying to be helpful, that they are unable to tell when a payment will be made.  These applicants are not paupers, they are not going with cap in hand or begging bowl.  These are people in long-term employment whose cards have been stamped, who have been paying their PRSI and who are entitled to these benefits. They should not have to go cap in hand to a public representative or anyone else, begging.  There is no reason in this modern age why, in the week in which a person becomes sick and sends in a medical certificate to that effect, the disability benefit or sickness benefit could not be <Col N="2355" /> paid and it is inexcusable if it has not been paid within a fortnight.  I will not accept any explanation from the Government that because of the switch-over from the old system of insurance to PRSI delays have been caused and that these delays have now been overcome.  The Junior Minister in the Department of Social Welfare had not though of that excuse before Christmas.  His explanation was that the delays were a result of the postal strike.</P>
    <P>There should be enough initiative on the part of the Government and the Cabinet, if it was necessary to switch to the new PRSI system, to have had a cross-check from one number to another.  The excuse being offered by the Department that claims cannot be processed unless both numbers are given with the medical certificate is lame and unacceptable.  It may have some bearing on the situation in some cases, but Deputy Tully told us last night of certificates being sent with both numbers and of the applicants being told a week or two later that there would be a delay because the numbers had not been given.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to appear to be too critical of officials of the Department.  I know they are labouring under great stress.  I have deliberately refrained from making inquiries in the public offices in County Donegal because to do so would be to embarrass friends who do not wish to become involved in a political row.  However, if they were asked to give an honest explanation for the situation, I am sure they would agree with what I am saying. Their difficulty is the problem of communicating with head office in Dublin by reason of the telephones at head office not being answered.  Instead of going to my local offices I go to head office here on behalf of those who are seeking the payments to which they are entitled.  The staff at head office are very apologetic and say that all they can do is to take in medical certificates and give receipts for them.  I might add that these receipts consist of plain pieces of paper with a note to the effect that the medical certificate has been received and bearing the names and addresses of the applicants <Col N="2356" /> and the date of which the certificate was received.</P>
    <P>There is no excuse for this situation other than the incompetence on the part of the Minister, but this incompetence did not start with him.  His predecessor, the Taoiseach, while in opposition promised that the delays in social welfare payments would be reduced on Fianna Fáil's return to office and at that time he criticised the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, for delays of two and three weeks.  Now there are delays of up to six months.  People living on the breadline are not able to get the moneys to which they are entitled.  If I were in that category I would be out on the streets protesting and bringing with me as many people as possible, because when the elected representatives fail to listen to the voice of reason, fail to listen to the voice of those who are in need, the only resort is to street politics.  The sooner the Government understand that they are playing with dynamite, the better for all concerned.  When people become very angry they can express that anger in a manner that may not be orthodox but in a manner which may have to be listened to, as has been the case in other parts of the world and, indeed, in other parts of this country.</P>
    <P>Because the Minister is such a pleasant and likeable person I am reluctant to be too critical of him, but he stands condemned in the light of the situation in the Department because never before has there been such failure in that area as is the case now.  In response to the Labour Party motion last evening the Minister tabled an amendment which, paraphrased, might have read: &ldquo;Look what I have done.  I have given increases of 25 per cent to the long-term social welfare beneficiaries and a 20 per cent increase to those in receipt of short-term payments&rdquo;. He could be compared to the little boy on television who invites us to see how many Smarties he has.  However, what the Minister did not say was that at a time of an inflation rate of 21 per cent, while social welfare recipients may have more money in their pockets, the value of that money has decreased and that families are finding it much more difficult <Col N="2357" /> to live on social welfare payments this year than was the case last year.  What, then, is the real value of the increases in terms of purchasing power?</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect there is this problem of long delays in payments.  Last week a man in Buncrana told me that, despite my having been notified to the effect that the old age pension he had applied for in November last had been paid &mdash; information that was given to me also in reply to a parliamentary question &mdash; he has not yet been issued with his pension book.  What kind of administration is this?  It is inexcusable and the only remedy is for the Minister to resign. Apparently he is interested only in the health side of his responsibility.  Most of us believed that, although some delay would result from the switch to PRSI numbers, those delays would be minimal, but we cannot be expected to go on accepting this change as an excuse for these continuous and lengthy delays.</P>
    <P>If these delays have been caused is it the fault of the civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare, the people now almost at the point of resigning, who found it necessary to tell their colleagues in other sections of the Department: we will not answer the telephone because you are annoying us; we cannot get this system operating correctly because we are being annoyed.  What do they do?  They pull down the shutters, lock the doors and remain inside and will only answer mail, or, in response to an inquiry from the Minister's office, give some information.  Whenever before did civil servants seal themselves off from the general public particularly in the Department of Social Welfare?  Whenever before did people in the public service &mdash; a service recognised as being a social necessity in a modern society in which those earning can help those who are not, those who are healthy can help the sick, whereby a whole system is built up within society catering for the needs of the weaker sections &mdash; whenever before did ordinary people who have dedicated their lives to the service of the public in the Department of Social Welfare seal themselves off?  It was not for a simple reason they took such extreme measures.  We <Col N="2358" /> know the reasons.  We know there is far too much political meddling in that Department.  We know that the Minister in his constituency forces decisions, forces results, at the expense of the people living in County Donegal.  And we know that there is bickering in the backbenches of the Fianna Fáil Party from rural Deputies who experience the same frustrations I do.  But they can go to their Minister who can lay down the red carpet so that all stations go.  Even at that the results are not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I want to protest in the strongest possible manner at this attitude of the Government. They are more concerned about keeping files clean, about keeping the desks clear, keeping the books right than they are about paying pensions and benefits to people in great need.  Those are their priorities &mdash; keep the books right, balance the sheets, but do not pay out more money than is necessary; slow it down.  And this is not happening only in the Department of Social Welfare.  I met an official of the Department of Agriculture in County Donegal in the last week who is known to be a Fianna Fáil Party supporter, an honourable man, even though he has never given me a vote in his life.  He told me he was disgusted with the senior officers in the Department of Agriculture whom he could not now trust on their word on the telephone.  If he speaks to them one day about an issue he is told one story and the following day is told another.  He concluded that the only reason for it is that there is no money available out of which to pay grants, which is why they are stalling.  The same thing is happening in the Department of Social Welfare.  Would it not be an honourable thing for them to admit that? Would it not be an honourable thing for them to say: &ldquo;We have failed.  Let us go to the country.  Let us get a new mandate. Let us ask the people for their adjudication on our performance over the last four years.&rdquo;  I know that, if some of the people who have approached me in their anger could express that in votes the present Fianna Fáil Government would not receive many votes from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister contends that the change in the system from the insurance number <Col N="2359" /> to the RSI number is the cause of the delay.  I categorically refute that claim.  It is just total incompetence on the one hand and lack of proper planning on the other.  I am told that the staff in the Department of Social Welfare cannot cope with the work, that they cannot cope with the rate at which applications are coming in.  I am told there are a number of files missing, that they are somewhere in the Department, they are not lost.  But that is like the young lad on the ship whom the captain sent for a bucket of water.  When he was pulling the bucket out of the water the rope broke.  He came back and the captain asked him: &ldquo;Did you lose the bucket?&rdquo;&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is overboard.&rdquo;  To which the captain replied: &ldquo;You lost it?&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is not lost when you know where it is.&rdquo;  That amounts to the same explanation being advanced in the Department of Social Welfare.  When one asks for a file they will say: &ldquo;No, it is not lost, it is here in the Department in the office somewhere.&rdquo;  But they cannot put their finger on it and that is the cause of the delay.</P>
    <P>In the 20 years in which I have been a Member of this House never before have I encountered the criticism being meted out to the present Minister for Social Welfare from constituents.  Never before have I witnessed such downright indifference on the part of a Minister to the payments necessary to keep people alive. It is grossly unfair.  The Minister may contend that it happened before he assumed that office.  If it did, what he is saying then is that it is not his fault but that of his predecessor, the present Taoiseach &mdash; and I do not rule that out either because the previous Minister for Social Welfare, before he became Taoiseach, promised to do away with the delays in the Department of Social Welfare.  That is one of the other promises not being kept.  The present Minister is responsible and the bucks stops there.  It is of no consolation to me or to the people who come to my home or telephone or write to me seeking payments months overdue to be told that this is all occasioned by the change of system.  They are not interested. <Col N="2360" /> All they are interested in is receiving their payments punctually each week, payments to which they are justly entitled. It is unjust and unfair on the part of the Minister and the Government not to make these benefits payable.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister last evening. I thought it a very weak performance on his part not to reject the charges made by Deputy Tully, not to explain that Deputy Tully was wrong, but more or less to accept the criticism Deputy Tully was making as being valid and fair.  His only answer was: look at the increases we gave in the budget.  Those increases were necessary. It was a sign of weakness on the part of the Minister that the only comment he had in defence of himself was to point to the increases in the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Hussey) Thomas Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte and, yesterday evening, Deputy Tully, have been loud in their criticism of the way social welfare payments are being made.  I have a very clear recollection, as a Deputy in this House during the period 1973 to 1977, when Fine Gael and Labour were in Government, of the many delays that obtained at that time, delays which to my mind were far greater than they are today.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the attack being made on the Minister for Social Welfare. I have a feeling that the main reason for this motion is an effort by the Opposition to make cheap political capital out of the plight of the weaker sections of our community. But the people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits need have no fear whatsoever of a Fianna Fáil Government because our record in this area is impeccable.  Any benefits to which those people are entitled will be paid and paid in full.  I can guarantee the Opposition that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding to the main part of my reply I should like to refute the charge made by Deputy Harte that the Minister forces results in his constituency at the expense of others.  I should like to refute this on behalf of the Minister because I know it is not true.  Deputy Harte should not have made that charge because nobody knows better than he that the <Col N="2361" /> Minister for Social Welfare administers all these schemes in a fair and honest way and would not stoop to that kind of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I refute that charge. Indeed, I think the Deputy should withdraw those remarks.  Last evening before the Minister moved the adjournment, he had set out in some detail the record of his achievements since he became Minister for Social Welfare.  The charge being made in the original motion before the House is that the Minister has not been discharging his responsibilities in relation to the administration of his Department. The Minister refuted this charge by showing conclusively that the Department have been and are functioning well and providing a high level of service to the public.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that the overall amount of money being spent by the Department this year will be about £1,100 million and this includes for the second year in succession increases of 20 per cent in short-term benefits and 25 per cent in long-term benefits &mdash; the highest increases ever given in the history of the State.  Some 540,000 people each week benefit from these payments and in addition about 440,000 families each month are paid children's allowances.</P>
      <P>The most frequent complaints being made related to the disability benefit scheme.  When we look closely at what is happening in relation to this scheme and in particular at the number of persons being paid and at the amounts being paid we can clearly see that the position is not what it has been made out to be.</P>
      <P>Let us look once more at the figures of disability benefit payments.  The total amounts of flat-rate and pay-related benefits made by the Department in a recent six week period were of the following order:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Week ending 27 February &mdash; £2.3 million involving approx.  72,000 persons; Week ending 6 March &mdash; £2.4 million involving approx. 72,000 persons; <Col N="2362" /> Week ending 14 March &mdash; £2.7 million involving approx.  71,000 persons; Week ending 21 March &mdash; £2.5 million involving approx.  72,000 persons; Week ending 28 March &mdash; £2.6 million involving approx.  72,000 persons; Week ending 4 April &mdash; £2.8 million involving approx.  73,000 persons.</P>
    <P>I am quoting these figures so that the House may see clearly that persons claiming sickness benefit are in fact being paid the moneys to which they are entitled. The figures of expenditure prove conclusively that the Department are neither holding back payments nor is there a shortage of money &mdash; a charge made by Deputy Tully.</P>
    <P>The new schemes and improvements to existing schemes mentioned by the Minister speak for themselves.  They resulted in worthwhile benefits for the most deserving sections of our society. Among those benefiting were old age and blind pensioners, disabled persons, orphans, working mothers, the unemployed both young and old.  These people not alone benefited from improvements in direct payments but also from various other measures introduced to meet their particular needs.  Examples are the national fuel scheme, the special Christmas bonus and the extension to the free travel and free telephone rental schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned last evening some of the plans that he has undertaken for further development of the Department and their services.  These include proposals for the National Pension Plan and for removing discriminations which still remain against women in the social welfare code.  He also mentioned developments which would improve the administrative capacity of the Department to deal with the expansion of their services in the time ahead.</P>
    <P>If the accusations in the original motion before this House were true it would not have been possible for the Minister to put before us the record of achievements which he has accomplished in the short space of time since becoming Minister for Social Welfare.  If account is taken of the dependent spouses and children <Col N="2363" /> of beneficiaries, many thousands of people benefit on a regular basis from the services provided by the Department. These are large numbers of witnesses who can testify to the fact that the Department are actively fulfilling their role.</P>
    <P>Admittedly there have been problems in the disability benefit area, but despite these problems the incontrovertible fact is that we have been paying more than 70,000 people this benefit each week and the payments represent more than £2½ million each week on average.  In the present year total expenditure on disability benefit is expected to be about £132 million. These are large amounts of money indeed paid out regularly in respect of one benefit only.  Factors such as these simply cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The details I have given of the huge amount of money being regularly paid out by the Department must surely satisfy the House that the allegations made by Deputy Harte that there was a shortage of money are completely without any foundation whatever.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I would also like to refer to some of the problems raised in the debate.  In relation to the changeover to the new system of numbering from January 1981, judging by the contributions which have been made concerning the change made in the Department at the beginning of the year there still appears to be a degree of misunderstanding of what happened.  It would, therefore, be useful if I were to explain in somewhat more detail exactly what the changes were, the problems which have arisen and how the situation is being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I would like straightaway to dispel the notion which Deputy Tully appears to have that the Department suddenly opted at the beginning of this year for a new system of calculating entitlements and that this system was brought in without adequate consideration on the spur of the moment.  In fact what happened at the beginning of this year was simply the final stage of a process which had begun much earlier.</P>
    <P>A computer system was first introduced <Col N="2364" /> in the Department in 1973 for the payment of flat-rate disability benefits. This system was extended from April 1974 to cater for the payment also of the new pay-related benefit.  This began the process of relating benefit entitlements to earnings.  The next step was the relating of social insurance contributions to earnings. From the social point of view this is a much fairer system.  The lower paid worker pays less than he would have to pay under a flat-rate system and the higher paid worker paid according to his earnings.  Such a system would also be essential to form a basis for further developments, such as the proposed National Pension Scheme.</P>
    <P>In April 1979 the old system of collection by means of stamped insurance cards ceased and contributions have since then been collected by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with PAYE income tax.  As a result of the operation of this system men and women now have the same contribution year which is in fact the income tax year which, when it becomes familiar, will make the whole system more readily understandable. As a result both men and women now also have the same benefit year which practically coincides with the calendar year.  To put it more simply, in general a person, man or woman, claiming benefit in a particular calendar year &mdash; say, for example, this year of 1981 &mdash; knows that his or her contributions in the last complete income tax year before 1981, namely, 1979-80, determines the level of entitlement to benefit and that the earnings in that income tax year determine the level of pay-related benefits.</P>
    <P>The changes that took place from January last were therefore not something decided on the spur of the moment but rather the final step in a chain of events. From January entitlement to benefits arose for the first time from the first year of the new PRSI contributions collected during the first year of that system in the tax year 1979-80.  As the PRSI system was computerised at the Revenue end it was essential that it be dealt with by a compatible computer system at the Department of Social Welfare end.  The computer <Col N="2365" /> system in the Department of Social Welfare was therefore expanded to accept the insurance records from Revenue and in fact the insurance records for the insured population in 1979-80 are now fully computerised.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of this operation was that both the social insurance number and the PAYE number, or RSI number as it is now called, is needed to fully identify a person's insurance record. New entrants to social insurance are being given an RSI number only so that the need for two numbers does not arise in their case and the need will accordingly gradually diminish.  However, for the remainder both numbers are required at present.</P>
    <P>As the Minister explained last night, certain problems arose in that a large number of claims and medical certificates were received in the Department at the beginning of this year that did not contain both insurance numbers despite large scale publicity requesting all the Department's claimants to quote both numbers. In fact at that time as many as 25 per cent to 30 per cent of claims were not properly completed.  This led to delays in a number of cases as the staff had to link the claims with the correct insurance records or to link second and subsequent medical certificates to the original claims.  Cross-index facilities on the computer system linking the old and the new insurance numbers was a considerable help in identifying most claims but nevertheless any extra work involved leads to delays which, if they occur in a sufficiently large number of claims, will have adverse effects throughout the whole disability benefit system.</P>
    <P>Due to the publicity campaign the number of claims being received without the correct numbers has been reduced to the region of 10 per cent and this improvement has had a marked effect on the speed of processing claims.  As there will always be persons who for one reason or another will not quote their numbers correctly, it will not be possible to do away with this problem entirely, but I am hopeful of even further improvements in the situation.</P>
    <P>As regards the control of payments, <Col N="2366" /> prosecutions and legal proceedings it should not be forgotten that in administering the many schemes for which they are responsible the Department of Social Welfare have very definite legal responsibilities to ensure that adequate control procedures are effectively implemented. Unfortunately we will always have a certain number of fraudulent claims and claims from persons who are wrongly convinced that they are entitled to benefits when in fact they are not.  This means that each individual claim must be carefully scrutinised and where there are doubts inquiries must be made whether they be directed at the claimant, his employer or other relevant source. Sometimes the need for these inquiries and the consequent delays which they bring about in dealing with the claims in question are not appreciated.  Because of this it may help if I were to explain at least in outline what can be involved in these inquiries and the reasons behind them.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to benefit under the various schemes operated by the Department is not left to the discretion of the staff of the Department or even to the discretion of the Minister.  It is based on statutory conditions laid down by the Houses of the Oireachtas and they can be found in the recent Consolidated Social Welfare Act.  The staff of the Department are legally obliged to ensure in each case of a claim for benefit that those statutory conditions are properly fulfilled.  For example, has the claimant the required number of social insurance contributions; is he genuinely incapacitated if claiming disability benefit; is he genuinely unemployed and seeking work if claiming unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>If there are doubts about any of these matters they must be investigated and claims where the conditions are not satisfied must be rejected.  Furthermore in many instances the claims of persons currently receiving payments have to be reviewed to ensure that they continue to be entitled.  To ensure this certain claimants are sent for examination by the Department's medical referees.  Others are sometimes asked to show what efforts they have made to get work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2367" /> Cases where fraudulent claiming is suspected are, of course, vigorously pursued both to recover moneys overpaid and, where there is sufficient evidence of a criminal offence, to bring the person to court.  The vast majority of overpayment cases do not necessarily call for prosecution but it is of interest to note that last year, for example, over 100 cases of fraudulent claiming were prosecuted in the courts.  Many more are in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>The Department are also involved in ensuring that employers, too, are meeting their obligation in recording and paying social insurance contributions.  The Department's inspectorate carry out regular and systematic surveys of employers to ensure that they are deducting and paying over the correct amount of contributions. Since April 1979 the necessary follow-up action against employers who do not comply with the regulations governing the collection of contributions is taken by the Revenue Commissioners. Up to mid-April of this year proceedings had been ordered by the Commissioners against 816 employers who had failed to submit their end-of-year returns for 1979-80, the year which governs entitlement to benefit since 5 January 1981.  I understand, too, that at present there are over 300 similar prosecutions against employers awaiting hearing.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters for two reasons. My primary motive is to bring home the fact that the staff of the Department have a wide range of duties to perform in addition to simply making out payments. This, as I mentioned, is a factor which is often not appreciated, particularly when the control procedures inevitably give rise to delays.  The second reason is to answer the question raised by Deputy Tully yesterday evening regarding what is being done about employers who do not comply with the requirements of the PRSI system.  As can be gathered from what I have said, both my Department and the Revenue Commissioners undertake continuous action in this area and action of a very vigorous nature up to prosecuting large numbers of persons in court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> Over and above all this I would also like to mention that, even if a minority of employers fail to pay the contributions due and even if we fail ever to recover the amounts involved, the worker will not be at a loss.  There is power in social welfare legislation to deem such contributions to have been paid provided we are satisfied they are properly due and no blame can be attributed to the worker. This power is frequently exercised but, first of all, inquiries must be made so that the Department can be satisfied about the bona fides of each particular case.  All this takes time and the Department are often blamed for delays for which they are not responsible.  In cases where contributions are deemed to have been paid and as a result benefit is also paid, the responsibility still rests with the employer to pay the contributions and all possible action is taken to recover the amount due, including legal proceedings if this becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the facilities, accommodation and staff numbers, this was mentioned.  We know that as the services of the Department have expanded, additional facilities have also been provided. Additional accommodation has been acquired over the years in modern buildings such as those in D'Olier House, Oisin House, Marlboro House, Town-send Street and Gandon House.  The extra space in these buildings was acquired to provide for the accommodation of extra staff required to implement-new schemes or expansions of existing schemes and to improve the accommodation available for the staff generally. Additional accommodation has been acquired in Gandon House and will shortly be available.  This extra space will be used specifically to facilitate the assignment of extra staff to the sections dealing with disability benefit claims.  In addition, part of Gandon House has already been fitted out as a public office which will increase considerably the facilities available to the public to make inquiries about the various schemes operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>With a view to improving still further the facilities available to the public to <Col N="2369" /> deal with their claims for unemployment benefit payments, new employment exchanges are being provided in the Dublin area in Dún Laoghaire, Navan Road and Thomas Street.  Plans are already being made for the provision of extra exchanges in Ballyfermot, Blanchardstown, Coolock, Finglas and Tallaght which will considerably ease the burden on claimants who must at present travel to centre-city exchanges.</P>
    <P>I have set out the position in the Department of Social Welfare quite clearly and have shown that progress is being made there.  In spite of the huge increase in the number of claims being made, the Minister, the staff and myself are actively pursuing those claims which are being paid with the least possible delay.  As I said, inevitably delays will take place for which neither the officials nor the Minister can be blamed.  Over the past few months Opposition Deputies in particular have been very vocal in their criticism.  They have been working hard, maybe because there is an election in the air, canvassing for those problems.</P>

      <P>In some cases Deputies are even more irresponsible than the general public when submitting their inquiries because they fail to quote the numbers which are so necessary to deal expeditiously with the claims.  Today I had 28 representations from a Deputy and he did not give any number.  This is the type of thing that is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>An Opposition Deputy of course.  I have dealt with the major issues raised in the debate in so far as I could do so in the time allowed to me.  The information which both the Minister and I have given in our contributions to the debate, in my opinion, clearly shows that the accusations made in the original motion cannot be sustained.  I confidently appeal to the House for its support by accepting the amendment to the motion which the Minister tabled last evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject this <Col N="2370" /> amendment.  I want to say a few words in support of the motion.  This motion is about people who have not been paid, not about those who were paid.  We seem to hear more about the people who are being paid.  There can be no excuse for the volume of chaos that exists in the Department over the past five months.  It appears that every effort is being made to perfect a system of collecting workers' contributions and to perfect a system to avoid abuse&mdash;I am not against perfecting that system &mdash; but it appears no effort has been made to perfect the system of paying benefits.  The contributions by the Minister and his Minister of State indicate that this is the case.  Last night the Minister spoke about the steps that have been taken since the chaos was created. He spoke about the former employees of the disability benefit section who were brought back to the Department.  It is obvious that this motion which condemns the Minister is correct because he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that this confusion, with the resulting hardship suffered by thousands of people, did not happen.</P>
      <P>I would go so far as to look for an inquiry into the circumstances of the changeover to the computer system.  In no way should this changeover have caused, directly of indirectly, such hardship. I have been 20 years in this House and have been dealing with social welfare problems.  During that time never have I had to deal with the volume of social welfare problems I have received over the last five months.  It was never necessary for me to put down parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister of State that I did not go canvassing for these problems; they came to me at all hours of the day and night.  Those unfortunate people had to pay for phone calls, stamps and petrol when they came to see me and other TDs.  These people were out of pocket trying to get someone to help them get what they were entitled to.  It is only when every effort fails that I put down a parliamentary question.  At present I must have 20 to 30 cases of nonpayment in the Department and if I do not get some results within the next few <Col N="2371" /> days I will have to convert them to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>I do not send in queries without insurance or RSI numbers.  Admittedly I sent in a few cases without RSI numbers because the people concerned did not get their RSI numbers from the Department, but all had insurance numbers.  The Minister should not generalise.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the most needy section of the community.  These people are usually out of work because of illness. Illness can create a sudden crisis and these people save to cover themselves during their illnesses through contributions to our social welfare system.  This is money saved for the proverbial rainy day. When that rainy day comes, by way of sickness or unemployment, all kinds of obstacles are put in their way before they can get their money.</P>
    <P>Some of the people I am talking about fill in many forms and get the same forms each week.  Some of them have filled in these forms five or six times but they do not get any cheques.  I tell them I made representations to the Department on their behalf and they tell me they got more forms.  I get in touch with the Department again, and they get another form but no cheque.</P>
    <P>It appears that records have been lost in the Department.  The Minister will have to make a clear statement on this position.  Have the Department got the record of the people who have paid insurance down the years?  When filling in their forms some people have to go to their employers and former employers to get their insurance record, but when they fill in forms and send them to the Department, they are likely to get the same form back within a week or two asking for the same information.</P>
    <P>I will cite a case to illustrate the chaos that exists.  A person has not sent in a certificate for weeks but still gets his payment cheques from the Department. That is unusual &mdash; it is usually the other way around.  This disorder in the department has put an extra burden on the health boards.  Were it not for the supplementary welfare scheme administered by them I hate to think of the degree of <Col N="2372" /> suffering of the many unfortunate people waiting for their just benefits.  We can thank Deputy Cluskey, the Parliamentary Secretary in the National Coalition, and the then Minister, Deputy Corish, for that scheme.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any doubt about the work being done by the health board superintendent community officers and the community officers he should check with those officers, who will give him a clear picture of the hardship and near starvation inflicted on people because of the Minister's failure to operate the Department as it should be operated. Health board staffs have been diverted from the work they should be doing. Some health boards are owed hundreds of thousands of pounds by the Department who have failed to pay benefits, particularly disability and unemployment benefits.  Community welfare officers, who have heavy responsibilities to the underprivileged, are being diverted from their important work while doing all sorts of accounts.  There has been massive loss of money by the health boards arising from the chaotic conditions in the Department.</P>
    <P>I know cases of persons called for examination by a medical referee months after they had sent in the final certificates, on the basis that they were still getting benefits.  When people who have not got medical cards go to their doctors it costs them £4 to get certificates.  In many cases they have to repeat their visits in order to get the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister devoted much of his speech to a description of his achievements since he took office and said &ldquo;actions speak louder than words&rdquo;. Indeed they do.  His achievements are very small compared with those of the man he tried to criticise, Deputy Cluskey. During Deputy Cluskey's term in office the extent and value of new schemes introduced are too numerous to give here.  The Minister tried to take credit for some of those schemes.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Minister said the Government were paying social welfare increases in April from the January <Col N="2373" /> budget.  It was the National Coalition who introduced that.  Up to then social welfare recipients had to wait until July, and sometimes later, before getting increases given in the budget.  The Minister spoke of the 25 per cent and the 20 per cent increases in this year's budget and boasted about the double week Christmas bonus.  Does he not remember that all this was part of the National Understanding, squeezed out of the Government by the ICTU in negotiations, sometimes lasting far into the night?  The Government did not want to concede these increases: they came after protracted ICTU pressure in the negotiations. Unfortunately the ICTU did not foresee the terrible upward trend in inflation and consequently in the cost of living. If congress had foreseen this trend, widows would not be depending on a mere ten per cent in allowances for their children.  Because of the 20 per cent increase in the cost of living social welfare recipients are much worse off than last year.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that people in rural areas suffer most from the chaos in the Department.  Claimants for unemployment benefit must send their files to the Department and have to wait for weeks. In Kilkenny and the surrounding area there is a population of about 20,000. When the social welfare agent there retired he was not replaced and the people are at a severe disadvantage.  When people with only 52 stamps run out of benefit they are kept waiting for three or four weeks.  Then they get a letter from the Department telling them why they are out of benefit.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister failed to mention that in the Finance Bill last year the Government tried vigorously to bring social welfare payments into the income tax net.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the motion some action will be taken by the Department to relieve the hardships being suffered by the social welfare classes.  If not, I will be tabling 20 or 30 parliamentary questions next week.  I will do it only as a last resort, only if the Minister, even at this late stage, fails to take immediate action to ensure that people who are <Col N="2374" /> entitled to benefits will get them when they apply for them.  The present situation cannot be tolerated any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my seventh time in the last 18 months speaking here on delays in social welfare payments.  The Minister has heard these complaints but has chosen to ignore them.  On 8 December 1980 Deputies and Senators were informed by circular that there would not be problems any longer, that the postal strike had been settled and the backlog had been cleared.  We were told the staff were in a position to deal with all claims on arrival in the Department.  The truth is that the problem is still with us to a very large extent.  People are waiting weeks and weeks for money for their bread and butter and they are not getting it.  Last week I met a man with 11 children who had not received payment for six weeks.  I would like a Minister to live on nothing and to feed 11 children for six weeks with no money.  Surely this is an inefficient system.  The Minister, Deputy Hussey, said there were no complaints in County Galway.  That is hard to believe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <P>When people are coming to your door every day with social welfare problems, the least you can do is raise your voice in Dáil Éireann.  Voices are raised every week but the Minister chooses to ignore them.  I spoke in Irish on the subject last time, hoping the Minister might understand Irish as he did not seem to understand English.  It made no difference.  This social welfare problem is a national disgrace.  We live in what is supposedly a Christian country.  When you see people all around you getting <Col N="2375" /> nothing every week it is hard to believe it is a Christian country.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hussey went on to explain the PRSI system.  We are all aware of that system and the contributions which people make, without choice, to pay for the system.  He said that £22.8 million was spent on disability benefit for 73,000 people. We are here to talk about the people who got nothing.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this serious and sad problem.  I hope this question will never have to be raised in the Dáil again. One only has to look at the Order Paper to realise that the problem has not been solved.  Yesterday I got an answer to Question No. 15.  I would not put down a Dáil question except as a last resort.  I have to put down a Dáil question when I cannot get satisfaction anywhere.  When the Dáil adjourned for Easter, I rang the Department of Social Welfare and lodged complaints.  Last week people told me they still had not received payments. It appears the only way that Deputies can get a satisfactory reply is through a Dáil question.  I appeal to the Minister and to all the members of his party to see that the problem is solved once and for all.  It is a sad state of affairs which has not improved at all in the last year and a half.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is slow in being paid.  It is totally unjust that young people under 18 cannot receive unemployment benefit.  It is also unjust that people over 18 are assessed on the means of the household, with their parents, brothers and sisters.  I would like the Minister for Social Welfare to introduce legislation to ensure that young people will get unemployment benefit as individuals and will not be assessed on their parents' income.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister is not here for this debate in so far as it calls for his resignation.  The motion tabled by the Parliamentary Labour Party calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to resign forthwith in view of his failure, despite repeated requests, to manage his Department efficiently.  As a last resort the Minister has been called upon in this House to resign because all other means at the disposal of Members <Col N="2376" /> of this House have been tried to no avail. He said:</P>
      <P>I have given the House some indication of my achievements during the short time since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare.  I have outlined the on-going activities of the Department as well as some of my plans for the future.  I am sure the House will agree that this is an impressive record and bears a more than favourable comparison with anything that can be put forward by occupants of the benches opposite.  I confidently appeal to the House to give me its support and confidence so that I can carry on with the good work.</P>
      <P>One of the Members of the House is a psychiatrist.  I am sure he would, without hesitation, in his professional capacity clearly state that the man who stood up in the House in the face of the record of that Department since he took office is an egomaniac.  There is no other explanation for it.  He is also Minister for Health.  There must be a medical term for someone who cannot resist a camera, who, when he sees a camera, must jump towards it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>He seems to be far more reluctant to come into this House when his Department and his competence to run that Department is being questioned by the members of this House than he is to leap in front of a television camera or any other sort of camera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that brought about the tabling of this motion was the failure of the Minister to ensure that people got their lawful rights and were paid what they were legally entitled to.  What does the Minister do in reply?  Not only does he engage in megalomania by giving us <Col N="2377" /> his alleged achievements, but he misleads the House.  He claims credit for things he did not do.  He did not acknowledge what he did.  In fairness to him, he should get full credit for those.  Amongst his alleged achievements was the Consolidation Bill. I left the Consolidation Bill on his desk in 1977.  Of course he probably had not been in his office until last year.  That is why he did not find it there and put it to the House.  That was done by a special committee.  It took the Minister or his predecessor three years to even discover it was there.  The Minister claims credit for a double week.  Deputy Pattison has already pointed out that the double week was part of the negotiations of the national understanding.  He did not tell us that his Government abolished the twice-yearly payments which were established under the previous Government and continued by them until Fianna Fáil came into office and abolished it.  He did not tell us about the annihiliation of the poverty committee to which he paid more attention than any other aspect of the work in his Department.  He did not get around to telling us those things.  What he did tell us was the number of people who were paid social welfare &mdash; a figure of one million payments per week was given.  Of course, that is the case.  The figures have not substantially increased during the years although I agree there have been some fluctuations.  We are talking about normal payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied the the postal strike was a factor in the breakdown of payments.  We all know that strike was disastrous but how long ago was that?  He claims also that people do not give their correct numbers.  That has always been a problem to some extent but it does not in any way explain the total collapse of payment of disability benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to staff difficulties. Is there any precedent for a Minister, as the political head of a Department, as the person elected and then appointed by this House to be responsible for the administration of the Department, to stand up in this House and try to shift his responsibility onto the staff?  I know the staff of that Department. I had the honour of working with <Col N="2378" /> them.  They are not responsible for what has happened.  The workings of the Department did not collapse when I was there.  The same people administered the schemes.  The only thing different about the staff in the present situation and the staff when I was there is that they are demoralised by the Minister.  As I said, he is a person who is more interested in his photograph than in his work.  He has no interest in the Department.  He has the staff driven up the wall by making opportunist statements about alleged schemes to be introduced even though people in the Department have never heard of them.  He is a political opportunist and that has been his first priority since he occupied his ministerial post.</P>
    <P>That may be fair enough but not when the result is that literally tens of thousands of people have gone without an income for months.  As we are debating the incompetence and the unsuitability of the Minister to hold office, there are still tens of thousands of families who are not getting their legal entitlements because of lack of interest on the part of the Minister.  He is too busy making political capital and he is totally uninterested in the responsibilities placed on him.</P>
    <P>No one comes into this House and lightly makes these charges against any other Member or against any Minister.  I should like to make the following point. I do not know when Deputy Kenneally came into the House &mdash; at any rate it was a very short while ago.  There has not been any Fianna Fáil backbencher in the House to try to defend the Minister.  Last night the Minister made a feeble attempt at it; he attempted a &ldquo;snow&rdquo; job.  The Minister of State was sent into the House this evening to speak in this debate.  I asked Deputy Pattison if the Minister of State was using the same script as was used here last night by the Minister because it was almost verbatim.  There were a few minor changes but one would have to search for them.  The same &ldquo;snow&rdquo; job was attempted.  Where are the Fianna Fáil backbenchers?  Are they in this House to show their solidarity and support for the amendment put down in the Minister's name?  We know they will have to troop through the lobby to vote <Col N="2379" /> for the amendment but they have signalled quite clearly what they think of the Minister for Social Welfare and who can blame them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil backbenchers are not coming into this House willingly to support the following amendment which was put down by the Minister. The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann affirms its confidence in the Minister for Social Welfare, expresses appreciation of the improvements he has made by way of substantial increases in social welfare payments as well as the extension and improvement of existing services, the introduction of new schemes and the action he has taken to modernise the administration of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder they have not come into the House to support that nonsense?  Like us, they are meeting their constituents every day and they are hearing heartrending stories of how people have to wait 14 weeks even though they have submitted certificates and yet have not received even one payment.  Because of cutbacks in the health boards, these people do not get even the supplementary welfare allowance to help them keep body and soul together.  That is what we have got from the political opportunist who occupies the position of Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the Department of Social Welfare when computerisation was introduced. Switching to a computer system is a very tricky business.  For months prior to its introduction &mdash; and the officials sitting beside the Minister know this to <Col N="2380" /> be true &mdash; I had the Secretary of the Department and senior officials in my office almost daily to ensure there would be no disruption in payment of benefits and I had a guarantee there would be no disruption during the transition.  The Minister did not meet the officials every day to find out the situation.  It is indisputable that the Minister is very seldom in his office.  One of the difficulties the staff have is to find the Minister to get him to sign important letters and to make important decisions that have been postponed and postponed and postponed again because they cannot find the Minister. He is too busy being photographed or singing songs.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that one of the discs on the computer system was lost and before the system was put into operation the original files were destroyed?  Is that not the real reason why people have not been paid &mdash; even though it did not figure in the Minister's statement.  Further, is it not true that over a period of years people's records were put on micro-film and that because it was neglected and stored in a damp room they cannot be used?  Is not the real reason that, due to the gross incompetence of the Minister, tens of thousands of families have not been paid over a period of months?  Is that not the real reason?</P>

    <P>A site purchased some years ago for an automatic telephone exchange in Athenry was found to be unsuitable due to developments which came to light after the site had been acquired.  Eight alternative sites were considered.  Of these, four were found to be unsuitable and three were not available.  The remaining site, comprising 33 square perches, which was ideally situated being adjacent to the existing exchange, was purchased.  It <Col N="2289" /> would be contrary to practice to disclose the price paid for it.</P>

Payment was refused after 6 October 1980 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the decision disallowing payment and in that connection was again examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>The claim was then referred to an appeals officer who decided that he was not incapable of work during the period 6 October 1980 to 22 December 1980, the date of the latest medical certificate before him at that time.  In the meantime he had been in receipt of unemployment benefit from 7 October 1980 to 1 April 1981.</P>
      <P>He again submitted medical evidence from 2 April 1981 but payment of disability benefit was not authorised pending a further examination by a medical referee. The examination has been arranged for 14 May 1981 and when the result is received his claim will be reviewed.</P>
