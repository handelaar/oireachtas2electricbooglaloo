      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total annual rent paid by his Department and each semi-State body under the aegis of his Department in the city of Dublin for office accommodation; the rent per square foot for each office per annum; the length of time to the next rent review; and the property company or landlord to whom the rent is paid.</P>

      <P>My Department do not rent office accommodation.  The renting of office accommodation by the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for the day-to-day administration of the bodies concerned and is not a matter for which I have statutory responsibility.</P>

      <P>I put similar questions to other Ministers, as the Taoiseach is aware, and I should like to know if the Taoiseach is in a position to clarify if (a) the same degree of responsibility attaches to each Government Department and (b) if any Government Minister has responsibility <Col N="1652" /> in relation to the rental of office space by semi-State bodies?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are five Irish circus families besides this one trying to make a living out of a population of 4,500,000?  Does he not consider that the families who have given great entertainment to the Irish people deserve some subsidy from the Government?  Will the Taoiseach recommend that to the Arts Council?</P>

      <P>The question is only concerned with the Arts Council, the body for which I have particular responsibility. As the Deputy is aware, they are independent in the administration of their funds and it would be a matter for them to consider this in their own jurisdiction. I can tell the Deputy that this matter is under consideration in a number of Departments that have an interest in it.  Perhaps we will be able to bring something forward to be of assistance.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that I am very sympathetic to this group of people, many of whom I know well.  They provide a very important public service and have done so over the years.  They provide good employment and are very much a part of the life of our people.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I take it that the Taoiseach agrees that that form of Irish culture would suffer grieviously if those circus families were to be squeezed out of existence and prevented from touring the country.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the Arts Council are of the opinion that, in order to render some of the assistance mentioned in the seven point plan put forward by Mr. Fossett, an amendment of the law would be necessary?  If that is so, I should like to know if the Taoiseach will take steps to have the law amended?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan),</i>
        <b>Mr. M. Cosgrave</b> and <b>Mr. Kelly</b> asked the Taoiseach (a) the procedures under which the Attorney General or the Government select and assign legal representatives to groups of individuals at a Tribunal of Inquiry; and (b) whether such procedures were ever employed prior to 14 February 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures under which legal representation may be selected or assigned at a tribunal or inquiry must depend upon the circumstances which required the setting up of the tribunal and the nature of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To help to relieve the anxieties of those who were injured in the Stardust fire and the next-of-kin of those who died, the Government decided that full legal representation, without cost, should be made available by the State for all those concerned who wanted such legal representation at the inquiry.  The Government were advised by the Attorney General that it would be inappropriate for him or for the Chief State Solicitor to represent the next-of-kin or injured at the inquiry.  The Government considered that it would be wasteful of time and effort to have a multiplicity of representation of a common interest at the Tribunal. Accordingly, it was decided to <Col N="1655" /> appoint two solicitors which would have the effect of limiting the numbers involved and at the same time offer a choice to the families concerned.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General had informal discussions with members of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and as a result put forward certain names as being suitable to represent those who would wish to have legal aid before the Tribunal without liability as to costs.  It was decided to appoint Michael E. Hanahoe &amp; Co., Solicitors, as having general local knowledge.  The Government also decided to appoint Mrs. Maura Bates, Solicitor, of the Coolock Law Centre, because the law centre was geographically suitable and the centre was actively involved with a great number of cases concerning people in the area affected by the tragedy.  In deference to the wishes of a committee representing a number of the families concerned, the Government have now agreed to provide for the costs of one further legal team, namely, Liam T. Lysaght, Dockrell, Shields &amp; Farrell, Solicitors, of 51-52 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, with counsel.</P>
    <P>The Solicitors chose their own counsel.</P>
    <P>The undertaking given by the Government to pay the costs of legal representation in connection with the inquiry does not extend to the costs of any subsequent actions.</P>
    <P>Free legal representation of this kind has not been provided at any other similar tribunal and therefore there were no set procedures to be followed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that there is no legal power for the Government, whether through the Attorney General or otherwise, to engage legal representation for groups of individuals, however sad or deserving their situation may be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General would have the capacity to carry a charge of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government not aware that the Attorney General's Vote can be applied only to the objects which are defined by law as being the Attorney General's functions and that those functions do not include the engagement of counsel or solicitor either for private individuals or for groups of private individuals? Therefore, any expenditure purported to be imposed on that Vote for such purpose would be illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware but I would have to take into consideration the views of the former Attorney General on that matter.  I will seek further advice and if necessary I will presume that the matter may be dealt with by way of Supplementary Estimate or of some other mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it be admitted, then, that so far as the Government are aware there is no legal power to confer this benefit, a benefit with which we on this side of the House are in complete agreement? Were the next-of-kin of the victims informed that there was no legal power to do what we have heard is being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was not adverted to.  The Government's concern primarily was to provide this service for the families concerned as expeditiously as possible.  Until the Deputy raised the matter here now, I had assumed that the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General would be adequate to carry this charge but I am not at this stage accepting that the Government have no legal power to pay these costs.  However, I will seek further advice on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; why, since it is anticipated that the Vote for the Attorney General will carry the legal expenditure <Col N="1657" /> involved, he has told the Government that it would be inappropriate for him or for the Chief State Solicitor to have any part of engaging the legal representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Attorney General's advice and my understanding of the basis of that advice is that he has a responsibility to place the facts and the general situation before the tribunal and that in that situation it would be more appropriate for the families concerned to be independently represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point put forward by the Deputy was made by the representatives and I am informed and assured by the committee who are now in being and who are representing the relatives that the addition of this latter firm will render the situation completely satisfactory from their point of view.  They have assured me personally on this.  The Deputy will be aware that there are now three firms of solicitors available to the relatives. Each of those firms will have a separate team of counsel, both junior and senior. Therefore, there will be a fairly strong representation on the relatives side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Taoiseach aware of the long-standing practice whereby when a solicitor and counsel are assigned to an accused person in the criminal courts &mdash; I know this case is different but the principle is the same &mdash; the person concerned contacts a solicitor who contacts counsel? The solicitor and counsel then attend court and say whether they are prepared to act for the accused.  They are then assigned to the accused person as the solicitor and counsel selected by himself. Would not this have been a much better procedure to have adopted in the present case?  It would have engendered more confidence in justice being done and in being seen to be done.  With the exception of the firm of Lysaght, Dockrell, Shields and Farrell, the other two firms are regarded by the relatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;as having been assigned to them as Government counsel.  Would the Taoiseach agree that this may lead to a lack of confidence among the relatives in this regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a number of points and I shall deal with the last one first.  The difficulty was that there were more than 300 families <Col N="1659" /> involved and this meant that the normal process of consultation with them was not really available to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable difference between relatives of victims being represented at a tribunal and a criminal trial.  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government's intention was to provide a service for the relatives and to provide that service on the most acceptable basis possible.  The two persons chosen were chosen entirely and exclusively on that basis.  The Community Law Centre were already very much in contact with a number of the families concerned in the normal course of their work and the Government were satisfied that this group would be entirely acceptable to the local families.  The other firm were selected entirely on the basis of their general familarity with the area and their knowledge of it, but when it was drawn to our attention by the committee which has now been formed that they felt that they were entitled to some selection of their own, the Government acceded to that point of view and have added the firm selected by them to the panel.  All in all, the Government have done everything possible to ensure that the relatives do have satisfactory legal representation at the tribunal.  I want again to point out that in other tribunals this service was not made available by the State to the relatives concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Were there any reservations of any nature expressed by the relatives committee as to the two original solicitors appointed?  Would the Taoiseach not agree with me that, as was indicated a moment ago, with over 300 <Col N="1660" /> families involved that would mean one solicitor trying to deal with over 100 cases not all the same but with considerable differences in many of the cases, and that that representation would appear to be totally inadequate?  Would the Government review the situation as to the number and also the form of selection of solicitors appointed on behalf of the relatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, no reservations at all were expressed by the relatives or their committee.  Their point of view was that they would have wished a firm that they would select not necessarily to represent them but to be available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to reply to Deputy Cluskey's second point.  The point is that there is a commonality of interests between all the relatives and therefore it would be undesirable that the tribunal would be overcrowded and overburdened with representation. There will be a lot of senior and junior counsel there already and it was felt that the three separate teams, both of solicitor and counsel, would be satisfactory from the point of view of the relatives concerned and I am assured very positively that that is now the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept in retrospect that it would have been wiser to have consulted with the relatives on the representation before making any appointments?  Would he accept the assurance from this side of the House that, if the former Attorney General proves correct in his assertion that in fact the Government are proposing to act beyond their legal powers, the fullest support will be given by this side of the House to any vote or change in the law <Col N="1661" /> necessary to facilitate the representation being provided?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that offer and will gladly avail of it should the need arise.  However, as of now I am not accepting that there will be any need for any additional powers of action by the Government to discharge these costs.</P>
      <P>On the question of consultation I think the House will understand that it just was not possible.  We were anxious to set up the tribunal as quickly as possible and that it should meet as quickly as possible. and in the time available, if the relatives were to be represented at the first meeting of the tribunal, it was necessary to act very quickly.  We did that and I am quite satisfied that the two firms of solicitors selected, particularly the Community Law Centre and the other firm, were totally acceptable to the relatives and the community.  But the issue which subsequently arose and which we are now dealing with very fairly was the question of the relatives, or a substantial number of them, being entitled to nominate somebody for themselves, by themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in the outturn on the capital expenditure allocated to the transport sector is attributable to a shortfall in the expenditure by the air companies and CIE.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the air companies' capital programme in 1980 was £21.35 million.  The actual outturn was £18 million resulting in a shortfall of £3.35 million. This arose from the exercise by the air companies of tight control of capital expenditure in 1980, which resulted in a reduction in the expenditure originally proposed on aircraft modification, workshop development and spares.</P>
      <P>So far as CIE are concerned, I understand from the board that the difference between the actual capital expenditure in 1980 and the capital allocation of £24 million arose in connection with the Dublin suburban rail electrification programme. CIE have informed me that provision had been made in the original allocation for possible down-payments which it was expected would be requested by some suppliers but these down-payments were either not requested or did not arise until early 1981.  In other cases there was some delay until 1981 in the supply of materials in respect of which delivery was originally expected late in 1980.</P>
      <P>CIE have indicated that the job creation and employment levels in the project were not adversely affected by these factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the success of the management of CIE in minimising the take up of funds in relation to the suburban rail programme, are the Department now prepared to reward that good management by enabling CIE to increase their current account subsidy this year from approximately £65 million to the credit of at least £1.34 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1665" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the question referred to capital allocations for 1981.  It must be remembered that for 1981 it is £49 million.  That is a very sizeable increase on what it was last year. That is a show of good faith by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister's unfortunate recent accident impaired his hearing.  In case he has not heard my question I will ask him again.  If the management in CIE have been able to save £1.34 million worth of money, whether it is capital or current, are the Department now in a position to reward good management by increasing the available sums of money to CIE in this current year?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that the Government have made adequate funds available to CIE to maintain services and to provide the necessary capital allocation for 1981 to the level of £49 million. This, I suggest, is a great advance on what it was last year.  It is to be hoped that CIE will make the best use possible of the money made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the Chairman and the Managing Director of CIE are this afternoon meeting representatives of the unions involved to discuss the effect of the cut-backs in the real amount of money available to CIE to see what services and jobs may be terminated, reduced or lost with the Government's programme now of job reduction?  Finally, if a State company save money by good management, may we take it that good management is going to be rewarded by that money being taken away?  Are the Government not, in fact, taking away the incentive to good management by not allowing them to transfer those funds on to the current account requirement which they need of <Col N="1666" /> at least £80 million, and not the £65 million that they are currently getting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport whether in view of the need to launch an intensive promotional drive to generate additional traffic at Shannon Airport, he will establish a special task force representative of Aer Rianta. SFADCo, Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte to co-ordinate and direct a special promotional campaign: and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is continuing co-operation and liaison between the bodies concerned in the promotion of traffic at Shannon Airport.  As has been mentioned recently during the course of the budget debate, the Minister for Transport has encouraged Aer Rianta to make every effort, in co-operation with the other agencies involved, to attract additional traffic to Shannon.  Success will call for action by several State agencies. notably Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte and SFAD Co, and I know that these agencies are working closely together with the objective of developing additional traffic at Shannon.</P>
      <P>With specific regard to the Deputy's proposal for a special task force.  I should point out that a sales task force representative of Aer Lingus.  Aer Rianta and Shannon Repair Services have been in operation for a number of years.  This force are concerned with the promotion of Shannon abroad and undertake regular sales visits abroad aimed at air carriers. In the past they have concentrated their efforts on the American market, but more recently, in the light of changing traffic patterns, they have been directing their efforts at the UK. Europe and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Shannon Airport has faced difficult times in the past and these have always been overcome by the enterprise and innovation of those associated with the airport.  I am confident that with the application of similar vigour and co-ordinated action the present decline in traffic can be halted and steady growth resumed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Two companies have lodged applications with the Department of Transport for authorisations to operate scheduled services from the new airport being provided at Waterford.  One application relates to services between Waterford and a number of cross-channel points: the other relates to internal services between Waterford and Dublin. Other operators have expressed general interest in using local airports, including Waterford, as part of an integrated internal network.</P>
      <P>Work on construction of facilities at Waterford is continuing and is not expected to be completed for some months.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Sligo harbour can normally accommodate vessels of 1,500 tons fully laden.  However, serious situation problems which arose in 1977 meant that ships were being required to discharge part of their cargo at Killybegs before proceeding to Sligo.  In order to remedy the siltation problem, a full cost State grant of £18,000 was sanctioned by the Department of Transport in August 1978 for dredging of the channel and berths.  To date a sum of £16,000 has been paid to the commissioners and a claim for the balance of £2,000 is awaited.  The port can again accommodate vessels of 1,500 tons fully laden and I understand that <Col N="1676" /> since 1980 only one vessels has had to use Killybegs instead of Sligo and that vessel exceeded 1,500 tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no unnecessary delay in making a decision on the proposals for this area as set out in a layout plan submitted to my Department by Dublin Corporation.  I am aware of the urgency which attaches to the redevelopment of this area, but because of the major civic importance and cost of the project which may be repeated in other inner city areas, all planning aspects, particularly the social aspects, must be carefully <Col N="1679" /> considered.  In pursuance of this the city manager was asked to consider outline proposals suggested by my Department for a mixed type of development and these were used as basis for a discussion between officers of the corporation and of the Department on 27 February 1981.  Arising out of this discussion it was agreed that two sections could be developed for housing purposes without compromising the necessary comprehensive planning of the designated area and the corporation have been notified accordingly. The corporation have been asked to prepare an action plan indicating their overall proposals for the general area.</P>
      <P>I believe that this is the most expedient manner to produce a comprehensive plan which fully exploits the possibilities of the area for a properly integrated development. I am satisfied that my Department will be kept fully aware of developments by the corporation officials and that the attendance of an officer of the Department at meetings of the city council's committee is not necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> I have no proposals at present to extend facilities for postal voting at Dáil, Presidential and European Assembly elections and at referenda.  Extended postal voting facilities are available at local elections under the Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations, 1974.  So far as the disabled are concerned.  I am asking returning officers to bear their needs specifically in mind in the selection of polling stations.  I am advising them to ensure that every polling station is situated at ground-floor level and that temporary ramps to facilitate access of persons in wheelchairs are provided wherever necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies are, I am sure, aware of the provisions in the electoral law under which blind and incapacitated electors may be assisted in voting by the presiding officer or by a companion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these questions have been put down in response to representations made by the disabled groups' representatives?  Can he consider giving precise instructions to returning officers to select, particularly in urban constituencies, one polling station where facilities for the disabled can be properly provided and that this information will be directly communicated to the organisations in advance of the election?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions numbered 23 to 26, inclusive, together.  The percentage increase in the grant-in-aid payable to An Foras Forbartha in 1981 over 1980 is 0.65 per cent.</P>
      <P>When the grant-in-aid to An Foras Forbartha for 1981 was fixed at £2 million it was also decided that a review of the programme and operations of the Foras should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be a matter for the board to decide in the usual way on the priorities to be observed consistent with the overall grant provision.  The review to which I have referred will be concerned with the purpose, suitability and adequacy of the existing programmes of the Foras in relation to needs; with the changes that might be made and the implications of change; with the possibilities for better co-operation with other institutes, including the question of possible amalgamation with <Col N="1684" /> the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <P>The Foras has been in operation since 1964.  I believe that it is timely and appropriate that there should be a re-examination of the kind I have described of its role and functions; of the way in which it works, and of its relationships with other bodies, in the light of experience and taking account of future needs.</P>
    <P>This decision does not mean that a diminished importance is attached to research and advisory work in the areas in which the Foras operates.  Nor does it necessarily imply a reduced role for the Foras.  What it means, essentially is that the Government are concerned to indentify and bring about the most efficient and cost-effective arrangements for carrying out the programmes that are identified as relevant and necessary and to that end are prepared to look fundamentally at established arrangements.</P>
    <P>The review will be conducted by my Department with the assistance of an inter-departmental group which will include representation of other Departments concerned.  The NBST will be closely involved in the review and will also be represented on the group.</P>
    <P>There have been no discussions of the kind referred to about particular programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware, first, that there is a carry-over of expenditure from the previous year of approximately £100,000 which will effectively mean that the increase to an Foras Forbartha this year is less in real terms than it was last year?  Secondly, is he aware that An Foras Forbartha is facing the prospect of redundancy by April this year unless firm financial commitments are made by his Department to the executive and the staff in that body</P>

      <P>I am aware that there was a carry-over from last year.  As regards the lay-offs spoken of by the Deputy I do not see any need at this stage to speak in such terms.  I think the Deputy will accept that it is necessary in any operation going since 1964 to have a total review of the operation and that is what is involved <Col N="1685" /> here.  It is no threat to jobs or anything else, just a major review of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic purpose of this Bill is to provide the protection which the Government promised to the weaker sectors of our society in this difficult economic period.  As Deputies know, in this Bill we have provided a 25 per cent increase for long term beneficiaries &mdash; old age pensioners, widows, the handicapped and so on.  We are also providing for short term beneficiaries a 20 per cent increase.  In children's allowances we are providing increases of the order of 30 per cent, while smallholders will receive an increase of 20 per cent both on factual and notional assessments.  It is important to recognise that these are very substantial increases, especially given the discussions which are taking place in the House today.  We are all aware of the difficult international and national economic circumstances and the measures being taken by other Governments at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we make a comparison with Great <Col N="1738" /> Britain and the North of Ireland we find that from 1 April we are giving reasonably substantial increases to old age pensioners. A single contributory old age pensioner will receive from April an increase of £6.15 per week whereas the increase recently announced in the British budget amounts to £2.45 applicable from November.  This puts into perspective the increase which this Government are giving.  From 1 April the increase for a couple on old age pension will be £10.75 and the comparable increase in the United Kingdom and the North of Ireland will be £3.90.  It is quite clear that the order of the increases granted here is quite substantial, especially given our present difficult economic circumstances. A couple in receipt of retirement pension will receive £53.55 and the comparable figure in Britain is £47.35.</P>
    <P>We recognise that there are problems for beneficiaries such as widows, old age pensioners and the handicapped, but it must also be recognised that the increases given in this Bill are substantial.  On that basis I have been very happy to bring this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that in the past two increases were given, one in the spring and one in October.  In 1976, for example, long-term beneficiaries received an increase of 10 per cent in the spring and a further 5 per cent in October. In 1977 they received increases of 9 per cent and 5 per cent.  It must be quite clear that it is far better to receive an increase of 25 per cent in April than to split the increase between April and October.  While a total increase of 15 per cent was given in 1976, the splitting of that increase between April and October meant that the effective increase for the recipient was less than 15 per cent over the whole year.  A number of Deputies raised this point but it is important to put it into proper perspective.  Last year the Government provided for an increase of 25 per cent from April and the same provision is being made this year.  In addition I would remind the House that the Government provided the double week's payment before last Christmas.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made regarding the fall in real terms of the benefits in <Col N="1739" /> the Bill and it was suggested that increases should be indexed to the consumer price index or to average earnings. The increases would be much less if they were indexed to the CPI and would amount to about 18 per cent.  I trust that Deputies would not wish the increases to be tied to that figure.  Substantial improvements in excess of the CPI have been made both last year and this year for long-term beneficiaries and, to a lesser extent, for short-term beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The comparison of figures can result in a certain confusion but it is true that earnings increased more rapidly than prices in the periods 1973-77 and 1977-81. The comparison of social welfare payments to earnings shows that social welfare recipients have received advantages from increasing prosperity.  Since such payments have increased more than earnings, therefore they have increased substantially more than prices.</P>
    <P>For a single old age contributory pensioner during the period 1973-77 the real increase in social welfare payments over earnings was nil, whereas in the period 1977-81 the increase is 22.5 per cent.  It is quite clear that the Government are increasing old age contributory pensions and other long-term benefits by more than earnings and thus considerably more than prices.  In the period 1973-77 the social welfare payment for a married couple in receipt of old age contributory pension was down 2 per cent compared to average earnings, although it was greater than the increase in prices.  In the period 1977-81 the comparable figure shows an increase of 22.6 per cent over earnings.</P>
    <P>In 1973-77 the disability benefit payable to a single person showed a nil increase against earnings but in 1977-81 there was an increase of 9.5 per cent.  For the married couple in the period 1973-77 there was a decline of 1.4 per cent in disability benefits against earnings whereas in 1977-81 there was an increase of 9.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I could give more detailed examples of these kinds of increases which show very clearly that the Government have maintained <Col N="1740" /> and honoured their commitment in increasing social welfare payments not only against prices but also over earnings.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting features of the Bill, one that was not dwelt on during the debate, is the new maternity scheme. This is a particularly significant development and it will have wide and important effects.  For a woman on maternity leave it increases the number of weeks covered from 12 to 14 and it also provides for easier contribution conditions for women who re-enter the work force.  It is important for women generally who may decide to leave the work force for a period to look after their children and then return at a later stage.  Later they may have other children, leave the work force for a time and return.  Under the present conditions they could be disadvantaged in relation to the maternity scheme but the new scheme will provide easier contribution conditions for them.</P>
    <P>It will provide for the basic requirement of 26 contributions in the last 12 months or in the governing contribution year.  Previously it was necessary to have 26 contributions in the governing contribution year but in many instances it could happen that the woman in question would not have the necessary contributions in the last governing contribution year, which is effectively the last tax year. Currently that is April 1979 to April 1980 &mdash; also the current governing contribution year &mdash; but from 1 January of next year the new governing contribution year will be April 1980 to April 1981.  It is quite possible that a woman would not have had the 26 contributions in the year April 1979 to April 1980 but she could have been working since that time and in the past 12 months she could have 26 contributions.  Previously she would not have benefited from the maternity scheme but following this legislation a woman on maternity leave will be able to benefit by having 26 contributions in the past 12 months.  I realise that the technical aspects of the Bill may not be immediately understood but they can be important in their application.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that is important but which has not been recognised either in this House or outside is that the legislation <Col N="1741" /> will introduce a minimum weekly payment of £45.75 compared with the present minimum of £20.45.  I shall give some examples of women working in various industries so that the House will see what is involved.  For instance, in the food and drink industry the average weekly earnings of women are £80 office. The effect of the 14-week payment will mean that women in that industry availing of the new scheme will receive £63.94 per week for 14 weeks.  In contrast, the existing scheme which is for 12 weeks provides an estimated £46.82.  The total estimated additional benefit over 14 weeks is £333.</P>
    <P>There are many women working in the textile industry and I shall give some figures in respect of this industry.  The average current earnings are £55 per week. The effect of the new payment over 14 weeks will provide a minimum of £45.75 &mdash; the floor figure in the new scheme. The existing scheme provides for payment of £36.59 for 12 weeks.  The effect of this increase over 14 weeks will mean an additional £201.</P>
    <P>I shall take the clothing and footwear industry as a third example because there are many women working in this sector. Average current earnings are £53 per week.  The new scheme will provide for payment of £45.75 for 14 weeks while the existing scheme provides for a period of 12 weeks at an estimated rate of £35.74. The additional benefit a woman will receive over 14 weeks will be £212.</P>
    <P>In addition, a woman will receive a tax refund, the amount depending on tax-free allowances.  One of the features of the scheme is that the aggregate payment will be equal to net current earnings.  One of the aims of the Bill is to provide that the woman who goes on maternity leave will receive under the provisions of this scheme payment for each of the weeks that will be equal to her net current earnings. That is net of tax and other deductions. The purpose is to maintain her at a level of her net current earnings.  I appreciate that there may be exceptions, say, in the case of a woman who has had a recent substantial increase in earnings, that it may be slightly different.  But, other than such exceptions, the basic <Col N="1742" /> principle on which we were working in this Bill was to provide aggregate payments equal to the net current earnings over the course of 14 weeks in the case of this maternity leave.  I hope that this will help to clarify the position in relation to the detailed application of the new maternity scheme.  Needless to say, I am particularly glad that the Minister for Labour has introduced legislation to cover such a scheme.  It is then my privilege, as Minister for Social Welfare, to devise, draw up and introduce in the House a scheme that will meet this new legislation.  We believe that this is a very good scheme and constitutes a most important development and improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies also asked questions about the national pension plan.  I want to clarify the position in this respect.  A draft White Paper has been circulated to the various Departments for their views. The replies incorporating the views of all of the Departments have not yet been received &mdash; quite a few have been &mdash; but in the meantime there is a new costing process going ahead because of the proposals being revised as a result of the increases being granted under the Bill with which we are now dealing.  The Bill provides for increases for social insurance pensions and the new earning ceiling on contribution liability.  We must provide a new set of figures in relation to this new position and that is currently being done. It is intended that the White Paper on the National Pension Plan will issue in the very near future.  Some Deputies asked questions about the self-employed.  The question of social insurance for the self-employed is being catered for within the White Paper on the National Pension Plan.</P>
    <P>Some other Deputies raised the question of the referral of decisions to head office.  I should make it quite clear that, in the first instance, it is only in cases where disallowance is contemplated that the claim is referred to headquarters at all.  In effect this means that a second opinion is received before there is any question of disallowance.  If we look at an analysis done of the submissions to head <Col N="1743" /> office, say, in the case of fraud &mdash; fraud like working and signing, or concealing means &mdash; we find that approximately 70 cases per week arose in that area for reference back to headquarters which, if taken as a percentage of the total weekly payments, is .06 per cent.  Therefore, Deputies will recognise that it is not something that is done willy-nilly.  There must be some control exercised.  Of course these cases would then be investigated by headquarters, if considered necessary, by the special investigation group.  That is the kind of order in that respect.  I have given that figure in order to keep it in some perspective because sometimes it can be thought that it has grown to proportions which are far greater in relation to the total number of weekly payments.</P>
    <P>The second point with which I want to deal was one raised by a number of Deputies in relation to married women. In this respect the survey showed that there were 120 cases per week referred for determination and that these represented .1 per cent of the total weekly payments.  It is important that I make this point so that Deputies can keep it in proper perspective.  I suppose it would be hard to understand how there could not be some order of percentage of referrals. If there were no referrals whatsoever then I suppose one would be posing the question: are no questions asked whatsoever in this area?  I mentioned this also because Deputies seemed to be of the opinion that there was some different treatment of married women from other categories.  In the case of married women, the success rate on appeal is no different from any of the other categories. In fact the success rate is of the order of 40 per cent of a similar overall order in relation to other kinds of appeals.  It would be wrong to assume that any special measure was taken in that regard.  However, the officers must ask questions as to whether or not people are available for work, of both men and women, and I might reiterate that the number of cases referred to headquarters in relation to married women is .1 per cent of the total weekly payments.</P>

      <P>In the case of the self-employed and farmers there were approximately 25 cases per week shown in this study, which represent .02 per cent being referred.  One further category is the &ldquo;left work of own accord&rdquo;, where people are alleged to have left work of their own accord.  There the survey showed that approximately 230 per week came into that category, representing .19 per cent of the total weekly payments.  I should mention that one of the administrative changes I made in relation to that was to devolve to local offices more of the decisions in relation to those who are alleged to have left work of their own accord.  As the House will understand, these would be more difficult to determine and to agree to because there can be a dispute of one kind or another between the beneficiary and the employer.  In any event, I have recently devolved on local offices more of the control in that area and have made the appropriate arrangements.  Some further changes are planned in that area.  Here the problem is that it requires retraining of staff, and some managers are more capable of dealing with that type of situation than others.</P>

      <P>The reason I tabled my amendments was to try to expedite claims from rural Ireland.  Basically, most of the claims referred to the Department come from rural areas.  As I understand it if an applicant has less than 78 contributions paid and has a poor law valuation of £4 or more his case must be referred to the Department.  The local officer does not have the discretion although he would be very competent &mdash; maybe more competent than Dublin &mdash; to make a decision. Even though he can forecast accurately almost all the time what the decision from Dublin will be, nevertheless the application must be forwarded to the Department. This is bureaucracy gone crazy and I do not see any reason why persons with less than 78 contributions and a PLV of £4 should have their applications sent to Dublin for decision.  A PLV of £4 means a holding of about six acres of poor land, or eight acres of very poor land or more acreage of ridiculously poor land.  It is a notional figure that has no purpose whatever.</P>
      <P>While I am not permitted to move my amendments I request the Minister to change the regulations so that the local officer can determine applications for benefit in such circumstances.  The Minister should also amend the PLV figure to a more realistic one.  He should increase it to a higher figure.  I have been told that it takes ten days from the time the local officer sends the file to the Department until it is returned.  In many instances the Department send back the file for further investigation and that can result in delays of up to one month.  My amendments sought to eliminate the bureaucracy in the Department when dealing with such claims.</P>

It is basically an administrative matter and, as the Deputy knows, we have introduced a number of administrative improvements which have speeded up the payment, particularly relating to the assessment for non-contributory old age pensions.  In that respect the administrative procedures that have been introduced have been very successful.  This has been verified by Deputies on both sides of the House, apart from the proof that we have by way of the figures.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is blatant discrimination in these cases in respect of married women in that when a married woman applies for unemployment benefit, the case is sent to Dublin for processing whereas if a man or a single woman makes a similar application and if their poor law valuation does not exceed £4 and if they do not have a business or reside with someone who has a business, their case is decided at the local office. Even if these conditions are fulfilled so far as a married woman is concerned, her case must go to Dublin for determination. What is the reason for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will inquire whether there is such a practice as that outlined by the Deputy.  It may be that in some instances the local officer may express more doubt about a situation having regard to the fact that in many of these cases we are talking about employment that is subsidiary to farming employment.  There may be more doubt expressed in the case of a female as to whether she was engaged in farm employment.  The procedure the Deputy describes could arise from that situation rather than for any Machiavellian reason.  However, I shall have a look at the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of being Machiavellian.  The local officer is statutorily <Col N="1749" /> bound to send to Dublin an application from a married woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension because that is definitely not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the regulations here but I shall not quote them now.  They stipulate that an application from a married woman who has fewer than 78 employment credits and who has a poor law valuation of less than £4 is sent to Dublin for processing.  The local officer would know the circumstances at first hand.  He would have compassion and understanding in respect of the application but when that application is referred to Dublin it becomes a mere statistic and the applicant is only some anonymous person so far as the Dublin office is concerned. Surely in this day and age a little commonsense should prevail and such cases should be dealt with at local level, thereby ensuring no undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to a staff instruction which may be given because I can confirm that there is no statutory provision nor is there any regulation that has been made by any Minister to the effect outlined by the Deputy.  The staff instruction could arise in circumstances where a more senior manager is available in one of the other exchanges.  In other words, the instruction could relate to the level of staffing at a particular exchange.  The matter would be one of an administrative arrangement but I shall have it looked into as a matter of urgency.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an area in which in so far as possible decisions should be taken at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we may take it that the Minister will issue clear instructions to the managers of local employment exchanges to the effect that where the necessary information is readily available, bureaucracy will be eliminated and the decision taken at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, given the fact that there is the suitable level of management to take those decisions.  However, I have <Col N="1750" /> given an undertaking to the Deputy that those general provisions will be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should accept that in the vast majority of cases applicants attend personally at the local employment offices, that the local officers help with the filling in of the application forms and that they, almost by way of mental arithmetic, are in a position to make the decision before, perhaps, the applicant leaves the office.  In circumstances in which applications are sent to Dublin, would the Minister indicate clearly to officers at local level that this should not happen and that the decisions should be made locally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would repeat that what the Deputy is talking about is not a regulation in the strict meaning of that word. It would be an administrative arrangement. All I can say to the Deputy is that I agree with the general points he makes and with the objective which he would pursue on that.  That would be my objective also and on that basis I will have the matter reviewed as one of urgency.  I have mentioned that there can be administrative complications but it may be a case of referring sideways rather than upwards as it were, in arriving at a satisfactory answer locally.</P>

      <P>The two amendments put forward by Deputy Harte were ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I tabled these amendments was that I felt the section was very unfair, particularly to working-class families.  In a family where a child is attending full-time education the children's allowance would be paid until that child is 18 years of age.  This is <Col N="1751" /> also the case where the child is in a recognised apprenticeship to a particular trade.  Now we find that with the large number of redundancies some children over 16 years of age and under 18 years of age in working-class families find themselves out of work with no desire to go back to school and their parents are deprived of the children's allowance. This is probably an oversight on the part of the Minister but I appeal to him to sympathetically consider including such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The children's allowance is payable to parents of children over the age of 16 and under the age of 18 provided they are in full-time education or in apprenticeships or incapable of self-support by reason of physical or mental infirmity.  Once the children leave school their parents no longer receive the children's allowance if they are over 16 years of age.  On the other hand, as the Deputy said, if they do an apprenticeship and then subsequently are made redundant their parents would not receive the children's allowance because they would return to a comparable situation to the children who did not enter into apprenticeship in any event.  There, one would have to change the children's allowance scheme generally to provide that it went on whether the child continued in education or not.  That is a much broader question.  It certainly would involve substantial numbers.  I appreciate the point the Deputy makes about someone who goes on an apprenticeship.  First and foremost, if the apprenticeship is not regarded as a formal apprenticeship the parents cannot benefit, whereas if it is a formal apprenticeship they can benefit. Some problems arise in that area.  I would be prepared to say that certainly in relation to the apprenticeship and the different kinds of apprenticeship I am prepared to look at them to see what the situation would be.  But the problem is the one of comparability with other children once they leave school and before they get into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have <Col N="1752" /> any knowledge of the number of children between the ages of 16 and 18 in apprenticeships and not attending school whose parents are receiving the children's allowance? Are we talking about big figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of children in that age group is 94.000 but I do not have the other figure available now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's sympathetic approach to this but there is a difference in young boys or girls serving an apprenticeship or being six months of one year in apprenticeship and then, through no fault of their own, being made redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say that is an aspect that I would certainly look at.  I will look at the question of someone who enters an apprenticeship and becomes redundant following that.  There could be a genuine case in that event and it might be possible given the more limited numbers involved in that event, to overcome the comparability problems.  I take the Deputy's point in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had put down another amendment that all documents relating to a decision should be made available to the person concerned or a person acting for him.  I wonder would the Minister agree that when people are refused benefit or assistance of any description from his Department it is most unsatisfactory to tell them that because of a particular section or because their means exceed the statutory limit they are excluded from the scheme?  In the North and in Great Britain the entire file on the case is made available to the applicant, so he can read the file and see the deciding officer's opinion or medical evidence on it and can come to a fair judgment of whether he is entitled to benefit or not.  I am sure Deputies in the House will appreciate the difficulty that arises when an applicant approaches a public representative to renew his appeal and there is a vacuum. The Deputy does not know why the Department shot down the application. He may suspect the reasons but he does not know precisely what the position is <Col N="1753" /> and it leaves the applicant in a most unfair position.  If a person makes an application for benefit or assistance he is entitled to be told precisely why the application is refused.  If he goes into a court of law the judge tells him what the case is.  I do not see why this barrier should be there between the Department of Social Welfare and the applicant.  I would ask the Minister to change the regulations so that the applicant will be informed in full of the position relating to his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make clear that certainly as far as the appeals officer is concerned he will divulge the full details of assessment and any other relevant factors at the hearings and that in fact a detailed reason is given for the decision of the deciding officer.  I think the question that can arise is the question of whether someone has given a statement otherwise, in relation to, for instance, unsuitability for work.  This is something that may be in relation to an accident at work where civil proceedings may be going on.  The cases here would be very few and, in effect, very detailed reasons are given and every opportunity is given in the appeal.  Not only that, but in second appeals at times when, say, a Deputy comes along to vouch for someone and say that in his view such and such is the case, this view and this information are taken into consideration.  The appeals officers do divulge the full details of means assessment and how they arrive at this means assessment and any other information they are acting on at the hearings, and they would be obliged to do that in any event in relation to the discussion which takes place at the hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have personal experience of people in the Republic, particularly in Donegal, working in Northern Ireland and finding the difficulties that I am talking about with the Department of Health and Social Services in Belfast.  In making a representation to that Department in Belfast I find that the information I receive back from them is most detailed and complete, fair, open and honest and the person getting the copy of that can <Col N="1754" /> take a look at it and say.  &ldquo;That is the right conclusion which the Department have come to.  I now understand why I am not getting it&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Department are reading the situation wrongly&rdquo; and can point out to me or any other person where the Department are misleading themselves or misunderstanding the case.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Minister tells me, there is a very big difference between the information which a person in Northern Ireland receives from the Department of Health and Social Services in Belfast and the information that a person in the Republic receives from the Department of Social Welfare here in Dublin inasmuch as it refers to any case that I know of in the constituency where I have the duty to work as a public representative. I am merely saying to the Minister that it would be more honest, fair, complete and businesslike for him to direct that a person who has been refused would be given the complete details of the reasons for that refusal.  I will give an example. One of the new bodies set up here is An Bord Pleanála and the entire file of any information which is passed between an objector and an applicant under An Bord Pleanála, is related back to both sides.  If it is good practice in An Bord Pleanála there should be more need for it in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>This is an administrative procedure and when a deciding officer gives a decision he gives the reasons for the decision.

I presume that these are things which the Deputy would not particularly want laid out in an appeal. Here, of course, the individual has the right to bring his or her own doctor along <Col N="1755" /> to the appeal and to consult him in that respect.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concluding this point.  It may be more important in the case of medical reports.  While I acknowledge that the relationship between the doctor and the patient must always be very confidential, this may be one of the cases where it is more important.  Again I cite the case of a Donegal person working in Northern Ireland appealing on a disability benefit claim.  That person's doctor did a detailed report to the Department of Health and Social Services in Belfast.  The medical evidence in reply to it was made available to my constituent.  That is not done here.  I do not see any violation of the relationship between patient and doctor if the matter has been dealt with between two doctors and the patient concerned.  If the patient concerned wishes to make the information available to a public representative such as myself, that clearly is a decision which must rest with the applicant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of old age and retirement pensions, the Minister has been making a lot of play of the fact that the increases which he has awarded to people in the Republic are far in excess of those awarded to people in Great Britain.  That is not precisely the case.  For example, the Minister has prudently avoided mentioning the case of the person from the Republic living in Northern Ireland, the retired civil servant who has gone back to Northern Ireland to live or maybe the widow of a civil servant who has gone back to Northern Ireland to live and is now in receipt of a widow's pension, retirement pension or old age pension.  That person now living in Northern Ireland is living on 75 per cent of the value of the pension because of the currency difference which has him or her living almost as a pauper.  Virtually every week, maybe not with the same regularity now as at the beginning, I get telephone calls and letters from people living in Northern Ireland or I have personal contact with the relatives of those people in Northern Ireland asking if there <Col N="1757" /> is any way in which the currency differential which is now affecting their mother's pension, leaving the mother living now almost as a pauper, could be attended to.  Therefore, there is no sympathy whatever from the present Government for people living in such circumstances. I refer to people who have given great service to the State.  They are Irish people who happen to live in Northern Ireland where sterling is the currency. Because of our exchange rate, those people are living on three-quarters of what the Minister says is a very good pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone with a pension from Northern Ireland who is living in the Republic, has that pension increased either by a direct increase by a budget proposal in Westminster or an increase in value as a result of the current currency exchange rate, the Republic of Ireland pension will be reduced by the same amount.  In other words, if a person who has worked in Northern Ireland or Great Britain is now living in the Republic, particularly in Donegal, and that person is in receipt of a small or part British pension, and a part pension from Dublin, the value of that pension is taken into consideration in determining the amount of pension which that person should receive from the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin. If the pension is increased directly as a result of a budget proposal in Westminster, say the figure is £2 per week, the pension from the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin is subsequently reduced by £2 per week.  If the pension is increased as a result of the difference in our currencies by £2 or £3 per week, then the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin reduce the Irish pension by a similar amount.  It is grossly unfair.  The present Government are having their cake and eating it.  It is very unfair to people who have given great service to the State and who now find themselves living almost as paupers in Northern Ireland.  It is also unfair to people who had to emigrate because they could not get work here and who now find that, because their pensions have increased either directly or as a result of the high value of sterling, they also lose out.  The Department of Social Welfare in Dublin are gaining as <Col N="1758" /> a result of the currency differential.  The Minister has almost constantly referred in the House to the great increase which he and the Government have given to old age pensioners and other pensioners in the budget.  He has cleverly avoided this very unsatisfactory position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make some points clear because there could be some confusion. I am sure the Deputy appreciates the situation but, from what he said, one would think that some of these things applied generally.  The increases are 25 per cent here.  They are at a very much lower level in England.  There is no question about that.  To take the old age pension couple, if you apply a 25 per cent increase on the United Kingdom pension, you get £3.90, you increase by roughly £1, that is £4 or £5 against £10.75 here.  The Deputy makes the most of the point.  I accept that it is his job in opposition to do that but it fades in comparison with the reality of the size of the increases.  That is the global point.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Irish pensions being reduced because an English pension increases, fortunately, the increase in this case is much bigger in Ireland.  The increase in England is smaller so the effect of that will be much less this year. This applies of course, only where the pension is an assistance pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies only to assistance. It does not apply to contributory pensions.  If you have a contributory pension and another pension from England, that is entirely your business.  What the Deputy says refers only in cases of assistance, because a means test is applied for assistance benefits.  The only way to get over this in the long run is to have a national pension plan and to get away from assistance schemes altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> The Deputy raised the question of people going from here to the North of Ireland, that the value of their pension may, due to exchange rates, be reduced. Within EEC regulations, we are required to pay at the national rate in any event and each country would, in effect, be doing this.  That could apply differently when the person goes to any other country, to Germany, the United States or anywhere else.  A great deal of variation could be created.  If one is receiving a pension here and going to England, the pension will be paid at the rate prevailing here.  We cannot do much about that.</P>
    <P>In relation to partial payments, which the Deputy mentioned, the actual rate of increase would be higher where they are means tested than the 25 per cent we talk about globally.  For instance, if the means are £15 per week, the increase will be closer to 50 per cent in practice.  It is one of the features of the Bill that when you are on a partial payment, it is higher.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Deputy has great concern for Border movements in both directions.  I hope the Deputy also appreciates that we are extending the free telephone rental scheme to people who have returned from England or the North of Ireland.  That did not apply before.  I am not totally unheedful of the Deputy's points and suggestions.  It is one we have included in the provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you and the Minister for your co-operation. We have discussed this Bill very fully in its various sections.  This side of the House have serious reservations about the Bill.  Briefly, we feel there has been a missed opportunity here, that we could have had an opportunity in the context of this very important issue to deal with a wide variety of issues which the Minister chose not to deal with and which on Committee Stage were not accepted as appropriate for inclusion in the discussion. Despite the disturbing evidence available <Col N="1761" /> of a very serious and rapid rise in sex-related offences, this Bill makes a very narrow assault on that problem and is little more than a tidying up of some aspects of very outdated legislation relating to rape defined in a very narrow and singular way.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate, perhaps, that the mechanics of Dáil procedure and the tedious way in which Parliaments do their business, reacting often with legislation or measures that are too little and too late, mean that this legislation is probably already out of date even in its new form.  I am ready to concede that there are improvements in the Bill, particularly in relation to penalties and to the protection of people who, tragically, have need to take action under the Bill. However it would have been a wonderful chapter in the history of this Parliament if we had taken the opportunity presented and included in the Bill areas of real concern permeated in our society by tragic implications in regard to sex-related offences generally for a wide variety of issues.  This would have specifically referred to sections in the Bill concerned with the definition of rape and with other types of crime which have at their roots a perverse attitude regarding what we might call one's understanding of what the sexual relationship is about and the impact that has on people in terms of the brutalising effect of sex-related crimes on women and some men and younger people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wondered during the debate if there was some better way of dealing with this issue than merely deciding in advance, as it was decided here, to bring about some progress in relation to a very narrow range of issues included in the Bill.  We had a chance &mdash; and we shall not have one.  I believe, for many years again &mdash; to stand back from this area, study it and assess it with new found insights which modern psychiatry, modern criminology, modern experience of other countries would have given us as to how we should deal, not just with rape in its narrow sense, but with the whole area of sex-related crime.  That might have enabled us collectively to produce legislation <Col N="1762" /> which would have dealt in a compassionate and yet very strong way with issues that are very real and which unfortunately have been omitted from this legislation.</P>
    <P>That is a pity because I do not anticipate that we shall have this kind of Bill before us again for some time.  In fairness, the Minister is to be congratulated on actually having introduced a Bill in an area about which there has not been that much demand, although I would like to take the opportunity of saying publicly that I shall be passing to the Minister's office some signatures which were handed to me to give to the Minister last week by a number of women who came to the gates of Leinster House.  I understand there are 10,000 signatures attached to that petition, which is about their concern in regard to deficiencies in the Bill.  In almost all the issues in the petition this party supports the demands of these women.  Accordingly, it is with mixed feelings that one sees the passing &mdash; as presumably will be the case &mdash; of this Bill into law when one sees outside it an enormous problem not only of sex-related crime but of the need to improve understanding of sexual relations between people and the tension, strain and stress it produces in marriages and outside marriage and the difficulties to which it gives rise.</P>
    <P>When we hear of crimes of a sexual nature or rape one always gets the impression that we hear only of the very few and that there are many problems in this area about which people for one reason or another are very reluctant to come forward.  Presumably that is why rape is alleged to be the most under-reported crime.  It is a crime of essential repugnance to civilised people: it strikes at the dignity and equality of human beings.  It seeks to take advantage by one sex of the nature of that sex and its allegedly superior physical strength.  It brutalises women in some cases most terribly and with horrible effects.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes a tiny step forward in trying to deal with the problem.  I wish it had been many giant steps, as it could have been.  Would the Minister commit himself to further legislation in this area <Col N="1763" /> in a Bill that would be comprehensive and deal with the need for new attitudes towards crime of a sexual nature, attitudes which were dealt with very extensively in the report to the British Government by their committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from what is in the Bill.  At this stage we can only deal very strictly with what is in the Bill and not mention what might be or should be in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in replying, might take the opportunity of referring to the possibility of other legislative approaches in this regard.  We know that neither the Bill, nor indeed any legislation, is the complete answer nor perhaps even largely the answer to the problem of sex-related crime and that there are many other areas requiring to be dealt with if we are properly to tackle the issues arising.  In my view we have missed an opportunity here.  If that is the case, it is unfortunate for the women and the children of this country because there have been instances where children have witnessed what is referred to in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think we could tackle these problems at an earlier stage and more fundamentally at their roots and not do as we have done here, and that is, very little for many people and very late. Nevertheless, it would be wrong of me to do other than wish the Bill success.  We made our reservations known on Committee Stage and they still remain.  If <Col N="1764" /> given the opportunity we would introduce the changes we think necessary to this legislation.  In a way I hope our fears will be groundless.  In my opinion there is room for improvement in this Bill.  We spelt them out on Committee Stage and I will not repeat them now.</P>
    <P>I hope we can look forward to a diminishing crime pattern in this frightening area where the statistics point in only one direction, that is, unprecedented misunderstanding between the sexes, violence between men and women and tragedy for families.  I do not know whether, in the light of the experiences of other countries, we can deal with this problem satisfactorily, but we should be willing to do this very soon by taking a broad look at the whole area of sex-related offences and relations between men and women and try to embody whatever is needed in legislation to bring about the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is a symbol of our determination to bring about progress in this regard.  It is probably not much more. I wish the Bill every success.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pursue the question of the extension of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and to ask why virtually unlimited jurisdiction is being granted.  This section appears to extend the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in areas about which we might be concerned. Problems will arise, not just in relation to the facilities available and the number of judges but specifically in relation to the extension of jurisdiction.  Does the Minister consider that the present mechanics and structures of these courts are adequate to deal with the increased burden which will now fall upon them? Serious concern has been expressed on this matter.  The Minister will be aware that a number of district justices and High Court judges have over a long period been provoked by inadequate court facilities to make numerous remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that if we are to have justice in our courts the environment should be such as to enable people to come to level headed, sensible decisions with all facilities readily available and without any kind of injustice being <Col N="1767" /> perpetrated either on the prosecution or the defence.  Unfortunately in this country we have courts which by no stretch of the imagination could be considered anything but far short of ideal.  There are courts where legal representatives and clients are obliged to discuss business outside the building, sometimes in the rain, or in cars.  We have facilities which have been condemned by a judiciary who are normally reticent, in this regard at least.</P>
    <P>The difficulty occurs at a number of levels, particularly at District Court level. Section 2 deals with the Circuit Court and it is not exempt from criticism in this regard.  Is the Minister satisfied with the facilities available?  Surely the extension of jurisdiction, which is implicit in this and other sections, will do nothing more than place a very great burden on an already overburdened area and will run the risk of creating an injustice.  It should be the Minister's concern to see that the highest standards of justice prevail.  If one looks for evidence in this respect one must accept what judges have said about the matter.  Time and again they have commented on what can only be described as the disgraceful condition of many courts throughout the country, which is a shame on all of us.  I do not see how the Minister can justify extension of jurisdiction which will only aggravate the existing deficiencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification of increasing the jurisdictional limits of the Circuit and District Courts is a matter that has been raised by Deputy Keating. I should like to refer to the background. The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, fixed the jurisdiction limits of the Circuit Court in contract and tort, excluding matrimonial and criminal conversation actions, and proceedings at the suit of the State, any Minister, Government Department or any officer thereof at £300.  In title to land actions, the court's jurisdiction limit was set at £60 valuation, and in probate and equity matters the limits were set at £1,000, personalty, and £60 valuation of land.  The monetary, as opposed to valuation, limits of these jurisdictions were <Col N="1768" /> increased by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, from £300 to £600 and from £1,000 to £2,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>The Hire Purchase (Amendment) Act, 1960, gave the Circuit Court jurisdiction in hire purchase claims up to £1,000 and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, gave similar jurisdiction in credit sale agreement claims.  The Succession Act, 1965, increased the court's probate jurisdiction to £5,000 personalty, and £100, valuation of land.</P>
      <P>The Courts Act, 1971, increased the contract and tort jurisdictions of the court from £600 to £2,000 and the jurisdiction in hire purchase and credit sale claims from £1,000 to £2,000.  In equity matters, the 1971 Act increased the personalty limit from £2,000 to £5,000 and the land valuation limit from £60 to £100, bringing them into line with the probate jurisdiction of the court.</P>
      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended in their 20th Interim Report that the contract and tort jurisdictions of the Circuit Court be increased from £2,000 to £10,000 and that for equity cases the £5,000 limit on personalty be removed and the £200 limit on rateable value of land be increased to £200.  As section 28 contains a proposal, of which the Courts Committee were not aware when making their recommendations, to increase the maximum which may be awarded under the Civil Liability Acts as compensation for mental distress to the relatives of the deceased in a fatal accident, it was decided to increase the new tort limit to £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied there are no delays in the Circuit Court.  Section 31 provides for a time lag in respect of arrangements for introducing the new jruisdiction limits. This delay will permit the rule-making bodies to make rules of court which will be necessary to make the new arrangements fully effective.  Having given further consideration to the likely work involved in preparing and bringing into effect the new rules and other likely practical requirements for the operation of the new jurisdictions, I am of the opinion that a time lag of 12 months rather than six months would be more appropriate. Amendments Nos. 36b and 36c give <Col N="1769" /> effect to the revised period.  The extra time will also provide an opportunity to make better progress on the accommodation of proposals which the Minister for Justice referred to on Second Stage and to give detailed consideration to the administrative arrangements for the best use of the available court time and accommodation.  I am satisfied that by the time the main proposals of this Bill regarding jurisdiction come into operation the arrangements for the distribution of business in the District Court will be such that the court will be able to handle the increased workload.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the operation of the lower courts will be kept under close review for some time after introduction of the new jurisdiction arrangements. The best estimate available at present is that it is likely the District Court will be the only one whose caseload will increase as a result of this Bill.  Demand on Circuit Court time is not likely to change significantly. However, if as a result of experience in either court under the new dispensation there arises a need for the appointment of additional judges, justices or court staff, I will not be slow to take whatever steps may be necessary to fulfil that need.  It is not possible to estimate the effect which the improved access to courts as afforded by this Bill will have on the volume of business.  It follows that it would be a futile exercise to make new appointments on the basis of what can only be guesswork at this stage.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the Minister indicated on Second Stage that the proposals in this Bill were drawn up following careful consideration of the practical consequences. I should like to place on record that consultations on the proposals have taken place not only with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court but also with the judiciary in the Circuit and District Courts and other interested bodies.</P>
    <P>I trust I have stated clearly the justification of the extension of jurisdiction to the Circuit and District Courts.</P>

      <P>I wish to direct some <Col N="1770" /> questions to the Minister because matters have been brought to my attention regarding some district courts.

There appears to be a lack of communication and liaison between the Department and the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proposing in this Bill to make changes with regard to District Court and Circuit Court jurisdiction. Deputy Keating referred to the difficulty of having consultations in many of the courthouses throughout the country but that is only part of it.  I wish to deal with a matter that is causing concern in relation to District and Circuit Courts.  Will the Minister tell the House what is happening in his Department in regard to the rationalisation of court sittings?  It has been brought to my attention that there is at present in operation a process whereby quite a number of District Court sittings are being abolished.  To give an example, in County Offaly there are seven different sittings of the District Court and I am reliably informed that at least three of those are being abolished.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister in his reply made a number of interesting comments. In general the principle of an extension of jurisdiction is possibly ideal and is to be welcomed.  We know there are at present many cases pending in the lower courts where the costs involved are perhaps even greater than the amounts essentially involved in the cases.  In regard to the consultations which took place into the background to this Bill the Minister gave the impression &mdash; at least this was the impression I had &mdash; that there was a kind of unanimity, presumably among the professional organisations and so on, about the wisdom of this Bill and of this section in particular.  I wonder if the Minister would accept that there have been the widespread complaints about which I have spoken.  While it might appear at first glance that the physical conditions are not intrinsically related, the reality is that the extension of jurisdiction proposed here will mean a heavier workload for the Circuit Court, which is what we are talking about in this section, with apparently no proposal to increase the existing number of judges or to provide any kind of facilities in that regard. This simply means that two pints are being endeavoured to be fitted into a pint bottle and it will not work.  If the Minister is of the view that he has consulted widely, would he, for example, refer to a submission from the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland which said specifically in relation to this section that the Law Society felt justified in sounding a serious warning that the Circuit Court, among other courts, is already operating at full capacity, perhaps with some very few exceptions, that the proposed increases in jurisdiction will seriously overtax the capacity of the Circuit and District Courts, the judges, justices, registrars, <Col N="1772" /> clerks and other office staff.  That is a submission of a most telling nature from people who are professionals in this field. They feel that they are operating at capacity.</P>
      <P>Regardless of that submission the request now is willy-nilly to increase jurisdiction.  I might give extracts from a letter from an eminent legal personage, whose name I will omit because it is not relevant, but what is relevant is what he says.  After chiding this House on the way it has dealt with District Courts, he goes on to say that many of our Circuit Courts are little better.  In the court in which he practices extensively &mdash; and he names it &mdash; there is not so much as a consultation room, so that one has to consult with one's clients in the hall or else in the motorcar.  In many of the Circuit Courts there is not as much as a consultation room.  He says that the Bar Council made representations on this matter but to no avail.  This gentleman says that the main thing wrong with the proposed legislation is that, as usual, we are putting the cart before the horse.  We should first organise facilities before contemplating any change in the law.  He says we should consider for a moment some of the problems that will arise.  There will be major problems in relation to evidence and he talks about the difficulty, to which others have referred, of organising the attendance of doctors and expert witnesses, as the point will arise that they can be called to court at any time during the year.  At present the position is that they know approximately when they are required in court and it is just a few times in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on at length about this but I do not wish to do so.  The Minister made a very interesting remark.  He said that if a problem arose he would monitor it carefully and would then respond.  I suggest that that is precisely the kind of thinking that has led to the dilapidation existing in our courts and the deterioration of our standards in this respect.  It is perfectly obvious that problems will arise.  Indeed it is obvious that they have arisen already without any increase in jurisdiction. What I am asking the Minister &mdash; and I have an amendment at the end of Committee Stage anyway to try to ensure that <Col N="1773" /> this Bill will not become operative until such time as the facilities are provided &mdash; is: how can he reconcile the existing overwhelming evidence from people practising in the legal profession, from judges who have commented publicly on the matter, from anybody who has had occasion to visit some of these courts? How can the Minister honestly come into this House and tell us that the facilities are adequate, that an increased jurisdication of a very significant nature here will not add enormously to existing problems, thereby creating more?</P>
    <P>These are not just problems of office administration.  In this context we are talking about justice, about making sure that a person who goes before the court &mdash; a most traumatic event &mdash; gets justice; that he or she is enabled to be dealt with in a matter which is not cramped, not discriminatory, not in any way prejudicial to his or her interests by virtue of the fact that there are not adequate facilities to talk to one's legal counsel, that the judge feels that he has got to get through so many cases, that there are people almost crowding around the witness box or whatever.  The disgraceful condition of courts is a problem fundamentally relevant to the proposal to extend jurisdiction.  It is perhaps more relevant in the case of District Courts, where the statistics of the problem in this respect would be even greater.  Anybody operating in that field has already said there are problems in that respect.  Now we are about to increase jurisdiction.  Can the Minister answer three questions for me?  (1) What extra percentage of work will now fall on the Circuit Court?  (2) Does he propose to appoint extra judges and staff?  (3) What extra allocation will his Department provide to bring this new situation about in order that we can deal fairly with what is in essence a good idea if it were practicable?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything Deputy Keating has said is correct.  I would appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at the situation and at Circuit Court courthouses as well.  I might refer the Minister again to his Second Reading speech when he made the point that he had in preparation <Col N="1774" /> a set of proposals relating to courthouse accommodation which he would be putting to the Government in the near future.  That speech was delivered some time ago.  I wonder what has happened that set of proposals.  Is the Minister now in a position to outline the precise situation in regard to them?</P>
      <P>As the Minister and his Department are responsible for the administration of justice they should take the initiative and be responsible for the keeping of courthouses in proper condition.  Local authorities are at present experiencing a lot of financial problems.  I can assure the Minister that the updating and improvement of courthouse accommodation is low on their priority lists.  Some courthouses are reasonably adequate; that is as much as one can say about them.  The majority of them are completely unsatisfactory, have no consultation rooms, proper toilet facilities or heating.  Those facilities are essential because in many instances people arrive at 9 a.m. for a consultation before a Circuit Court hearing.  Those people may have to wait until 5 o'clock in the evening in buildings that do not have proper toilet or heating facilities or a proper room for consultation.  That is not good enough in this day and age.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the relationship that exists between the Department of Justice and local authorities the Minister should be able to ensure that courthouses are maintained to a moderate standard.  The Minister must exercise complete control over courthouses.  The exterior of many of the courthouses is beautiful and many of them are historical buildings but it is sad to see them decaying as they are at present.  The Minister should put forward the set of proposals he said he would introduce in the course of his Second Stage speech.  He should tell the House what has happened since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we move from section 21 should like to make two points, one is peripheral to the question of jurisdiction and the other relates to the whole question of financial ceilings in the Bill and my plea for index-linking.  The Circuit Court, which is under discussion, deals with claims between £250 and £2,000.  The £2,000 jurisdiction was conferred in October 1971 and it represented an increase then of £600.  There is no argument about the need to increase jurisdiction at least in line with inflation which, as the Minister knows better than I, is soaring all the time.  At present it is at an all time high.  This is the most efficient and productive tier of the court system but, in case the Minister might take refuge and solace from this as a way of pushing through his desire to foist extra jurisdiction in this regard without giving the facilities to do it, it should be said that there are a number of reasons why it operates the way it does.  In general, the standard of judges at this level is very high and cases can be and are heard within a short time.  That is not necessarily the case at all levels.  It is possible to have one's case in the Circuit Court heard within two or three months of the cause of action arising.  There is no backlog as such at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> However, that is achieved only by extraordinary dedication by a number of judges.  Outside Dublin it is a norm for judges to sit from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.  As was stated, it is nearly as demanding as the work of a Dáil Deputy. Certainly, it is very exacting.  Fair credit goes to the judges who make that possible. While this is commendable in eliminating delays it cannot reasonably be suggested that litigants whose cases come on for hearing at 7.30 or 8.30 in the evening receive as fresh and as alert a hearing as those who are called earlier in the day. The question of the length of adjudication is something that should be considered in this regard.  Perhaps, what is for some people a normal working day is too great in areas where one is dealing with extremely sensitive matters affecting fundamentally the future and the lives of many people.  In other words, if there is to be a discussion in this respect we should err on the side of caution in asking judges to work fewer, in terms of courtroom hours, rather than greater hours but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Circuit Court is packed to capacity and the £2,000 limit is obviously inadequate.  This inadequacy means that in cases of a road accident where there are not personal injuries if one of the cars involved is new, the claim is likely to exceed the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  Obviously, that is absurd.  There is a need for a change in the jurisdiction I do not wish that to be obscured but there is no point in asking people who are already working to capacity to do something extra.  All that would happen would be that we would have people with nervous breakdowns and the concept and principle of justice would be done a genuine injury.  I put it to the Minister that any proposal to increase jurisdiction &mdash; this applies throughout the Bill &mdash; must take account of the fact that the Circuit Court is already working to capacity.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any jurisdictional increase &mdash; this is the kernel of the matter &mdash; it must be matched by an increase in the number of judges and staff.  It would not involve any substantial drain on the Exchequer as the court staff is already available.  The question then is how great <Col N="1777" /> the jurisdictional increase should be.  The increase proposed in the Bill is of such a scale that it represents a very substantial increase in real terms in the Circuit Court jurisdiction.  In other words, there is more in the section than merely up-dating with inflation; it means a very real increase in jurisdiction.  Some of the increases in jurisdiction will be dealt with in other sections and we will be disagreeing with the Minister in regard to them.</P>
    <P>An argument in favour must be presented in terms of decentralisation.  In principle that would certainly seem acceptable but it can and may give rise to practical difficulties.  If the Circuit Court jurisdiction limit is increased to the limit proposed it will mean that quite substantial personal injuries actions will be heard before the Circuit Court.  That means that litigants with substantial personal injuries would be deprived of a right to a jury trial, an important issue in a democracy. Just as serious is the difficulty they are likely to experience in arranging for the attendance of witnesses.  It is the normal practice in cases of significant personal injuries that the court has the assistance of expert witnesses.  Naturally enough when dealing with serious injuries one needs the assistance of a doctor, a psychiatrist or whatever professional assistance is necessary at the time of the trial. It is not unusual to have a general practitioner and two or three more specialists giving evidence on behalf of each party, for example.  Naturally, the same specialists tend to be required to give evidence in a large number of cases.  At present that does not give rise to any problems because all these personal injury actions are listed for the High Court.  That means that for the bulk of the year the court goes out on circuit to Galway, Limerick and Cork and that facilitates the attendance of expert witnesses, medical and otherwise.</P>
    <P>If the proposed increase goes through one could define the situation where, for example, a plastic surgeon might on the same day be required to give evidence of his treatment in Castlebar, Skiberreen, Monaghan and, perhaps, Roscommon. The clashes of commitments that must inevitably arise for professional witnesses <Col N="1778" /> will result in major delays.  Has the Minister thought about this?  In relation to the operation of the Circuit Court's criminal jurisdiction, one difficulty should also be mentioned.  An accused has the fundamental right to a trial by jury and I hope that anything any Government may do will not impact detrimentally on that right.  However, the legislature has realised that there may be cases when obtaining an independent and impartial jury may cause difficulty.  That has been recognised in a number of ways.  Obvious examples would involve allegations of violent rape or some type of agrarian dispute where there were strong local feelings.</P>
    <P>In these cases an accused might complain that he would not be given a fair trial in an area in which the offence was alleged to have been committed.  The prosecution might face similar difficulties in border counties in prosecuting smuggling offences, for example.  Both sides have a right, on seven days' notice, to apply to have the hearing of their case transferred to the Central Criminal Court.  I would not argue as to the possibility of there being some degree of abuse in this procedure of accused persons seeking to transfer, not because they fear the existence of prejudice on the part of a jury, but because they are aware of and disapprove of the sentencing policy of the Circuit Court judge.  However, that is a matter which can be dealt with in another way.</P>
    <P>I am asking whether there is a danger, now that we are going to make inroads on this very fundamental right, perhaps by way of a nod and agreement, of the situation being abused but that this is a way out.  I suggest to the Minister that he think again in this respect because if there is abuse there is another way of dealing with it.  Arguably, I could suggest that the absolute right to transfer be abolished and that instead both the accused and the State be given the right to have cases transferred for a cause shown, but what I am concerned about here is not the thinking behind the increase in jurisdiction but the very serious effect and implications involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> I would refer briefly to the question of financial limits.  It is nonsensical that this House must occupy itself, as happens regularly, on the fixing of financial limits in Bills, sometimes even on the introduction of whole new legislation to deal with financial limits that were fixed years ago and which are totally out of date, whether they be in the area of general fining policy or in the area of sanctions for specific offences.  In the case before us it has taken years for the relevant Bill to reach the House.  If the new limits are agreed, they will become outdated immediately because of the rapid rise in inflation, a situation that shows no signs of diminishing. Unless we agree to index-linking the limits now, there will be varying standards of justice because the £100 fine or the £2,000 fine of today is worth more than it will be worth in six months' time and it is worth a good deal more than it will be worth in two years' time.  In some cases the Minister has taken power, by way of ministerial order to increase the limits, but the problem is that this is very new and has not been used widely.</P>
    <P>In the legislation with which I am familiar, there is always argument in this regard.  This is a matter which should never be the basis for substantive debate in this House or for new legislation as has been the case up to now.  Why not build in a provision for index-linking the fines or the values of any financial limits in this Bill with current economic indicators which would increase automatically thereby endeavouring to ensure that what is justice for one person today is justice for another tomorrow or next year or at any other time?  Surely that is merely commonsence instead of having a situation in which there is a good time to be fined and a bad time to be fined.  The situation has become so ludicrous that it is no longer worthwhile for the Garda to take people to court.  This is particularly true of fines in respect of litter offences. The same applies so far as the planning laws are concerned.  The financial sanctions are irrelevant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating has suggested that there will be great disadvantages and stresses and strains imposed on litigants and, indeed, on professional people because they will find difficulty in having professional witnesses at point A and at point B on the same date.  I do not accept that this situation in itself will impose stresses, hardship and problems in respect of communications and transport. The information available to me &mdash; and this information is from the professional interests and from the courts committee &mdash; is that these interests are totally satisfied that the situation will not be anything of the extraordinary and serious dimensions that the Deputy plays it up to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to all the views put to me, I am satisfied that the interests concerned are happy about the situation.  Many of the professional people, particularly those in the medical profession, inform me that many of those who find themselves involved tragically in serious accident cases have their initial, if not all their consultations with local consultants at the hospitals in the areas in which they live.  Invariably, these people are available in the Circuit Court in these areas and for this reason the argument that Dublin would necessarily be <Col N="1781" /> the hub of all activity in this regard is a misrepresentation of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised also the question of juries but that is a question that does not arise on the section we are dealing with except in so far as there is no intention in the Bill to have juries in the Circuit Court for the purpose of civil cases.  The Deputy has referred to the accused and to juries in criminal cases but we are not dealing with that context in the proposed legislation.  I would be going outside my function on Committee Stage of this Bill in replying to something that is not material so far as the Bill is concerned.</P>

I was going to ask had he in mind allowing plaintiffs in actions in the Circuit Court in contract or tort cases, particularly tort cases, to make application to be granted a jury.  Obviously the answer is no.  There has been a very big lobby to abolish the jury system here and we will be dealing with that on the later stages of this Bill in regard to the High Court situation.  I feel that the jury system is a safeguard and a guarantee for the ordinary citizen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has emphatically stated that where the jurisdiction is raised from £2,000 to £15,000 the plaintiff will not be entitled to have a jury.  I might add that human nature is a strange thing. Some judges will be generous with other people's money and some will be very careful not only with their own but with somebody else's money as well.  That is human nature.  What I want to get across is that, over a period of time, people generally get to know the attitude of a judge to a particular kind of problem. This can be seen over a period of years. There could be a situation where a case would be valued at £12,000-£15,000 and the plaintiff may feel that the judge might be somewhat careful and that it would be better to settle the case out of court.  This could be a situation where the plaintiff should be entitled to apply for a jury if he wished.  Fifteen thousand pounds is an enormous sum of money to people and there should be a choice open to them now that the jurisdiction is being increased because it is a very big jump from £2,000 to £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that if people are not entitled to have a jury they may come up against judges who are over-protective of the interests of large insurance companies and so on and this would result in a disadvantage to the plaintiff.  Because of the huge extension of the jurisdiction the Minister should strongly consider allowing juries in the Circuit Court at the choice of either party.  There will be many cases where the claim is small and, irrespective of how it goes, the case will proceed without a jury.  But in many cases where the amount of money involved is extensive, a person should be entitled, if he so desires, to have the case heard before a jury.  The jury system goes back to the year 1200 and we should continue to have it in the High Court certainly, and in cases in the Circuit Court because of the increasing of the jurisdiction. <Col N="1784" /> Many people would not avail of the opportunity but there are many who would and I would ask the Minister to look into that.</P>
    <P>We have touched on the position in regard to doctors, surgeons, engineers, architects and other professional people giving evidence in court.  The Circuit Court visits some of the larger towns around the country.  There will be a lot of surgeons attached to the local general hospital giving evidence but, in regard to neurologists and other specialists needed to give evidence they may be required to travel from Dublin to do so.  In this context the settling of the list for the Circuit Court is going to have to come under review.  I know the Minister has seen Circuit Court lists.  They arrive ten days beforehand and I have seen 300 or 400 cases listed for a one or two-day sitting. Specialist witnesses may have to wait around the court for two days and the solicitor cannot tell them whether the case will be reached or not.  If one brings down a surgeon from Dublin to Castlebar for two days and then the case is not heard it will certainly be very difficult to get him to attend in Castlebar on any occasion in the future.  If the jurisdiction is being extended there will be a very big increase in the business of the Circuit Court.  Because of this there is going to have to be a much more business-like approach to the settling of District Court and Circuit Court lists.  I would personally urge the Minister to arrange a conference between himself and the different county registrars and the different Circuit Court judges in consultation with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council to see if they can arrive at a more businesslike procedure in regard to the settling of Circuit Court lists.  It is totally unsatisfactory to see 300 or 400 cases in a list for a two-day sitting.  It would be a physical impossibility to get through it all.  It would be like expecting the full Order Paper to be dealt with in one day here in the House and I do not think we will ever see that happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is unsatisfactory. My concern would be that there would be a number of very eminent surgeons leaving their hospitals in Dublin and travelling down to a court and waiting for a number of days and the case not being heard.  They might have had to leave behind a very important operation; they might have had to leave behind some very sick person to attend in court.  It is to facilitate people who are expert witnesses in so many different lines.  I am not speaking just of the medical profession but also of top engineers, architects and people in so many walks of business life and so on.  I want to try to overcome this situation which at the moment is highly unsatisfactory.  Three or four hundred cases may be listed for a two-day sitting and everybody knows in his heart and soul that 300 of those cases will be adjourned.  You might find yourself half-way down the list and uncertain what the situation is.  This is not a business-like approach.  Imagine 400 cases listed with the plaintiffs, defendants, expert witnesses and so on arriving for that hearing. Think of the loss of manpower over that few days with all the people attending for the hearing of those cases.  In fairness to the judges, they are very anxious to change this as also are the county registrars and everybody else.  But that situation has existed, to my knowledge, for the past 12 or 14 years.  The problem will have to be tackled and eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should see if the meeting I have outlined can be arranged even during the passage of this Bill.  There should not be too much difficulty in regard to tackling this matter.  I will mention some of the items that will have to be arranged.  The county registrar would have to communicate far earlier than he does at present.  The normal procedure in the circuit court is that the county registrar notifies solicitors and sends them the court list seven to ten days before the court hearing.  Some of the solicitors will communicate with him to say that some of the cases are not going on.  I suggest that six weeks beforehand a provisional list would be sent out and then each solicitor would have to communicate with his witnesses and so on <Col N="1786" /> and write back to the county registrar, saying, for instance. &ldquo;In nine cases out of 20 I cannot get witnesses.  People are ill, therefore those cases are not going on&rdquo;. Then four weeks beforehand the county registrar will be able to send out a second list and after another two weeks he could send out the final list, and one could arrive in court happy in the knowledge that his case will go on.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat myself, but let us consider a list of, say, 200 cases.  There would be 200 plaintiffs and 200 defendants &mdash; that is, 400 people &mdash; 200 solicitors and 200 barristers perhaps.  You are running into probably 1,000 people most of whom are wasting their time in that court because their cases may not go on.  Similarly you are wasting the time of doctors, engineers, surgeons and so on.  I do not know whether this has ever been tackled seriously.  I doubt whether there has ever been a businesslike and commonsense approach to see if those lists can be changed.  I am referring specifically to the Circuit Court.  The Minister of State is 14 or 15 months in his job.  If he were to take the initiative in this respect I feel that he would have the goodwill and co-operation of all of the parties concerned.  People with whom I discussed this matter are fully aware of this problem.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  Some years ago I arrived in Dublin for a case that was due to go on and people travelled from all over to attend.  They waited all day, the case did not go on and they were back the following morning in Dublin.  I found it extremely difficult to explain to those people how the list situation works.  Irrespective of any plausible explanation that one could give them, their main contention was that they had been totally discommoded and put out over the whole matter.  They felt very aggrieved over the waste of their time and the excessive costs in which it involved them.  I hope that this matter will be looked at thoroughly.  Now that the extension of the Circuit Court jurisdiction is proceeding the Minister of State has an opportunity of tackling this matter on a realistic, practical and businesslike basis and I urge him to do so.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I will ask the Minister <Col N="1787" /> of State to let me know his views about the jury system.  Does he envisage at this stage giving a plaintiff an opportunity of requesting the provision of a jury for, say, a serious case in which that plaintiff is involved where the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court now is up to £15,000?  In a case of that nature where £12,000. £14,000 or £15,000 is involved, the person desiring a jury should be entitled to have one.  The additional expense involved would not be too excessive.  In fairness to the plantiff and people involved in court actions, this provision should be made.  I ask the Minister of State to consider seriously the restoration of juries in cases of £15,000 or so in the Circuit Court where requested by the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Enright when referring to juries used the words &ldquo;the restoration of juries&rdquo; because under the Courts Act, 1971, juries for the purpose of civil cases were abolished.  It is not proposed in this legislation to restore &mdash; to use his word again &mdash; the jury system.  It has been said on a number of occasions that the jury system is a valuable one and that there is a certain strong lobby against juries at the moment.  I genuinely hold the view expressed by Deputy Enright that that lobby is pretty strong at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying is correct.  Firstly, the abolition of the jury system in the Courts Act, 1971, was based on information that indicated clearly the numbers of people who sought the jury presence in the Circuit Court prior to then.  For that reason it was considered desirable to abolish the jury system in the Circuit Court, and the person who seeks to go into the High Court today and avail of the jury system does so at some risk to himself.  I acknowledge that and I agree with the Deputy, but that is the risk that he has to take.  I would like to point out also that it is envisaged as a result of the proposed legislation that many family law cases will now come before the Circuit Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am speaking about juries.  I have been asked why juries should not be restored in this proposed legislation.  In fairness, if I am to give Deputy Enright a comprehensive answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It need not necessarily ever be acceptable over there, but that should not preclude me from giving my views even though they might not normally or naturally be acceptable to the Opposition parties or individual Deputies. I am sure Deputy Enright appreciates the fact that I am trying to give as comprehensive an answer as possible.  In that connection I referred to the fact that it is envisaged that the new jurisdiction of the Circuit Court will attract quite a number of family law cases.  As Deputy Keating will appreciate, this is a great step forward: that we can provide for the first time a proper judicial forum for the sensitive areas of family law cases in which heretofore there was admittedly <Col N="1789" /> some neglect.  Intimacies which are often related in court in such cases are such that it might be difficult, in certain circumstances, for them to be totally aired in that type of situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright referred to the fixing of lists.  I am informed that the fixing of lists for Circuit Courts is a quasi-judicial function.  However, I note Deputy Enright's views.  I also want to add that the administrative examination or hopefully restructuring which is being looked at at the moment includes that in the District Court content.  Maybe the suggestion which Deputy Enright has made is something that might more advisedly be put to the local bar associations and county registrars who might take it up at local level in their respective areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am speaking personally when I speak on this section.  I am not now practising as a solicitor and, therefore, I have no vested interest one way or the other.  I am a bit concerned about the increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £2,000 to £15,000.  I am concerned because quite substantial cases will now be heard in the Circuit Court dealing with running down actions and injuries received in those actions.  When we reach the figure of £15,000 we will be dealing with injuries which could only be dealt with in Dublin hospitals.  It follows from that that expert witnesses, consult-and surgeons and so on, will be required to attend in Circuit Courts throughout the country.  It will not be possible to procure the attendance of the highly qualified specialists in these courts because it will mean that a consultant will be required probably to be away from Dublin for two days, even if the case is reached on the day on which it is listed. The first duty of a surgeon or a specialist is to be available in his hospital to treat and cure people who are badly injured. If they are going to be running all around the country, from Donegal to Kerry, giving evidence in Circuit Courts, they will simply not be available in their hospitals in Dublin.  Furthermore, they would be coming to give evidence in cases where the plaintiff might very well be, and most <Col N="1790" /> likely would be, a man with no money.  If the case is won, he will get such fees as the county registrar may tax for his visit to the Circuit Court.  If the plaintiff loses the case, he will get nothing.  It is not going to be easy to arrange for the attendance of these witnesses in Circuit Courts. It is not in the interest of the proper running of specialist hospitals to do so.</P>
      <P>How is it possible to arrange this is Dublin?  It is a different setup altogether in Dublin.  A phone call will ensure that the witness is not required to leave his hospital for longer than perhaps half an hour before he is required in the witness box.  In that way, he can be available.  It can also be argued that county surgeons are required to go to Dublin.  That is so, but it is much easier to arrange for the country surgeon or country doctor to travel to Dublin, because he usually has a good professional and maybe personal relationship with the solicitor concerned. The solicitor can arrange that the doctor will not have to leave his hospital in the country in most instances until the solicitor is certain that the case is on.  Furthermore, if there were proper free legal aid available in running down actions &mdash; I understand there is not &mdash; then it might be argued that the witness would have his expenses paid anyway because of free legal aid.  The net result of this will be to provide an inferior court service for these running down actions.  It will also have the effect of forcing settlements upon plaintiffs which they might not otherwise accept, because they will have no alternative if the solicitor tells them that he simply cannot get the witness to come to Tralee, Letterkenny, Cavan or Roscommon. He will have no alternative but to settle the case.  The insurance companies will get to know this, they will hold out and there will be settlements forced on plaintiffs which they would not otherwise accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these increases in jurisdiction are being brought about the least that the Minister and the Government might do is to implement proper free legal aid so that witnesses can be paid if brought down to these courts.  Since I saw this measure being introduced I had this fear. For the same reason I am against the <Col N="1791" /> abolition of juries, which indirectly comes into this discussion because I believe that any running-down actions where the plaintiff might not have an open-and-shut case, where there would be a doubt, are settled where juries are concerned.  If there were no juries it follows that they would be tried by a judge without a jury and there are plaintiff's judges and defendant's judges and these are well known to the legal profession and to insurance companies.  One very well known judge who presided in our courts for a great number of years was known as a defendant's judge.  Cases that are listed or are likely to come before these judges will not be settled by the defendants who will let them run and take their chance.  I think the net result of the whole thing will be that justice will not be done in the long run as well or as sympathetically as it is done at present. I should like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for his comments, but I disagree with his estimate that the figure of £15,000 will necessarily involve the travelling of thousands of consultants around the country to the extent envisaged by the Deputy.  Deputy Keating raised this matter earlier and I explained that in the Dublin area there is a certain convenience because of the proximity of these people.  In rural areas there is not the same proximity even though they may be available in local hospitals.  I have before me the comments of the Court Committee on this matter.  They said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that a concentration of these cases in the District Court and the Circuit Court might create difficulties in the provision of the necessary medical evidence because some medical consultants might be reluctant to travel to various venues around the country rather than to the High Court in Dublin.  The Committee are not satisfied that there is real substance in these objections because experience has shown that in many of the cases in the High Court the consultants <Col N="1792" /> come from outside Dublin.  In cases of road accidents patients are more frequently than not treated in local hospitals and are treated by local consultants save in cases which develop serious complications where it may be necessary, as for example in the case of severe brain injury, to send the cases to specialist units in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I found, on examination of this, that it is in fact the situation.  In the vast majority of cases the consultants are those that were in a position to see the patient on admission to hospital in cases of road accidents particularly.  While I agree that proximity to Dublin makes matters much easier for all parties, in the country we can have the difficulty of a hospital being 30 or 40 miles away.  For a consultant required in court the travelling of that distance might cause in itself as much difficulty and hardship on a particular day as travelling perhaps 100 miles from outside Dublin if he were one of the type of specialists caring for the victim of a road accident that had suffered severe brain injury or something of that nature.  I am, however, satisfied that what is recommended in the committee's report is acceptable and that has been demonstrated on further examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also spoke about the jury system and the extension of legal aid.  I do not intend to comment on the legal aid system in the context of this legislation.  As regards the jury situation, as I have already said, they have not existed since 1971.  I do not know what the arguments were for or against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should not like, and I know Deputy Fitzpatrick does not intend, to have it felt abroad that there is such a thing as partiality among the Judiciary.  It has been long accepted that anything that would in any way, even though not intended in a certain way, endanger or undermine public confidence in our Judiciary or the courts could have very serious implications.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>You will see that this is so in the debates published next week. There is a very big body of opinion on this side of the House who feel that this extension will cause problems for many litigants.  If I may give an example of a Circuit Court case, a person who receives an ankle or knee injury may be off work for one year and lose £6,000 in wages. First he may be in a local hospital and then a Dublin hospital.  This could cost about £20 a day, then he has to pay doctors fees and he could have further expenses of £4,000 or £5,000 In all, his expenses could amount to £11,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When his ankle has healed perfectly he might wonder how much compensation <Col N="1795" /> he will get.  Will he get more than £4,000? If so, he will be all right if he goes to the High Court, but, if he gets less and goes to the High Court he will be faced with costs.  This person will have to face these problems.  If he is facing a jury he probably will be treated more generously than if only one person hears his case.  For that reason there is a strong case to have the jury system restored to the Circuit Court. This would give people more confidence in having their cases heard in the Circuit Court and I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with expert witnesses and went on to deal with the settling of the lists.  He regarded that as a quasi-judicial procedure.  If we have to bring consultants, surgeons and some of the top people from the Richmond, St. Vincents and the Rehabilitation Centre to, say, Tralee or Castlebar&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  A top surgeon left our county hospital some years ago and he is famous all over Europe.</P>
      <P>Injured people often come to Dublin for treatment.  When their cases are heard in the Circuit Court the specialists must come from Dublin.  If the cases are not heard on the appropriate date, the injured person is faced with the difficult problem of asking these specialists to come back.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very fair with his replies but I do not believe he fully understands the unsatisfactory nature of the listing of cases.  This is one problem he must tackle.  If he organised a consultative meeting with the county registrars, judges, the bar counsel, the Incorporated Law Society, and senior officials of the Department, this problem could be very satisfactorily resolved.</P>
      <P>Our courts should be streamlined. They should be an example of efficiency and administration but unfortunately, because of the unsatisfactory nature of the listing of cases, they are not.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and I would like to hear his comments.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I must clear up one point.  In the course of my last contribution I stated that insurance companies would be more likely to contest running down actions listed before judges without juries.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am glad to hear that, but the Minister spent some time making a case for the integrity of judges.  Nobody has more respect or confidence in the Judiciary than I have, but I still believe they are human and therefore fallible.  I still believe some judges who preside in our courts in running down actions are known as plaintiffs' judges and others as defendants' judges.  I was making the case that where insurance companies know these cases are being heard before a judge with a jury, they will let the case go to a hearing rather than settle it.  Justice is very often obtained far more effectively through a settlement than through an all-out contest.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has made the case for £15,000 jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.  I believe it will work out as a hardship against plaintiffs, who will find it quite difficult to secure the services of the necessary expert witnesses based in Dublin who will have to travel from Dublin to give evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot imagine what politician could make a point in six minutes but I will do my best to complete my contribution. My main concern is for the injustice committed on the people who entrusted themselves to the tour operator we are now discussing and I made a suggestion that there may be some way in which we could compensate them from a fund to be set up by the Minister under his proposed legislation. I suggest that it should be called a travellers protection fund and that when sufficient funds were accumulated, assuming that another Bray Travel horror story did not happen in the meantime, the possibility of compensating the victims of the Bray Travel collapse might be considered. However, I wonder whether those who would subscribe towards such a fund would agree to its use in compensating these people.  That is another difficulty. I am sure that the Minister will examine these matters and will take the necessary decisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister met an <i>ad hoc</i> committee representing the Bray Travel victims and had a long and searching discussion with these very decent people.  They are good citizens who are most unfortunate in having lost money through their dealings with Bray Travel.  Having met the Minister and had a very strong dialogue with him I believe they understood his position and understood why he could not subscribe to the Bill before the House, in spite of his sympathy for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to compensate the Bray Travel victims from Exchequer funds. This has happened once in our recent history in relation to the Irish Trust Bank. That was a matter which went to the very foundations of the financial institutions of the State and the banking system and <Col N="1798" /> reflected on the creditworthiness of this country.  The decision taken on that issue was the correct one.</P>
    <P>Whilst one might at times question Deputy Hegarty's sincerity, it is probably fair to say that he introduced this Bill with the good intention of trying to secure some form of compensation for these victims. I believe it is a fairly well-intentioned Bill which seeks to achieve something which cannot be achieved.  Deputy Hegarty seeks retrospective compensation for those involved in this fiasco. Every member of this House, regardless of party, would like to achieve that aim. We have heard one hardship case after another during the course of this debate and we would all wish to see compensation being paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin by referring to a point made by Deputy Andrews. While it is quite true that an Opposition do not have the responsibility with regard to managing finances that a Government have, it is a rather feeble and worn-out weapon to throw at an Opposition to say they want more money to be spent.  When I was Government Whip in the last Dáil I remember watching the Opposition's performance in Private Members' Time and week in and week out in times of severe financial stringency they were drafting and debating motions which called for very substantial State expenditure. That was at a time when the State's finances were a great deal healthier than they are now and the national debt was about one-third of what it is today, less than four years later.  These were appeals made from the Opposition side in the last Dáil and they would have brushed aside as a trivial argument the suggestion that an Opposition have no business calling for State expenditure.  If they are not <Col N="1799" /> allowed to do so, they might as well pack up and go home because most improvements and reliefs require State expenditure.</P>
      <P>In this instance, any element of State expenditure would be purely temporary. Deputy Hegarty's Bill, which he never claimed to be perfectly drafted, envisages that the fund would be launched in the first instance by a Government loan but would subsequently become self-perpetuating and would generate sufficient revenue to support its future operation.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on three of the matters with which the Minister for Transport dealt in his very unsuccessful attempt to rebut the points made by Deputy Hegarty in his speech.  The weakest of the Minister's points, whether it was his own invention or given to him by some adviser, was his statement that this Bill refers only to air travel.  He asked why it should be restricted to air travel and why surface travel should not also be included.  I have nothing against including surface travel and I imagine Deputy Hegarty feels the same, but in legislation one deals as far as possible with the broad, typical case.  One sees an evil or a gap in the conditions of life and tries to fill that gap.  One cannot pretend that one has filled every gap or closed every loophole and left nobody with a sense of grievance.  Very nearly all mass travel of the kind which is handled by tour operators is air travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea travel has got back to the point that there is no longer such a thing as a liner plying from western Europe to the United States.  One cannot travel to New York by a regular line and see the famous skyline and the Statue of Liberty sinking in the sunset.  That has not been possible for many years.  The rhetoric in the Minister's speech was supposed to make us think that these surface operators were commonplace but that is not the case. Sea travel is the prerogative of cruise operators who cater for a very small and specialised market.  I do not mean to belittle such a market.  I have never been able to afford the money or time to go on a cruise; frankly, I confess I would be bored to death at being cooped up on a <Col N="1800" /> ship with the same people for weeks on end.  However, I have never been on such a cruise and I cannot speak with personal authority, but I know it is a very restricted and small end of the travel market.</P>
    <P>The mass market which is what is in Deputy Hegarty's mind and in the minds of this party in connection with the problems caused by the collapse of Bray Travel is the air market.  It was a very feeble objection that the Minister should point to this supposed gap in Deputy Hegarty's Bill as, to some extent, invalidating it.  If that is a serious objection by the Minister, what is to stop him from putting down an amendment to extend the benefits to sea travel or to surface travel by rail?  No doubt the rail sector is bigger than the sea sector, although I do not know how in this country a person can start on a foreign tour by rail without in the first instance taking a boat.  Perhaps the Minister has some idea of how that could be done?  If he thinks that is a serious problem, let him amend our Bill in order to include this category.</P>
    <P>A more serious objection to which he referred on two occasions, and which I thought seemed to lurk in the concluding remarks of Deputy David Andrews, related to the retrospective element in what was proposed by Deputy Hegarty. I should like to quote from the Minister's speech on this point.  At column 693 of the Official Report dated 3 March he stated:</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows that retrospective legislation is frowned upon, not alone by this Parliament but indeed by every other House of Parliament, except for very obvious, specific reasons.</P>
    <P>That is wrong.  The Minister is mixing up criminal legislation with legislation that has no criminal content.  It is true that criminal retroactive penal legislation which would have the effect of subjecting somebody to a penalty for a deed that was not a crime when it was done is objectionable.  That is a breach of natural justice and a flagrant unconstitutionality. It is absolutely illegal here.  It is against the common conscience of mankind and it cannot be done in any country that knows the rule of law.  It is also true that <Col N="1801" /> courts here and elsewhere tend to lean against legislation, even though it may not be criminal legislation, which is retroactive in its imposition of burdens. Courts take a poor view of this and jealously construe legislation which has the effect of imposing burdens retroactively. For instance, to subject somebody to a tax liability in respect of a period during which he had no reason to suppose any tax liability would attach to him is an objectionable form of legislation.  It is not unconstitutional so long as it is not criminal but it is objectionable.</P>
    <P>What has that to do with the measure before the House?  We are not proposing the retroactive imposition of any penalties. Deputy Hegarty is not proposing to hang, draw and quarter Bray Travel, to confiscate their goods, to impeach them or to exile them.  All he wants to do is to provide a fund that will start from a date before this disaster happened and which will leave the people concerned as though their travel arrangements had not been disrupted.  That has nothing to do with the objectionable aspect of retroactivity which lawyers talk about and which the Minister has obviously misunderstood.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect is the question of the State stepping in to bail out people.  The Minister, Deputy David Andrews and another Fianna Fáil Deputy referred to this matter.  Deputy Hegarty is as well aware of this as anybody else in this House.  For the State always to be regarded as the wise, compassionate mother who soothes the crying child, even if the child has hurt himself by doing something he was not supposed to do, is an image which I admit evokes a concept of the State that will destroy it in the end because there is no end to the burdens the State will be expected to take on.  That is the heart of the Government's Opposition to our measure, namely, that it expects the State to pick up the tab for things for which the State traditionally has not regarded itself as liable.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not offending anybody on either side of the House when I say that I see a certain validity in that point of view.  I have said myself that there is a <Col N="1802" /> limit &mdash; and in this poor country a very quickly reached limit &mdash; to the degree to which the State can accept the imposition of further burdens.  Burdens are thrust upon it at election times as, for example, when a form of taxation to which nobody had raised any objection was removed in order to get votes.  I refer to the removal of car tax in 1977.  That is a burden on the State, every bit as much as though the State had taken upon itself the obligation of compensating every victim of any kind of misfortune for the next few years.  In as much as a source of revenue was taken from the State, that was a burden placed upon it because it must find the same amount of money to do the job from some other source.</P>
    <P>In a sense it does not lie in the mouths of Fianna Fáil Deputies to whinge about the State creaking under the burdens being laid on it by the Opposition or by interests outside the House who lobby the Government.  It does not lie in their mouths to talk like that when they have laid an equivalent burden on the State by making cheap promises in return for votes, which took the form of relieving people from imposts such as motor tax. I know it is back with us under another name and with another doubling up it will be back with us in full severity.  What Fianna Fáil did was a burden on the State every bit as much as the assumption by the State of a new sphere of liability.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will not think me unreasonable in making that simple political point.  It is a political point &mdash; that is what we are in business for.  However, having said that, I think there is a certain substance in the argument that the State cannot be expected to pick up the pieces and stitch them together in the case of every private misfortune.</P>
    <P>In regard to that admission I want to say three things and I will be brief about them.  In a general sense it would be a good idea if some Minister for Finance, some Government, were to think, even if only experimentally, of including an item in the budget in every year to set up a fund.  It does not matter about putting a figure on it &mdash; £2 million, £3 million, even a couple of hundred thousand.  The administration of that fund would be at <Col N="1803" /> the discretionary decision of an independent commissioner to be used in respect of calamities, disasters, personal misfortunes of all kinds that would occur in a particular calendar year.  Naturally not a penny could be paid out until the year was over because, should there be a disaster in January or February, the whole fund could be exhausted.  Nobody would know whether or not disasters would arise in July, August and September which would make further calls on a fund which could by then be exhausted. Therefore the fund could not be called on until the end of the year.  But it could then be discretionally allocated by an independent administrator, somebody in the same position of public confidence as a judge or an ombudsman, to people who were the victims of all kinds of misfortune. A businessman or a trader who finds that he must go out of business on account of other people's bankruptcies or somebody who is the victim of a misfortune for which the law does not at present provide any scheme of compensation is as fully entitled to the compassion of his fellow citizen as somebody who has been let down through the disappointment of a contract or a very large, disgracefully large, series of contracts, as was the case with the Bray Travel victims.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have wandered somewhat into the matter of principle from the strict terms of what this Bill is all about.  But if one were to look at the question of public assistance, public relief or public compassion for individuals who have been injured, or who have suffered misfortune, if one were to look at that general field without pre-conceived notions, one would see a great number of inconsistencies and gaps.  For example, I have got a car parked in the car park here this evening.  If Deputy Flynn over there, in a fit of dissatisfaction with anything I might say, goes out and punctures its tyres, pushes in the windscreen and pours sugar into the petrol tank, that is a malicious injury for which I can be compensated by Dublin Corporation.  But if that same car is injured through his negligence, in the absence of an insurance scheme &mdash; I know there is an insurance <Col N="1804" /> scheme applying to his driving of his own car &mdash; I get no compensation.</P>
    <P>Supposing it is negligence in some other way, suppose Deputy Flynn walks out of the House carrying a heavy parcel on his shoulder and lets it fall in such a way that it damages my car, I get no compensation for that; it is just my bad luck.  It may be that the Deputy will be decent enough to compensate me out of his pocket but, on the other hand, he may not.  In other words, negligence, neglect, except for the very narrowly defined spheres of road negligence, leaves the victim exposed to the possibility of bringing a civil action.  He must bring his own civil action and there will be no one to step in and pay his costs against the party who is injured.  Or, suppose I am a businessman and I am injured &mdash; I have been driven out of business by the failure of somebody to pay his bills.  I have got to have cash liquidity also, so I am gone.  I may have to let a lot of workmen or employees go and so on.  My business is ruined.  My life is disrupted, not through any fault of mine.  I am in a situation of personal disaster.  There are many such situations in the country.</P>
    <P>The employees of Bray Travel were adverted to by Deputy Hegarty and others on this side of the House and I suppose, in fairness, I should say on the other side of the House.  They are not envisaged in any existing scheme.  Therefore there could be a case for a Government &mdash; I freely admit the thing could get out of hand and become unworkable &mdash; but there would be a case for a Government including, even if only experimentally, in their social welfare programme for a year or two an item which would allow discretionary awards to be made at the expiry of a year or two years to any kind of person who had suffered any loss or injury of a kind which ought to excite the compassion of his neighbours but for which there is no existing statutory scheme.</P>
    <P>That is a general thought.  I do not know whether it will be scooped up by the Fianna Fáil election machine, which by now I have no doubt is desperate.  If so, I will make them a present of it.  Of course I will not neglect to claim it as <Col N="1805" /> mine if it ever surfaces.  It may or may not have merit, but it would be worth trying at least experimentally.  I want to say to the Government, represented now solely by Deputy Flynn over there, that until we have such a scheme we have no option but to work from hand to mouth and from case to case.  It is exactly for that purpose that Deputy Hegarty's Bill was introduced.  It does not propose to burden the State with the permanent liability of compensating the victims of travel firm collapses.  It proposes, in the first instance, that the State should get such a fund off the ground by means of a loan, but that thereafter it should be self-supporting.</P>
    <P>What can we do in the absence of a general fund?  I perfectly recognise all the points made on the far side of the House about the State picking up the bill for people who never expected in the past the State to pick up their bill.  That is why I say: &ldquo;Very well, let us have a general social fund, a general disaster fund, or misfortune fund.  I do not mind what it is called &mdash; and Taisee Mí-ádh, if Deputy Flynn wishes.  Let us award it a certain amount in a discretionary way at the end of an appropriate accounting period &mdash; I suppose a year.  But until we have such a fund how can Deputy Hegarty or any of us go to our constituents &mdash; and a lot of my constituents were hit by this collapse also &mdash; and say: &ldquo;Look, you are not really in a different situation from people who are hit by bankruptcy, or by injuries of a kind for which nobody has thought of taking out insurance and for which no statutory scheme exists?&rdquo; That is not an answer for them.  All they can ask is that their elected representatives of this and the other House do their best in the given circumstances to provide compensation for them.</P>
    <P>I think I have gone a very great distance in admitting the difficulties and weaknesses there are in compensating people in contexts in which the State has not previously provided compensation.  I have made a concrete suggestion as to how we might &mdash; of course, we can never have perfect happiness in this world &mdash; go some distance towards remedying this in the future.  But we are talking about <Col N="1806" /> the present and, for the present, Deputy Hegarty has done his best at short notice. This Party do not claim any perfection in drafting.  We are perfectly willing to accept criticisms of what I might call a Committee Stage kind in regard to this Bill.  I am sure Deputy Hegarty will not show the same arrogance as Ministers commonly show when Committee Stage amendments are put up from the Opposition side.  Having made all of these admissions, I think Deputy Hegarty has done a very good and just day's work in regard to the hardship caused by the massive collapse.  The arguments which have been brought into the field against him from the far side have nothing like sufficed to overturn the case he has made. I very much hope that the House will pass the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am not going to play to the gallery in my contribution here this evening. But it is incumbent on me to put the record straight on some of the rather lukewarm comments made here by the Fine Gael Party in support of this Bill, a Bill hastily put together which in no way deals in a proper manner with the problem in hand.  I was glad to hear Deputy Kelly, the last speaker from the Opposition side, admit that the weaknesses of the Bill were enormous.  Consequently, when our Bill comes before the House, I will be expecting him to give it a good and honest hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, in his statement, gave a very clear and explicit <Col N="1807" /> indication of how the Government see the situation in the wake of the Bray Travel collapse.  The travel business is a fairly large sector of economic activity.  It is very complex by virtue of the number of parties and interests involved including not only major tour operators but also retail agents, carriers, and members of the public.  The range of holidays and packages available, some based on charter services, some on scheduled promotional fares, sometimes in association with other facilities and ground arrangements, at other times in isolation, represent an added complexity.  Most complex of all is the whole area of contract and the nature of the contractual arrangements between the many parties involved.  It is quite clear that any attempt at regulation in this area requires a great deal of preparation and forethought and it is that very fact that is the primary reason why the preparation of an appropriate package of measures is taking what may seem like a long time.  I am confident, however, that the end results will justify the amount of time and effort being put into the preparation of the required measures.</P>
    <P>It is clear, as the Minister for Transport has shown, that the present measure does not address itself in any meaningful way to the root of the problem.  We are being asked to treat an infection.  Treatment, without an attempt to prevent in the first instance, involves misdirected effort.  The Deputy's Bill has made no attempt to get at the root of the problem.  It is a remedial rather than a preventative measure.  In essence the Bill does no more than provide for the closure of the stable door after the horse has bolted.  That is not enough.  We must try to ensure that the horse cannot bolt in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>And then the horse will be starved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins, in the course of his contribution last week, disputed a statement made by the Minister to the effect that the Fine Gael move represented an abuse of Private Members' <Col N="1808" /> Time.  What the Minister was referring to in that instance was not the right of Members to introduce a Private Members' Bill.  What was at issue was the fact &mdash; clearly confirmed &mdash; that what Fine Gael were looking for to give real teeth to their measure was a commitment that the Exchequer would come to the rescue. Standing Orders do not allow for this type of measure in a Private Members' Bill and the attempt by the promoter to circumvent this rule is a blatant abuse of Private Members' Time and was aimed solely at currying political favour with the unfortunate victims of Bray Travel.</P>
      <P>Far from dealing effectively with the problems involved, the Bill serves only to confuse the situation.  The Bill has raised expectations which have no prospect of being fulfilled.  Deputy Hegarty's Bill is an enabling measure only.  Even if, for the sake of argument, it were passed, it would be necessary to make detailed regulations to set up the fund provided for in the Bill.  Further effort would be necessary in devising detailed rules to govern payments from the fund and, of course, the establishment of the relevant agency to administer the whole scheme would consume further time.  None of those points have been made clear and the Deputy has been anything but forthright on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the question of bonding and licensing in his introductory statement.  The present measure does not incorporate any of those elements.  The Bill before us simply means that travellers are being asked to pay for their own protection.  The Deputy's measure leaves the trade free to continue accepting money over the counter from members of the public for holiday packages that might or might not materialise depending on the particular circumstances of the individual travel organiser concerned. The aim must be to deal with the specific characteristics of the business which can lead to financial collapse.  Any meaningful attempt to improve the situation necessitates a number of things: firstly, a clear unambiguous understanding of the trade and its characteristics and an accurate diagnosis of problem areas; secondly, <Col N="1809" /> a clear well-thought out scheme to deal with the matter in an incisive way; thirdly, a recognition that improvements cannot be effected overnight; and fourthly the will to resist the temptation to seek short-term political gain by bringing in a half-hearted and inadequate response at this stage.  It is obvious that the latter temptation proved too much for the Deputy and the proof of his haste is demonstrated by the deficiencies in his Bill and that is agreed by some Opposition speakers.  The Deputy's measure puts no onus whatever on the trade to protect its customers.  I want no one to be in any doubt about that point.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has made great play of the undertaking by the then Minister.  Deputy Faulkner in 1977 to introduce legislation and has sought to allege a complacent and lethargic approach in follow-up with appropriate measures.  However, the Deputy has completely missed the point.  The fact is that when the major Court Line collapse occurred in Britain in 1974, an event that should have signalled the need to provide for preventive measures here, the Coalition, then in power, failed utterly to act and it was left to Fianna Fáil on its re-election in 1977 to give a public commitment to introduce appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>Were any Dáil Questions put down by the Opposition following subsequent failures in the trade such as Sunjet and Star Holidays Ltd?  The answer is no.  The Opposition at the time, far from being in tune, were completely out of touch with the situation, had no sense of public responsibility and failed to appreciate the need to act at that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has suggested that if there are defects in the Bill, these could be remedied by way of appropriate amendment.  That, I am afraid, is not a feasible proposition.  The defects in the Bill, to which Minister Reynolds drew attention, are not the basic reasons that explain the Minister's inability to support the measure.  The position taken up by the Minister is based on a more fundamental consideration, namely, the radical difference in philosophy underlying this Bill and that promised by the Minister <Col N="1810" /> which is based on the need for a broad approach that would deal with the totality of the situation.  Amendments, at this point, would not bridge this gulf between the two approaches or bring about any meaningful improvement in the present measure.  Amendments at this point would only improve the technicalities of the Bill but would in no way alter the philosophy behind it.  The philosophy we will incorporate in our Bill will protect the public and put the onus on the trade to do something about it.  I am anxious to emphasise that point because it constitutes the nub of the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy has accused the Minister of adopting a destructive rather than a constructive approach to the Bill.  The Minister has gone to great pains to justify the position which he has taken.  The Minister has made clear his conviction that the primary onus for protecting the traveller must be with the travel trade itself.  The Bill leaves the trade untouched and not only that, it seeks to ask the traveller to pay what amounts to a tax for his own protection.  The Opposition appreciate these points but are not prepared to acknowledge them.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Deputy introduced the question of retrospection in his Bill because of the natural expectations which that created among those unfortunate enough to have lost their hard-earned money with Bray Travel.  It must have been obvious to Deputy Hegarty that there was no question of making public moneys available as he has suggested. The Deputy's action was calculated to embarrass the Minister and the Government but in my view all it has served to do is to raise expectations unreasonably, only to have such expectations shattered. The Deputy's action, therefore, has been more a source of acute disappointment to clients of Bray Travel than an embarrassment for the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty referred in his introduction to the potential effects of the Bray Travel collapse on foreign tourists contemplating holidays in Ireland.  He raised the question whether such tourists could have any confidence making bookings for holidays here and argued that Irish tourism could suffer as a result.  On <Col N="1811" /> all these points the Deputy is misinformed. The collapse of Bray Travel should have no effect on incoming tourism. Irish tour operators are involved mainly in outgoing tourism, that is to say, in arranging holiday packages abroad for Irish people.</P>

      <P>Tourists coming here from abroad do so in many cases on the basis of packages arranged by travel organisers in their home countries and they enjoy the benefit of such protection schemes as may exist in their respective countries.  I hope that this will clear up any misconceptions about potential damage to Irish tourism which may have been created by Deputy Hegarty's claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not present in the House on the evening the Deputy introduced his Bill, but on reading the Official Report, column 687, of 3 March I was surprised, indeed taken aback, by the suggestion that the fund proposed in his Bill should also be applied to compensate staff of Bray Travel who lost money or wages following that company's collapse. Where does the Deputy envisage that the line should be drawn in compensating creditors of Bray Travel?  If staff claims are conceded and met from the proceeds of the fund, what about other general creditors of Bray Travel such as airlines, foreign hoteliers, apartment owners and <Col N="1812" /> so on?  The Deputy is unwittingly, or otherwise, seeking to create precedents that would end up in the creation of a bottomless pit.  In other countries where such funds exist for the protection of holidaymakers, they are applied for that purpose only and I must say that I am not aware of one single instance where such funds are also applied for the benefit of creditors generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

      <P>What I am saying here is not to understate the dilemma which arose for staff of Bray Travel who lost their employment as a result of the collapse. I have, of course, the utmost sympathy for the people who lost their jobs. In the overall context, however, I would ask, are the employees of Bray Travel to be treated in a special way in contrast to employees of other companies who lost or who, in the future, might lose their jobs through liquidation of the company in which they were or are employed?</P>
      <P>The action taken in the case of the Irish Trust Bank in 1977 has been cited as a precedent in support of retrospection for Bray Travel clients and the Deputies have laid particular emphasis on that aspect.  The Minister for Transport has already dismissed that case as a precedent. The statement issued by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance at the time emphasised the <i>ex-gratia</i> nature of the payments made.  It was stressed that the Government had authorised those exceptional measures in order to reinforce the high standing of Irish financial institutions.</P>

I would like to remind the House that when the relevant Bill relating to the Irish Trust Bank was before the House, it was opposed by Fine Gael.  The position <Col N="1813" /> adopted by the party in that case is at variance with the attitude of the Opposition in this instance and seems to confirm the view that the present measure is designed more with political gain in mind than with bringing about any improvement in the travel business.  I challenge the Deputy to clarify the shift in his party's position between the case of the Irish Trust Bank Bill and the present measure.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the Deputy's mind. In his introduction he stated that he looked upon this Bill as stage one in a two-stage operation &mdash; the first stage covering bonding and the second stage to be concerned with licensing.  That is fine but his Bill incorporates no licensing or bonding provisions whatever.  The Deputy seems to be equating the fund provided for in his Bill with bonding.  That is incorrect. Bonding is generally an arrangement applicable to individuals or firms under which a sum of money becomes available to a third party or trustee to compensate creditors in the event of a business collapse.  A reserve fund of the kind proposed by the Deputy is exactly what its name implies &mdash; a fund which is normally only called upon if, for example, the individual's bond proves inadequate in relation to the liabilities arising. If the Deputy is serious about bonding and licensing, could he explain why these aspects are not provided for in his Bill?</P>

      <Col N="1814" /> Critics have implied that if there had already been protective measures in operation, clients of Bray Travel would have suffered no losses.  It is true, indeed, that if the Government were to regulate every aspect of our lives, we would never suffer any material loss.  But does the country want an ever-increaseing level of Government regulation or not?  The Government have been criticised in this case for the absence of regulation and in other instances have had to endure accusations from the other side of the House of excess State interference.  It is a fact of modern life that the Government are blamed for everything nowadays.</P>

      <P>I would refer to press reports over the weekend relating to an offer by a certain tour firm of 50 holidays to Miami for victims of the Bray Travel collapse.  The reports in question suggested that the offer was being made as a straight trade in exchange for Government approval of a proposed holiday series by the company in question.  I want to make it clear that applications for flight approval for air charter packages are considered on their merits and that the Minister will not entertain offers of any kind in exchange for traffic rights.</P>

      <Col N="1815" /> During the debate, reference was made to the claim that the Bray Travel companies had not submitted audited accounts for a number of years and the allegation was made that the authorities were remiss in not following the matter up.  As the Minister for Transport indicated during replies to Dáil Questions on 10 February last, the claims relating to non-submission of accounts by the Bray Travel companies were brought to the notice of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism who is the responsible Minister under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>I understand that Bray Travel Limited and their associated companies, are private companies and as such are not required to furnish annual accounts to the Companies Registration Office.  That requirement applies only to public companies. In such cases annual accounts must be furnished to the Companies Office but that office have no function in scrutinising them with a view to any investigation.  The accounts are filed merely for the information of the general public.</P>

      <P>All companies are required under the Companies Act, 1963, to furnish annual returns to the Companies Registration Office containing information about directors, shareholdings and so on.  These returns would not be of any relevance to the question of a company's financial position.  Perhaps that is where Deputy Hegarty got his lines wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have inquired whether there is to be any investigation of the affairs of the Bray Travel Companies. The Minister for Transport has no function in this area.  The Bray Travel case is a court liquidation and there are provisions in such cases for dealing with instances of apparent offences by officers of such a company, and of bringing such to the notice of the Director of Public Prosecutions for appropriate action.  I suggest to the Deputies on the other side of the House that the measure would be best left with the courts who are dealing <Col N="1816" /> with the matter at this time and any appropriate action that they deem necessary can be undertaken by them and not as suggested by the Deputy who obviously is not familiar with what the Companies Act requires of private companies.</P>

      <P>The debate on this measure has given rise to a great deal of publicity and interest and I believe that the public will be well able to assess the pros and cons of the situation and recognise the commonsense approach of the Government in this matter.</P>
      <P>Most of the arguments of substance have been explored and exhaustively debated.  The Minister for Transport has made crystal clear the distinction between the philosophy of the present measure and the broader approach which underlies the alternative measures at present being prepared in his Department. Our measures will be comprehensive and will deal in totality with the whole process of bonding, licensing and regulations right from the fundamentals of tour operators, and not try in a party political way to gain short-term advantage at the expense of the general public. Those alternative measures will deal with the totality of the situation and will not deal with it in a piecemeal fashion as this Bill is doing.  The Minister's approach will provide a concrete foundation that will protect the public by improving the calibre and professionalism of the trade in the years ahead and put the travel trade on a basis from which it will be able to grow and at the same time be better able to meet the needs of the public whom it is there to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly in his submission admitted that there were severe shortcomings and weaknesses in his own party's Bill.  I would have thought that a man of his considerable talent in legal matters would not have allowed Deputy Hegarty, in the first instance, to frame legislation that would be totally incomplete and unable to deal with the problem that has arisen. <Col N="1817" /> But for some unknown reason Deputy Kelly is now at variance with his own Deputy in promoting this Bill and is suggesting that we cannot close every loophole in one fell swoop.  We all quite readily understand that it is not possible to close every loophole with one simple piece of legislation.  Some Deputy on the far side of the House did on the last occasion we were here refer to it as a simple measure.  I would not be unkind enough to suggest that surely it is a simple measure for simpletons.  But unfortunately we are not dealing with simpletons in this country and we must provide a framework of legislation that will be able to go to the nub of the matter and provide the right kind of protection for the general public so that what has happened now will not in future be able to happen again in the same circumstance.  That is the whole idea and I appreciate greatly that Deputy Hegarty would go to the trouble of seeking to bring in a Private Members' Bill.  But he will have to recognise that Deputies on his own side of the House agree with the Government side that this is a short-term measure, that it is in no way a comprehensive Bill and consequently, in all seriousness, the Opposition parties could not expect the Government on this occasion to promote or support or to deal with this measure in any way than by voting it down.</P>
    <P>Our measure will be coming in shortly and it will deal comprehensively with the whole business of tour operators here. Some of the extravagant language used here on the other occasions when this Bill was being discussed left a lot to be desired.  Such suggestions as bringing in legislation by way of reaction is not a good fundamental basis for legislation in the general view of the public.  I am suggesting that Deputy Hegarty's legislation in no way fulfils the need or the desire of the general public in dealing with this matter.  I am not suggesting that the Deputies on the far side were totally playing to the gallery.  It did form a major part of their effort but some good suggestions did come from both sides of the House and the Deputies on both sides can rest assured that when we are promoting our Bill through the House we <Col N="1818" /> will take due cognizance of the various aspects of the arguments put forward. But it would be inconceivable for the Government to suggest that they would allow themselves to deal with this Bill knowing full well that what they were putting forward was a short-term measure in no way dealing with the fundamental aspects of the problem.  Even in the short title of the Bill the word &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; implies the existence of other measures. I was only sorry that in his introductory submission Deputy Hegarty could not tell us what these other measures were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that it was short sightedness and that he was unable to do it because had he had any clear idea of what was required to deal with this problem at this time he would have made a full and comprehensive statement dealing with all aspects of the trade and saying how the licensing and bonding might be introduced.  Not only was the Deputy not familiar with what was necessary to protect the public in this instance, he completely forgot to deal in any significant way whatsoever with bonding or licensing arrangements and this must be a serious miscalculation on the part of the Opposition. If, for no other reason, since bonding and licensing have not even been adverted to in the Bill to any great extent, how could any Government be expected to support it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took particular note of some of the provisions in the Bill and the House can rest assured that if we were even to support this Bill in its totality we would have to deal with the Restrictive Practices Commission right away in that it deals only with certain people in certain associations and there is no talk whatsoever about the tour operators who are not members of the various organisations.  I suppose the Deputy would be able to handle the Restrictive Practices Commission on that score when the time came. It must be remembered that in regard to the contributions to the fund, what in essence this Bill asks the general public and people who would be taking holidays <Col N="1819" /> to do is simply to pay a tax to protect themselves.  I do not think that is fair.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is fair or reasonable to suggest that those people who are going to take holidays with their hard-earned money this year or any year in the future would have to put up their own protection money.

I am sorry that for the sake of short-term political gain Deputy Hegarty and his friends obviously formulated and framed this legislation without even consulting with their senior legal advisers.  They should now come in here and beg forgiveness of the House.  Deputy Hegarty would be better advised to withdraw the Bill at this stage and to wait to make a decent submission when our total Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not unmindful on this side of the House of the need for this legislation. We are not unmindful of the hardship that has been suffered by the people who paid their hard-earned money.  But what we are being asked to do by Deputy Hegarty is to create a precedent of a bottomless pit that would have to be <Col N="1820" /> applied to all creditors of all companies in liquidation in the future.  No responsible Government would do that.  We will not take that stand but will bring in, in the very near future, legislation that will protect for the future all those who place their money in the hands of tour operators in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State was obviously sent in here today to do a job.  If quantity and value can measure the depth of the job he has tried to do then he has got his point across.  But I do not think he has impressed because he has put forward here some of the strangest arguments for not supporting the Opposition Bill to compensate the victims of the Bray Travel collapse.  Indeed, we have listened to some of the strangest arguments &mdash; not too many, let me say &mdash; from the back benches of Fianna Fáil in these last two weeks when this measure was being discussed.  It is fairly obvious that the Minister of State was sent in here to do this job this evening and I believe he has failed miserably.</P>
      <P>There is a precedent for retrospective compensation and the precedent has been referred to by the Minister himself.  It dates back to 1977 and the need for this measure dates back to 1977 and before that year.  It is not that something has been foisted upon us suddenly or that these people have found themselves in the situation in which they now find themselves quite as suddenly as that, because we have had warnings before.  The Minister has referred to it and other speakers have referred to other collapses and the utterences from the Irish Travel Agents Association.  It is worth recalling that in Killarney in 1977 the predecessor of the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, undertook to bring in a measure to ensure that the suffering which had been inflicted on a small number of people to that date would not be inflicted on future travellers. I think he gave a firm commitment, I am sure, on behalf of the Government, that some steps would be taken or some measure put through this House to protect those who were booking holidays abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> Now we have the Junior Minister here this evening accusing the Opposition of rushing in a measure and not waiting for a Government measure &mdash; may I say the long-promised Government Bill?  If we succeed here tonight in convincing the Minister of the need for this measure, then we will have achieved something and I do not care how rushed the measure is.  I am not in agreement with the Minister of State &mdash; or the Minister when he spoke here a fortnight ago &mdash; that there are so many defects in this Bill now proposed by Deputy Hegarty, but if we succeed in convincing the Minister in the short time left to him in office &mdash; or is he hoping that he will not have to handle the measure and that the election will take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; sooner than he can bring forward his own Bill?  Judging by the speed with which he has worked, seeing that his predecessor promised the measure as far back as that Killarney speech of 1977, I do not think we can expect the measure before the election.</P>
      <P>I want to make a couple of points about this.  I am not going to go over all the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Flynn, in his contribution because those who read his contribution in the morning or listen to it on radio tonight and many of those who are affected who are listening to him here this evening, will not be convinced by Government opposition to this measure, a rather strange opposition because the Government would not have lost any more face than they have already lost in failing to bring forward the Bill since it was promised in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could easily have given in, all right, with amendments if he saw a defect or two.  Let us face it, the Opposition are restricted in bringing in Bills, as we all know, because we cannot put a burden on the Exchequer and any Bills brought in by the Opposition would have to be defective, if one could call that defective, in some way because their Bills must be framed in a way that calls for no <Col N="1822" /> financing from the Exchequer.  However, this Bill is merely asking that the Exchequer by a vote of this House would lend to the agency which would be set up under the Bill sufficient capital to compensate those who were injured by the collapse of Bray Travel.  Great play has been made here in the hour-and-a-half debate last week and the previous week about retrospective compensation.  It is worth recalling that on 10 August 1977, shortly after the Government came into office &mdash; maybe to fulfil a promise which they made more hurriedly than this Bill was drafted &mdash; as with many another promise they thought they might not have to honour, they fooled the electorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>They drafted the manifesto of 1977 in such a way and in such a hurried fashion that they saw the ground slipping from under them and they thought that many of the promises in that manifesto would not have to be honoured.  This may have been one of those promises.  However, the precedent is there, and on 10 August 1977 the then Minister for Finance, now Minister for Energy, Deputy Colley, issued a statement authorising the Central Bank, without a vote of this House, to compensate to the amount of £4 million those who suffered due to the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank, and that was retrospective compensation.</P>

      <P>The record says, and I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 August 1977, that &ldquo;the Government wish to mitigate depositors' inconvenience, uncertainty and hardship and reinforce the high standards of Irish financial institutions&rdquo;. In particular the statement underlines &ldquo;the hardship which a protracted liquidation would cause some elderly, retired people whose life savings were deposited with the bank&rdquo;.  Many of those elderly, retired people were what could be described as millionaires and were foreign citizens, and here were we compensating these people in retrospect and now we are refusing to compensate to the extent of no more than £400,000 &mdash; I do not know the exact figure but I would say that £350,000 would be nearer the figure &mdash; people who have booked a holiday in good faith.  It is not unusual to book holidays now in the month of December.</P>
      <P>There are many people in jobs or businesses which do not permit them to take holidays in mid-summer, when most of us can take our holidays.  Many of these people, in booking that holiday, spent savings which had taken months &mdash; in some cases years &mdash; to accumulate.  I am reliably informed that many people who booked those holidays did so, not because they wanted to go abroad, one person said he would prefer to go to the west or the south of Ireland as he had done for five or six years previously in December&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he was advised by his doctor to take a holiday where he would get a week or a fortnight's sunshine.  There were many more sufferers of the Bray Travel collapse who had booked their holidays for health reasons. Would the Minister compare that with what was done in 1977 for people who suffered because of the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank?  Many people who booked with Bray Travel did not get their <Col N="1824" /> weeks in the sunshine as advised by their doctors.  They also had to suffer the loss of their cash, in many cases cash which they could ill afford to spend on holidays but which they had to for health reasons.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government, represented by the Minister of State, if they cannot see their way to supporting this measure, to at least bring in their own Bill to ensure that compensation will be paid, although there has not been the slightest hint from the Government side that compensation will be paid under the new measure.</P>
      <P>It is rather strange that these arguments have been put forward in the last few weeks.  If the Minister of State reads the contributions of his own back benchers, he will see that Deputy Andrews is in favour of compensating people.  There is nothing standing in the way of retrospective compensation.  Nothing that the Minister of State or the Minister has said has convinced me that it cannot be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On those grounds alone, I plead with the Government to bring in their Bill within a month, if they cannot support the present measure.  We, on this side of the House, will be doing our utmost to ensure that compensation is paid to those who have suffered.  Many other arguments could be put forward.

Many motives have been attributed to my reasons for doing this.  I put it to my party.  I did so as a result of attending a meeting to which the Minister's party was invited at the Tara Tower Hotel, where we heard from many hundreds of people piteous and lamentable happenings of their efforts to have a holiday.  It was not to win an election, certainly not in north-east Cork because there were only two people in my constituency involved in the Bray Travel collapse.</P>

      <P>It is a measure and the importance of the measure was, as the Minister pointed out, that it had a resemblance to UK legislation.  Deputy Deasy dealt effectively with the Minister's sarcasm on that point.</P>
      <P>I have the honour to be a Member of the Council of Europe.  As such, I have access to a lot of parliaments without any cost to the State.  I was amused to hear the Minister say this is a copy of UK legislation.  Then he said people in his Department were running around Europe looking at what was happening in other countries.  It probably cost more to do that than to compensate the victims of the Bray Travel collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our proposals would work.  It does resemble UK and certain European legislation. To give the Minister an idea of how well it works, in the UK, in a short time, they have built up a fund of £20 million.  There is no money being taken from anybody because the fund is now self-perpetuating.  The Minister of State said we should not be looking to the travellers but that we should be looking to the travel organisers.  That is a stupid statement.  The Minister knows very well that it comes out of the pocket of the traveller anyway.  The travel agencies have no fund of their own, except what they collect from travellers.  The percentage idea is the right one.  This Bill is <Col N="1826" /> simple, straightforward and would work. It is not a hypothetical situation.  We have an exact example of it in at least three European countries where it has worked efficiently and well.

      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power said it.  The members of Bord Fáilte, I presume, should be engine drivers, not hoteliers.  How stupid can they be in their criticism and their efforts to denigrate this side of the House in our efforts to help people who suffered hardship? I give another commitment on behalf of my party: when elected to power we will implement this legislation retrospectively and we will compensate those victims.  We will also compensate the staff members who suffered so severely in this collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a very unusual situation, dealing with people who are effectively bankers.  They take people's money in January, shortly after Christmas and hold it for six months.  There is no licensing, absolutely no control over them.  They can go out of business.  We have a situation under our law where Bray Travel with their five or six companies can transfer money from one company to another and fiddle around with people's money while we look on.  Then I am told that I am wasting the time of the House.  Surely that is my right on behalf of the people as a public representative. I should be failing in my job if I did not do that.  I claim the right to do it.  I am serious about it and I am completely <Col N="1827" /> disgusted by the type of approach we have here tonight, quibbling about bonding and reserving and so on.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a Travel Reserve Fund Bill under which a fund would be built up out of which any future collapse would be covered.  A loan would be made available. We are not seeking a grant from the taxpayers but a loan would be provided which would be repaid to the Exchequer. Nothing could be simpler.  This is not a hypothetical situation; it is the situation that exists across the water.  The Minister need not send his staff further than the UK where there is a system which works effectively and cures the problem.  I believe that is what we are doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the two Deputies Andrews and other Deputies opposite clearly making the point that there was hardship and that these backbench Deputies were in favour of compensation, of helping the victims of Bray Travel.  That was consoling.  I now suggest to the Government side that they should have a free vote on this.  There is no ideological problem involved.  It is a pragmatic issue.  Test your Members and see how they will vote.  I am sure the Bill would be carried if there was an open vote and I see no reason why that should not be done in the interest of the victims of Bray Travel.  I appeal to the Government party to do so.</P>
    <P>The managers of the tour operators are in favour of this type of legislation and in favour of a loan.  They know that, as Deputy McMahon pointed out, it is young people, not wealthy people, young married couples and people who are ill and trying to get a holiday abroad who were disgracefully treated by Bray Travel.  As a result a powerful group have been set up who will demand retrospective legislation and they will be right in doing so.</P>
    <P>They are taking action because of the collapse and because of the way they were blackguarded in this case where money was collected right up to the very minute of the collapse.  You had people like Aer Lingus who knew that things were not right in Bray Travel.  Many people <Col N="1828" /> knew it.  Where were all the Ministers and Ministers of State while this was happening? We were told we would have legislation but it is crystal clear from what has been said that no effort will be made to compensate the victims of Bray Travel. There is no doubt about that.  In Government we will go ahead with this Bill and we will compensate the people because in justice they deserve it.</P>

      <P>I have given permission to Deputy E. Collins to raise the subject matter of Question No. 40 on the Order Paper for Tuesday, 10 March 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  The ban on herring fishing in the Celtic Sea is because of the need to conserve herring stocks.  Certainly, I do not wish to contradict the principle of conserving these stocks, nor do I wish to argue against the scientific facts involved in establishing the herring population in the Celtic Sea.  I am appealing to the Minister to allow a restricted opening of the Celtic Sea, especially for drift-net fishermen, of whom there are approximately 500 operating from Wexford. Waterford and Cork.  They are not owners of large trawlers and mostly use boats up to 50 feet in length which are known locally as skiffs.  There is a very good case for allowing these fishermen the right to fish for herring, especially between October and January.  The productivity of the drift-net fishermen is about one-sixth of the productivity of larger mid-water trawlers and the catch per man is estimated to be in the region of 2.2 tons as compared with a catch per man of about 40 tons aboard mid-water trawlers.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of these small drift-netters and I ask him to ensure that the negotiations in Brussels will result in allowing a restricted opening of the Celtic Sea.</P>
      <P>In reply to my question of 10 March the Minister stated that he had been pressing persistently for limited opening and that the Council has before it a proposal which would allow drift-net fishermen to catch up to 1,000 tonnes of herring in 1981 subject to a licensing system.  I suggest that the tonnage is far too low and there should not be a restriction of 1,000 on these small fishermen.  We have gone far beyond the time when Fianna Fáil promised in their manifesto an exclusive 50-mile zone.  That was very hastily dropped by the inefficient and ineffective negotiators on behalf of the Government.</P>
      <P>It is very sad that during the past two years foreign trawlers have been able to catch herring as a result of bi-catches while Irish fishermen have not been in a position to catch herring because of the total ban imposed by the Government. There are other matters such as the fuel subsidisation enjoyed by French trawlermen which is not enjoyed by our fishermen. Our fishing industry, especially in the south-east, is in an extremely depressed condition because of very poor fishing over successive years.  Something must be done.  My immediate plea is on behalf of the 500 drift-net fishermen.  If there could also be a limited opening on a quota system for the mid-water trawlermen, I would welcome it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding non-payment of loan instalments. I asked the Minister to ensure that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are not allowed to repossess these small trawlers.  The industry is extremely depressed and that <Col N="1833" /> fact must be taken into account.  Finally, when the Brussels negotiations are finalised the Minister should ensure that the Celtic Sea is opened to drift-net fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Conservation within the context of the EEC fisheries policy has become a sham.  I know we have not yet achieved a common fisheries policy, but the interim measures have been a disaster for the Irish fishing industry during the past four years.  It behoves the Minister to see that proper conservation measures are introduced and adhered to and to ensure that Irish fishermen are not discriminated against.</P>
      <P>The only place where I can see conservation measures operating within the EEC is around the Irish coast, specifically within the Celtic Sea.  The Dutch and the French do not give a damn about conservation measures and they have proved this, especially in the past year when they have caught thousands of tons of herring in prohibited waters in the North Sea and the Celtic Sea with which they have flooded their own markets.  The only people who are being victimised by the conservation policies are our own fishermen, particularly our small inshore drift-net fishermen who are trying to earn a living using 20 feet or 30 feet boats.  They are being prosecuted for catching a very limited amount of fish.  I grant that the Minister has been sympathetic during the past herring season but I should like a definite commitment from the EEC that there will be a limited or temporary opening of the Celtic Sea.  That is the least we should have.  How can other people get away with catching thousands of tons of fish with their huge boats while the Irish fishermen who catches ten or 15 boxes is being prosecuted and banned from the Celtic Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of all that, as a result of imports from third countries Irish fishermen cannot sell their produce.  The very high proportion of fishermen who are in arrears with BIM with regard to loan repayments is due to the fact that the market has collapsed, in particular the herring market. During the past season Irish fishermen <Col N="1834" /> have had to dump their catch into the sea because it could not be sold due to the importation of illegally caught fish from third countries and because of illegal catches of herring by fellow members of the EEC.  In this connection I mention the French and Dutch fishermen.</P>
    <P>I heard on the news today that the British have got permission from the EEC to ban fish imports from third countries and that is a major advantage to their fishermen.  Why can the Irish fishermen and the Irish fishing industry not get this concession?  It is because the men of Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Aberdeen, Grimsby, Hull and the other British ports have lobbied British political leaders. They have succeeded in twisting their arm sufficiently to get a ban on imports from third countries.  That is what is needed here.  Unless imports from Iceland, Norway, The Faroe Islands, and Canada are stopped our fishing industry will be ruined.</P>
    <P>The Common Market is there to provide a reasonable living for the people within that market but the Irish fishermen are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  They should not have to compete against fishermen from Canada, Norway and Iceland.  They should be able to earn a living in their own community but that is not happening at the moment.  Every fisherman here expects the Minister to invoke his power of veto if the English fishermen get a concession which is not given to Irish fishermen.  We have the same marketing system here as applies in Britain.  They are catching fish and are marketing it in the same way and imports are coming into Britain and Ireland in the same manner.  If those imports are stopped from entering Britain it means we will be flooded to an even greater extent with imports from the third countries to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be present tonight to answer the question raised.  I regret I was not available for Question Time on Tuesday, 10 March as I was in Brussels that day.  It is nice to realise that Members opposite missed me but they <Col N="1835" /> uty Enright stated, Circuit Court lists are arranged on the basis that there will be a certainty of a full list to keep the court going for a day.  In arranging a list, provision is made for settlements where cases will not proceed and the net result is that there is usually two or three days work listed for one day.  That is all right if the litigants and particularly the professional witnesses are convenient to the court but it is disastrous if the witnesses have to come one hundred miles or more. Therefore I am concecned about this substantial increase in the Circuit Court. Some of the legal profession are for this increase but I am in a position of being able to look at the Circuit Court and the courts in general from outside with a knowledge of how they work and with a knowledge of the inconvenience that litigants can be caused and the frustration that they can suffer.</P>
      <P>We have not a free legal aid system available to the vast majority of people who will avail of the Circuit Court.  That means that people with limited means will be able to get the services of a solicitor and counsel to handle a case, but it is just not reasonable to expect that they will have the services of busy professional consultants residing and based possibly 150 miles away.  The litigant is expected to get these witnesses to the Circuit Court, which is possibly 150 miles away, on speculation.  If the plaintiff wins they will be paid such sum as the county registrar will certify but if the plaintiff is not successful the witness will not get paid because the plaintiff cannot afford to pay him, the solicitor concerned could not be expected to pay him and because the State have not provided free legal aid services.  This matter needs a lot of consideration. The Minister has not made a convincing case that there will not be the kind of hardship I have talked about and that justice will be done.  Cases will probably be concluded with inadequate settlements because of the litigants' difficulty in getting expert witnesses to travel long distances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is determined to go ahead with this, something should be <Col N="1836" /> done about the Circuit Court lists to ensure that if a case is listed it will be heard.  Even in this case it would mean that a professional witness would have to go down the country at 11 o'clock in the morning at the latest which would probably mean that he would have to leave the night before.  I heard the Minister saying that the fixing of lists is a judicial or quasi-judicial function.  I agree with that because most of the lists are arranged, in accordance with the judges wishes, by the county registrar.  My suggestion may mean the appointment of more Circuit Court judges, but as far as I am concerned it would be better to fix a reasonable list for a day and if the list collapses by all the cases being settled, the judge should be able to call it a day and spend the rest of the day in any way he wishes.</P>
    <P>It is much better to do that than to put two or three days' work into one list and find that an unfortunate plaintiff has to hang around.  He has probably suffered a lot already and has had a lot of inconvenience and worry about the case.  The big day has arrived and he is there all dressed up with his witnesses and his professional witnesses who have travelled a long distance at great inconvenience to themselves and, perhaps, great inconvenience to patients in Dublin who are lying in hospital beds awaiting attention from them.  They should not have to hang around for another couple of days. It would be much better for the list to collapse, as they say, and let the judge have a day off rather than having this frustration, inconvenience and loss for the litigant.</P>
    <P>We should be able to arrange this in consultation with the President of the Circuit Court.  Some machinery should be available whereby cases could be specially fixed as of right.  I know cases can be specially fixed, but that is if everybody agrees and if the judge agrees.  Cases should be specially fixed as a right if witnesses have to travel a distance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to Deputy Fitzpatrick I would ask him to comment further on a statement he made in the House last night which <Col N="1837" /> has been there for years but it has never been acted upon.  I saw there was a reluctance on the part of the other member states to accept the principle of compensation. I raised it on three occasions without success.  I found I was very much a lone voice in raising the matter of the opening of herring fishing in the Celtic Sea.  From June onwards the evidence seemed to be that the Commission continued to set their face against it and the prospect of a continued closure was on the cards.  The new recommendation from the Scientific Committee endorsed that view and the second report of the Technical Committee endorsed it also. The recommendation was that the stock was in a depleted state and that if fishing was to be carried on they could not contemplate even 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes being taken from it.  They said that, while they would take account of economic and sociological considerations, that was outside their sphere of competence and they pointed out we should not lay too much stress on short-term problems because they would probably cause even worse problems in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all that unfavourable advice, we indicated we were dealing with people and that fishermen had to be provided for.  I agree with both Deputies opposite that the east coast had its own problem last year with regard to prawns and white fish.  I was most anxious to help the owners of small boats who had not got any compensation.  In November I raised the matter with Mr. Gundelach and pressed him to the point where he said that if there was an opening of the Celtic Sea it <Col N="1838" /> could not be taken in isolation, that it was a political decision.  He said that other areas closed to herring fishing such as the North Sea would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I put forward three options.  One was for 4,000 tonnes for Irish boats and this would be closely monitored.  The next option was that we might have fishing in July and the last fall-back position was for 1,000 tonnes for small boats using driftnets.  These options were mentioned to the IFO when they visited the Taoiseach last year.  They were mentioned as being a last resort.  It was pointed out that the first two options could not be confined to Irish boats, that foreign vessels would have to have a right to fish with them.  The third option is exclusively Irish.  As Deputy Collins said, it provides for two tonnes or a little more per man for 500 men and I referred to this on my visit to Dunmore East.</P>
    <P>With regard to the TAC and quota proposals in January 1981, this has been accepted by the Commission.  It is still held up in negotiation, although I have pressed the matter.  We cannot get an EEC decision solely on this without getting overall agreement.  It is not something we can take as a national measure. We have got legal opinion on this matter but we must take account of the whole picture.  I am completely at one with the request of the Deputies and I am doing everything possible to bring it about.  I have high hopes we will get that limited opening for October 1981 at least.</P>

    <P>It is a matter for Galway County Council in the first instance to consider whether such a proposal might attract <Col N="1686" /> private investment for the purposes of a toll scheme under the provisions of the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979.  I am advised, however, that, having regard to the level of investment involved and the volume of traffic that a bridge at this location would attract, there appears to be little prospect of financing such a project by private investment.</P>

      <P>It is not possible for me to say how long it will take Donegal County Council to rehouse the approved applicants on their present waiting list.  While the initiation of their building programme is a matter in the first instance for the council, the level of the programme must be determined by such factors as the degree of priority of applicants' needs, the availability of serviced sites, the capacity of the building industry in the area and the amount of capital resources which can be made available to implement the programme.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, an average of 284 applicants were rehoused by the council.  At 31 January 1981 the council had 315 houses in progress, 334 houses at tender stage and 283 in planning.  Sites for a further 629 houses have been acquired or are being acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in the person's <Col N="1720" /> weekly entitlement to unemployment assistance was brought about by two factors. One was a reduction of £2 a week to recover an overpayment of £118.75 incurred during a period last year when the person received payment in excess of his entitlement.  The second deduction arose from the reassessment of his means when his wife became entitled to a non-contributory old age pension of £21 a week in her own right.</P>
      <P>The person is accordingly being paid unemployment assistance at the rate of £9.20 a week which is the maximum rate applicable to a married man in a rural area (£28.40) less the value of his means (£17.20) together with a deduction of £2 on foot of the overpayment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 9 January 1980 and was paid to 17 January 1981.  Payment was refused after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the decision to disallow her claim from 19 January 1981 but as she did not submit medical evidence of incapacity for work after that date there is no period in dispute to submit to an appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She claimed unemployment benefit on <Col N="1723" /> 21 January 1981 and in reply to an inquiry stated that she is only available for part-time employment in her own area while her children are attending school.  A deciding officer disallowed her claim on the grounds that she is not available for employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and her case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination. Arrangements are being made to have her case heard as early as possible. If she considers that her means are insufficient to meet her needs she may apply to the local health board for a supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
