      <P>Before resuming my contribution to the budget debate I should like to commend the Taoiseach for his action in the aftermath of one of the greatest tragedies that has befallen our nation since it came into being.  It goes to show at least that human concern entered into politics.  I hope the relevance of what goes on in this House will be displayed by positive swift action in implementing legislation and that the wave of emotion and the avalanche of sympathy which followed this terrible disaster will ensure that the young people who died so tragically and whose aspirations and ambitions can now never be fulfilled will not have died in vain.  I trust that the tribunal to be set up to look into the disaster will inquire comprehensively into the entire situation and that the House will deal effectively with it afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the budget that has been going on for some weeks seems of minimal consequence because everything that possibly could be said about the budget, <Col N="1837" /> good and bad, has been said.  That, of course, does not take from the fact that Government and Opposition speakers must carry on in the wake of the speech of the Minister for Finance.  I said in my short contribution last week that the best summary I have heard of the budget did not come from the Taoiseach or members of the Government or from any member of the Opposition.  Indeed, it did not come from anybody in this House.  The best summary I have seen and heard of this budget came on international television at the inaugeration of the President of the United States on the steps of Capitol Hill when the Rev. Moomaw, in his stentorial voice, said: &ldquo;Oh God, we need you now more than ever before&rdquo;.  In political terms, maybe we do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the Irish telephone system, such as it is.  I said that both the Minister of State and the Minister had received high commendation from the workers in Posts and Telegraphs for their interest in the activities of the Department.  However, the figures produced by both Ministers do not stand up in real workable terms in so far as the telephone system is concerned.  It is good to hear that 80,000 telephones will be installed this year and that by 1984 there will not be a waiting list.  I hope that target will be lived up to.  I have in my possession a typical letter from a constituent in a far distant region of the west who is lucky enough to have a telephone service of a kind.  I will not go into the details of the letter but I should like to make two points.  He is on a party line&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has an emergency he must get the priest or the doctor or the local Gardaí to crank the telephone of the 300 subscribers simultaneously in order to get a signal strong enough to contact the local exchange.  The gentleman who has written this letter suffers from a vocal disability &mdash; he has a slight stammer.  I will quote from the letter:</P>
      <P>Noise comes and goes during a conversation so that one tries to speak rapidly when the line is clear and this vocal disability trying to speak rapidly when the line is clear causes palpitations of the heart and if you have to receive medical attention it is not going to be that easy to do so.</P>
      <P>I am making the point that that is a typical letter from a constituent.  The service is not what it is stated to be.  If you try to dial any 091 or 093 number from upstairs here it is virtually impossible to make any contact whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Some time ago we had a debate here where questions were asked regarding rumours of political implications in the appointment of trainee installers.  The Minister and his Minister of State defended their case very well.  Many young men who were successful in their medical examinations and about whom references have probably been given to the Minister have not yet been called for employment.  I hope the Ministers concerned will ensure that these people are called for service within the Department in a reasonably short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I hope the remainder will also be taken on. The budget introduced some weeks ago has lost its relevance so far as debate in this House is concerned.  The man in the street will have to pay for what is introduced here and no amount of talk or debate will change that.  On this side of the House we can only highlight the <Col N="1839" /> issues but the Government intend to introduce them.</P>
      <P>The answer to Question No. 127 on 10 February 1981 to the Taoiseach gave the percentage increase from mid-February 1977 to mid-November 1980 in respect of various items.  It is interesting to note that petrol has increased by 63.4 per cent, postage charges by 65.7 per cent and another increase is due shortly, telephone charges by 80.4 per cent, electricity by 88.5 per cent and town gas by 139.7 per cent.  There are other variations also, all of them upwards.  The cost of this has to be borne by the citizen and this is not becoming any easier with the falling value of the punt.  Times are becoming more difficult for the citizen who has to bear the brunt of the burden imposed by the budget, irrespective of what is said here. Bread has increased in price from just over 20p in mid-February 1977 to 38.5p in February 1980.  The price of 1 lb of creamery butter has increased from 53p in mid-February 1977 to over 65p in February 1980.</P>
      <P>I could continue with the list of price increases that are startling and that affect the standard of living of every household. In this connection the recommendation contained in the programme given to the people by Fianna Fáil in 1977 has not been implemented and will not be implemented in the time remaining before the Taoiseach goes to the country.  If I remember correctly, the Government stated that prices would decrease by 1 per cent for the remaining period of 1977, by 2 per cent for 1978, by 2 per cent for 1979 and the decrease projected for 1980 was left blank.  The decrease projected by the Government made a total of 5 per cent, not taking 1980 into account: we could multiply that total by 40 in the case of many items and we would not be within striking distance of the price increases that have taken place.  That promise was not honoured by the Government.  Something should have been done about the matter, even if only to re-introduce food subsidies in an emergency such as exists now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the budget on every household has meant that the items most <Col N="1840" /> spoken about by people are prices, unemployment, the lack of confidence in agriculture and the lack of job opportunities for young people.  I should not like the people to be distracted from those matters by any references to Northern Ireland. We do not want any emotional drum beating, even though in political terms the statements by the Rev.  Ian Paisley may be of advantage to the Taoiseach. I should not like the people of this country to be distracted from the real issues that concern them in their daily lives and on which they will be asked to make a judgment sometime before June 1982.</P>
    <P>Job opportunities for young people are of crucial importance to every parent and young person.  Much has been said about the percentage of young people under the age of 25 years, questions have been raised about the number of young people unemployed and much debate has taken place about the opportunities that exist for them.  The aspirations of these young people are not being met.  Thus, the credibility of the Government and of all politicians is at stake in that specific promises and guarantees were given to young people that have not been implemented.  Politicians of all parties run the risk of paying the price in electoral terms when these young people exercise their franchise.</P>
    <P>If employment were to be dealt with on the lines promised in the Fianna Fáil election programme we would have fewer than 50,000 people unemployed at this time.  In fact, the number of unemployed is more than 130,000 and that number is rising.  Many of these people are under 25 years.  They have made attempts to get employment on many occasions but each attempt has been frustrated. This leads to apathy and a lack of confidence on their part and it should be considered seriously.  The work experience programmes and the youth employment schemes introduced by the Minister of State for Education and another Minister, although they were introduced as temporary schemes, have played a major part in giving experience to young people seeking employment.  These schemes have come to stay, at least while the demographic situation remains as it is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> In the report on Youth Employment by the Manpower Consultative Committee there is the following statement:</P>
    <P>As a comprehensive examination of the educational system regarding its relevance to modern employment of a technical nature should be carried out, the Manpower Consultative Committee might consider how this should be done.</P>
    <P>That is very important in the context of the micro-electronic industry that is with us now and for which we have a tremendous base and the necessary facilities.  If this is pursued properly, the fear of very large numbers of people being replaced by machines will not be that great.  In fact, unlimited opportunities present themselves if the matter is followed through properly.  In the same document there is the following observation:</P>
    <P>Indications are that many of the most disadvantaged young people do not come into contact with the official employment agencies.  Efforts of official bodies to help such minority groups should, therefore, have a high public profile.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that in the case of people from economically deprived backgrounds, intervention may be necessary at the primary school stage.  That is a very important statement which is of concern to all parents and teachers.  It is true that the National Manpower Service has done a marvellous job in recommending young people for different types of employment, but there are many with whom they have no contact.  There is a need for advice at primary school level.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for bringing young children to an intellectual level where they can look after themselves from a basic point of view rests on primary teachers, but they have not been given the facilities which they deserve.  Many of our primary schools are substandard and it is unfair to ask parents to send their children to schools which do not have the same standards as their own homes.  The INTO have campaigned to bring pressure to bear on the Department <Col N="1842" /> to carry out necessary repairs.  This campaign has been effective and the Government should by now be aware of the importance of the primary school sector and should see to it that further finance is given to this area.  More remedial teachers must be appointed in national schools because the ordinary primary school teacher, in a situation where the pupil-teacher ratio is too high, has not sufficient time to use his abilities to bring children of lesser intellect to a stage where they can reasonably hope to look after themselves in the area of basic reading and mathematics.  While primary teachers may have a certain amount of training in the remedial area, they have not the necessary time to develop the minds of these children, who will be completely lost if they go on to secondary or vocational school.  Such an experience will badly damage their confidence.</P>
    <P>Another fact which emerges from the Manpower Information Quarterly Bulletin for December 1980 is that redundancies notified as having qualified under the redundancy payments scheme in the first nine months of 1980 amounted to 10,667.  Increases in employment took place in some areas.  When word spreads about possible redundancies a loss of confidence occurs and the morale of workers drops, as does their capacity to increase output.  There is a psychological effect on the workforce which causes a strain between them and management.  This is a matter of serious concern at present. Many long established industries are being seriously hit and every town in the country is experiencing the trauma and despair of people faced with redundancy who may have no hope of obtaining decent employment within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that the IDA have done a marvellous job in bringing industry to various parts of the country. However, due recognition has not been given to the fact that many industrialists have come here because they recognise the quality and the capacity of our workforce. I speak particularly about the west where the environment may not be very suitable for larger scale industries.  In spite of this, many of these industries <Col N="1843" /> have been set up during the past ten years and basic infrastructural facilities have been provided.  The confidence shown by the industrialists has been justified by the productivity of the workforce.  However, many of them are now faced with difficult times due to the world recession and in this context the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism should examine the role of the county development teams and should consider an expansion of their scope and budgetary powers.</P>
    <P>The ordinary county development team are very limited in their capacity to spend money to attract smaller scale industries or to invite local people with specific ideas to set up small industries. The team in my own county have been innovative in many respects, even to the point of having films made showing facilities available in the county which they have attempted to project to industrialists abroad.  They find themselves somewhat limited in their capacity to do so. The Minister should consider the budgetary powers given to SFADCo as compared with those given to county development teams.  As time goes on we will become more dependent on small scale industries and these teams must be given greater scope to develop them.  That is not to say that the IDA should not continue their efforts to attract industry. Many advance factories throughout the country are empty and there is very little hope of their being occupied in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Probably the only section of the community who have welcomed this budget are social welfare recipients and various organisations involved in this field.  This is the Year of the Disabled and I hope that the same amount of lip service will not be paid to it as was paid last year to the International Year of the Child.  The disabled deserve much greater consideration and this has been recognised to a certain extent in the budget.  Practical advances can be made without any great expense in such matters as easier access to public buildings.  Other practical requests have been made by the disabled which should be granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> Last year the introduction of the free fuel scheme caused quite a furore in many counties because the guidelines laid down by the Minister were never published in the local papers and are not published on the application forms for free fuel.  Many people who consider themselves entitled, applied for it and on investigation it was found that they were not entitled to it. This has caused a great strain.  The scheme in its present form is unworkable and something should be done about it. The assistance officers have been under enormous pressure to grant even a minimum amount of free fuel to people who consider themselves eligible.</P>
    <P>In relation to social welfare, County Mayo in particular has a long standing row between the dentists and the Department. People who have contributed to social welfare payments are not entitled to dental treatment as a result of their contributions.  I raised this in the House before but it has not yet been sorted out. It is time for the Minister to do what has to be done and settle it once and for all. A person who has worked in a factory for 20 years should be entitled to dental treatment on his contributions but the system operated by the Department requires that an applicant must go to the dentist who must fill out an application form and send it to the Department to determine the eligibility of the patient. This form is supposed to be returned in six weeks but sometimes it takes from 18 months to two years.  If one had a toothache for that long we could expect an expansion in the mental hospital services throughout the country.  This is bureaucracy at its worst.  The staff in the section of the Department concerned are completely snowed under with applications. That should make it easier for the Minister to introduce a system in which the applicant would have a record of his contributions for the period of employment so that the dentist could recognise immediately that the applicant was eligible for treatment and he could apply to the Department for payment afterwards.</P>
    <P>In the recent past I met several widows' associations who feel that they have not been justly treated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Their pensions have been <Col N="1845" /> increased in line with the other social welfare increases but they feel they should be entitled to a minimum amount of free travel and electricity.  Many widows have to look after young families and the effort of coping with and rearing these children imposes a great strain on them. They should be allowed the convenience of being able to use public transport to visit relatives even on a quarterly basis. That would be a small concession.  The Minister should look at this to see what he can do about it.</P>
    <P>The increased price of drink will affect the social life of our old age pensioners many of whom like to travel to their local pub to have a drink with their friends. This will be very much restricted now. An increase was granted to them but by the end of the year this will be negatived by inflation or other price increases.</P>
    <P>In relation to pensioners in the west, many years ago these people were forced to emigrate to Britain or the US to earn their living and they supported their families at home while doing so.  Some of them were lucky enough to be eligible for retirement pension on their return but they have found, due to the complexities of the legislation, that when budgets in the countries from which they receive their pensions, grant them an increase, their Irish social welfare payment is automatically decreased.  A payment from the Department of Social Welfare here to an old age pensioner means more than does a payment from a foreign department. These people have a valid case in that they owe nothing to this country.  In fact, they put everything they had into it.  They were forced to emigrate and their productivity came to the assistance of their families at home.  Week after week their payments flooded into this country. Without them many would not have been able to manage at all.  The Minister should look at whatever legislation governs this situation to see what can be done.  Several thousands of people right along the west coast are affected by this and they feel they are being discriminated against by a country they were forced to leave in order to look after their relatives. When they come back they find that they <Col N="1846" /> are denied any payments from the Department here.</P>
    <P>The means test for the old age pension should be relaxed.  I had a case recently where an applicant aged 69, a hard working farmer with half a dozen cows, was denied a pension.  If he sat down and did nothing he would be entitled to a full pension but because he follows the advice of the Minister for Agriculture and goes into dairying to increase output he is denied benefit from the Department.  It is a contradiction in terms.  One Minister urges people to do something, while on the other hand there is a clear indication that if they do nothing they will qualify for all benefits.  This should not be tolerated. We must have social welfare but we should not turn into a welfare society where if one does nothing one gets everything but if one does anything one gets nothing.</P>
    <P>The increase in the price of petrol with further increases on the way will affect the standard of living of many people.  A car is not a luxury in rural Ireland.  There is too much tax on a gallon of petrol.  I know the Government need money to run the various services and that we complain about foreign borrowing, and that we ask for more money to be spent in different Departments but the methods adopted by the Government to get this money are not justified.</P>
    <P>The Government were elected in 1977 on a specific list of commitments.  Half way through their period in office their leader was changed and the present Taoiseach was elected on the assumption that he was the only one with the capacity to work an economic miracle when times were bad.  It has not come about.  In fact budgetary over-spending was of the order of £200 million in his first year in office. Confidence has waned to an alarming degree in agriculture; unemployment is higher than it was in 1940 and inflation has not been brought under control. There is no semblance of control over price increases in essential foodstuffs.  In general the state of the country is not what it should be.  We cannot blame Deputy Ryan this time nor former Deputy Justin Keating, and we cannot blame the Arabs.  Although the world recession has <Col N="1847" /> something to do with it, had we followed more prudent policies our country would be in better shape now to meet the economic circumstances of the time.</P>
    <P>Housing was to play a major role in the Government's re-election.  The £1,000 grant was an incentive that even an illiterate person can understand.  The magical figure of £1,000 gave the illusion of an enormous jump in real terms in financial assistance for the building of new houses. The increase in the cost of housing since then has reduced this to a very minimal amount and it is simply not sufficient to offer a grant today of £1,000 in respect of a new dwelling.  It is difficult enough for young people to get the money together from a loan, borrowing or savings to buy a house; but when the incentive offered to them is only £1,000 at today's prices and with the way increases are continuing to take place right across the board it does not make sense.  The difference between the loan and the cost of the house is increasing all the time.  The grant remaining static has not helped matters. It would not buy even the windows for a decent sized house.  Everybody would welcome the grant being increased to £3,000.  The qualifying area of the house should also be increased because at the moment it is too small in relation to a grant.  The Government have given a commitment to reintroducing the home improvement grant.  This should certainly be reintroduced because a lot of people are being denied this very necessary facility.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Bill, which is to be introduced shortly, gets some mention in the investment programme.  The amount of money given to Bord na Móna for distribution this year is not sufficient. I urge the Minister to ensure that the scheme gets into operation before the turf cutting season this year.  It is not fair that Bord na Móna should be the agency for distributing money to competitors such as co-operatives or private individuals. The level of grant assistance offered for the west of Ireland in the draft Bill is the same as that for the whole of the country.  We recognise that the west is a disadvantaged area and the level of grant <Col N="1848" /> assistance in respect of bog development in the west should be higher than it is. Due to the very high level of rainfall it costs more and takes longer to save turf in the west than anywhere else.  This fact does not seem to have been recognised in the draft Bill.  I hope the Minister does something about that when the Bill is brought before the House.</P>
    <P>A major political item for the west is a commitment to build another regional technical college in the west.  There is some mention of this in the Minister's speech.  Every political organisation, in fact every organisation of any consequence in County Mayo has backed the call by the VEC to lodge an official application to the Department for a regional technical college.  There will be a lot of talk about this in the months ahead.  I understand that the documentation has already been lodged with the Minister for Education.  I hope the Minister will give attention to this.  We are living in a technological age, which is becoming more sophisticated as time passes.  People in County Mayo have to travel to Sligo or Galway to attend regional technical colleges. The economic hardship imposed on their parents is not justified.  A commitment to the provision of a regional technical college in that district would enhance the ability of the area to attract further technological industries because the basic facilities are being provided.  If this is not followed up with educational facilities many opportunities will be lost for our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like publicly to record my very deepest sympathy to the parents of those who lost their lives in the recent holocaust in Artane.  It has been an appalling experience for every person. There has been an air of gloom over everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have analysed the contributions that have been made to this budget debate and I would like to approach the budget from three particular aspects &mdash; first, from its social implications to the economy; second, from the incentives which have been directly given to private enterprise; and, third, from the point of view of the national youth awards scheme. <Col N="1849" /> There has been a lot of doom and gloom about the budget.  Shortly after its introduction many irrational statements were made which now seem to be discounted because people are beginning to see that the budget, when one considers the present European and international financial climate, is excellent.</P>
    <P>There are three types of budget which could have been presented to the House. First, we could have had an austere, harsh type of budget, on the lines of the one introduced overseas.  Second, we could have had a soft budget.  The Government had been accused of preparing a soft budget for an election.  Third, we could have had a balanced budget.  An austere budget, like the one introduced in England, can cause great havoc.  It is dismantling heavy industry there, which will be very difficult to get re-established, and is causing great hardship.  A soft budget, taking soft options, programming inflation into the economy, is a course which could have been taken by the Minister for Finance, but he did not do that.  He looked at the prevailing situation and produced this excellent, socially just budget, with key elements which have given great incentives.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social elements in the budget a comparison must be made because an accusation has been levelled at the Government that it is not a socially just budget.  It is important to compare the four years of Fianna Fáil in office, when in real terms slightly over 40 per cent has been awarded in social welfare benefits as against 10 per cent in the four years of the Coalition Government. Taken as it stands, that statistic indicates exactly how socially orientated this Government have been.  It would be very easy to produce a table of comparisons showing that in many cases welfare payments have been increased by over 25 per cent. I have the tables in front of me.  There is no point in doing that.  They have been discussed before.  They are printed and they are there for anyone to see.</P>
    <P>This is a balanced budget and in the economic situation which prevails internationally, it is a courageous budget.  We see the socially orientated policies of our Government in the increased benefit for <Col N="1850" /> old age pensioners.  Walking around my constituency this is the feedback I am getting.  These people have been looked after first and foremost, and this it the most important element in the budget.</P>
    <P>A second aspect is the increase in capital expenditure from £1,270 million to £1,773 million, almost a 37 per cent increase.  This is a direct incentive to private enterprise to take up the challenge. Private enterprise have a social obligation to become actively involved at this stage in our economic growth.</P>
    <P>Another element of the budget is the £100,000 for our national youth awards scheme.  I am particularly interested in this area.  The Minister has an ideal opportunity to involve young people in schemes which can help us greatly.  We are living in an age of rapid changes. Young people are being exploited in many areas of activity.  This awards scheme could be of great help.  I will cite three instances where this could be done.</P>
    <P>We have a terrifying prospect of drug abuse.  Within the next five or six years the abuse of hard drugs will become a real challenge to our health and educational authorities in trying to take a positive role in preventing this widespread abuse.  In a national awards scheme this is one area where young people could become directly involved with the Department in identifying the problem and trying to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We also have the awful problem of under age drinking.  Young people of 15 and 16 years of age are being served alcoholic beverages.  This is another area where the national youth awards scheme could be implemented and youth leaders could be appointed to specific areas such as trying to identify drug pushers or being involved in the introduction of identity cards to ensure that young people will not be exploited in the area of under age drinking.</P>
    <P>A third aspect is direct community care.  Young people should be afforded the opportunity of finding ways and means, with the assistance of the Department of Health, of helping old people and giving them the better life which they deserve.  We must try to ensure that young people know what their direct <Col N="1851" /> responsibilities are.  There is a developing gulf or gap between young people and elderly people which is undesirable and which comes from the exploitation of young people.  If properly implemented the national youth awards scheme &mdash; and I have no doubt that the Minister will have a great deal to say on this score &mdash; can show positive results within the community. I should like to have seen a larger sum of money allocated in this area.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about direct incentives for private enterprise.  We hear talk about the differential between the punt and the £ sterling but, as a nation, we must be prepared to increase our work commitment and our attitude to efficiency and doing a good days' work.  Our rate of absenteeism is holding us back at the moment.  Unless we do something about it, jobs will be lost.  In our major local authority, Dublin Corporation, last year we lost something in the region of 300 years in sick pay or sick leave, call it what you like, amongst 5,000 employees.</P>
    <P>It is important that a work ethic should prevail.  This budget has shown confidence in increasing capital expenditure. This should be appreciated and taken up by private enterprise.  Incentives and proper awards should be given to workers for a good days' work.  I believe the emphasis should be on rewarding people who work and have a good work record, rather than allowing for sick leave.  The reward should be given to people who work.  Perhaps a day off in the week should be given to people who do a full month's work rather than giving so many days sick leave.</P>
    <P>This is a country bedeviled by an attitude of investment in sickness.  The budget endeavours to create jobs in a climate where the microchip is making it more and more difficult to do so.  Insurance companies are manning down their regional offices in some cases from 10 and 12 employees to one or two.  Machines can be installed which carry out work formerly performed by employees.  The bank can instal massive computers and the loss of jobs could be serious.  It is a constant struggle to create new jobs which are so essential to our economy.  The <Col N="1852" /> lifeblood of the economy is the creation of jobs.  The number of jobs created by the Government over the past three years is on record for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the 40 per cent increase in social welfare benefits over the last three-and-a-half years.  We have had a very serious oil crisis.  There is no point in living in a dream world such as in John Lennon's revived hit &ldquo;Imagine&rdquo; where everything is all milk and honey. It is all very fine to talk about that when one has massive amounts of money to back one up.  We are living in an economic climate where there is a downturn in consumer needs and in production.  It is not an easy climate for any Government to steer an economy through.</P>
    <P>The budget is taking a balanced course and making the best of our opportunities. It is not taking deflationary measures but showing confidence in the economy.  We would have introduced a budget that would have battened down the hatches and been austere and made it very difficult for small firms to operate.  Instead the Minister, in his wisdom, is steering the economy through this difficult time. People in industry and those operating small businesses appreciate this.  Everyone would like to see greater income tax reliefs.  In the present economic structure this is not easy and would be irresponsible. We have not increased direct taxation. It is a balanced budget to get the economy moving.  Anyone going to England frequently will realise the nervousness that prevails there where firms are going to the wall and large industrial-orientated firms have been going bankrupt as a result of the harsh measures taken.  Here we have kept things going and it is the policy of the Government to keep the economy on an even keel.</P>
    <P>If one wants to get a measure of how the economy is going it is important to see how it is rated internationally.  Our currency is faring very well within the EMS.  Our £ is holding its own.  There is an artificiality about the differential between the £ sterling and the IR£. Everyone realises that.  Yet it is used to try to paint a picture of gloom.  As recently as three weeks ago firm indication came from the English Exchequer <Col N="1853" /> that they were seeking ways of joining the EMS.  When that happens the situation will be totally different as regards the rating of the £ sterling and the IR£. At present our exporters are seeking the opportunities available to them and doubling their efforts to avail of the opportunities that lie within the budget as it is framed.</P>
    <P>There are small increases in certain social welfare areas.  I should like to have seen bigger increases but it is difficult to increase in every area.  Taking the development of the social welfare scheme over the past few years from a medical point of view, great advance has been made. This has been due to the Taoiseach who, when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare, laid the foundation for a better attitude towards the socially deprived.  I am very pleased with the budget in that area and the Minister should be congratulated in that respect.</P>
    <P>There have been increases on cigarettes, and drink.  I am not a kill-joy in my attitude to drink but if the increase served in any way to deter young people from drinking I would be happy.  If it had that direct effect I would be happy for it to be increased by twice the amount.  However, the great problem is that it does not appear to have that effect.  The money appears to be there and that is unfortunate. I should like to see some of the revenue that will come from the increased tax on alcohol ploughed directly into incentive schemes to deter young people from drinking.  I know I am repeating myself on the question of under-age drinking and drug abuse but I feel very strongly about it.  Unless there is a new public awareness and unless parents and young people get involved we will have a massive problem.  It is the exploitation of young people that I object to.  The old age pensioner who has always enjoyed one or two drinks has also always had a balanced attitude to his or her drinking habits.  We are not speaking about that sector of society at all.  At present the big problem lies with young people and let us not run away from all the ensuing problems. What can one say about cigarettes other than that they constitute a programmed recipe for ill health.  Despite all <Col N="1854" /> the efforts of the Health Education Bureau, unless people come to grips with this problem we will have more ill health as a direct result of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>The price of petrol has been increased as well, something nobody wanted to see happen.  Everybody seems to feel it constitutes a very tough increase.  From asking people what they thought about the budget it would appear that they objected most to the increased price of petrol. That message came through loud and clear.  With regard to the usage of petrol the motor car is no longer classified a luxury and is essential to industry and many occupations as well.  But there are many cases of cars being over-used particularly in an age when we must be more aware of the conservation of energy. There is no obligation on a person to use a motor car.  Indeed greater restraint in its use could easily offset the increase to a huge sector of society, thereby doing our economy a great favour as well as our present adverse balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The budget has been received with great acclaim by the building trade.  As recently as 10 days ago the building federation applauded the budget particularly for its provisions in fuelling the building industry.  This is particularly fortunate when one remembers that in other countries there is at present a downturn in this industry.  The building trade is one of the key areas in a developed economy. It is almost a barometer of how the economy is going.  Taking into account the increase in capital expenditure and the guarantee, almost, to private enterprise that if they develop, the Government will occupy many of the buildings completed, it must be realised that there is tremendous opportunity in this country.  One can adopt an attitude of doom, gloom and depression but it must be remembered also that most Europeans look on Ireland as a country with immense natural wealth.  Therefore it is up to our people themselves to exploit that resource.  The Government can lay the foundation and the plan &mdash; as have been structured in this budget &mdash; but looking to the Government all the time for the answers just will not do.  Nowadays, compared with the time when I left college, there are tremendous <Col N="1855" /> opportunities available to young people who are prepared to work hard.  An emphasis on efficiency will help our economy tremendously.  But we must all be aware that we must become more efficient to allow our economy to grow.</P>
    <P>There has not been much comment in the course of this debate on the question of buying our own produce.  When one examines the budget in detail one finds that there are areas where this is imperative. Our people have a tremendous weapon in this respect, in staving off problems, if only they are prepared to show a national pride, a pride in themselves demonstrated by the purchase of their own produce.  Watching the Robert Kee television series &mdash; Ireland: a Television History &mdash; one could within a few weeks formulate an appraisal of how our economy has expanded since the inception of this State.</P>
    <P>We are now at the point of growth expansion; the foundations have been laid.  Confidence must prevail at all levels, a confidence in ourselves, by our people availing of the measures incorporated in this budget rather than adopting a destructive attitude.  This is a growth budget and people must examine it for the opportunities it makes available.  In the present climate of opinion it constitutes a balanced budget, and is fuel charged with incentives to the building industry, from which there can be quite a spin-off, coupled with the tremendous relief to people in need.</P>
    <P>I appeal to private enterprise for more initiative, to take up the offer made to them and to endeavour to involve more and more young people through the national youth award scheme.  It must be remembered that the future of the country is dependent on our young people and they must be involved.  I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice present has very strong feelings about under-age drinking, drug abuse and so on.  There is a great opportunity to involve young people in these areas through his Department and the Departments of Health and Education also. Indeed I would recommend that that award scheme be increased fivefold in the <Col N="1856" /> next budget, to be developed from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before speaking about the budget and the economy generally I want to join the previous speakers in their expression of sympathy to those who suffered so much as a result of the Stardust fire.  It is appropriate that I should take this opportunity to add my voice to theirs.  I would add one further comment. Later in the day there will be a motion in regard to the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry.  At this stage I would merely say that I hope the Government will not merely set up an inquiry and rest at that.  In my own constituency the last major disaster at Whiddy took place and I saw the huge report coming from the inquiry and I am still waiting for the Government to take steps to implement that report.  I also saw in my own county a major train disaster which was not quite as big.  Again inquiries have been going on but I want to see some action and a bit of force to ensure that this type of disaster will be prevented in the future. I will leave it at that.  It is not appropriate that I should say any more.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused by the previous Deputy from the Government back benches talking in glowing terms about the ability of the Government to balance the budget.  I do not know whether he has read much of the budget figures but on the Minister's own admission the budget is based on a deficit on current account of £515 million so it is a bit of a joke to be talking about a balanced budget.  Even that figure is not a true one because it is based on sums which, quite frankly, do not add up and we will end up the year with a far greater deficit.  But at this stage I merely want to point out to the previous Deputy that any thoughts that he has that this budget is presented on the basis of being a balanced one can be quickly disabused by looking at the last page of the Minister's budget speech where there is an explanatory table of the current budget.  He will see that on the Minister's own figures the budget is based' on a deficit of £515 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By general agreement it is accepted that at present our economy is in a mess. Many of us who are interested in the <Col N="1857" /> future of our country, who are genuinely looking forward to the Government producing a strategy which would commence and stimulate a move out of the economic morass in which we are in.  I judge the budget on that basis.  It has to be accepted that in this budget and the accompanying plans and documentation, particularly the Book of Estimates and the capital budget, there is no planned strategy to improve the economy to any appreciable degree, to tackle the underlying problems of the economy.  Therefore I have to say that this budget does not get anywhere near the pass mark; in fact it is a total failure.</P>
    <P>In case it might be suggested that the basis on which I make my case is not a tenable one I want to quote a few figures to prove it.  The basis of my case is that the economy is in a mess and this budget does nothing to bring it out of the mess. We have to look at the main economic figures as they were in 1980 as opposed to 1977, the year the Government took office.  A quick glance at these figures will indicate quite clearly how much damage has been done to this country by the Government, how bad the economy is, and will sketch the dark and gloomy picture which would require a bit of imagination and a bit of vision to change.  In 1977 unemployment figures were falling; in 1980, the unemployment figure went up by 34,000.  In 1977 the growth rate was 5 per cent; in 1980 it was nil.  In 1977 the increase in agricultural output was up by one-third; in 1980 it fell.  In 1977 the national debt was £3,600 million; in 1980 it was £7,500 million, double the 1977 figure.</P>
    <P>That is the major economic fault which I lay at the feet of this Government.  They actually doubled the national debt since they came into power.  One would see some excuse for that if one could see its results in an improvement in our employment figures, if we could see its result in improvements in our infrastructure.  But unfortunately we have had a combination of increasing unemployment, pot holes in the roads and a doubling of the national debt.  What use has been made of the borrowing since this Government came into power?  I would accept a Government <Col N="1858" /> that would borrow if the money was put to good purpose.  But what have the Government been doing with it?  They have been paying the houshold bills with it over the last four years.  On that basis it is clear, judging this Government since 1977, they have been a total disaster.  The borrowing figures are so enormous that we are inclined to get confused and I see people using the foreign borrowing figure in relation to the overall one.  But the foreign borrowing figure is very important and very relevant to the disastrous state into which this Government have put the country.</P>
    <P>In 1977 our figure for foreign borrowing was £170 million.  It is now almost ten times that figure.  Everybody knows the difficulties associated with foreign borrowing. At the end of 1980 the figure was £1,600 million and that is only the foreign borrowing part of it but it is very important from the point of view of the falling punt, the extra cost on repayment of the currency in which we borrowed.  The State gets nothing out of the interest because it has to be paid free of tax and there is no recovery.  It is a matter which has to be emphasised and it is one in respect of which the Government can take no credit.</P>
    <P>They are the comparisons between 1977, when this Government took over, and the situation today.  We can talk about percentages and statistics but these figures cannot be disputed.  What is the excuse of this Government for sinking this country into so much debt over their term of office?  What is their excuse for doubling the national debt since they came into power without making good use of that money, without having a consequent reduction in our unemployment, a consequent improvement in inflation and a consequent improvement in our infrastructure?  In comparing 1977 with 1980 I almost forgot one of the major parts of our economic make up, that is the inflation rate.  How can members of this Government, with straight faces, stand up here and talk of what they are doing for the country when in 1977 we had an inflation figure of 10 per cent and which nearly trebled last year?  That is the background and that is the comparison <Col N="1859" /> as between 1977 and 1980.  It was in the context of that background and of the damage done over that period that one would have expected an improvement and a strategy to bring this country back from the economic bog into which it had been sunk by the present administration.</P>
    <P>There is one other comparison that should be mentioned, that is, the projections included in the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto.  I know people get sick and tired of that infamous document but it is no harm to bear in mind that this Government made certain serious projections in 1977 upon which they went to the electorate and got a huge vote of confidence. Those projections have proved to be totally wrong, totally false and, I can only come to the conclusion at this stage, totally dishonest.  In these areas to which I referred the projections were that unemployment would now be down to 32,000.  How can this Government face the people with straight faces and say they are able and willing to honestly tackle the problems of the economy when that figure is four times higher?  There was a projection of an inflation rate of 5 per cent.  Fianna Fáil said there would be no problem bringing inflation down to that figure, but what is the figure today? Nearly four times higher.  There was a projection of a growth rate of 7 per cent. What is the comparison today?  Nil.</P>
    <P>The projection that really took my fancy, and which I would have strongly supported if there had been any solid effort made to implement it, was the strategy to be adopted which would result in 3p in every pound spent being switched into the purchase of Irish goods.  This was to have the incidental effect of 10,000 extra jobs.  What has been the outcome? It has gone into reverse and almost 3p in the pound less is being spent on Irish goods.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we bear these facts in mind.  We cannot just look at the budget as presented by the Minister for Finance.  We have to look at the background to it and the record of this administration since they came into power.  On that basis we have to assess what should <Col N="1860" /> have been done and to what extent the budget fell short of that objective.  I believe that, based on those figures and many others which have been quoted recently, one has to come to the inescapable conclusion forced by all the evidence (a) that the economy is in a mess, (b) that there should have been an overall strategy to effect an improvement to map a path out of the economic bog into which we had sunk and to steer the economy in that direction and (c) that this budget is a total failure when one judges it by those criteria.</P>
    <P>Hopes were raised at the time of the palace revolution within the Government party.  In fairness I thought there were grounds for some hope that the present leader would take a grip of the economy. Ten or 15 years ago in certain Ministries in which he was involved he showed a certain amount of initiative and imagination. From that point of view I watched him gathering the economic powers of the State under his control, directly or indirectly, and, like many other people, hoped that he would make good use of those powers.  He gathered them in more than any other Taoiseach since the foundation of the State.  He did this in a number of ways, <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto.  De jure</i> he abolished the Department of Economic Planning and Development and assumed entire and direct control over that area himself.  He considerably expanded his own Department and, directly, and without any apology to anybody &mdash; least of all the last occupant of the Ministry &mdash; took direct control.  In a more indirect way he also took control of other aspects of the economy and undoubtedly has exercised an influence over the Ministry of Finance greater than that exercised by any previous Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on the position of my fellow Corkman in that office except to say that since the present Taoiseach took over he has appointed two Ministers for Finance who, to say the least, had shown little interest in or knowledge of economic affairs.  It would be fair to say that they were people who would have a degree of political subservience to the Taoiseach.  I do not believe <Col N="1861" /> one should talk about personalities when in politics, but this has been the comment of many commentators.</P>
    <P>I will look at the more tangible things, such as the Taoiseach's control over the finances of the State.  There is a direct example in the supposed £100 million planned to solve our crime problems.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, 5 September 1980 there was a full page spread &ldquo;War on crime; £100 million to beat the bandits&rdquo;.  The other national papers carried similar headlines, not spread to the same degree on their front pages, but the background to that £100 million is what is important in proving my point.  I will speak later about spending it because it has not yet been provided, and that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>This arose out of a meeting between the Garda Commissioner and the Taoiseach following a tragedy in which a number of our Garda force were killed.  The Garda Commissioner was instructed to draw up a plan.  Last July the Taoiseach directly advised that whatever resources of the State were needed to implement that plan would be made available.  There was no reference to economic problems or to the Minister for Finance.  The Taoiseach confirmed that it would be done. When the commissioner carried out his instructions and drew up his plan there was a further meeting.  That plan was approved by the Taoiseach.  The fact that it was going to cost £100 million did not worry him; he gave the go-ahead.  Was that not the action of someone who was taking over direct control of the finances of the State without any reference to the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>That point is given further proof when one considers that with all the talk, the interviews on television, with everybody breathlessly hanging on to every word dripping from the Minister's lips, all the party political broadcasts and all contributions on this resolution, the entire budget only involved a net increase in revenue of £160 million and a net increase in expenditure of £150 million.  That is what was done in the budget when one boils down the changes that took place, and yet at one meeting the Taoiseach was able to guarantee £100 million to implement <Col N="1862" /> a war against crime.  That shows the extent of his control.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has gathered the power. There were expectations and hopes throughout the country that he might be able to show a degree of economic wizardry and start to solve our problems.  I am afraid that the awful realisation has dawned.  It is clear from what was expected of the wizard and what has been produced that the emperor does not have any clothes.  It is clear that the hopes and expectations of our people in that area have been totally dashed.  The vision, imagination and innovation expected in the economic area are all lacking.  It is only now that the extent to which the Fianna Fáil Lynch-style Government mismanaged our economy is becoming fully apparent.  However, it is clear that the inefficiency then shown appears like genius when compared to the Haughey experiment.</P>
    <P>The economy has got worse since it was taken over by the Taoiseach.  The strategy one would expect to effect an improvement is totally lacking.  The total dedication one would expect in regard to the important areas such as unemployment, prices and balance of payments is not evident.  An attempt has not been made to establish a strategy to deal with those problems on a solid long term basis. All the efforts of the leader of the Government appear to be directed towards one objective, that of being re-elected.  I am not so innocent in politics as to suggest that any politician should forget he has to face the people if he is to be re-elected. That is part of the democratic system, but if somebody is elected to do a job the carrying out of that task must be his primary objective.  While one must bear in mind the need to be re-elected and the need to work towards ensuring that, it is letting down the people who elected one if one's abilities are not primarily devoted to doing the job for which one was elected.  It is clear that that is not so at present and has not been so for the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The whole strategy appears to concentrate on publicity and press relations, to avoid any positive action and, in the words of McLuhan &mdash; if I remember him <Col N="1863" /> correctly &mdash; we end up with the medium becoming the message.  I can only classify that type of approach as government by mirrors.  Everything is assessed in the context of the publicity it will gain, the public reaction to every move made and the effects on the polls from the popularity point of view.  A great disservice is being done to the country with that as the primary and fundamental approach of the leader of the Government.</P>
    <P>The action in relation to the £100 million to be devoted to the war against crime is typical of the style of Government we must suffer.  There was an emotional reaction here following the sad deaths of two members of the Garda.  It was clear that the country demanded that action be taken to ensure as far as possible that such an awful occurrence would not happen again.  The initial steps taken by the Government, directed and controlled by the leader, were: to have full discussions with the Garda Commissioner, to look for a plan and to commit the resources of the State to the implementation of that plan.  There was a lot of publicity following that, culminating in a heading in a national newspaper telling us of the war on crime and that £100 million would be spent to beat the bandits. That was indicating decisive action by the Government who were committed and concerned.  The leader of the Government gave the impression that he was going to make sure our people could be satisfied that appropriate steps were being taken to beat the criminals.  That was a totally cynical exploitation of the emotional feelings of our people and of the demands and worries of the Garda in relation to increasing their strength and efficiency.</P>
    <P>That money was never made available and from the manner that operation was approached by the Taoiseach it is now clear he did not have any intention of making that money available.  Time does not permit me to go into this matter in great detail but I hope to deal with it when the Estimate for the Department of Justice comes before the House.  That propaganda effort stated that £42 million would be spent on helicopters and airplanes <Col N="1864" /> in the establishing of a police air reconnaissance unit.  In November the Minister was asked about the provision of the money for that purpose.  The Minister mentioned that there was not anything he could offer in the 1980 Estimates but he would be making a provision under a separate subhead in 1981.  He duly made a provision in the Estimate for 1981 under a separate subhead, aircraft. Bearing in mind his own figures when he talked about some eight helicopters at the time at roughly £5 million apiece and four light planes costing about £.5 million apiece amounting to about £42 million, what is the figure provided in 1981 towards meeting that portion of £100 million? Also on that figure let us judge the credibility of the Government and the commitment which they had to their £100 million crime package.  The figure was £1,000 and that amount was included as a separate subhead in the 1981 Estimates. That is the actuality, the reality, as opposed to the wild, extravagant promise made last September, the cynical publicity exercise that was carried out at the time.</P>
    <P>Other promises were made.  They were going to increase the strength of the Garda force from 10,000 to 12,000, a very worthy object, no problem.  They promised that the resources would be made available.  There was direct commitment by the Taoiseach himself.  What is the situation today?  After six months of the 18 months in which this was going to be done the number in the Garda force is not even 10,000.  It is actually less than the baseline which was going to be increased.  If one is to judge by the recruiting efforts at the moment &mdash; or the lack of them &mdash; there is absolutely no intention of increasing that figure, and this is borne out by the fact that almost half-way through the 18-month period during which this was going to be done the Minister has not even gone to the trouble, as far as I can see, of increasing the statutory maximum number beyond the figure of 10,000 which was fixed some years ago.  That again shows the extent of the commitment of the Government and it shows even more, and very saddeningly so, the cynical propaganda approach <Col N="1865" /> which has been adopted by this Government of an absolute pretence that they are dealing with the problems supported fully by a propaganda machine and then letting the problem fade, at least they hope, into oblivion.  That is an important factor that has to be borne in mind and it is time to put it on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the present Taoiseach or members of his Cabinet, sub-Cabinet or party using public relations. It is a modern part of politics, but at the same time one has to question the extent to which it is being used today.  One has to question the manner in which things that are not happening are presented as being about to happen.  One has to consider whether this is a total abuse of power.  I do not intend to attack the media.  As far as I am concerned the media do their own job, but in that area a few comments might be no harm.  One expects the Fianna Fáil newspaper group to give the Fianna Fáil line, obviously. Indeed, one is pleasantly surprised now and again by a show of independence by some of their writers but in other areas I question the extent to which the Government party control the media.  This is provided for me by the take-over of yet another paper, the <i>Sunday Journal</i>, by a company noted for their support for the present Government party.</P>

      <P>I will merely make my point by referring to the newspaper article and I will close that portion of my speech on it.  This newspaper article aroused a certain degree of amusement on my part, at the same time making the point that I was making.  The article is on page 10 of the <i>Sunday Journal</i> of 15 February and it refers to the enthusiastic support for the Taoiseach's speech at the Ard-Fheis last Saturday night as &ldquo;well deserved&rdquo;.  It refers to Deputy Haughey as &ldquo;well known for his perfectionism&rdquo; and it goes into the reaction and the applause well deserved &mdash; subjective comment, mind you &mdash; for what, according to this article, can only be termed a brilliant speech by Deputy Haughey last Saturday night.  In the name of goodness, does this paper pretend to be an independent newspaper while it produces that kind of tripe?  It is clear what happened. This writer had his piece written and prepared beforehand, pursuing the line which he follows quite normally of polishing the image of the Taoiseach.  When the awful tragedy of last week-end occurred he overlooked making sure that this piece of Haughey-licking was deflected and held for another occasion. The basic point there is, in the name of goodness, let the Government have their PR and their relationships with the press and we will face all that when we come to it, but let them get on with the job of governing and not be spending so much time polishing an image behind which there is nothing, no action, no activity, no attempt to do the basic job for which they were elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting back to the budget and the economy, there is hope for this country. There are factors within the economy which make it clear that with the proper plan and strategy we can overcome the difficulties which we face, but this must involve a constructive approach, a planned one that is not related to the short term or to elections-round-the-corner, one that is laid down over a number of years and which has the commitment of a Government to implement.  Firstly, <Col N="1867" /> one has to look at the main productive areas.  There is nothing for any of us, no pay for a TD, no allowances for civil servants unless one has an out-turn from the productive sector.  It is primarily in that area that the eggs are laid, a portion of which we all eat subsequently.  Any such strategy has to be based on the four main productive areas, agriculture, industry, tourism and fisheries.</P>
    <P>Assessing the Estimates and the budget, it is clear that the Government do not accept my contention.  These are the areas which are very important.  What have the Government done?  Let us look at agriculture, which is so important and in which a quarter of the country is involved.  We have cuts in the capital budget and a total ignoring of the fact that, if agricultural incomes in the current year were to be at the same level as they were in 1978, they would have to be in the order of £1,450 million.  According to the ESRI, they will be down to £815 million.  This aspect was looked at in an article in <i>The Economist</i> in January.  They did a survey and talked about Ireland being a nation of farmers, retaining the agricultural habit of finding fault with any harvest.  It also said that farmers had plenty to grumble about now, unemployment at 10 per cent, an inflation rate at about twice that figure and so on.  Real farm incomes &mdash; and farmers still form 22 per cent of the workforce &mdash; have fallen by half in two years, savaging trade in the market towns.  That is the view of an independent magazine.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the basic area to which there must be an input from the Government and an effort made to restore confidence. We deserve to get a reasonable package from Brussels but, at the same time, any Government looking for a reasonable package have provided a readymade answer to those who do not want to provide such a package.  They will ask the Government what they did and, if they were genuine in their protestations about the agricultural community, why did they not provide a reasonable package and make a genuine effort to tackle the problem.  It is clear, both from the capital budget, which cuts the amount for <Col N="1868" /> the farm modernisation scheme, and from the current budget that the Government are not in any way committed to restoring the fortunes in agriculture, to restoring confidence and stopping people destocking, to increasing the breeding herd and to encouraging the small farmer to expand.</P>
    <P>At a time when unemployment is rising industry must be encouraged.  I am not in favour of giving hundreds of millions of pounds here and there.  The money simply is not there.  At the same time, if the Government had an interest in industry why did they virtually stifle the cash flow in many companies by insisting that one-and-a-half-year's tax should be paid in the current year?  Is that the incentive one should give to industry to expand?  It is clear the commitment is not there.</P>
    <P>Tourism is very important in my own constituency &mdash; I am not being parochial about it &mdash; and it is very important for the country.  In studying the capital investment plan, which I hoped would have emphasised tourism, I found it was a plan which was based on an investment. Investment, how are you &mdash; borrowing of £17,00 million.  It is a lot of money. What emphasis was placed on tourism in the plan?  What suggestions did the Government make to provide funds, albeit borrowed, to develop the tourist industry? A sum of £5 million was allotted to tourism.  I am not great on figures but I think it works out at about .3 of 1 per cent.  If that is a criterion of the Government's commitment to tourism, God help tourism.</P>
    <P>The last major productive area which has to be tackled is fishing.  Since the present Government came to office we have had messing about the limits.  The 50-mile limit was done away with within weeks and we now have a failure on the part of the Government to establish even an exclusive 12-mile limit &mdash; this from a Government who, when they were in Opposition, howled about the 50-mile limit.  When the last Government had an exclusive limit of 30 to 35 miles lined up, Fianna Fáil said it would not do; it had to be 50 miles or nothing.  I am aware that the present Government were fully briefed on negotiations and were given <Col N="1869" /> every help at the time of the changeover. But we now are virtually helpless.  This was highlighted by a statement by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry when he said in December that a 12-mile limit was unrealistic.</P>
    <P>What constructive approach has been made in regard to marketing in order to ensure that the fishery industry is going to develop?  Examining the various documentation produced with the budget, we find that that area has been ignored. Unless these four major productive areas &mdash; agriculture, industry, tourism and fishing &mdash; are developed, there is no chance of improving our economic situation.  The Government have not done so and on that basis it is clear that &mdash; I was going to say that their economic strategy had failed, but it is clear they have not even got a proper economic strategy.</P>
    <P>We have often been criticised for not making constructive suggestions.  We have to commit the resources of the State to those major productive areas.  That has not been done.  That is the first step on the path out of the present economic mess.  What are the main economic problems? They can be summed up as jobs and prices.  We must provide more employment or, alternatively, we have to prevent jobs being lost.  The Government seem to be totally helpless when confronted with increasing unemployment figures.  They seem to think that after a while it will reach a peak and then decline.  Positive steps must be taken by the Government to ensure that the rise in unemployment is slow, and, if possible, that more jobs are created.  It is even more important that jobs are protected. It is estimated that an IDA-created job in industry can cost £10,000 to £14,000 per job, depending on the industry involved.  Sometimes it is even higher, but averages at over £10,000.  I am not complaining about that because I think that the IDA are doing a good job.  This party support them fully in their efforts but like Canute trying to keep back the tide, they are creating jobs while all the time unemployment figures continue to rise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there must be greater emphasis on retaining existing jobs. <Col N="1870" /> Without becoming involved in too much expenditure, existing jobs could be protected until, to use the hackneyed phrase, we get the economy moving.  Until that time we must protect more of our existing jobs.  Then, when there is an improvement in the economy and when, we hope, there will have been a change of government, we may talk meaningfully about new jobs.  In my home town there is a food-processing factory which is associated with the Irish Sugar Company and in which 160 people are employed.  This is a co-operative which is based on native raw material from the area but unfortunately, it is to be given the chop.  This is the type of enterprise that we should be endeavouring to retain in the hope that ultimately it will be back to being a viable proposition.  I am borne out in this by the remarks of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on state-sponsored bodies who, having examined the affairs of the sugar company, have stated objectively that in their opinion plants such as the one I have referred to should not be closed having regard to the various side effects that follow such closure, for example, the cost to the state in terms of social welfare and so on.  In other words, such enterprises should be retained either until they become viable or until an alternative employment opportunity is offered.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which the Government have not been concentrating sufficiently, having regard to the huge cost of new jobs and the relatively small amount of money that is needed to ensure the protection of existing jobs.  There is no sense in expending £14,000 for the creation of one job while existing jobs are going by the board.</P>
    <P>The other major economic problem that must be tackled is the problem of inflation.  This budget will add 3 per cent directly to the inflation figure and we know that inflation affects everybody, regardless of his station in life.  There is a feeling of helplessness so far as this situation is concerned.  There is no evidence of the type of effort that was made during the day of the Coalition Government and when the 1974 oil crisis quadrupled oil prices, thereby forcing inflation upwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> The Government tell us that our inflation problem is due to the price of oil and that there is nothing we can do about it. That was not their attitude when in opposition. Neither was it our attitude while in Government when, by way of a combination of budgetary measures which included food subsidies, negotiations with the unions and so on, we succeeded in reducing the then inflation rate from more than 20 per cent to 7 per cent.  That was in 1977.  For the short time that this Government will remain in office, they must show some positive strategy for tackling this problem of inflation.  There is no point in their sitting back helplessly and hoping the problem will go away.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the way in which people will be affected directly by the budget and by the lack of economic strategy on the part of the Government, there is at least one sector who have cause for complaint.  I refer to all those in the PAYE category.  These people are entitled to a just and fair tax system but it is clear that the Government have not the slightest intention of introducing equity into this area.  Income tax was introduced as a temporary measure about the time of the Napoleonic wars.  The system has developed since then and we now have 750,000 people within our PAYE system. Any Government who fail to examine this whole question carefully&mdash;and I am not talking merely about setting up another commission&mdash;are failing those people.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the percentage increase in social welfare payments but in the light of the current trend in inflation these increases will have been eroded even before they become payable. Is there any evidence of a genuine attempt on the part of the Government to remove inequities from the social welfare system, to ensure that those who are entitled to social welfare payments receive them without having to wait for months and without having to make representations to their local T.D. in order to have the money paid?  Is there the outlook that frauds within the system should be eliminated so that there is more money available for those who are entitled <Col N="1872" /> to it?  This is an area that has not been tackled properly.</P>
    <P>The last major area that I wish to consider relates to the total dishonesty of the Government in producing a budget which does not stand up to examination.  As has been well documented by people both within this House and outside it, the budget figures for last year were very far out.  They were out to the extent of £2 million on current account and £130 million on capital account.  One might say that a mistake was made but in the light of last year's experience how can anyone consider the figures for 1981 and say that there is a possibility of inflation?  If this year's figures are also wide of the mark, and I believe they are, it is not a question of a mistake being made but of a deliberate approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with your ruling, I withdraw the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo;' since apparently it is unparliamentary. One learns something every day.  Either a great mistake has been made in regard to this year's budget figures or somebody has come up with those figures knowing well what he was doing.  One way or the other a Government who produce figures in that way do not deserve the support either of this House or of the people. Already we are placing bets within our party as to the extent to which the Government's figures will be out in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My last point is to reiterate my belief that the people generally would be prepared to make some sacrifices, would be prepared to pay a few pence extra on the pint or on cigarettes, if they thought that the money being taken from them in this way was being put to good use.  However, it is clear that, while the Government are <Col N="1873" /> loading on the agony on the people, they have no specific strategy or plan to put to any good use the additional revenue being raised by these tax increases.  The Irish people must get the opportunity of having a Government which are prepared to tackle the economic problems of the country with honesty, vision, imagination and integrity.  They are not getting this at the moment and I do not believe that they will get it after the next election. When that happens and there is a Fine Gael Government, there will be an opportunity to start the process of getting us out of the present economic mess. That is the one hope which is now left to the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make a very brief contribution to this debate.  We have heard much in the past weeks from the Opposition benches about the weaknesses and strengths of the budget, mostly about the weaknesses.  It has been very frustrating for the Opposition to recognise that the budget is a well based one which was acceptable to their constituents and to the most vulnerable section of the community, social welfare recipients.  The Minister for Finance in his budget statement made particular reference to the concern of the Government for social welfare recipients, particularly those on fixed pensions and old age pension. He has made a number of valuable and welcome improvements in their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leader of the main Opposition party has time and time again indicated that if his party were returned to Government they would give the farmers £70 million, give the social welfare recipients more than the Fianna Fáil Government would, and that they would reduce taxation. On the other hand, he accuses the Government of borrowing beyond their means, despite the fact that there has been quite a reduction in borrowing, and in foreign borrowing in particular.  If the Fine Gael Party are going to provide such vast finances for the farmers, the PAYE sector and social welfare recipients and, on the other hand, cut back on borrowing and reduce taxation, before the people <Col N="1874" /> of this country make a decision and for one reason or another, return a Coalition Government&mdash;I certainly do not think that they will return a Fine Gael Government&mdash;if there was even the remotest chance of their returning a Coalition Government, I should like to ask where will the money come from to pay for all of these improvements, to cater for the farmers and the PAYE sector?  I cannot hear a chirp of reason or sense in Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's statement.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Kelly, in his flowery and colourful language, says that, no matter what Government are returned to office after the next election, some tough decisions will have to be made. Deputy FitzGerald also says that but traipses around the country getting signatures for the abolition of rates, resource tax and so on, promising the farmers this, that and the other.  Yet, he comes into this House and says that he will reduce foreign borrowing and taxation.  I do not wish to accuse anybody of misleading this House and, in particular, of misleading the people, but there is certainly a contradiction in the statement from the leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of our unemployment now and in the past has never been a bone of real contention among any of the parties.  The ultimate goal of any politician or any Member of this House is to ensure so far as possible that jobs are available for the young people coming out of school, for those made redundant when the industries and factories in which they are working are incapable of continuing in the prevailing economic climate. Irish industry must adapt and adjust.  It is doing that, but not quickly enough to satisfy any Member of this House.  We should not make political capital out of the sacrifices being made by the unemployed. It is a dreadful and sad thing for a child to grow up in a home in which unemployment dominates.  Where one person is unemployed, three or four others are directly involved in that unemployment. Therefore, it is a serious problem. However, I have confidence, and so have the people, that the present Government are capable of taking us out of <Col N="1875" /> this deep recession and bringing us into a new era in the eighties when ultimately we will have jobs for the young when the worst of the recession recedes.  The people have more confidence in this Government than they had when fewer people, or about the same number, were unemployed under the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>It is right and just that the people should now be reminded of the type of Government which they had to endure&mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; under the Coalition.  We had a Government with no cohesion, no leadership, a Government racked to ruin by divisions and the inablilty to bring legislation through the House, even if agreed at Cabinet level. I do not have to remind Deputies of the Family Planning Bill which former Deputy, now Senator Cooney tried to introduce into this House.  We had a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, former Deputy and Senator, Conor Cruise-O'Brien, who neglected our telephone and postal services. He excluded them from his portfolio to concentrate, as unofficial or official spokesman for the Labour Party on Northern Ireland, thus leaving the incoming Government an enormous legacy of neglect and incompetence in that Department.  Even under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, he was, to say the very least, illiberal.  He tried to extend his influence in the broadcasting authority even to the type of music which should be played on the airwaves.  Rebel songs were not allowed, traditional Irish music of one sort or another was not allowed. There was not a specific instruction, but it was insinuated that on television and radio certain types of songs should not be played.</P>
    <P>I was not in the House at the time, I was an ordinary political activist in my constituency, but I know that certain civil servants were afraid to be seen bringing certain newspapers into Garda Headquarters or the Department of Justice.  The Coalition brought fear in these quarters. Whatever the composition of that Coalition between Labour and Fine Gael, and it was bad and the people gave their verdict on just how bad it was, and the <Col N="1876" /> people should be reminded of it again and again so that they will never forget it, I ask the people today to consider the type of alternative Government Fine Gael and Labour are offering now.  We had the incredible sight of disunity in the parties.  We had the flight of the earls from Fine Gael, the elder statesmen of Fine Gael.  We had the flight of Mark Clinton who will not be going forward. Paddy Donegan will not be going forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What about Deputy Joan Burke?  If I could do so without interruption from Deputy L'Estrange&mdash;I know it is difficult for Deputy L'Estrange to restrain himself&mdash;I would address myself to the choice before the people. This Government produced a wise and reasonable budget and Deputies coming back from the constituencies after the budget appreciated that.  A poll was conducted after the budget and it showed a favourable response to the budget. Anybody I have spoken to has not objected to the considerable improvements in social welfare.  For instance, from April personal adult dependant rates for long-term weekly payments, old age and widows' pensions, invalidity pensions, deserted wive's benefits and allowances and health allowances will be increased by 25 per cent.  That is a wonderful thing.  The Minister increased the duties on beer and cigarettes.  I drink beer and I smoke cigarettes but I have not the slightest objection to these increases, and I do not think that any of my constituents have.  I have the choice of not smoking <Col N="1878" /> and not drinking.  If I see the continuation of the social outlook of the Government in catering for the less well off in the community, I will be prepared to make sacrifices and so will my constituents.</P>
      <P>We have had a lot of talk about money not being made available for infrastructure, roads and telephones.  I have dealt with the telephone service, the legacy of neglect, of despondency, the lack of recognition of the skills of the people in the Post Office.  That is what this Government picked up, and in the circumstances, in the few years they have had the opportunity to do anything about those things they have invested heavily in improving the telephone service, and they are succeeding.</P>
      <P>The petrol duty increase, it will be admitted, was rough and perhaps it will come back in industrial costs and so on. The choice for the private motorist is to drive a little less, to drive more efficiently, to share cars to and from work. That is happening more and more frequently, It is not a bad thing because it will help to conserve energy.  The Minister justified that increase and I fully support him.</P>
      <P>We come to the question of money being made available for investment in roads.  Of course we would like to have highways and flyovers as they have in Britain but we have no colonies to plunder so that we could build these efficient and expensive motorways.  We have industrial development which is bringing juggernauts and other heavy traffic into urban estates.  In my constituency there is very big industrial development and I welcome it even if the roads are not capable of taking the traffic from it.  I welcome the thousands of jobs that have gone into the Sandyford Industrial Estate.  It is an act of confidence in business. It indicates that business people have confidence when they have the right site for factory development.  While sacrifices must be made, I see no reason why we cannot invest in some improvements until such time as money becomes available to provide greater growth structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about rooting out dole fiddlers and the people who are cheating, robbing or stealing in <Col N="1879" /> regard to the dole&mdash;that is what they are doing.  I know that a tradesman frequently will not work unless he is given time off to collect the dole and unless he is paid in cash by the contractor.  That is a difficult thing to put one's finger on but it is happening.  I would agree with the Opposition that these offenders should be rooted out and exposed.  I know that the Government have provided for improvement in the investigation of suspected dole fiddlers and so on.  But there are other fiddlers; there are the high income groups who are avoiding tax that the State could do with.  There is greater concentration on dole fiddlers than on those in high income groups who are avoiding tax and in their own way depriving the State of what it is entitled to.  Only the rich can afford professional accountants. Why does the House not concentrate more on that aspect of the matter? If one puts oneself on the place of an unemployed man who gets one or two days' work and gets £10 or £12 extra in the week&mdash;I am not justifying it&mdash;it is very difficult for such a man with a family even with £50 or £60 to maintain his family.  I say to the people in the Department of Social Welfare that they should continue to pursue those who blatantly and continuously fiddle; they should view with compassion those who may be doing small jobs for a small return and on an occasional basis depending on their ability to do that kind of thing.  The Revenue Commissioners should continue to pursue vigorously people whether professional or business who employ expensive lawyers and accountants in order to avoid payment of income tax.  There seems to be an air of respectability about such people.  I condemn them out of hand; I have no sympathy with them.  I have more sympathy for and understanding of the man who is unemployed and is on a meagre allowance.  Those who have jobs and an income should be thankful and should remember those not so well circumstanced and we should concentrate more on those who are prepared, with the help of professional assistance, to cheat the State of what it is entitled to.</P>
    <P>Nobody has complained to me very <Col N="1880" /> forcefully about the budget.  It is a satisfactory statement of the country's financial position.  It has been repeatedly said to me that we must avoid the tragedy of the British unemployment situation where whole towns and villages, thousands of people, friends and neighbours find themselves without any work.  The monetary Thatcherism of Great Britain has in my view failed and will ultimately lead to the recognition by that country that they no longer have an empire.  Some echelons of British society do not admit that their empire has gone forever and that there is no more plunder, that they must concentrate on developing their own economy.  I hope that no future Government will ever bow the knee to absolute monetarism of that kind which is savage in the extreme and threatens the whole western world with revolt and revolution. I am glad to see that this Government will not go bull-headed in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance dealt fully with vulnerable industries.  For a long time now the Government have been concerned with the problems of sensitive, vulnerable industries.  The changes due to fully pay-related contributions and funding of social insurance expenditure, while principally made for other reasons were in practice of major assistance to these industries.</P>
    <P>I conclude by calling on the Opposition, particularly the leader of Fine Gael, to declare definitively which course of action he intends to take if the people decide to return him to Government? Will he adopt the Thatcher monetarism? Will he close the gates on foreign borrowing? Or will he be flúirseach and spread promises to the farmers, the unemployed and the pensioners?  What will he do when and if he gets the opportunity?  Let the Opposition come clean on this issue which is a very important one.  We can no longer be misled as regards the direction in which the country must go in these difficult times.  We are told by Deputy Kelly, front bench spokesman for his party, that they will have to tighten the belt and, on the other hand, we have Deputy FitzGerald promising sun, moon and stars to the PAYE sector, the farmers <Col N="1881" /> and so on.  Let him now come clean on what he intends to do.  More than likely we are in an election year and it is important to clear up the matter.</P>
    <P>As I do not wish to get into an argument with the Chair, I shall not discuss the composition of any future Government but I should like to make the following observation.  I have been nearly four years a Member of this House and I have witnessed the performance of the Opposition and the divisions in their parties on which attention is not concentrated to the same extent as on the supposed divisions in Fianna Fáil.  I have seen the migration of some elder statesmen from the othe side, I have seen the inability of the parties to unite on certain issues.  I have witnessed the performance of the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party on the election of the Taoiseach and I can only tell the people to be careful when they choose the next government. I can tell them that if they choose a government led either by one or both of the other parties they are choosing a throw-back to the last Coalition Government and for this country in the present difficult times that would be death, economically, socially and culturally. Fianna Fáil will not let the people forget that.  No matter how the Opposition Parties criticise the Government, individually or collectively, they will not break up this party.  We are a united party.  We have supported the budget 100 per cent and there has not been any dissent. That cannot be said for the Opposition parties when they were in government. They disputed among themselves and broke away from one another.  Let them remember that.</P>
    <P>I am not casting any aspersions on the motivation of any politician.  It is my view that all politicians are here for the best possible motives, but for one reason or another they find themselves dragged into less than honest criticism.  When they can produce anything better than Fianna Fáil, let them stand up and tell us exactly what they propose.  Let them say how they would govern the country.  They cannot have it both ways and I intend to <Col N="1882" /> emphasise that point at every opportunity before the next election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the motives behind the formulation of the budget somewhat puzzling.  It can hardly be described as a &ldquo;give-away&rdquo; budget.  Contrary to what Deputy Andrews has said, I found few people who were pleased with it.  It has affected most people adversely, but while it has not been a &ldquo;give-away&rdquo; budget, neither has it been a budget that set out to solve the economic ills of the country.</P>
      <P>We look on a budget as the annual housekeeping plan of the government of the day but one could not so describe this budget.  It is only a short-term manoeuvre. We can see quite clearly that the Book of Estimates on which the budget was based has been cooked and the budget can only be described as fraudulent. It does not make any attempt to face up to the economic problems of the country.  A whole series of figures in the Book of Estimates point to the fact that the budget is not a realistic assessment of our economic position.  Virtually every figure can be questioned because it is obvious that the money provided in the Estimates will not be sufficient to finance the relevant Departments for a full year. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that enormous Supplementary Estimates will be introduced during the year.</P>
      <P>If my memory serves me correctly, in 1980 the Supplementary Estimates came to approximately £300 million.  On this occasion the figures have been so distorted that I imagine the Supplementary Estimates that will have to be introduced in 1981 will be £1,000 million or even more.  There has been vast under-estimation in respect of the Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Andrews that the increases in the social welfare allowances and benefits are to be welcomed but I do not think the increases were extravagant. They were what the recipients and the rest of us expected.  They are barely keeping up with the rate of inflation &mdash; in fact, they may not keep up with the huge increases in the cost of foodstuffs and fuel, items that affect social welfare recipients to a very large extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> There has not been anything in the budget for any other section of the community. It has set out to penalise the working people and the private sector. Any working person who travels to his place of work by car or motor cycle is faced with an enormous increase in the cost of transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision to close the Ceimicí Teo. glucose plant at Corroy, County Mayo, has been taken.  Discussions are now at an advanced stage between Fielder Gillespie, an Australian company, Ceimicí Teo. and the Industrial Development Authority for the establishment of a wheat protein and glucose manufacturing plant at Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  A final decision on this joint venture is not expected for some months.  If it is decided to go ahead with the joint venture project it will be necessary to discontinue the production of glucose at Corroy as soon as the new plant is in production.  However, both Ceimicí Teo. and the IDA will seek an alternative industry at Corroy to employ the existing workforce.</P>

      <P>We have the ludicrous position where Ceimicí Teo. are involved in negotiations for the Cork project and, at the same time, are telling the country they do not intend to close Corroy.  There is something anomalous in that kind of statement.  Why, after spending £1.63 million on refurbishing and updating Corroy, was it not seen fit to provide a milling plant there which is now being proposed for Cork?  In the past year £1.63 millions of public money was spent there on new plant and anti-pollution facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters for the company.  When the other industry goes ahead it will not be profitable to continue the present one.  In the event of Ceimicí Teo. having to close down at Corroy, the Government will take all necessary steps to ensure that some other industry is provided for the area.  We have had no decision stating categorically that the Corroy factory will close down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If Ceimicí Teo. are successful in their discussions on the joint venture, it will close.  May I put it to the Minister that, having answered Question No. 5, the same kind of special consideration will be given to Ceimicí Teo. in Corroy as was given to Kiltimagh, which so far has been unsuccessful.  Has the Minister's office any responsibility for a decision which would undertake to provide a milling plant in Corroy or is he washing his hands clean?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, through the IDA, have assisted in every possible way in the establishment of industry.  They have assisted with grants in the case of Corroy.  A considerable amount of money was made available over the last number of years to assist the operation there, but it has not been very successful.  Last year the output was 11,000 tons as against 24,000 the previous year.  Decisions are taken on the basis of the actual situation.  If the project is viable, the company will continue.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the position of the company in question is as stated in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>I share the concern, implicit in the question, for the future of manufacture of the company's product.  Despite the prestige of this product, the company has, over a long number of years and under different owners, had difficulty in trading profitably.  This has, I understand, been a major constraint on Fóir Teoranta in regard to the provision of further loan finance for the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this company are currently awaiting finalisation of contracts for carpets in Irish emassies in Brussels, Athens and Paris and that the Government are currently in a position of bringing forward those contracts and ensuring the continuation of jobs in 1981?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The company have been in touch with the Office of Public Works on the lines suggested by the Deputy. There are also efforts being taken in an endeavour to involve some other people in the carpet industry to explore the possibility of a take-over.  There have been many developments in relation to this whole project.  I am sure the Government will endeavour to do everything possible to ensure continuation of the factory but that is the decision of Fóir Teoranta at present in relation to the operation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the carpets being manufactured by this company are very different from the normal commercial carpets made in other factories throughout the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore to apply the normal yardstick of profitability in this case is not the right way of assessing its value to the country.  We must preserve this skill.  The wares of this factory are an advertisement in every embassy belonging to the Irish Government throughout the world and even in this House, as Deputy Quinn has said.  Rather than looking for a commercial carpet company who will say &ldquo;It is not viable and we cannot absorb the skills into our factory,&rdquo; the Government should treat this as a special case outside Fóir Teoranta and the IDA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism the steps he proposes to take to establish the reasons for the size of the deficit in NET; the amount of money borrowed by NET in each of the last five financial years; the origin of the funds borrowed and the amount of interest paid, or due to be paid, by NET in each of those financial years; and the estimated funds required for the company this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reasons for NET's losses in recent years have been (i) the effects of the delay in construction and the cost escalations associated with the company's ammonia/urea plant at Marino Point, County Cork; (ii) the company's inadequate equity and high borrowing level and consequent heavy financing charges; (iii) the impact of the continuing strength of sterling and the US dollar (particularly in the last quarter of 1980) on NET's substantial <Col N="1897" /> foreign currency borrowings; (iv) the high depreciation charge associated with the Marino Point plant; (v) changes in production technology which have made the company's involvement in the manufacture of phosphoric acid and compound fertilisers at Arklow unprofitable resulting in increasing financial losses at the Arklow plant; (vi) the general depression in fertiliser price levels since the 1973 oil crisis; and (vii) overmanning and high labour charges in many of the company's operations.  In addition, NET's losses for 1978, 1979 and 1980 were also influenced by the write-off of substantial losses associated with NET's Arklow Gypsum plant and the effects of a four months strike at the Arklow fertiliser plant in 1978-9.</P>

    <P>As regards the estímated funds required for the company this year, capital repayments amounting to approximately £50 million&mdash;based on exchange rates prevailing at 31 December 1980&mdash;will be required to be made by NET in 1981.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in connection with Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta up to the period ended 31 December 1979 is contained in the annual accounts of the company, which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the NET Acts.</P>
      <P>I understand that the unaudited estimated loss for the year ended 31 December 1980 is over £55 million, which consists of a trading loss of £19.7 million &mdash; after taking into account financing charges of £26.7 million &mdash; depreciation charges of over £11 million, a book currency translation loss of over £18 million, in respect of the conversion of the company's outstanding borrowings in foreign currencies to Irish pounds at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December 1980 and a write off of £6.6 million in respect of losses at Arklow Gypsum.</P>
      <P>I would regard it as premature at this stage to give any indication of the estimated profit or loss for the year ending 31 December 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it was the Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies who effectively unearthed and displayed to the public the full extent of the mismanagement of NET is the Minister in a position to indicate to the House <Col N="1902" /> whether the Government will go back to that committee before any final decision is taken with regard to the restructuring of or redundancies in that company?  Will the Government seek the opinion of that committee who played such a critical role?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made some public announcements in relation to the position of this company. He has had consultation with some experts in relation to the matter and I am sure that the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee would have to be taken into account by the Government in considering the future of NET.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government took the original decision to proceed with NET's Marino Point plant on the basis of an estimated total cost of fixed assets of £42 million.  However, when NET subsequently made allowance for costs other than fixed asset costs &mdash; for example, pre-production expenses and interest payments, working capital and cost escalations, the overall cost of the project was put at £63.5 million, which the company regard as the first detailed estimate.  The final cost of the Marino Point plant is estimated at £137.3 million, representing an increase of 116 per cent on the estimate of £63.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that considerable, sustained charges were made on the trade union movement as being uniquely and virtually exclusively responsible for the escalation of costs of 116 per cent?  In view of the answer that he has now given to the House, will he undertake to clarify through the GIS that the trade union movement and the workers on the site at Marino Point in no way contributed to the increased costs as they were charged with doing?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, on the basis of the figures he has now given to the House, if anybody is to be charged with neligence or irresponsibility in the increase of costs, it is the management of NET when the estimate went from around £40 million as a sketch price to £63 million before the work started, and that labour on site costs can in no way be held responsible for that kind of mistake?  Will the Minister, in some way within the responsibility of his Department, clarify that matter because workers in the Marino Point area have been blackguarded in this regard by informed opinion which has emanated as a result of lack of statistics?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first two parts of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The unrealised book losses arising on the foreign currency borrowings referred to in the tabular statement, as a result of the net change in exchange rates between the time of borrowing and 31 December 1980, amount to just over IR £18.61 million. The actual losses will be determined by the relationship between the Irish pound and the other currencies on the dates of repayment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the continual double and treble parking of motor vehicles in front of Pearse Street Garda Station, Dublin, and of the prolonged parking of cars which have been stolen, or which are under investigation in front of these premises; if he is further aware of the considerable public criticism of motorists in regard to this particularly when no parking tickets are issued in respect of such vehicles; and if he will as a matter of urgency arrange for adequate car parking for the members of the Garda Síochána employed in this station and for a pound area in the city centre to which such cars can be removed pending investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, because of the pressure on the limited parking space available at Pearse Street Garda Station, double parking of motor vehicles has occurred from time to time and, occassionally, treble parking.  The vehicles involved have included both official Garda vehicles and vehicles belonging to the public.  I am informed that it is not correct to say that there is continual double and treble parking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 16 official vehicles attached to the station and, of necessity, these are from time to time parked outside.  Gardaí from other areas who in the course of their official duties have occasion to call to the station necessarily park there also. Members of the public occasionally park near the station when calling there on business.  While, additionally, stolen cars which have been recovered and cars which are otherwise under investigation <Col N="1915" /> are parked in this area to facilitate investigations, every effort is made to ensure that they are not kept there any longer than is necessary.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the parking problem at Pearse Street Station admits of no easy solution, as there is no space in the immediate vicinity which could be used for off-street parking.  The Deputy will appreciate that to enable the Garda to carry out their duties it is essential that there should be some parking of official vehicles outside the station.  However the Garda authorities will do their best to ensure that this parking is restricted to what is necessary and that double or treble parking is avoided.  Arrangements have recently been made by the Garda to the effect that where stolen or other vehicles brought to the station for investigation cannot be dealt with speedily, that is to say, within a matter of hours rather than days, they will be taken elsewhere until inquiries are completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1916" /> for Justice the number of ground rents purchased to date under the new legislation.</P>

      <P>The special purchase scheme provided by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, came into operation on 1 August 1978.  Between that date and 30 January 1981, inclusive, 9,144 vesting certificates were issued through the Land Registry under the scheme.  In an additional 929 cases the purchase money had been paid to the ground landlord but the vesting certificate had yet to issue, giving a total of 10,073 ground rents which had by the end of January been effectively bought out under the Act.</P>
      <P>Ground rent tenants of local authority houses are given the right of purchase under the 1978 Act but the procedure is a matter for the local authorities and they do not come within the Land Registry scheme.  I have no information as to the number of such tenants who have exercised their right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the progress of the scheme?  Will it, as originally announced, lead to the abolition of ground rents, bearing in mind that on his own estimate there were, I think, 250,000 ground rents in the country at that time and this abolition amounts to .04 per cent to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy O'Keeffe, to others in his party and to members of the Labour party continually knocking this scheme which I introduced in 1978.  This is a better scheme and far more favourable to owner occupiers than the scheme promoted by the Coalition Government.  That Government refused to make any financial contributions to such a scheme, made no bones about that being their policy and defended it.  The scheme I introduced has worked effectively.  We have had over 10,000 vesting certificates issued, despite the fact that the scheme has been continually knocked outside the House by representatives of the party opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind that to win the last election <Col N="1917" /> a promise was made to abolish ground rents?  Is he satisfied that after two years of the scheme, which is limited to a five year period, it is going to abolish ground rents within the five-year period considering that after two years, on his figures, only .04 per cent of ground rents have been abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated, 10,000 people or more have benefited from the scheme.  I am sure that 10,000 would be a much greater number but for the campaign against it outside the House by members of the Deputy's party.  The Deputy knows full well what I am talking about.  They have done their best to sabotage this scheme from the beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in the next three years the remaining 98 per cent or 99 per cent of ground rents will be purchased?  Does he expect the promise which his Government made to have a scheme which will effectively abolish ground rents to be carried out?  Does he seriously expect anybody to believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that when I introduced other landlord and tenants legislation we discussed the matter he is talking about for hours on end. I reject the political innuendo in his question now, as I did every time it was raised. I am more than satisfied that this scheme would be far more effective but for the sabotage efforts being conducted.</P>

      <P>The towns covered by the patrol car are Bailieboro, Ballyjamesduff, Cootehill, Kingscourt, Virginia and Shercock.

Does he not think that one full-time car for the Bailieboro area, which includes Kingscourt, Mullagh, Shercock, Tullyvin, Virginia and Cootehill as well as Bailieboro and Ballyjamesduff, is totally inadequate?  Is the Minister further aware that there has been a number of bank raids in separate towns in this area over the last couple of years, that there is a number of large industrial factories in the area and that there is a large number of dance halls?

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> 1. inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>(1) the immediate and other causes of, and the circumstances leading to, the fire at the Stardust Club, Artane, Dublin, on the 14th February, 1981.</P>
    <P>(2) the circumstances of and leading to the loss of life and personal injury at the Stardust Club on the 14th February, 1981.</P>
    <P>(3) the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 14th February, 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with fire at the Stardust Club.</P>
    <P>(4)  the means and systems of emergency escape from the Stardust Club, and their adequacy, on the 14th February, 1981.</P>
    <P>(5) the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 14th February, 1981, at the Stardust Club to prevent and to minimise and otherwise to deal with any other circumstances that led or contributed to the loss of life and personal injury aforesaid or might have led or contributed to loss of life or personal injury;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>2. making such recommendations as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper in respect of the statutory and other provisions in relation to fire, fire prevention and means and systems of emergency escape from fire, their adequacy and enforcement and any other matters that the Tribunal considers relevant.</P>
    <P>Since submitting the motion I have decided to revise it in paragraph 2 so as to delete the original word &ldquo;general&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;statutory and other&rdquo;.  We are all, Government and people alike, extremely shocked and distressed by the appalling tragedy which occurred in the Stardust Club in Artane in the early morning of Saturday last, when so many young people lost their lives and more than 150 others suffered injuries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> On behalf of the Government and myself, I wish to again extend our deepest sympathy to the bereaved, to their relatives and friends and to all those who have suffered injury.  I should like to take this opportunity also of paying tribute to the heroism and devotion to duty of the members of the fire service, the ambulance services, the Garda, hospital staff, members of Civil Defence and others involved for their marvellous work on the night of the tragedy.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to the victims of this disastrous fire and to their relatives, and, indeed, to all our people, to do everything in our power to establish the circumstances and causes of the fire.  We must seek out as fully as possible the lessons to be learned from this terrible event, so as to prevent, as far as is humanly possible, such a disaster occurring again.  It is for these reasons that the Government decided that the body appointed to hold the inquiry should have the highest status in law and they concluded that a Tribunal of Inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, would be the most appropriate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The President of the High Court has consented that the Honourable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane will constitute the Tribunal. He will be assisted by a number of assessors who have been chosen on the basis of high calibre, experience and expertise.  Their names are as follows:</P>
    <P>Professor David Rasbash, B.Sc.,</P>
    <P>Ph. D.,</P>
    <P>Department of Fire Safety Engineering,</P>
    <P>Edinburgh University.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gunnar Haurum,</P>
    <P>Chief Inspector of the Fire Service,</P>
    <P>Denmark.</P>
    <P>Mr. Pierce Pigott, B.E., M.Sc., C.</P>
    <P>Eng., F.I.E.I.,</P>
    <P>Head of Construction Division,</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha,</P>
    <P>St. Martin's House,</P>
    <P>Waterloo Road,</P>
    <P>Dublin, 4.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> I should like to express my gratitude to Mr. Justice Keane and the assessors for agreeing to the Government's invitation to act.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is being given very wide terms of reference to enable it to carry out its task.  It will be empowered to inquire into the cause of the disaster and the circumstances in which it occured and to examine the adequacy of the measures taken to prevent, detect or minimise or otherwise deal with the occurrence and also the means of emergency escape.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's declared determination to have the most searching and exhaustive inquiry carried out, the tribunal is established for making such recommendations as it, having regard to its findings, thinks proper in respect of the general provisions in relation to fire, fire prevention and means and systems of emergency escape from fire, their adequacy and enforcement and any other matter that the tribunal considers relevant.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will be empowered to require the attendance of witnesses, the giving of evidence and the production of documents and the terms of reference will provide the tribunal with full scope in its conduct of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The State will provide an independent solicitor and counsel who will be available to act for the next-of-kin of any victim and for any injured party before the tribunal. Any such party who wishes to be represented by this legal service should apply to the solictor.  Every party is of course at liberty to make his own arrangements independently of this State aid. The tribunal will sit in the premises of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, Blackhall Place, Dublin, and will have its first meeting on Monday, 2 March 1981.</P>
    <P>In deference to the feelings of the bereaved and the relatives of the victims of the tragedy, I had intended to confine my remarks to the minimum necessary to introduce this motion.  However, I feel obliged to comment on certain unfounded statements of a serious nature which have been made and which may have given rise to some public disquiet.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the fire service has <Col N="1988" /> been called into question and I should like to put on record that on the night in question the Dublin Fire Brigade behaved in an exemplary manner.  From a report that I received at 10.30 a.m. on the morning of the fire the following facts emerged.  From the initial call to the fire brigade at 1.43 a.m. four fire engines, including a turn-table ladder together with an emergency tender and two ambulances, immediately responded.  On arrival the brigade immediately went into action.  After an assessment of the situation a call was made, eight minutes after the original summons at 1.51 a.m., to headquarters and the Major Accident Plan was put into operation.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made that my Department have deliberately delayed action to strengthen and improve the fire service.  I am satisfied that a résumé, necessarily brief in these circumstances, will show that this is not so.</P>
    <P>The work of improvement commenced with a comprehensive review of the service, and the legislative framework within which it operates, by a working party whose report was published in 1975.  Following full consideration of the report and comment received thereon, mainly from local authorities, action has been initiated by my Department on all the principal recommendations made by the working party.  Furthermore, to enable progress to be achieved as quickly as possible, the administrative and technical staff of the Fire Services Section has been expanded considerably.</P>
    <P>The following are some of the more important measures which have been taken:</P>
    <P>Detailed local reviews of the fire service have been initiated in all areas, with a view to identifying deficiencies so that remedial action could be taken.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for the fire service has been increased considerably &mdash; from £694,000 in 1977 to £2,500,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The programme of central training courses for fire service personnel has been expanded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> A Fire Prevention Council have been set up to promote fire prevention measures generally.</P>
    <P>A study has been completed on the need for improvement of fire service telecommunications and action has been initiated with a view to having the recommended improvements implemented.</P>
    <P>Important guidelines have issued to local authorities on recruit training.</P>
    <P>I should mention that personnel from the local fire service are giving valuable assistance to the Department in relation to many of these matters, which leads me to the comments which have been made on civil servants: I need hardly say that they are entirely without foundation.</P>
    <P>Having made these points about what has been done, there is always room for improvement as in all areas of public administration.  I will be bringing forward, as a matter of urgency, proposals for improving the law on the fire service, in particular in relation to fire prevention matters.  Draft proposals for a Bill are at an advance stage.  The heads of the Bill have been cleared with other Departments and I will be bringing the scheme of the Bill before my colleagues in the Cabinet within ten days.</P>
    <P>As you will be aware, I have requested all city and county managers to arrange for immediate inspection of all potentially dangerous buildings, such as dance halls, discotheques, night clubs and other places of public entertainment in which large numbers of people may be placed at risk in the event of fire.  I have also asked that any premises which do not meet fire safety requirements should be closed, under existing powers, pending the taking of remedial measures.</P>
    <P>Draft Building Regulations were prepared in the Department and published on 29 November 1976.  Copies were widely circulated by the Department to local authorities and to professional, administrative and trade bodies and comments were invited from interested parties within six months.  A Government <Col N="1990" /> statement accompanying their publication said that, pending formal making of the regulations the draft would afford a valuable guide to those engaged in the design and construction of buildings and those in the local authority service concerned in that purpose.</P>
    <P>As recently as last November, in a speech to the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, I asked the industry to continue to see the draft as a code of practice until such time as the final document had been prepared.</P>
    <P>Requests were received that the time for comments &mdash; over 600 were received &mdash; be extended for a further period and these were granted up to 31 December 1977.  Even with these extensions comments continue to be received, in particular on the method of implementation and control.  The original technical draft, prepared by An Foras Forbartha, was not prepared in a legal form and a completely new draft had to be prepared to ensure that the regulations when made would be legally viable.</P>
    <P>I now propose to issue within the next 10 days the draft of the regulations with amendments, and within six weeks to publish a revised version incorporating the amendments.  I intend that they be used by local authorities, industrial and professional bodies in their operation, as if they had statutory backing.  New legislation will be required to give statutory backing to the regulations and to provide a more flexible system of control.  I have already initiated action on this enabling legislation and I will bring it before the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have met representatives of the Fire Prevention Council on a number of occasions during the past few days and in the light of the discussions I have now decided that a special task force will be immediately established under the direction of the present chairman of the council, Mr. Geoffrey Cronin.  I intend that the task force will liaise closly with local authorities in the latter's role on fire prevention and keep me fully briefed.  The head of the task force will report directly to me.  It will also augment the efforts of the Fire Prevention Council on such matters as publicity, advertising, seminars, <Col N="1991" /> preparation of instruction leaflets, all aimed at increasing public awareness of fire hazards with particular reference to places of public entertainment.  Further details of the work and composition of the task force will be announced later.  I would like to take this opportunity to convey my thanks to Mr. Cronin for making his services available.  A number of amendments put down seem to envisage a major and comprehensive review of the entire legislative and statutory provisions covering fire and public safety.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that such a major review should not be undertaken by a tribunal of this sort.  The Government are influenced in this matter by the need in the interests of all those affected by the tragedy that the tribunal's findings should be available at the earliest possible date and that its progress should not be impeded by detailed investigation of the matters referred to in the amendments. The Government consider that these matters should be looked into in depth by a full-scale broadly-based commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Government have in mind, as a separate matter, the establishment of such a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>To conclude I have no doubt that the House shares fully the Government's objectives in this matter and will lend its full support to this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1., to delete sub-paragraph (3) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the measures and their adequacy, including the Draft Building Regulations of the Department of the Environment and the statutory provisions and regulations which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and the Local Authority, taken on or before the 14th February 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise and otherwise deal with fire at the Stardust Club.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Right through the length and breadth of the country shock and horror waves are still spreading as a result of the terrible tragedy last Saturday morning.  It was a tragedy such as some people say never occurred in this country before.  That is not quite correct because as far back as the thirties we had the Drumcollogher tragedy which had a certain amount of similarity to the present tragedy: it was in a place of entertainment; it was caused by certain things which in my opinion were not at the time properly investigated with the result that most people still do not know what actually caused that disaster or why so many people were killed. We had the tragedy in the convent in Cavan, the tragedy in Whitegate.  We had the more recent tragedy in Burdoran and we now have this one.  There were others of not such major proportions but horrible tragedies they were not only for those directly concerned but for their friends and relatives.  The one thing we must do, having given all the sympathy and solace we can to the relatives and the injured, is try to ensure that something like this never happens again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be critical and this is not the place to try to score party political points.  There are many things I should like to say but from which I shall refrain. I would, however, like the Minister to comment on why the draft building regulations were not dealt with before now. Why was something not done about <Col N="1993" /> them?  They were not drawn up in a hurry.  They took quite a long time to prepare and when prepared were sent throughout the country for the purpose of getting comments and those comments came in &mdash; over 600, the Minister says &mdash; and these regulations having been discussed and reviewed, we find that from 1976 to date we have not been in a position to put them into operation.  It is now suggested that the Government should commence preparing for such operation.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister or his predecessor but I believe that what occurred in Drumcollogher and in all the other fire tragedies down the years can occur again unless we are very careful. Last Saturday's tragedy was terrible; it is still terrible and will be terrible for the next few months but we tend to forget tragedies very quickly and if something is not done now as a matter of urgency I believe it will drop into the background and over a period of time we will find reasons for not doing what we should have done before now and what we should now do as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Our amendment was put down for a number of reasons, one being that we felt that the motion before the House was not adequate to cover the serious situation that had arisen.  We therefore suggest that the House should delete (3).  As a matter of interest I should be glad to know why some other system of numbering sections of the motion and the subjects of the motion was not devised because it is rather confusing to have 1. and (1) again and 2. and (2) again when the matter could be dealt with by using letters or Roman numerals.  We want to delete (3) which says &ldquo;the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 14th February 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise the otherwise to deal with fire at the Stardust Club.&rdquo;  We do not think that is adequate and we suggest it should be substituted by the wording &ldquo;the measures and their adequacy, including the Draft Building Regulations of the Department of the Environment and the statutory provisions and regulations which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and the Local Authority taken on or <Col N="1994" /> before the 14th February, 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with fire at the Stardust Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One word which must be included in any regulations made by the Minister is the word &ldquo;statutory.&rdquo;  I remember well regulations made many years ago and passed around to local authorities which did not have, as far as I am aware, the statutory authority to be operated, but which did have the effect that the fire officers in the particular local authority areas who were really interested in seeing that things were done properly insisted, for instance, on having secondary lighting in every place of entertainment, lighting which would continue to show where the exits were when the main current went off.  These officers insisted on having panic bolts put on doors and on the requisite number of doors being available. In my own county, in my own constituency, small halls were closed down because the necessary money could not be found to carry out these alterations. There were those who said at the time that it was terrible to close down these small halls which were very necessary in the area.  I felt that those people were right, but after last Saturday morning's tragedy, I am perfectly satisfied that those fire officers were correct.  That is the type of person we must have &mdash; somebody who will lay down regulations which, although it may appear the popular thing not to have them carried out, must be carried out and to the letter.  If those regulations had been in operation all over this country, we could not have had the terrible tragedy which occurred.</P>
    <P>I am under the impression that the tragedy could have been very much worse.  The crowd there, and the consequent loss of life could have been very much greater.  I may be in a minority, but I am not prepared to accept at all that the fire was due to vandalism.  I do not believe that we have in this country &mdash; bad as some of us may be &mdash; people who would deliberately set fire to a place where a number of people were enjoying themselves and so run the risk of causing such a tragedy.  I hope that I am right in this. There are far too many prepared to rush <Col N="1995" /> into print and claim that this, that and the other was done.  I believe it was a terrible accident, but an accident.</P>
    <P>The main point is that, when the tribunal is set up and when they bring in their findings, they do that without fear or favour.  I do not know any of the people mentioned by the Minister as being members of the tribunal but hope that, no matter who they are, there will be no glossing over or covering up and that people will not be allowed to get the impression that the fire could not have been avoided if it could have been avoided.  If somebody was wrong and if certain precautions which should have been taken were not, the public should know.  We do not want a repetition of inquiries into fires causing loss of life which never saw the light of day.  That is not the way to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>People must know.</P>
    <P>There is another serious matter about which the authorities have been very lenient.  We know that there must be an annual registration of clubs and places of entertainment.  We know that the registration is carried out as a result of a daylight visit by some officer, high or low, who takes a look around the place and then walks out.  If there is something amiss which is not very obvious, then a licence is usually granted.  Whatever regulations are being made should include stipulation that there be very regular inspections carried out, while, in fact, the place of entertainment is in operation. That is the time when one can see whether or not there is a danger in the way it is being operated.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the licences are usually granted for a set figure.  In the Stardust Club, I understand that the number was around 1,600 or 1,700 and that half that number were present on that night.  Does anybody here deny that there are clubs, hotels and places of entertainment in this country licensed for 1,000 which, on occasions, have packed 4,000 to 5,000 youngsters in to see some star who is there for the night at enormous expense?  If we are really interested in having this thing done properly, this overcrowding must be prohibited by the <Col N="1996" /> draft regulations being prepared by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have tabled three amendments and the Labour Party have put in an amendment which the Government have covered by their latest amendment, in respect of having statutory powers. Human nature being what it is, unless statutory powers are put in, we will not have these regulations carried out.  Even if statutory powers are included, unless there is the necessary mechanism there to ensure that these regulations are carried out properly, ways will be devised of avoiding them.  Most people here, will remember &mdash; I think it was about six months ago &mdash; when a Member of the Fire Officers' Association criticised our fire services, saying that he felt that we were due a very big fire disaster with heavy loss of life.  Most of us thought that the man was talking through his hat. Events have proved him right.  Perhaps some of us may not have had the due respect for this expertise which we now have.  The people studying those matters must have some way of knowing what is actually happening.  Perhaps what he said was a wild guess, but it was far too close to the bone for comfort.  When we do come to prepare these regulations, whether we like them or not, the experts in these fields must be consulted.  We must know what they think must be done. We do not, of course, have to decide that what they propose is correct.  If we decide that it is not, we shall have a very guilty conscience afterwards if it turns out that they knew an awful lot more than we thought about what was the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>When this terrible tragedy occurred, there was heroism there which many of us will never know anything about.  I believe that everybody connected with the tragedy displayed a courage which can only be displayed on an occasion like this. The ambulance service, the people who went to assist, the people in the hospitals, had a shocking job to do and they did that job magnificently.  Having said that, we still must be prepared to deal with those problems in a different way, because let us not forget, while the plan <Col N="1997" /> in Dublin worked well and saved a lot of additional lives, that would not have been in operation if the tragedy had occurred in a country town.  The numbers involved might be very much more than those involved in the Stardust Club on the night of the tragedy.  We must take this as being not merely a Dublin thing.  Many around the country seem to think that what happens in Dublin does not affect them. What happened in Dublin this time could have happened anywhere in Ireland under similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>One thing should be included when licences are being granted for places like this.  There must be a stipulation that, when panic bolts are put on the doors, there will be instructions as to how to open them.  Without such instructions they are as dangerous as if the doors were locked.  As well, there should be a number of people there to see to it that each door can be opened, and should be opened, at the correct time.</P>
    <P>The tendency to try to keep out the people who try to get in for nothing is there: the tendency to lock doors when they should not be locked is there.  I do not want to colour the possibilities here. They are matters which will have to be investigated because there is no point in having a staff of 40 or 50 if, when such staff are required at a time when people are frightened out of their lives trying to get out of a blazing building, they are not there to do the job.</P>
    <P>In the amendment we have tabled we express full agreement that the Government must do something quickly.  If we are to introduce legislation to deal with places of entertainment, I would point out that places of entertainment are not the only fire hazards.  Some of our schools, some of our hospitals, some of our public buildings including this House, are not as safe as people might consider them to be.  Therefore, when we come to deal with the whole question of this tragedy, provision for adequate compensation by way of insurance cover will have to be a proviso because there is no point in people coming along and commenting that it must be arson or malicious damage and that the people of the country should pay.  Those who are getting the money <Col N="1998" /> out of places of entertainment should make the provision and unless it is laid down by law that they should have adequate coverage, that coverage will not be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of those occasions when we in public life have a responsibility to speak and when perhaps none of us approaches the task with any great anticipation.  On such occasions we would prefer not to speak, but the onus is on all of us this time to ensure, in the wake of a tragedy such as this, that every step will be taken to ensure that a tragedy of the like or scale of this will not be allowed to happen again.  It would not be appropriate for us to apportion blame or to expect to be able to define at this time the areas that need consideration, but there is no doubt that on a wide variety of fronts in relation to fire prevention, protection and control, the adequacy of existing legislation and regulations can be questioned in regard to a number of areas.  Some of them must be given urgent and overdue attention if we are to achieve a comprehensive fire prevention and fire fighting service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an obligation in this House now to see to it on behalf of the people that all necessary steps will be taken immediately to bring about a truly comprehensive service.  That is our responsibility and it is the least the public expect from this House at a time such as this.  It is not for us to pass judgment but we have a duty and obligation to ensure that the tragedy of Saturday morning last can never happen again.  We have a responsibility, which there is no great happiness in having to undertake, on behalf of those killed in the fire, but we also have a responsibility to their parents and relatives and to the general public, to the State and the institutions of the State, and the local authorities who are charged with the responsibility of dealing with matters such as this.  We also have a responsibility to the operators and owners of places of public resort to ensure that the State will guide and instruct those people on how to maintain their premises at the highest possible level of public safety.  I hope that responsibility of ours <Col N="1999" /> will be discharged adequately as a result of the debate in this House and in the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I will explain the reason why my party thought it necessary to table several amendments to the Government's motion.  Our amendment, No. 3, seeks, at the end of paragraph 1 of the Government's original motion, to insert the words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;having made an interim report on these matters, to inquire into</P>
    <P>(6) the adequacy of the existing legislation, statutory regulations and local authority by-laws for the purpose of securing safety in the case of fire in places of public resort, and the adequacy of the draft building regulations published in November 1976 to cover the dangers of fire arising in structures and furnishings</P>
    <P>(7) the adequacy of inspection and control procedures and of the enforcement of the relevant laws, statutory regulations and by-laws</P>
    <P>(8) the adequacy of public liability insurance requirements in relation to such matters and to make&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would lead on into the original clause 2 of the Government's motion.  We tabled that amendment because we felt there might be a danger, because of the combination of clauses 1 and 2 of the Government's motion, that the tribunal, having examined the circumstances surrounding the fire in the Stardust and having come to the several conclusions which they will undoubtedly come to, would then feel obliged by virtue of clause 2 of the Government's motion to begin to examine the operation of fire fighting and prevention measures in every local authority throughout the country and the adequacy of these matters in relation to all public buildings and perhaps private buildings.</P>
    <P>In effect, we feared that the tribunal might find they had been assigned a job on which they could not present any reasonable conclusive report for a period spanning years.  We do not believe it is the intention of the House or of the general public that the tribunal should be set <Col N="2000" /> up and should remain in operation for a period of years.  The public want and demand and are entitled to expect that there should be an early as well as a comprehensive report on the circumstances surrounding the Stardust tragedy so that the steps the tribunal will regard as necessary can be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>That is why we tabled that amendment suggesting that the tribunal, having investigated under clause 1 in the Government's motion, would then make an interim report on those specific matters. That would allow the Government to take the necessary steps to amend legislation and to make regulations, and to provide necessary finance or personnel so that the local authorities would be allowed to revise their procedures as they might think best.  That would allow the tribunal to go on to make observations on the adequacy or otherwise of the general legislative position and on local authorities by-laws and the efficacy or otherwise of the manner in which services are carried out at ground level by control staffs, where they are available, in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The third aspect of our amendment deals with the area of public liability insurance.  The situation at present is that there is no obligation on any operator to provide any degree of public liability insurance.  In fact, if the Stardust Club is insured to the average level of public liability cover that is provided for similar ventures, probably the insurance liability cover does not extend beyond £1 million. I will not dwell on the adequacy or otherwise of that aspect in this House.  I will let Members of the House draw their own conclusions as to whether a public liability cover of £1 million or even less is adequate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why paragraph (8) of our amendment No. 3 was inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> The entire question of the examination of public liability insurance is not included in the Government's motion.  It is included in our amendment and I was endeavouring to explain to the House why it should be included.  May I continue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Chair was worried that the House might get into something that would not be a matter for the House on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all of us would be worried about that.  We felt that paragraph (8) should be included, that the tribunal should be invited to make comment on whether there should be a statutory obligation on persons who operate places where the public are likely to congregate by way of admission charge, and to decide whether there should be an obligation on the operators or owners of such places to carry a specified level of public liability insurance.  That is why that sentence was included in our original amendment.</P>
      <P>We considered that the adequacy of existing legislation and regulations was a fair point to have included.  There is a range of Acts and regulations all of which purport in one way or another to bring regulation and order into this area but which collectively seem to have quite a number of weakness when one examines them in their collective effect.  For instance, there are the Planning Acts of 1963 and 1976 which between them brought about the publication of the draft building regulations of 1976 which are referred to in our amendment.  There is also the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, under which any place operating as a public dance hall must seek an annual licence in the courts.  There is the Fire Brigade Act, 1940, under which the sanitary authorities have certain obligations in respect of providing fire services and I shall refer to this shortly.  There is also the 1890 Act referring to Dublin Corporation which allowed the corporation in 1934 to adopt by-laws in respect of protection from fire in places of public resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary part of this situation <Col N="2002" /> is the fact that Dublin Corporation are the only authority in the country who have a specific code of by-laws with regard to protection from fire in places of public resort.  They are probably the authority who have the largest number of control staff and who operate a fire service with probably the most sophisticated equipment and training.  Yet even with that background and staff, the provision of such services have proved inadequate in the case of the tragedy to which we are referring because it appears to us that the background legislation is itself inadequate and defective.</P>
    <P>The Fire Brigade Act, 1940, has been the subject of some comment in the past few days and presumably this is what the Minister for the Environment referred to when he issued his directive to the local authorities to investigate immediately and to close down any places that did not comply with the regulations.  I am sorry to have to say that local authorities and fire chiefs do not have that power under existing legislation and to give the impression they have is merely to misinterpret the situation.  Really it is a charade.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 of the Fire Brigade Act, 1940, a fire chief, as the sanitary authority, having carried out an inspection can serve a notice on the owner of a premises ordering that the premises be closed.  However, in section 7 there is also provision for recourse to the courts by the owner or operator in question.  If he is not satisfied with the decision of the District Court he may appeal to a higher court.  Effectively, the Fire Brigade Act, 1940, does not give to any sanitary authority or fire authority the power peremptorily to close premises that are found to be unsafe from the point of view of fire protection.  Clearly that Act needs to be amended and it does not need a commission or tribunal to advise to that effect.  For a number of years the fire chiefs and the sanitary authorities have indicated their unhappiness with the adequacy and efficiency of the 1940 Act. Let us hope that something will be done about it now.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) of our second amendment reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> The adequacy of the legislation, statutory regulations and by-laws relevant to fire prevention and safety, so far as material to the granting of planning and by-law permission for, and the conduct, running, supervision, and official inspection and control of, the Stardust Club, and the adequacy of the legislation, observance and enforcement of such legislation, statutory regulations and by-laws in relation to the Stardust Club.</P>
    <P>We felt it important that the tribunal should be able to state clearly how effective they regarded the various pieces of legislation and the control measures taken under such legislation in relation to the history of the planning application and decision, the by-laws applications and permissions granted and the various inspections carried out under the 1940 Act or under the 1935 Act in relation to dance halls.  We felt it important that the tribunal should be able to show whether the legislation and the codes had operated efficiently.  We felt it important that the tribunal should be able to advise whether procedures had been properly observed, that the tribunal should be able to say in relation to planning procedures, planning control, the observance of building by-laws in connection with the fire officers' requirements, that they had been carried out properly and efficiently, that all officers and servants had operated properly and, in accordance with their obligations, had performed their duties without let or hindrance.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the more recent reports which have been issued and which are relevant in relation to this matter.  In 1975 the then Department of Local Government published a major report on the fire services.  I understand that many personnel in the fire service now feel that if the recommendations of that report were to be put into effect many of the areas that were possibly found wanting could be dealt with very effectively.  It is rather disquieting that such a holocaust could take place in the area where the maximum number of controls and regulations apply.  This is the only authority I know of that has an <Col N="2004" /> entire code specifically dealing with protection from fire in places of public resort. If such a fire could take place in that area, what would be the situation, as Deputy Tully asked, in some of the other public dance halls and places of public resort throughout the country?  There is not as sophisticated a fire fighting service in many of those places as there is in this city.  There is also no authority in those places to adopt a book of regulations in relation to protection from fire in public places.  There is not the enforcement of control of building by-laws regulations which apply only in Dublin city, Limerick city and Dublin county at the moment.</P>
    <P>This holocaust occurred in one of those control areas.  There is an even looser situation outside them.  Is there possibly an even more potentially disastrous situation in those areas?  There is a great urgency about whatever actions are embarked on.  It is very important that the result of the tribunal's findings in relation to the Stardust fire should be made available to everybody in public authorities and in Government as soon as possible so that they can be acted on.</P>
    <P>We should remember that within the last year there was another major fire in a hotel in Bundoran.  <i>The Irish Press</i> today reports:</P>
    <P>A spokeman for the main insurance company involved has suggested that there will be no payment until the promised Government inquiry is held.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  Mr. Jackie Fahey, did indicate he was holding a public inquiry and we would have to wait for that.&rdquo;  The spokesman for the Royal Insurance Group said.</P>
    <P>The report in <i>The Irish Press</i> today also stated:</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said they were awaiting the final Garda report before making <Col N="2005" /> a decision on whether there should be an inquiry.</P>
    <P>In view of the tragic happenings last weekend and the unhappiness which was expressed after the tragic fire in Bundoran, there should be clarification from the Government about what steps they intend to take in relation to the Bundoran tragedy.  There is an onus on the Government, which I feel sure they will recognise, to make their decision known in relation to the Bundoran fire.</P>
    <P>Why have the draft building regulations not been published?  The passing of the 1963 Planning Act, which came into force on 1 October 1964, required those regulations to be published.  It is less than fair of the Minister in his speech to say:</P>
    <P>The original technical draft, prepared by An Foras Forbhartha, was not prepared in a legal form and a completely new draft had to be prepared to ensure that the regulations when made would be legally viable.</P>
    <P>All that happened.  The report of An Foras Forbartha was made to the Department around 1970, so I presume they had a fair length of time to convert the regulations into the legal framework, in which they were when they eventually appeared on 29 November 1976.  The Minister invited the public at that stage to make their comments by the end of May 1977. The only thing that happened was that apparently so many comments were made that the Department ran out of the draft building regulations and they reprinted the book in its draft form without change during 1978.</P>
    <P>It is quite pointless, if we are talking about introducing reform of legislation or new areas of control to give teeth to the officers who must monitor situations like this, to say as the Minister said today:</P>
    <P>I now propose to issue within the next ten days the draft of the regulations with amendments and within six weeks to publish a revised version incorporating the amendments.  I intend that they be used by local authorities, industrial and professional <Col N="2006" /> bodies in their operations as if they had statutory backing.</P>
    <P>Since they were published in 1976 they have been used by the local authorities, professional and other bodies as if they had statutory backing.  Since the original British requirements were published piecemeal over the last 20 years the requirements on which this volume is based, these regulations have been and are being used on a day to day basis as if they had statutory backing.</P>
    <P>However, this does not alter the fact that although the fire chiefs, the planners or the building control personnel are exhorting people to abide by those regulations they have not got the power to enforce them.  As long as they have to approach somebody with a tome as large as the ceiling of this chamber and say: &ldquo;I want you to comply with this&rdquo; and they are asked &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; their answer is: &ldquo;We are implementing them as if they had statutory backing&rdquo;.  Then, if somebody wants to be irresponsible enough, he can turn his face against it.  Those regulations should be adopted or they should not.  If they are appropriate, if the 500 observations which were made on the 1976 amendments have been considered in the last three and a half years and if decisions have been taken on them, the amendments should be put into the draft regulations and adopted.</P>
    <P>The Government should not, as was done with the Water Pollution Act and various other measures over the last three years since domestic rates were abolished, pass new legislation which involves the employment of personnel and expenditure of money by the local authorities, hand it over to them and tell them to get on with it without giving them the money to get on with it.  As everybody knows, one of the main reasons the fire services have not progressed during the last few years is because of the consistent shortage of available money to expand any of the necessary services which needs expansion in Dublin, Kinsale, Skibbereen, Bundoran or any other place throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The same applies in relation to the draft building regulations.  The Department <Col N="2007" /> are merely going through a charade of publishing draft regulations which they hope will have the effect of being used as if they had statutory backing, because they know too well that if those draft regulations become building regulations the local authorities will need to employ hundreds of trained professional personnel to implement, to monitor and to control them.  Unless those personnel are employed, it would be an insult if the regulations were to be adopted, given the force of law and then it was found impossible to implement them.  After 17 years let us cut that out and either adopt the regulations or decide we are unable to do so.  Let us not try to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the assessors appointed to the tribunal are well qualified and will give the learned gentlemen appointed to conduct the inquiry every assistance necessary.  It is strange, and I am sure fire officers will find it very strange indeed, that their request that the chief fire adviser to the Minister for the Environment is not referred to in the statement and is not included as one of the assessors to the judge who is to conduct the tribunal.  There has been over a period of years a most unhappy situation in the Department of the Environment, as there has been in a number of local authorities where people operating the fire services have expressed a sense of grievance at the manner in which they have to make their reports and recommendations. They feel they should be given direct access to county managers and, as a result, there has been a demarcation dispute.</P>
    <P>This debate should not be sidetracked into that area, but, in relation to the chief fire adviser to the Minister for the Environment, it should be explained to the House why that officer, the main officer charged with responsibility for advising the Department of the Environment of the adequacy of the fire services throughout the country and what needs to be done to improve them, should have seen fit to take court action against the Department because he felt he was not allowed to carry out his duties in the manner he felt obliged to do, as he saw them within <Col N="2008" /> his terms of reference.  I do not know on whose side right or wrong rested in that instance.  Fire officers are very much in agreement with the chief fire adviser to the Minister for the Environment in this matter.  No later than last Monday one of the fire officers appearing on television called on the Government to include the chief fire adviser, Mr. John Connolly, on the tribunal.  The situation in relation to this officer needs clarification.  It should be clarified for all of us who have some knowledge of the area and the unhappy situation that exists in relation to the operation of advice on fire matters to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>One area was not referred to at all by the Minister, and that was possibly because it might more appropriately be the business of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  It is an area in which we have a particular concern and which may have relevance to the inquiries of the tribunal.  Consequently, it was referred to in our amendment No. 3, where we referred to the need to cover the dangers of fire arising in structures and furnishings.  The draft building regulations which I referred to lay down standards for building components and materials which ought to be used in construction and have a fire retardant nature, the widths of gangways and alleyways, but they do not attempt to deal with the type of furnishing that should be provided in public places.  It appears to us that there is urgent need for some form of regulation to be made in relation to furnishing, especially seating, that uses polyurethane foam as its main component. The House will be aware that in October the Minister made an order, S.I. No. 298, which sought to limit the use of certain types of polyurethane foam in seating sold for domestic purposes.  However, for some reason or other, while this polyurethane foam, if it does not pass certain tests such as flame and smoulder tests, is not to be used in furniture for domestic purposes after 1982 and in between is to carry an advertisement clearly indicating that fact, the order does not set out to deal with furniture used in public places.</P>
    <P>Anyone who heard the technical evidence <Col N="2009" /> of the last few days and earlier in relation to the effect on polyurethane when it begins to break down under the effect of immense heat must realise the extremely dangerous nature of this material. As polyurethane begins to break down it gives off heavy black fumes and toxic gas.  It produces carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, which is toxic and which, if I am not mistaken, was one of the gases used in trench warfare in the first world war.  This is the most common material used in the interior of seating provided in public places.  Some of the gases emitted could have the effect of completely immobilising and knocking out someone within 15 seconds.  The material also issues heavy black smoke and, as it breaks down further, an intensely hot, molten tar-like substance begins to float in the smoke and ignites anything combustible it comes in contact with.  That is a frightening prospect to think about in relation to most seats in most public places.</P>
    <P>I wonder, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Minister, people in the Public Gallery and people in the Press Gallery, if we were to consider for a moment if the seats in this Chamber were filled with material like that &mdash; of course they are not &mdash; but, if they were to burn and give off those fumes, what panic and mayhem it would create in the House.  Yet there are no steps taken to introduce any form of regulation or control in relation to the further supplying of that kind of material for use in public buildings.  The regulations in relation to private houses are fairly lenient.</P>
    <P>I thought that the reason for the continuing use of the material was that there was no real replacement.  In today's <i>Irish Times</i> it is stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Hugh Reynolds, secretary of the National Manufacturers Association, which represents about 75 firms in this country, said the exclusion of non-domestic furniture should be reconsidered, and more thought should be given to types of foam other than polyurethane.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is quite possible to treat foam so that it will be fire-resistant and will not <Col N="2010" /> give off poisonous gases.  It would be more expensive, but its cost would come down if there was more demand for it and it could be manufactured on a large scale.  It is really a question of paying a bit more for safety,&rdquo; he added.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment dealt with a number of matters relevant to his Department.  If the question of the type of materials used for the interior of seating in either public or private places is a matter appropriate to some other Minister, the Taoiseach should take up with whatever Minister it is and with the IIRS the possibility of introducing adequate and stringent regulations in relation to the type of materials that may be used.  One of the difficulties in relation to regulations is that they only apply to materials supplied after the date they are adopted.  There is need to investigate the materials used in existing public buildings and to advise the owners of these buildings if the polyurethane materials they are using are regarded as a potential hazard. I have no doubt that after the dreadful events of last weekend the vast majority of owners of public places will be only too anxious to take whatever steps are necessary to replace any materials that might be in some way offensive or dangerous. But as the situation obtains this polyurethane material used in so much public seating is a potential killer.  Many people in public buildings around the country are being invited to sit on a potential time bomb.  Therefore there is an urgent obligation on this House to investigate that matter also.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said at the weekend the Government would undertake to meet the expenses of any malicious damage type of claim that might be lodged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is hardly relevant to the motion before the House.  I have given the Deputy plenty of latitude but he is now going outside the terms of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I might just make the point that while I accept that a malicious damage claim has been lodged that claim <Col N="2011" /> becomes liable for payment only after a court case and a ruling by a justice that the injury was in fact malicious in nature. Therefore it would be wrong for anybody, the general public or otherwise, to assume that demands of that nature would automatically be paid out merely because a claim had been lodged.  But in fairness to the local authority involved, there should be a clear indication to the House, or to Dublin Corporation, that if a claim such as this is pursued, in the same way as the claims in relation to the bombings in the mid-seventies and other items were met by central government funds, this item would be met also by central government funds irrespective of the fact that the provision for such claims has been reduced in the Estimates for the Department of the Environment from a sum of £3 million last year to a figure of £1 million this year.</P>
      <P>I know the various items raised will be examined and reported on by the tribunal. Deputy Tully raised the question of the adequacy of the materials used within the club, whether or not there was installed an emergency lighting system; if such were installed, whether or not it operated and, if it did operate, why more people were unable to avail of it.  Then there was the adequacy or otherwise of the water pressure in that area of Dublin at that time of night.  In fairness to Dublin Corporation I should say that I know that many local authorities reduce pressure at night time and times when there is not such a heavy demand on it so as to fill the mains in certain areas, especially those situated far from reservoirs and also because of the amount of capital works outstanding.  But if this is an area warranting attention then it is one that does not need the conclusions of the tribunal to improve it.  If water pressures are inadequate in certain respects at night time, on the occasion of major events such as this one, then it should be possible to provide personnel with the fire service who are able to open the necessary valves in the regional area, thereby providing as much pressure as necessary &mdash; if that turns out to have been a problem in any way; I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> Deputy Tully made the point also that many of the inspections in relation to fire safety are carried out in the day time.  I agree entirely with him that the bulk of inspections in relation to public places that operate at night time, and particularly late at night, need to be carried out while they are so operating, while they are carrying on in the normal way.  It is pointless if most inspections take place on a cold, wet, Monday or Tuesday morning because that is not the appropriate time.  We ought also perhaps examine whether the personnel employed in public halls like this should be required to undergo some basic system of training in fire drill in the event of fire, under the supervision of qualified fire officers of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I referred to the serious lack of money many local authorities experience whenever they endeavour to improve any of their services in respect of which they see a need for improvement, refurbishing or indeed the need for the provision of a completely new service.  As long as local authorities continue to have their budgets restricted to increases which over the last few years have amounted to approximately the equivalent of two-thirds the national annual inflation rate, then for so long will such local authorities be expected to perform an impossible financial juggling act.  If they are to carry out major reforms in one arm of their local authority service then it can only be at the expense and to the detriment of another arm.</P>
    <P>In that regard I want to give the House a clear example.  In June 1977 the local authority of which I am a member resolved that the firemen operating part-time stations in the county should be trained in the use of breathing apparatus and supplied with breathing apparatus not, one would have thought, an unfair or outrageous request.  We discovered that it was impossible to provide training for those part-time firemen who so very generously give of their services outside their normal working hours for very little recompense.  They would need to be trained outside normal working hours. They work at other tasks during the day and are merely on call in the event of an <Col N="2013" /> emergency.  We discovered that the personnel who could train them were fulltime officers of the fire service who had received promotion from the basic fireman of the line grade.  Because they had received that promotion, because they were now working at desk jobs, the Department of the Environment would not allow them to operate outside normal working hours because they were not prepared to pay them the unsocial hours content which forms such an important element of a fireman's pay.  Because those officers would not be paid unsocial hours they were not prepared to work what they regarded as unsocial hours and train the part-time firemen.</P>
    <P>That matter was resolved some time in 1979.  This is February 1981.  The part-time firemen in the stations in County Dublin still have not been trained in the use of breathing apparatus, and are still not entitled to its use, that almost four years after the local authority involved passed a specific resolution that they should receive that training and be supplied with that apparatus.  Again that was a question of money, one solely and simply of the financial provisions made available to the fire service.  That was the situation in the Dublin fire service over the last few years when it became, at times, a financial burden on men to receive promotion, a situation in which if a fireman did receive promotion &mdash; above the rank of fireman on the line &mdash; he lost his benefits, his overtime and discovered that the men he was ostensibly in charge of were earning far more money than he, their supervising officer.  No authority can be happy with a situation like that.  Any Department that allows such a situation to continue, one in which they insist on officers being paid less than the men can expect only trouble and discontent. We cannot condone a situation in which there is no financial inducement given to a man to apply for promotion.</P>
    <P>I gave that merely as an example, not by way of blaming any one individual or Department, but rather as an example of the difficulties under which local authorities labour, as an example of the fact that when there is not an incident, a dreadful occurrence, a holocaust that <Col N="2014" /> directs the spotlight of the nation's grief, the nation's demand for attention centrally on a single area, when there is not that sort of attention given.  When the carving knife for financial restraint is produced, those are the sorts of areas very often turned to.  I am not blaming any particular individual, any particular Department or any particular party.  I am not saying that any one party necessarily might be better than any other in relation to that.  There are certain areas that have not got the financial attention or indeed the personnel appointed to them they ought have had.  Obviously the nation now realises what some of us felt, that this is one of these services.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Fire Prevention Council in his speech and explained that they have now agreed to set up a task force, a sort of a flying column which would appear to hold out great hope as to briefing the local authorities and helping them.  The Fire Prevention Council was set up a couple of years ago and was jointly funded by the insurers and the Department of the Environment. It has only been in operation a couple of years and its main task, through advertisement and education, has been to make the public more aware of the measures necessary for fire prevention and control.  Last year its agreed budget, funded jointly by the Department of the Environment and the insurers, was £100,000.  This is just a new body and so is still exploring the areas where it needs to spend money, the areas in which it can most efficiently advertise its message, the areas in which it can best educate.  So it sought an increase in its budget from £100,000 to £146,000.  The insurers indicated that they were in agreement with that in principle.  The Department of the Environment said that they would not agree to the budget being increased by any more than 5 per cent, from £100,000 to £105,000.  This happened within the last few weeks.  That is the degree of importance put on the Fire Prevention Council a couple of weeks ago.  Today the Minister says that he has met representatives of the Fire Prevention Council on a number of occasions during the past few days.  Of course he has.  He has told <Col N="2015" /> the insurers to reconsider having to pay half of the £105,000 now.  He said:</P>
    <P>...in the light of the discussions I have now decided that a special Task Force will be immediately established under the direction of the present chairman of the council, Mr. Geoffrey Cronin.  I intend that the Task Force will liaise closely with local authorities in the latter's role on fire prevention and keep me fully briefed....  It will also augment the efforts of the Fire Prevention Council on such matters as publicity, advertising, seminars, preparation of instruction leaflets, all aimed at increasing public awareness of fire hazards...</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago the Fire Prevention Council would have had to reduce the moneys they spent on publicity, advertising, seminars, the preparation of instruction leaflets all aimed at increasing public awareness because 5 per cent, as we all know, would not go any way towards meeting the real increase in costs in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I have given those examples to show that there is not an awareness on the part of all of us involved in public life of the very important necessity for spending adequate money on fire prevention and on education about fire prevention and on setting up the necessary services in the local authorities throughout the country. Without seeking in any way to denigrate the services provided by other authorities, I am quite certain that, because of the very size of it and its very nature, the service, the equipment, the personnel and training attached to the Dublin fire brigade service are probably the best in the country.  Yet it finds itself with a backup of inadequate legislation, regulations not adopted, no controls on the type of furnishing and the other areas in relation to the disincentive to promotional opportunities.  It finds itself in the situation that we are discussing today.  So the need is not for refurbishing, not for a polishing up of the situation.  The need is for a renovation of the entire fire prevention procedures and a change of attitude <Col N="2016" /> to the provision of fire services right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that we entered our two amendments, rather reluctantly, as we had originally hoped that it might be possible to secure, by some prior discussion, an agreed motion put forward by all of the parties and Members of the House without necessity for any amendments whatsoever to be entered.  When the Government's motion was published we felt it was necessary to enter our amendment No. 3 and subsequently the other amendment which I presume is No. 5 and which we entered earlier today.</P>
    <P>In the last part of his speech the Minister referred to the setting up of a commission of inquiry and he said that the Government has in mind as a separate matter the establishment of a commission of inquiry.  I want to indicate to the House that we would be most anxious that both of our amendments would be accepted and adopted and included by the Government in their motion before the House or, otherwise, if they feel that they can give to the House a specific commitment that a commission of inquiry is going to be set up and that the terms of our amendment No. 3, items 6, 7 and 8, will be specifically included as part of the terms of that commission of inquiry, then possibly we might be in a position to agree to the withdrawal of amendment No. 3.  But I am a little disappointed that we have not been given firmer information and more definite views as to the commission and as to its terms of reference. I would hope that whoever is replying to this discussion can make that provision clear because it would be regrettable if we were not able to reach, in this House on this very sad day, agreement amongst all the parties as to the most efficient steps which can be taken as expeditiously as possible, really on behalf of all those young people who died in that fire because we have personal and collective responsibility to them and to their relatives and we should surely make every effort to unite as a Parliament on behalf of the nation in guaranteeing that the like can never happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I come as a Deputy with the privilege &mdash; which I share with the Taoiseach &mdash; of representing the distressed area, Artane.  Therefore I think I would be failing in my job of attempting to be a conscientious Deputy if I did not apply myself to the Government motion in a very hard-headed and practical way because the record of politicians on the provision of proper fire facilities is demonstrably and lamentably inadequate. A number of Deputies have talked about the fact that Dublin has probably the most efficient fire service in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested the other night and I tried to give the views of as many as I could of the people who were injured and of the bereaved relatives.  There is a lot of anger towards politicians.  Many of the young people in particular seem to feel a certain sense of grievance or betrayal that we did not provide them with protection when they went innocently into this disaster.  Therefore, it simply cannot be allowed to happen again.  Yesterday we could grieve in the unanimity of our commonly shared distress. However, not only in political terms but in realistic terms also, we owe it to the Government to criticise them on what they are proposing to do in their motion.  It will be noticed that the Opposition between them have tabled amendments. One of them, concerned with the Draft Building Regulations, is from the Labour Party.  I am glad to see that the Government have accepted this in general terms.  I put down an amendment, which was not, in order but which was in <Col N="2018" /> the same terms, concerning the necessity to introduce legalised draft building regulations, and the Fine Gael Party did likewise.</P>
    <P>One has to ask why it was that this decision which the Minister has now agreed to, to introduce amended draft building regulations, was not proposed by the Government as part of their response to the fire disaster.  Now, especially with the addition of amendment No. 6 put down by Fine Gael which I understand is being accepted, we have a pretty comprehensive armamentarium of powers for the tribunal which should enable them to come to the truth and to make recommendations arising out of it. I submit without rancour that the Stardust tragedy should have produced from the Government the response which was produced by the Opposition, that is, to accept the Government motion with amendments and in addition the necessity to give legal authority, statutory power, to the 1976-77 Draft Building Regulations.  Why did the Government not make that proposal?  Would they not have done it if we had not asked them to do it?  That is very important when you add to it this consideration that they have also agreed to establish a commission whose function will be to examine broadly the role of all regulatory bodies, the Department of the Environment, local authorities, existing fire services and so forth, to examine the whole position of our fire services, their efficiency, the general provisions in relation to fire prevention, means of assistance in emergency, escape and so on.  All of this is a very wide and comprehensive provision for a wide-ranging commission who presumably will have the power to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>Again one has to ask why it is that this appears to have come in response to the amendments put forward by the Members of the Opposition groups.  Why did it not originate from the Government? One has to concede that the Government now appear to be taking the issue of the Stardust seriously, although one recollects that early on the main provision, that I heard was the employment of 50 members of the Garda to find out the <Col N="2019" /> cause of the fire.  Now we have a very much more comprehensive group of provisions, which we would like to extend and amend.  Why did the Government not conclude, as those of us in the Opposition concluded, that this has gone on long enough?  We have seen too much of this kind of thing and this kind of tragedy. The lives of too many people have been lost.  We have listened to too many complaints from too many authoritative sources.  I would like to quote them because I have to confess that I myself had a crash course in the whole business of fire prevention and safety.  I cannot pretend that I am an authority on it and I do not so pretend.  Why is it that the Government themselves did not put down a motion and then say &ldquo;In addition, because we are taking this matter so seriously, we accept that there has been neglect over a very long time and we now propose also to introduce the necessary authority in respect of giving statutory powers to the 1976-77 Draft Building Regulations&rdquo;?  In addition, we have heard so much in the national press and some excellent TV programmes, especially &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; a couple of nights ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an outrageous programme.  It should never have been shown in the light of the decision taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the demands made I hope I will substantiate the case I made.  Why did the Government not act &mdash; I have to use the word &mdash; in a more responsible way arising out of this decision?  Why did they not widen greatly the components of their response into the motion about the Stardust and into a commission on the broad state of the fire services, and at long last introduce the building materials regulations which I understand go back as far as 1963 and anyway to 1970?  The <i>Report to the Minister for Local Government 1975</i> which I am sure all Deputies have seen, states that this will take effect on a certain date and so on; but, in fact, the regulations were never implemented.  I do not wish to introduce any rancour into the debate but I understand it was as a result <Col N="2020" /> of powerful lobbying by the building suppliers, that these regulations were not introduced.  That excuse could no longer be permitted.</P>
      <P>There is so much emotion, distress and so many harrowing experiences by mostly working class youngsters and their parents that it is difficult to know how accidents of this kind could happen.  I asked for the extension of the motion because I want to know about the role of the regulatory bodies, including the Department of the Environment, local authorities and existing fire services in respect of the general provisions for fire and fire prevention, means and systems of emergency escape from fire, their adequacy in enforcement and any other matters that the tribunal consider relevant to the inquiry.  This widens the motion to some extent but I do not think it would be desirable to restrict members of the tribunal to a period of time, say between 10 o'clock and 5 o'clock the following morning, and try to extrapolate from that assumptions, conclusions and recommendations which would not have the limitations of the very narrow base of that few hours of the Stardust episode.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the whole exercise of fire precautions, safey and handling of fires generally, there is an enormous hinterland outside the Stardust, Bundoran and all these other disasters which happened.  I do not think that a tribunal can help us to find the truth, unless they are allowed to follow leads outside the Stardust wherever they may bring them.  I am not interested in looking for a scapegoat.  It is much more serious than that.  I am more interested in trying to prevent this from happening again and learning from our experience. Therefore, the tribunal must be permitted to go back to the Department of the Environment, the local authorities, the various officers, administrators and the various individuals who took decisions. They must learn what decisions they took and why they took them.  Their general concept of their job in fire prevention, the means and systems of the emergency services will also have to be examined.  The attitude, limitations and difficulties of the Minister for the Environment, will also have to be examined. <Col N="2021" /> Deputy Boland referred to financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have a mild private grievance about this because of a fire in a small factory on a river in May 1978.  It was an extraordinary case because it was written up in the days of investigative journalism of <i>Hibernia.</i> They wanted to find out what was the inspector's report on that occasion. Recently, the editor, John Mulcahy, pointed out that when he got to the local authority and asked what were the terms of the inspector's report, he was told, eventually, that it was classified information and he was not allowed to see it. Is that so?  I know the tribunal will have full powers in this regard but it is quite obvious that it is important information which, in that case, was with Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>In reply to my question, the Minister, Deputy Barrett, said at column 1888 of the Official Report of 25 May 1978:</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement relating to the fire service which I made in introducing the Estimate for my Department in the House on 15 March 1978.  I indicated then that all local authorities had been asked to conduct a review of the operation of their fire services to determine how those services match up to the needs of today.  The reviews are comprehensive examinations extending to all aspects of both fire fighting and other operations, and of fire prevention work. They cover 11 separate aspects under 65 subheadings.  Accordingly, I do not see the need for an inquiry into the state of the fire services &mdash; that stage was completed in the Report of the Working Party on the Fire Service which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in July 1975.  The report made wide ranging recommendations on the operational service, fire prevention, structure and qualification, training and miscellaneous matters.  Work is in progress in all of these and, in particular, on the recommendation that for each local fire authority area there should be a separate assessment of the strength and adequacy of the <Col N="2022" /> service.  These are the reviews to which I have referred and, according as the fire brigade authorities submit their reports, they are being considered in my Department and being followed up with such inquiries, advice or assistance as may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne: Can the Minister say why it is that there appears to be such disquiet amongst the fire officers in relation to the fire services?  As I understand it, they have been anxious that there should be some sort of inquiry into these.</P>
    <P>Mr. Barrett: The chief fire officer seem to have a certain amount of disquiet from some public statements and so on.  We have asked for a review of each local authority in relation to fire services and what is required in their areas.  There are quite a number of these reports already in my Department being processed and examined. There are some still to come, but we are treating it as a matter that should be dealt with as quickly as possible.  On the reason for there being disquiet amongst the fire officers I will make more inquiries and try to let the Deputy know what are these specific reasons.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne: Surely the Minister must know when this is shown by people in their position &mdash; they are the authorities on this subject and know more about it than any of us &mdash; that, in these circumstances, the Minister must accept that the process he is using at present is not one that satisfies them, is probably not going to be an effective one and that is why they continue to be disquieted despite all the things he and his predecessor said they were and are doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating intervened, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the recruitment of executive members of the fire associations is very difficult from the point of view of the salary structure which is unrealistic and the question of qualifications which appears to be exceptionally demanding <Col N="2023" /> in some cases, that local authorities are experiencing real difficulty in getting response to advertisements for staff at that level?</P>
    <P>I am interested in the future but I think Deputies will note the similarity of much of the speech we had today from the new Minister regarding expeditious action and so on.  We have heard it all before. It is on the record from this group of Ministers who are in charge of this study.</P>
    <P>In the report of the working party on the fire services the point is made that it was not part of the task of that working group to make a detailed assessement of the strength and adequacy of the fire service in each area but that the question of assessement was necessary as a basis for the fire operation plans that they had recommended.  The Minister may be able to tell us whether that detailed examination has been undertaken.  I suspect that it has not been undertaken and I am supported in this suspicion by a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday last, February 16, under the headline &ldquo;Inadequate prevention policy lashed by fire chief&rdquo;.  To back up my case, I am quoting the various authorities and in this context I quote from that report as follows:</P>
    <P>A strong attack was made yesterday on the poor fire prevention measures operated by the Republic's local authorities and the lack of a proper national policy by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Fire Officers' Association, Captain Michael Maguire, of Waterford, said that they had been unhappy down through the years at the level of fire prevention measures and had, at one stage, sought a judicial inquiry.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that it had come as no great surprise to him, or his association, that such a dreadful tragedy has happened in the Stardust Club, as they had been warning that this was bound to happen some day.</P>
    <P>Captain Maguire said that their association had been making representations to the Department of the Environment for many years on the need for a proper fire service and some work <Col N="2024" /> had been done in the fire-fighting side, but the fire prevention side still lagged very much behind.</P>
    <P>With rapid industrialisation and the erection of more large buildings, particularly ones to which the public had access, there was need for fire prevention work and the examination of plans under the planning Acts to ensure that the recommendations of the fire officers are carried out.  There should also be spot inspections as a follow-up.</P>
    <P>Captain Maguire said that there was a great lack of fire prevention staff. Very few local authorities had any other than what the chief fire officer himself could do and other officers in the services, who were more operational officers than fire prevention officers.</P>
    <P>He blamed the Department of the Environment for this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Captain Maguire said that they had sought an inquiry into the country's fire service and they had wanted this to be headed by a judge.  The fire service needed to be investigated and the blame laid where it properly lay.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that in relation to the proposed inquiry the activities of the Department of the Environment should be investigated.</P>
    <P>I am attempting to act on behalf of these people who are the authorities in this area and for that reason I included the fire services in my amendment.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Captain Maguire said the people of the country could be subjected to another holocaust similar to the Stardust inferno because of inadequate legislation and lack of money for fire prevention services.</P>
    <P>There were a number of counties throughout the country where the post of chief fire officer was vacant, some for a couple of years.  These posts were vacant because the Department was holding new terms of office.</P>

      <P>The question of the extension of the main motion by way of this amendment is justifiable because the tribunal will find themselves faced with some of the factors which helped to cause the tragedy in the Stardust.  What do the Dublin fire authorities accept in respect of a disco or a dancehall of this kind, a converted warehouse?  Is that acceptable in the first instance?  In what way does it have to be converted?  What are the safety precautions to be introduced? Were they happy that the lighting system did not work?  Is that acceptable under the bye-laws of Dublin Corporation?  I cannot think that it is.  But in order to establish that, there is all the more reason that the tribunal should go back to the local authority or to the Department of the Environment if that Department are affected.  Is it also permissible in a disco of this kind to serve drinks to what, alas, if one looks at the ages of the dead and injured were predominantly a group of young people under 21 &mdash; 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  Is that permissible under Dublin Corporation bye-laws?  Surely the tribunal would have to have access to the inspector. Did he agree to these youngsters being there in a place where alcoholic drinks were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that these are matters that should properly be considered in a commission.  I do not agree.  Certainly, in my constituency &mdash; I do not know about the rest of Ireland but if it has any, and I think it has; it has shown its deep feelings, fellow feelings for fellow citizens &mdash; I do not think that they are in the mood for a commission. There is an enormous, beautiful, Chippendale cupboard down there with about 400 commissions' recommendations in it. We know what happened to those commissions and their recommendations. You can take this commission, this 1975 fire report.  What was done about it?  Perhaps the Minister might tell us in his reply.  He might tell us why the 1976 Building Materials Regulations were not legalised.  Why are we still waiting for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the tribunal will have to go outside the Stardust to find out about the water supply, the strange inadequacy of that supply about which there have been questions, the size of the staff, the training <Col N="2028" /> of the staff.  Who lays down these regulations, who sees that they are carried out?  What does the local authority insist on?  To what extent do the Department of the Environment impose any, or does it impose all its specific regulations? Would it not be wrong that the tribunal should be limited to the environs of the Stardust?  Every single paragraph in the Government's motion has the words &ldquo;Stardust Club&rdquo; in it &mdash; very circumscribed. In Artane they talk about a cover-up in a blunter way.  Is there an attempt to cover-up?  This is the danger. Possibly there are truths there that will be disagreeable for the Government, but that does not prevent us from insisting that whatever is the truth shall be found.</P>
    <P>May I draw attention to this report to the Minister for Local Government?  It has an interesting appendix.  In appendix G, page 111, under the Factories Act 1955 section &mdash; the Minister can enlighten me if I am wrong on this &mdash; it is stated, and I suppose it will come under the general heading of fire prevention, that the occupier of a factory is liable to a fine of up to £50 where certificate is not in force and a fine not exceeding £10 per day for a continuing offence.  That is for a local authority, county borough council, borough council, urban district council and so on who are responsible.  Surely the tribunal will have to go back to the bodies and would have a right to go back to them and ask them if they think £50 is enough.  Is that what they will find or will they find anything in that case to which I referred earlier, the clothing factory on the Quays?  Or was it £10.</P>
    <P>There is another interesting reference on page 109 referring to public dance halls.  It appears that 1975 is the date on this and I presume it is the latest regulation in relation to public dance hall premises. The conditions of a licence may include &ldquo;such conditions and restrictions as the licencing authority determine&rdquo; and so on.  The regulating authority is the District Court with right of appeal to the Circuit Court; enforcement is the responsibility of the Garda.  Under penalties it provides a fine not exceeding £10 per day where the premises are used without a licence; a fine not exceeding £5 per day <Col N="2029" /> for a breach of licence, apparently: £5 per day where a breach of licence occurs with licence subject to revocation.  That is hard to credit, is it not?</P>
    <P>About a year ago there was a case in France similar to the Stardust.  The penalty there was: the Lord Mayor got 11 years in gaol and I think the chief of police got eight years.  What gentle people we are &mdash; a fine not exceeding £10 or a fine not exceeding £5 per day.  We are careful where we exercise our gentility, are we not?  Surely that is outrageous. Surely that needs amendment.  Surely the tribunal must have the right to inquire into conditions of this kind in circumstances of the appalling nature of the Stardust holocaust the other night?</P>
    <P>Should the tribunal not be able to ask the fire authority, the local authority or the Minister whether there should be 100,000 gallons of white wood spirit stored beside the Stardust Club and an enormous area of timber?  The Stardust Club went up like a bomb and, just beside it, there are these very dangerous substances. Is that permissible?  What would have happened if there had been an extension of the fire?  I suspect that these would be bomb-making materials <i>par excellence.</i></P>
    <P>I was on a programme with Father Cleary, who made an extraordinary comment about the conditions under which these places operate.  He operates in all sorts of clubs of this kind all over Ireland, being involved with a number of priests in a show, and he said that as far as he was concerned the Stardust was one of the best of them.  What about the others? What are we going to do about them? This really is what we are concerned with here and now.  That is why we must take effective action.  The Minister must give a better assurance of speedy action than the one I have read out from his predecessor.</P>
    <P>We have asked for a review of each local authority and so on.  As far as I can gather from some fire officers, there are no serious fire services in many local authority areas and the officers cannot do anything.  We have now a new Minister and I wish him every success in his enormous <Col N="2030" /> task.  There is a terrible backlog of work undone by his predecessors, for which he is not to blame at all.  We all should wish him well.  He should not simply recapitulate the unfounded expectations of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland referred to the fact that this report does not include furnishings. Deputy Andrews has left the House but I trust nobody will mind my referring to the most interesting disclosures from a man called Skelton, a forensic expert on this stuff which we use, apparently in furnishings and which is not included in the building materials regulation.  The Minister should tell us what action he proposes to take in regard to it.  I understand that this material was probably the most damaging part of the whole building, responsible for poisonous fumes which suffocated the youngsters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to give legal power to the Building Materials, 1976, Regulations, which is a separate matter.  I hope like Deputy Boland, that the Minister will include, as it is not included at present, expanded polystyrene fillings.  Apparently this apparently highly dangerous and, at a certain stage, explosive material is used all over the country, in pubs, clubs, discos, dance-halls, everywhere.  After the Woolworths fire in Manchester an experiment was carried out with ten square feet of this material.  It was set alight with a match and in one minute it had reached over 1,000 degrees &mdash; they could not measure the heat produced.  It exceeded 23 MW &mdash; 23,000 one-bar electric fires.  This highlights the great difficulties which the Minister faces in attempting to protect people, in the light of the new materials which are so marvellous in some ways and so highly dangerous in others.  What does he propose to do on this particular matter?  I found one fire chief very impressive on that, in my opinion, magnificent <i>Today Tonight</i> programme, Captain McMahon, who was asked what he thought was going to happen as a result <Col N="2031" /> of the latest disaster.  He said: &ldquo;I give it a year.  There will be little or nothing done.&rdquo;  Perhaps he is wrong; I hope he is.  Between the Government and the Opposition some steps would appear to have been taken, first in respect of the Government motion, amendments to which have been accepted.  I would like my amendment to be accepted.  In respect of the distribution of building materials, the new provision is a very valuable one, brought up to date and amended.  It is very important, as Deputy Boland has said, that statutory authority be given to these provisions.  Can the Minister give us some sort of time scale as to when he proposes to give the statutory powers?</P>
      <P>There is also the question of finance. I wish the Minister well in his struggles with the Department of Finance and hope that he will be successful because, otherwise as Deputy Boland said, to use my own words of yesterday, it will all be simply fine phrases and word spinning by politicians again.  The public expect leadership from them.</P>
      <P>The fire officers have made the point, which I suspect is a valid point, that we politicians do not do anything about fire prevention or fire precautions because the public are not greatly interested in it, and it was said very bluntly that there are no votes in fire precautions.  That is not true, but from the point of view of our responsibility as lawmakers we must show leadership.  We have to try to help people to understand the appalling risks involved in their daily lives.  We have a responsibility, no matter what the cost to try to protect them from the dangers which all of us face every day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still burying the dead from this tragedy, and this House should treat this matter with the degree of respect such an actuality demands.  It is the view of my party that we should not be continuing to talk about the terms of reference of the inquiry.  This House should be able to reach agreement quickly, without great debate, on the terms of reference of an inquiry into a tragedy.  It is not the function of the House and it is not the intention of this <Col N="2032" /> party to trail over the possible cause of events.</P>
      <P>In so far as I can be I will be brief and to the point on our amendment, the one which was not accepted by the Government. First of all, I should like to say that we appreciate that the Government accepted the second amendment.  For the life of me I cannot understand why the other amendment was not accepted.  The Minister for the Environment has not given us any indication as to why.</P>
      <P>Let me reiterate that we are only talking about the terms of reference of the tribunal, absolutely nothing else.  We accept that the Government have moved fast, that they recognise the extent of the tragedy.  We welcome the establishment of the tribunal and make no comments in relation to the tribunal's composition, except that we accept that the members appear to be eminently qualified.  We agree there have been changes in the fire services, though not all those that are needed.  Therefore I will come to the one matter that has me on my feet, our amendment.  I would not be believed if I went home to my family and told them I was not home for tea because the debate went on so long.  I would not be believed if I were to say that what delayed me and the House was that we wished to substitute for the section of the motion which states</P>
      <P>the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 14th February, 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with fire at the Stardust Club.</P>
      <P>the words:</P>
      <P>the measures and their adequacy, including the Draft Building Regulations of the Department of the Environment and the statutory provisions and regulations which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and the Local Authority, taken on or before the 14 February 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise and otherwise deal with fire at the Stardust Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be believed if I said that this House had spent all this time, and in <Col N="2033" /> particular that the Government had refused to accept such an innocuous amendment, or what would appear to be such.  Alas, it is not innocuous, because it has not been put in here for the purpose of the Labour Party being able to say &ldquo;We have an amendment in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We do not want to divide the House. The House should not divide on an issue like this.  God knows we have enough differences of opinion, genuine differences, not to be manufacturing them.  Let us be clear about one thing.  The Minister for the Environment, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Social Welfare have been living with this since Friday night-Saturday morning.  They have had the text of this amendment so that they could see what we were proposing, but they still refused to accept it without giving an adequate explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment spoke about the Draft Building Regulations, how they were drafted by An Foras Forbartha in 1976 and circulated &mdash; I remember it well; they came in the old form An Foras Forbartha used.  The industry attempted to use the regulations. Many submissions were made in that context, referred to in the industry as &ldquo;performance specifications&rdquo; rather than precise detailed recipes on how to build a wall or a window.  According to the Minister, there were 600 in all.  They were subsequently published in legal form, with about eight or nine schedules attached, under the combined 1963 and 1976 Acts.  It is a surprise to me to be told they require legislation to enact them. My clear understanding has been that they could be brought into effect by ministerial order, because the framework of law within which they would be given statutory effect is embodied in the two pieces of legislation, the two Planning and Development Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and I do not doubt him, that they would need legislation to be brought into effect now.  I should like him to say what is defective about the 1963 and 1976 Planning Acts which makes it necessary now to have specific legislation.  That is a secondary matter, but an important one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> I respectfully suggest that the House is too objective.  We are obliged to set up a tribunal of inquiry to do a job quickly and effectively.  The sole concern of everyone, including the relatives of the dead, is to ensure that a thing like this will never happen again.  This side of the House cannot do anything about that: the Government have the majority and the power and the wherewithal &mdash; perhaps they have not got it &mdash; to ensure this will not recur.  It is one thing to make a mistake; that is human.  But to pretend that a mistake has not been made amounts to a cover up, when this House should be open and clear.  The Minister should state clearly the difficulties in implementing the Draft Building Regulations. I know there are difficulties &mdash; anybody in the building industry knows it &mdash; but let the House do its job properly and find out how we can implement them.</P>
    <P>The specific reason why we want the terms of reference to take into account the Draft Building Regulations has been provided in a speech of the Minister for the Environment.  He said, correctly, that since their publication in 1976 and their reprinting in 1978, local authorities and the professions &mdash; including my own, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland &mdash; have been asked to regard them as a code of practice.  I was at the annual dinner in the Shelbourne Hotel last year when the Minister said that, and we welcomed it.  Therefore, is it not appropriate that such an inquiry now should find out whether such a voluntary code of practice has been adhered to?  Is it not appropriate to discover how responsible the industry and the professions have been in seeing that the Minister's request was carried out in terms of regarding this as a non-statutory voluntary code of practice? That is all we are asking.  We are not apportioning blame, we are not looking for culprits.  We are trying to save lives and to see how effective were the non-statutory building regulations.  To our complete amazement the Taoiseach &mdash; and let us have no doubt about the fact that the Taoiseach is running this &mdash; and his Minister for the Environment have signalled that they are rejecting this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> If the Government do not accept such a reasonable request, is it not going to trigger off the kind of speculation that will not do anybody any good?  Is it not going to raise questions we do not need, thus undermining the whole basis of the democratic process and the integrity of people in elected office?  The Government have a clear duty in this regard.  In their response they must say clearly why the Labour Party amendment is not accepted by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment may stand up and say there are major difficulties, that the central difficulty in relation to implementation in a statutory form of the national building regulations is not the quality of their contents but the manner in which they will be administered. The Minister may say there are two options.  He may say we can gear the public service sector with a whole array of new employees, linked to public service pay requirements and with a corresponding impact on staffing levels in his Department and throughout the local authorities but that there has not been any financial provision to take such costs into account this year, next year or in the foreseeable future.  The situation in Britain indicates that they are having second thoughts about a bureaucratically administered system of national building regulations and our Department, aware of these difficulties and having regard to the contraints in the economy, may be having second thoughts about the way the regulations might be implemented.</P>
    <P>If the Minister said that we could reply and tell him that we appreciate the difficulties, that we realise there is no magic wand solution, but we would tell him that that does not remove the obligation to protect life in buildings, particularly in buildings of public resort and entertainment. Echoing what Deputy Browne said, the Minister could say that there is another model to the implementation and administration of national building regulations and that is the one to which the Construction Industry Federation referred in their submission, namely some degree of self-certification.  The effect of that would be that people who <Col N="2036" /> design and construct buildings and who subsequently are found to be negligent with regard to clearly specified regulations would be held to be criminally negligent and, in the context of a tragedy like this, would now be in jail pending the outcome of an inquiry, as Deputy Browne mentioned in relation to the French case.</P>
    <P>These are the choices open to the Minister. Why has the Minister not put them honestly on the table?  Why has he not pointed out the difficulties to the House? Why has he not told the House that we have to respond to the tragedy and why has he not sought the best way forward to ensure that a similar tragedy will not occur again?  I do not know why he has not adopted that course.  There is no party advantage in any of this.  There are endless topics about which we could disagree but on this matter there should be no disagreement.  The tragedy and the shame is that there is.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter of building regulations.  I should like to clarify one point that was repeated here today.  I have been quoted as saying that the Construction Industry Federation objected to and delayed the implementation of the regulations.  What they objected to were the insulation standards of 1976-77 but it would be unfair to accuse them of delaying implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I ask the Taoiseach or whichever Minister will reply to tell us why he thinks the public inquiry should not, as a term of reference, have regard to how the draft building regulations were implemented.  The Minister and the local authority have requested that they be implemented on a voluntary basis.  Why should not such a specific inquiry be made?  We are talking about a building for which outline planning permission was obtained on appeal in 1976.  I am speaking from memory and am subject to correction.  The revised final full approval was obtained in 1978-79 and, therefore, it would fall within the scope of the request to regard these draft building regulations as a voluntary code of practice.</P>
    <P>That is our argument.  All the rest will come later.  In the context of this tragedy <Col N="2037" /> and of the terms of reference of the tribunal the Government have a clear duty to indicate to the House why they will not accept this essential amendment.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak, but I should like to point out two things.  I have listened with care to Deputy Quinn and I now understand what I had not understood before, the rationable of his amendment.  The question of whether the voluntary application of the draft building regulations did happen in the case of the Stardust Club is a matter material to the inquiry.  It does not seem to me to be necessarily covered by the other terms of reference, and now that I understand the purport of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear that it necessarily is covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is covered under sub-paragraph (3) and under the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that it necessarily is covered, because it is a voluntary request to people to do something. I am not clear that this comes under the heading of legislation, of statutory regulations and by-laws.  Therefore, I do not see how it comes under my amendment, which in this respect seems to me not to cover the ground as fully as I would have wished.  Neither do I see that it necessarily comes under sub-paragraph (3).  It could or it could not, but we must make sure.  Having heard Deputy Quinn and having understood the rationale of his amendment, I urge the Government to reconsider their position. I suspect that, like myself, the Taoiseach and the Minister may not have understood fully why Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party were pressing the amendment. In that event, perhaps the Government will reconsider the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland raised the question of furniture and the materials used and he mentioned that this could be the function of another Minister.  I understand that it <Col N="2038" /> is.  I should like the Taoiseach or the Minister to let us know what action the Government intend to take in relation to the question of the composition of furniture which would appear <i>prima facie</i> to have been a significant factor in the tragedy. I feel that the House would need to know what is intended in regard to that because it is not really quite covered by what is here.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach or the Minister indicated the Government's intentions in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the agreement by all Deputies with the Government's view that this is a matter to treat with a great degree of respect because of the number of people involved and the seriousness of the tragedy.  I also welcome the agreement by everybody that we all have a duty to the victims of this disastrous fire, their relatives and all our people to do everything in our power to establish the circumstances and cause of the fire.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies in their contributions used the words &ldquo;cover-up&rdquo;.  I want to put on the record of the House that the Government &mdash; I include everybody in the House in that &mdash; want the truth of what happened.  We are determined to get the truth of what happened.  It is for that reason that the motion setting up the tribunal and setting out the terms of reference is as broad as we have it on the Order Paper.  That is the reason we brought in international assessors to assist the tribunal to get to the very bottom of what happened early last Saturday morning.  The people are entitled to know and are entitled to have an assurance that there is no cover-up.  The Government are determined there will be no cover-up.</P>
      <P>As far as the terms of the motion and the amendments before us are concerned I propose to accept amendment No. 2a put down by the Fine Gael Party which states:</P>
      <P>In Paragraph 1, to insert a new sub paragraph after sub-paragraph (5):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) the adequacy of the legislation statutory regulations and by-laws relevant to fire prevention and safety, so <Col N="2039" /> far as material to the granting of planning and by-law permission for, and the conduct, running, supervision, and official inspection and control of, the Stardust Club, and the adequacy of the application, observance and enforcement of such legislation, statutory regulations and by-laws in relation to the Stardust Club&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in accepting that amendment, together with subparagraph (3) in the motion, which states:</P>
    <P>the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 14 February, 1981, to prevent and detect, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with fire at the Stardust Club,</P>
    <P>This fully meets the point made in the amendment No. 1, proposed by the Labour Party.  I want to emphasise that there is no question of attempting to prevent any matter being looked at by the tribunal.  On behalf of the people in the Artane area, those involved in the tragedy, the families of the dead and the injured, as I said in my opening remarks, in the interests of all those affected by the tragedy, we want to see that the tribunal's findings should be available at the earliest possible date.  We do not want to include items which could in any way delay the report of the findings.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept, as I have already said, amendment No. 4, the other Labour Party amendment, and improve on it in a manner in which I have indicated. I propose, rather than use the work &ldquo;statutory&rdquo; alone, to use &ldquo;statutory and other provisions&rdquo;.  Many of the points which were made during the debate are of a general nature which I believe would be more appropriate to the commission of inquiry which I indicated the Government intends setting up rather than to the tribunal.  The Government intend to set up a commission of inquiry with very broad terms of reference.  They will be discussed in the normal way by the Taoiseach and the leaders of the Opposition parties.  In those terms of reference I have no doubt that the substance of amendment No. 3 will be accepted as <Col N="2040" /> points to be included.  I assume that this assurance will satisfy the Fine Gael Party who put down the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully's contribution was very fair and responsible, as were the contributions of everybody else who spoke.  He said we must attempt to try to ensure that it never happens again. I fully agree that we must try to ensure it never happens again.  I purposely put in the words &ldquo;as far as is humanely possible&rdquo; because I believe those words are relevant.  I do not believe the accusation that the motion is not adequate, that as Deputy Tully said it will not hold water when the full terms of the tribunal are taken into account.  We have gone as far as we can in regard to the terms of reference of the tribunal in relation to seeing that we get as expeditious a result as possible.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy Tully that the inspection of buildings should take place not just on the Monday morning, as was suggested, but when the premises are being used.  I know this is done in the Dublin area.  I agree with the Deputy that it should be done throughout the country. I also agree with his concern about the overcrowding of clubs and the danger of this.  That is one of the reasons why I requested the local authorities to examine immediately all those places of entertainment and take action under the regulations. The regulations are there despite some of the comments that were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully said that it was fortunate that this tragedy which occurred in the Dublin area did not occur in a country town because no similar plan like the one in Dublin is available.  There is in every <Col N="2041" /> health authority area a major accident plan.  The effectiveness of this could be seen at the time of the unfortunate tragedy at Buttevant.  There is an accident plan available to go into operation in every health board area.  This accident plan is reviewed at all times after any tragedy occurs.  I agree with the Deputy with regard to adequate staffing of all types of premises, particularly with regard to places of entertainment.  Many of the points made by Deputy Tully enforce the view of the Government that there should be a commission of inquiry to inquire not just into fire but into all matters related to public safety.  It is for that reason we have decided to go ahead with the commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland made a number of points with regard to the amendments. He was not in the House when I mentioned it earlier, but I have agreed to accept amendment No. 2 (a).  The substance of amendment No. 3 will form part of the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry across the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland referred to delay in the reporting of the tribunal. We agree that an early and comprehensive report should be available.  However, we do not feel it would be appropriate to tie the hands of the tribunal with regard to a decision on an interim report. The tribunal may themselves decide to present an interim report, but we should not try to tie their hands on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland mentioned the provision of public liability insurance in premises generally.  This is a matter which is <Col N="2042" /> under active consideration as part of a new insurance bill the details of which have been announced in general terms on a number of occasions.  We have compulsory third party insurance in relation to motor vehicles, and the question of other forms of compulsory insurance is a matter that will be dealt with in the Bill. I see great merit in having compulsory public liability insurance in places of entertainment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that this might be included in the Bill rather than the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify this.  I am not sure where there would be provision for mandatory public liability insurance in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It could go both ways. It could go before the commission of inquiry and it could be in the insurance Bill.  This is not a debate that should become contentious.  The Deputy made a number of points with regard to financial aspects for local authorities generally. I do not intend to go into that today. Another point the Deputy raised was that of appointing the chief fire advisor in the Department of the Environment as one of the assessors to the board.  It would be totally inappropriate and would be looked upon by the general public as an attempt to cover up in the tribunal if a civil servant, the chief fire advisor to the Department of the Environment, was included as one of the assessors.</P>
      <P>The question of polyurethane foam in seating is something that will come out in the tribunal.  The tribunal is being established to make such recommendations as they, having regard to their findings, think proper in respect of statutory and other matters.  Undoubtedly if this question comes up they will make recommendations on the foam.  I totally accept that at present the regulations regarding these materials are only for domestic use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also made a point regarding <Col N="2043" /> malicious damages.  I do not want in any way to prejudge the question of whether there will be malicious damages paid in this case or not.  However, the Government will take the position of Dublin Corporation into account should such a situation arise.  The Deputy went on to question financial matters, but I do not intend to bring that into the debate at this time.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Browne made the point that this cannot be allowed to happen again.  I accept that, with one reservation &mdash;&ldquo;as far as humanly possible&rdquo;&mdash; we, as a parliament and Government, should do everything possible to see that it does not happen again.  It is for this reason I made the announcement that I did regarding action across a number of heads.  The Deputy asked why the Government waited until now with regard to building regulations and a statement of intent to set up a commission of inquiry.  He also spoke about widening the terms of the tribunal. Since this tragedy occurred the Government have been meeting regularly and drafting the terms of reference of the tribunal.  It was for that reason that the question of the commission of inquiry is only being mentioned today.  The Deputy mentioned that there were restrictions on the tribunal.  I do not accept that there are except for the time restriction, and that is so that we will have a full report available as soon as possible.  Other than that there are no concrete restrictions.</P>
    <P>The other points made by the Deputy regarding legislation and statutory regulations are adequately covered in the amendment I have agreed to accept.  The Deputy asked what action had been taken with regard to the report of the working party on fire services published in 1975 and mentioned in particular the review of the local fire services.  A detailed local review of the fire services has been initiated in all areas of the country with a view to identifying deficiencies so that remedial action can be taken.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made the point that there was no fire training.  A central programme of training courses for fire service personnel has been expanded and <Col N="2044" /> important guidelines were issued to local authorities.  He made the point that he was acting on behalf of the chief fire officers.  It would be appropriate to make some comments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way I took it.  In the last few days much has been said regarding the reporting relationship between chief fire officers and county councils.  My predecessor had a circular letter issued on 26 October 1979 on this subject stating that arrangements should be made to have chief fire officers report to county managers in respect of specified matters which covered the key features of the judgment.  Included in those matters were fire prevention, operational fire fighting staff, staffing and training, fire stations and equipment and preparation of estimates.  A further circular letter was issued on 25 March 1980 to the same effect.  Following on these letters seven county councils adopted the arrangement wholly in addition to Dublin, where it has applied for many years.  Another two counties adopted it on a partial basis.  In other counties the arrangement has not yet been put into effect because of industrial relations considerations.  National negotiations have been proceeding on this matter.  My predecessor and I, and my Department, together with the local government staff negotiation board, have been active in seeking a solution.  I hope that, in the light of the present situation and with goodwill on the part of the different staff groups, it will be possible to bring matters to a sucessful conclusion.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the filling of six vacant posts has been held up because of failure to reach agreement on new conditions.  I have decided that arrangements be put in train for the filling of these vacancies on the basis of the old conditions with an addendum that these conditions are at present being reviewed.  I would expect the co-operation of all concerned in having these vacancies filled as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many matters were raised by Deputy <Col N="2045" /> Browne.  He mentioned size of workforce, the training of workforce, the adequacy of the water supply in the area of the Stardust on last Friday night, local authority regulations and many other things.  The terms of reference of the tribunal are such that all of these items will undoubtedly come up for discussion at the tribunal hearings.  It is not my position today &mdash; and I do not intend to enter into it &mdash; to interfere in any way with the work of this tribunal.  Indeed it would be improper of me to comment in any way on questions of water supply, training of staff or other matters.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the question of what I am doing about other clubs throughout the country in respect of which further action will be taken.</P>
    <P>As far as the building regulations are concerned the legal status for these will take just a matter of weeks &mdash; I want to emphasis that &mdash; just a matter of weeks. In regard to building regulations Deputy Quinn questioned the need for legislation to enable these to be put into operation legally.  The need for legislation arises because a different method of implementation and control, a simpler and much more efficient method, is now being put in train different from that envisaged in the base legislation of 1963 and 1976. That is the reason for enabling legislation. That same point was raised by Deputy Browne also.  I have already referred to the points made by Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies raised other points with regard to apparatus training&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

The Government are committed to seeing that there will be no attempt at cover-up, no accusations of cover-up.

      <P>I thought I had indicated to Deputy Quinn what I had in mind.  I want to say that the Government are very anxious that this motion, if at all possible, be agreed without a division. We have been listening carefully to what Deputy Quinn said about the Labour Party amendment No. 1.  It is clear from his remarks that Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party are concerned only with whether or not these building regulations, as a voluntary code, were applicable in the case of the Stardust premises in Artane.  I believe I am right in thinking that that was the thrust of Deputy Quinn's remarks &mdash; that it is the application of the building regulations to the premises in Artane, even though they did not have statutory effect, that is in the mind of the Labour Party.  From our point of view, on this side of the House, we are satisfied that the terms of reference, as they stand at present, are such and do authorise the tribunal to look at that aspect, to examine whether or not, in regard to the particular premises in Artane, the building regulations, as a voluntary code, were applicable.  But, as there may be some doubt about it, what <Col N="2048" /> I would like to suggest to the House is that they afford us the opportunity of a half an hour's adjournment, 20 minutes' adjournment, in which we can consult with the Government's legal advisers and report back to the House.  If it is clear that the terms of reference, as such, do cover this point, well and good.  If not it is proposed to come back with an amendment to make it crystal clear that the tribunal may look at this particular aspect of the building regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to an adjournment of the House for the purpose the Taoiseach has indicated.  We are anxious also that, if it can be avoided, there would not be a division on this matter.  But I think the Taoiseach may be misinterpreting Deputy Quinn's contribution if he interprets it as meaning that that is the only matter about which we would be concerned, that is, the building regulations.  We are concerned about all and every aspect of our amendment No. 1, which would broaden considerably the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction in this matter and would ensure that every statutory body, including the Department of the Environment, was looked into to ensure to the satisfaction of everybody, not least that of the public, that every conceivable authority or Department which could have had a bearing, or may have a bearing, not alone on what happened but on what could happen in the future, is investigated thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the terms of reference to be as all-embracing as it is possible to make them in order to ensure what everybody here has declared is our primary objective, not looking for statements but that there will not be a recurrence of that terrible tragedy.  It is in that spirit that we put down the amendment.  We are concerned with every aspect of the amendment and not just one aspect of it as the Taoiseach indicated he understood from Deputy Quinn's contribution.  We have no objection to an adjournment but it is only fair for us to state that unless the <Col N="2049" /> amendment, in its entirely, is accepted we will reluctantly be left in the position where we will vote against the motion.</P>

I was glad to hear the Taoiseach offering that there should be an adjournment and I appeal to the Labour Party and to the Fine Gael Party, but Labour in particular, to get together and, surely to God, agreement can be reached without all this carry on.</P>

      <P>We have accepted one amendment from the Labour Party, amendment No. 4, and we have accepted an amendment from the Fine Gael Party, amendment No. 2(a), Fine Gael have sought an assurance about the commission of inquiry on the basis of which they would be prepared not to press amendment No. 3.  At this stage I, perhaps wrongly thought that Labour's only concern in amendment No. 1, as enunciated by Deputy Quinn, was the application of the draft building regulations, even as a voluntary code, to the premises in Artane and I was prepared to examine that <Col N="2050" /> aspect further to see if we could meet the Labour Party on it.  I must say now, in case there is any misapprehension about it, that the Labour Party amendments and terms as set out here could not be accepted.  But we will certainly examine whether the specific point made by Deputy Quinn about the application of the draft regulations to the Artane premises is included in the terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already explained on a number of occasions, and I feel that there is a broad acceptance in the House of the principle that this particular tribunal of inquiry should do its particular job as expeditiously as possible, give us the truth, give us the facts, and then let us go on from there.  Our problem, as a Government, is that if the terms of reference are too wide, cover the whole compass of the building regulations, their implementation and so on, and cover all aspects of safety and fire precautions throughout the country, they will inhibit the expeditiousness of this tribunal and our suggestion is that all those matters will be discussed between us as the basis of a commission of inquiry. But in the meantime I do see the validity of the point that the application of the draft regulations to the premises in Artane is something that should be considered by this tribunal as a particular matter and we will be prepared now to see, first of all, if the existing terms of reference do cover that point and if they do not what amendment is necessary to cover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all quite clear. The amendment seeks to include the measures and their adequacy, including the draft building regulations of the Department of the Environment and the <Col N="2051" /> statutory provisions and regulations which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and the local authority, taken on or before 14 February 1981 to prevent and detect and to minimise and otherwise deal with fire at the Stardust Club.  Precisely what aspect of that does the Taoiseach think would broaden the thing, makes it more difficult to reach conclusions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was not already covered in the terms of reference as they stand it certainly comes within the compass of amendment No. 6 which Fine Gael have now put down.  Whatever else is in the Labour Party amendment No. 1 is certainly now covered in the amendment of Fine Gael which we are accepting, with the possible exception of this specific point made by Deputy Quinn, namely, the application of the building regulations, even though they were only a voluntary code, to the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I find difficult. If, as the Taoiseach says, all of what we requested in the amendment is covered in amendment No. 6, why is amendment No. 1 not accepted?  Amendment No. 1 was submitted last night and it was indicated this morning that the Government were not prepared to accept it. Amendment No. 6 was submitted today and the Government are prepared to accept it.  I cannot follow the Taoiseach's reasoning.  If what is in amendment No. 1 is covered by amendment No. 6 surely then the Government should accept amendment No. 1 because it was submitted first.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 as it stands at present in my view suffers from the defect that the entire compass of the building regulations would become a matter for this tribunal of inquiry to examine.  We suggest that what we are going to do about the building regulations is to introduce legislative proposals about them in a matter of weeks when the Labour Party and other Deputies will have a full opportunity to debate the whole situation in regard to the building regulations but, in the meantime, not to <Col N="2052" /> encumber the tribunal of inquiry with that very major area of activity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not accept that situation.  At the adjournment of the House the Taoiseach gave a commitment that we would seek the advice of our legal advisers on the point made with regard to the draft building regulations.  We were advised that the application of the draft building regulations was already covered in the terms of reference of the tribunal.  However, in case there would be any iota of doubt in any Deputy's mind, I decided that after the word &ldquo;measures&rdquo; in paragraph 5 to put in &ldquo;including the application of the draft building regulations published on 29 November 1976&rdquo;.

      <P>What we are anxious about, in insisting on our amendment No. 1, is that if we were to accept this situation <Col N="2055" /> it would exclude the Department of the Environment.  The Government have been extremely accommodating as far as other matters are concerned in relation to amendments and suggestions that have come from the Opposition and Deputy Browne, but the one sticking point apparently is in the two amendments which refer specifically to the Department of the Environment.  We feel very strongly that that kind of exclusion would be extremely detrimental to the best interests of the tribunal and the people at large, particularly the people who have suffered through loss of life in their families or through injury.  There are people within the Department and people who have business with the Department whose evidence could be vital and we want to ensure that that is included specifically in the terms of reference, not by implication but specified clearly.  On that ground, in order to ensure that every possible avenue which is necessary and desirable to be explored by the tribunal would be explored, there should be absolutely no ambiguity whatsoever regarding rights and access and what is included.  In an issue such as we are discussing here today one of the principal elements would be the Department of the Environment and for them to be excluded, for them not to be specifically included, would, in our opinion, be the height of irresponsibility.  That is why we are insisting, in the interest of the people I have mentioned, that our amendment would stand.  We are trying to be and have been extremely helpful and accommodating but there is a boundary between being accommodating and being irresponsible. We are not prepared to cross over that boundary.  It would be extremely irresponsible for us in this House not to insist that the Department of the Environment, not by implication, not possibly, but definitely are named and included in any investigation that the tribunal undertake.</P>

It would make it crystal clear if the Minister or the Taoiseach could explain whether or not, within the terms as set out in the motion as it will be amended following the acceptance of amendment 2(a), the Department of the Environment will be one of the areas which the tribunal can look into as regards the extraordinary situation which exists in relation to the chief fire adviser to the Minister for the Environment.  He apparently is not here to advise the Minister on a debate in relation to a fire with the greatest loss of life in our history.  The Minister's chief adviser in this matter is not present among the unusually large number of civil servants who are here. We would need clarification as to whether or not this area to which I referred in my original contribution regarding the relationship between that officer and the support he appears to enjoy from the chief fire officers of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What I am suggesting is that the substance of amendment 3 can be included in the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry which the Government intend to set up to inquire into the whole question of fire and public safety.  The question, as it relates to public liability insurance, will be covered in an insurance Bill and could also be included as part of the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry. The terms of reference will form part of an immediate discussion between the Taoiseach and the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given Deputy O'Toole permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my thanks to the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I sought permission to raise this because I felt that the nature of the reply today to my question was not satisfactory.  To put <Col N="2067" /> this matter of the Ceimicí Teoranta Glucose Plant at Corroy in perspective, I refer back to a debate which took place in this House on 9 December last, when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism introduced the Industrial Alcohol (Amendment) Bill, 1980.  The amending legislation provided for an increase in the authorised share capital from £½ million to £10 million.  This money was sought to provide for future developments within Ceimicí Teoranta. During the course of that debate, for the first time the Minister gave an indication that a joint venture with an Australian company was in prospect.  He went on to say that the newly constituted board of Ceimicí Teoranta had sought to establish a joint venture shortly after the board's appointment.  It would seem they had been unsuccessful in doing that and, having been unsuccessful, they sought to refurbish the Corroy plant.  The end result was that £1.6 million was committed, and most of it was expended on that plant: new machinery was installed, an effluent disposal and treatment works were provided and there now is a chemical plant very much up to date which could cater for a variety of chemical processes.</P>
      <P>During that debate the Minister told the House for the first time that after that decision had been taken the board, with the help of the IDA, had succeeded in entering discussions on a joint venture with the Australian company.  The proposal was that a glucose and gluten plant would be established in Ringaskiddy in County Cork, if the discussions were successful and if the proposals were brought to fruition, and, this plant in Cork would sound the death knell of the Corroy glucose plant.  This suggestion was not denied by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, who pointed out that little could be done to reverse the decision if the Ringaskiddy venture was to go ahead because it was felt that the Corroy plant was not commercially viable and for that reason the obvious thing to do was to introduce a more viable industry into the refining chemical plant at Corroy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the workers at Corroy discovered <Col N="2068" /> that the establishment of a glucose plant in Ringaskiddy would virtually mean the closure of their plant they got up in arms.  Deputations from the workers met public representatives and there was a lot of press comment.  At that time I sought clarification of the decision taken and I proposed a public inquiry into how the decision had been arrived at, if it had been arrived at.  I asked that the board would review the situation in the light of the position at Corroy.</P>
    <P>The position at Corroy is that 50 employees there have long service.  There are 20 further employees working as part-time dockers at Ballina quay, and the closure of the Corroy plant will mean the virtual shut-down of Ballina quay simply because Ceimicí Teoranta are now the one and only customer using the Ballina quay for the importation of strach for the manufacture of glucose at Corroy. As well, three or four men are employed by CIE solely for the transport of the starch from the pier to the Corroy plant.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are talking roughly of 75 people, many of them with long-time service.  We have been told that the potential employment in the new Cork plant, if it ever sees the light of day, will be roughly for 100.  The capital cost will be something like £4 million.  Already £1.6 million of public money has been spent on the Corroy plant which should have been kept open.  Ceimicí Teoranta apparently are turning their backs on that plant when they should be expanding it through the installation of a starch mill. In other words, the capital expenditure of £1.6 million should be topped up to provide the kind of facilities now being proposed for Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>I do not see any economic sense in leaving this up to date chemical plant empty when the facilities are there and the personnel, many of whom have long experience in the glucose and starch business. Why cannot the board look into the possibility of providing at Corroy the same facilities as those proposed for Cork at a much higher cost?  The argument has been put forward that the pier at Ballina at the entry to the sea of the Moy is not adequate to take the kind of discharges of maize and wheat required to keep the <Col N="2069" /> Corroy mill going.  My answer is that it is high time that that waterway was made adequate and suitable for such business.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the loss of more than 70 jobs in an area that has suffered very gravely from job losses in the past 12 months.  In County Mayo unemployment rose in 1980 from 4,500 to 5,500, an increase of more than 20 per cent, nearly twice the national average.  If we break down that figure we find that half of the job loss increase occurred in the district where there is now a proposal for a further loss of 75 jobs.  Today the Minister said that advance factories had been and were being built in the area.  I agree with such a policy so that we will be ready when the economy takes its upturn and, hopefully, we will be able to get tenants for the factories.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State have said in this House and outside it that they are giving serious consideration to this part of the country.  In the county there is approximately 250,000 square feet of vacant factory space.  Yet in this instance we have a semi-State body who are proposing to put a further 75 people on the dole.  The consequence of that is that people will have less money in their pockets and the social life of the area will be deprived of finance.</P>
    <P>One cannot but recall the commitment made by this Government, which was that where they had responsibility and influence they would not allow such things to happen.  Here is a case where they have direct influence on the outcome of a board decision.  Today I asked the Minister to clarify his position in relation to the board decision.  Even at this late stage I should like to know if the Minister will advise the board about Government policy in relation to this area.  Will he see to it that the board carry out their decisions in accordance with the stated policy of the Government?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that if the Corroy plant closes the port of Ballina will also close.  The long-term consequences do not look good for the area.  We have a port facility, albeit an <Col N="2070" /> inadequate facility.  However, it can be improved and made suitable for larger vessels.  Once that port closes we will find it very difficult to convince potential investors to come to the area.  We are throwing away one of our trump cards.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I ask the Minister to clarify his position on this matter and to let us know what, if any, are the proposals for Corroy.  Will the Minister give consideration to the establishment of a starch mill in the area seeing that so much public money has been spent on this plant?  At Question Time today the Minister made a statement in relation to production targets at Corroy.  He said they were unable to reach their target of 18,000 tons, that output is now down to 13,000 tons.  The Minister must know that one of the reasons for their inability to reach a certain level of production was simply due to obsolete plant which broke down practically every day.  During the years the workers worked six and seven days each week when the plant was in working order in order to fill orders.  The workers are due a great debt of gratitude by Ceimicí Teoranta.  There has never been a dispute in the factory, but the thanks they get now is to be made redundant. That is not the kind of treatment that should be given to those people, many of whom have had long service with Ceimicí Teoranta.  I appeal to the Minister to consult with the board in the hope that something will be done to save the plant.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked that the decision to close the glucose plant at Corroy be rescinded and in my reply I indicated no such decision had been taken and, consequently, the question of rescinding it did not arise.  During Question Time Deputy O'Toole questioned the wisdom of carrying on negotiations with another concern for a joint integrated venture that would produce glucose elsewhere in the country while, at the same time, saying it was not intended to close the Corroy plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer that question I must say that the expert advice available shows that the <Col N="2071" /> future prospects for a starch to glucose plant such as that at Corroy are worsening rapidly and that good prospects exist only for integrated milling to glucose operations.  To undertake a milling operation it is necessary to have the expertise to produce and market the other co-products that derive from a milling operation. The Australian company with which negotiations are being carried out have these advantages.</P>
    <P>What annoyed me about Deputy O'Toole's attitude is the fact that he is trying to wear two hats.  When the Minister introduced the Alcohol (Amendment) Bill in this House the Deputy welcomed it with open arms.  He welcomed the joint operation but now he comes here and questions the wisdom of the whole matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy welcomed the Bill and he congratulated the Minister for introducing it.  Now the shoe is on the other foot.  The Deputy was asleep and did not know what was happening. He is also questioning the future of Ballina harbour.  Is it since the Deputy moved to that side of the House that he has begun to see the value of the harbour? This two-faced approach by a front bench member of the Fine Gael Party with responsibility for Industry and Commerce is quite deplorable.  The way this matter has been approached is not in the interests of Corroy and of the workers there.  It is the Government's intention to try to ensure that jobs are protected at <Col N="2072" /> all times.  They have a particular interest in this factory.</P>
      <P>The history of the factory goes back to the early thirties when a Fianna Fáil Government decided to use the raw material, which was readily available in the area, to give employment to the people there. The Fianna Fáil Government have never reneged on their responsibility to the workers of that area.  They have always tried to see that the workers are looked after.  If it is necessary at a later stage to close the factory, I assure Deputy O'Toole and the workers that their interests will be looked after.  As Minister of State for the particular area I cannot recall receiving any representations from Deputy O'Toole, either privately or publicly, until today after he put down this question.  I cannot say that about other Deputies from the area.  Deputy Sean Calleary has shown his concern for the future of the factory and has been in constant touch with me on the whole matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should have manners and sit down.  I did not interrupt him during his speech.  He should show a little more responsibility in this matter.  I am amazed that a man of Deputy O'Toole's stature should play about with this matter as he has been doing during the last few weeks, trying to entice the workers and inflame them in relation to the procedure they should adopt.  I want to assure the Deputy and the workers that there is no decision to close down this factory.  It is providing a very good service at the moment.  The <Col N="2073" /> product there is very essential to industrialists. We hope that there will not be any disruption of the work going on there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 15,000 people employed throughout the country at the moment depend on the work that is being done in the Corroy factory.  We will not have a situation where people are allowed bandy about a question for cheap political reasons and give a wrong impression in relation to this operation.  I give frank and open answers during Question Time, I try to facilitate the Deputy.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in introducing the amendment to the Alcohol Bill, <Col N="2074" /> has been open and frank in relation to the whole question.  It was accepted by Deputy O'Toole at the time.  Now he is wearing another hat, he has a change of attitude and I do not think that it is doing any good to the operation in Corroy and the workers there.</P>

      <P>The delay in this case was because an original land certificate which had been issued to the solicitors for the registered owner in 1951 could not be produced to the Land Registry.  The necessary legal formalities in connection with the issue of a duplicate land certificate had to be completed before examination of the application for registration could proceed. These formalities were completed in November 1980 and the application for registration was completed on 11 February 1981.

There is extensive blanket bog in surrounding areas including Kilraine and Carrickatslieve, but the board have informed me that this bog is unsuitable for development by them.</P>
      <P>The Turf Development Bill, 1980, which I have introduced in the Dáil, proposes that funds be made available to enable Bord na Móna, subject to general directives as to policy to be given by me as Minister for Energy, to make grants available for private development of bogs, including bogs, which, because of their nature or size, are not suitable for development by the board.  Grant aid will extend to the cost of access roads, drainage and bog development equipment. When the legislation is enacted it will then be open to persons interested in the private development of bogs to make application to Bord na Móna for grant assistance.  I hope to take the remaining Stages of the Bill early in the current Dáil session.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the board that, last November, they made an order under the Turf Development Act, 1946, for the compulsory acquisition of about 750 acres in the aforementioned townlands and in the townlands of Ledwithstown, Drumnee and Ardoghil.  These lands are located in County Longford about one mile from the border with Westmeath.  Bord na Móna are negotiating on the price to be paid for the boglands being acquired.  The board state that there is no further bogland suitable for their purposes in the townlands mentioned.</P>
      <P>The board state that there are some 71 holders of turbary rights on the boglands being acquired.

In the meantime the Authority are vigorously promoting these advance factories in Bantry for suitable projects.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been drawn to difficulties being caused by aspects of the Civil Liability Act under <Col N="1933" /> which the court must rule as to whether an offer of settlement from insurers should be accepted or not; if he is aware that such advice may well be in contravention of the desires of the party involved and if he is further aware of cases in which such advice was found to be faulty when the case came before another judge, thereby causing a loss to the party involved; and if he is considering any amendment of the legislation to ensure that where a plaintiff so desires he or she may accept the proposed settlement figure without having to be directed to the contrary by the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an implication in the question that, as a general rule, settlements in civil liability cases require the approval of the court.  In fact the provisions to which I assume the question relates are special provisions for the protection of infants in certain circumstances. That apart, to reply to the various parts of the question would in effect involve me in expressing opinions on the manner in which certain discretionary powers conferred on judges by the Civil Liability Act, 1961, have been exercised in particular cases.</P>
      <P>I have received no representations that the law concerned is unsatisfactory. Should the Deputy or any other interested person consider that the law is deficient, I suggest that the best thing to do would be to send me his views and the supporting arguments in writing and in sufficient detail to enable me to examine them.</P>

      <P>If the reference to a &ldquo;smaller pension&rdquo; means a smaller proportion of the husband's <Col N="1934" /> pay, the answer to the first part of the Question is yes.  However, this statement by itself would be misleading without taking account of the relevant provisions of the Garda Síochána Compensation Acts and the Army Pensions Acts, which relate to the payment of compensation as distinct from pension.</P>
      <P>As regards possible changes in the Garda Pensions Scheme, the position is that matters relating to changes in the scheme fall to be dealt with under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, and it would be inappropriate for me to comment in the matter outside that context.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the county development teams in the western counties embrace all forms of ecomomic development.  I have no plans to expand the terms of reference because I consider that they are already sufficiently broad nor have I had any recommendation from the Central Development Committee, who co-ordinate the activities of the teams, that they should be expanded. Industrial development in the west, as in the country at large, is primarily a matter for the Industrial Development Authority. The Authority's Small Industries Programme is administered in the Mid-West region by SFADCo, with whom the teams in Clare and West Limerick have a close working relationship.  In the remaining western counties, the teams and their development officers act as local agents for the IDA in relation to the programme.  I am satisfied that industrial development in the west has not been inhibited by the terms of reference of county development teams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The roles of the teams and development officers in small industry development <Col N="1942" /> is under review at present.  In the context of this review consultations are in train involving, <i>inter alia</i>, the Central Development Committee, the teams and the IDA.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 9 October 1980, but he was not qualified for payment as, according to the records of my Department, he had less than the statutory minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in the governing contribution year. Following protracted inquiries it was established that he had in fact sufficient weeks of insurable employment in the relevant governing contribution year to qualify for payment.  I understand that, while these inquiries were being made, he was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Payment of benefit for the period 13 October 1980, fourth day of incapacity, to 23 January 1981, date of the latest medical certificate received, has been issued.  An amount of £180.95 was withheld and refunded to the Southern Health Board to reimburse supplementary welfare allowance paid to him during the period of his claim.</P>
      <P>His entitlement to pay-related benefit is being investigated and payment, if any, due will be made on completion of inquiries.</P>

      <P>On 8 December 1980 the person concerned claimed benefit from my Department in respect of incapacity <Col N="1959" /> which he stated was due to an accident at work on 5 October 1979.  He is not entitled to injury benefit on this claim as a period of more than 26 weeks has elapsed since the date of the alleged accident.  In fact, the employers have already indicated that no accident was reported to them.  However, he has been paid disability benefit at the maximum rate applicable to a married man from 10 December 1980 to 2 February 1981, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>

      <P>The person concerned originally claimed disability benefit from 2 December <Col N="1961" /> 1980 but, as no further certificates were received, no payment of benefit was due on the claim.  He again claimed benefit and submitted a first certificate from 6 January 1981 in respect of a different incapacity.  A cheque covering payment of all benefit due in respect of the period 9 January, fourth day of incapacity, to 29 January 1981, date of the latest certificates received, was issued to him recently.  In addition he has been requested to furnish a statement from his employer indicating the periods of absence from work due to illness since 2 December 1980.  If he has been absent for any periods for which he has not already been paid a further payment of benefit will be made to him.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment on the January 1981 claim was due to the fact that he failed to quote his RSI number on the earlier medical certificates and the claim could not be processed until the number became available on the certificates received towards the end of January.</P>

      <P>The making of a scheme of letting priorities in accordance with the requirements of section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, is primarily a matter for each housing authority.  Apart from the requirement in the Act that a housing authority shall have regard to the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, the Act also provides that a scheme may specify that particular priorities shall be accorded to particular categories of persons in the lettings of particular dwellings. In accordance with guidelines issued by my Department, housing authorities can give priority on medical grounds &mdash; for example, the Dublin Corporation scheme provides that applicants in special serious health circumstances are considered for housing without reference to points.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, and as I am not aware of any strong case for the alteration of the existing procedure regarding the housing of applicants suffering from cystic fibrosis, I do not consider that a special provision for such applicants is necessary.</P>

      <P>The person in question was made redundant in 1977 and received a redundancy lump sum and certain weekly payments.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, which came into effect on 6 April 1979 abolished redundancy weekly payments except for persons receiving them on that date.  If after that date payments to those still receiving them ceased for any reason, such as resumption of employment, any undrawn balance could not be subsequently claimed.</P>
      <P>The person in question was receiving redundancy weekly payments on 6 April 1979.  His entitlement ceased on 30 April 1979 when he became employed in his present job.  I understand that he has since been continuously employed so that there would be no question of weekly payments even if entitlement had continued.</P>
      <P>I am aware from representations already made to me that some persons affected by the abolition of weekly payments want to have the discontinuance of their entitlements reviewed.  Any changes in redundancy entitlements would require amending legislation and valid reasons for this would have to be put forward.</P>
