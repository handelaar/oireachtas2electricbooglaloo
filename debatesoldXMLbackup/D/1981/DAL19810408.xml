      <P>I wish to raise a point of order.  I have been attempting to raise with the Minister for Justice the question of an investigation into the activities of the Moonies in the light of recent disclosures about their activities in the United Kingdom.  Fianna Fáil might consider this to be a big joke but their amusement shows their lack of concern for young people.  My Dáil question has been disallowed on the grounds that it contains personal imputations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I demonstrated very clearly the differences and the deep divisions that exist within and between the Opposition Parties.  In their roarings for power they had the audacity to suggest that such divisions as exist within their own organisations also exist in Fianna Fáil.  They are like hordes of mad Pimpernels running around seeking to establish what is an untruth.  They seek it here, they seek it there, they seek it <Col N="1241" /> everywhere, but there is no doubt they will never find a split within Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Let us highlight another inefficiency that exists in the Opposition parties.  The attitude of the Coalition Government was highlighted by the fact that the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education with responsibility for sport had so little to do that he took on the portfolio for Industry and Commerce. They abolished the Sports Council and did not spend one penny on the promotion of sport.  The Department of Education was the vehicle used for sports promotion and under the Coalition they had nothing to do.  This is in total contrast to Fianna Fáil's attitude when they came to power.  Deputy Tunney was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for sport and he immediately reversed the position.  The first indication of that reversal was the formation of Cuspóir, an extremely wide ranging and efficient organisation who are carrying out their duties for the benefit of our young people in an exemplary manner.</P>
      <P>When the present Taoiseach was appointed this impetus gained momentum with the immediate implementation of plans for various sports centres throughout the country.  The building of some of these centres has already started and when completed they will provide sporting facilities in areas which would never have benefited if public money had not been provided in such an imaginative way.  This is a Finance Bill of vast dimensions. Substantial sums of money are being discussed.  That money will be spent by the various Departments for the benefit of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a plea on behalf of the Department of the Environment. I suggest that some of that money could be effectively spent by increasing the grant for first-time house purchasers from £1,000 to £5,000.  Such an increase would benefit the people who must buy a house for the first time in a market which has reached alarming proportions cost-wise. That grant should be allowed to first-time purchasers for any type of house and not necessarily for new houses.  Those buying a house for the first time must look around for the best possible value and if <Col N="1242" /> a second hand house gives them this type of value it will not inhibit the house sector of the economy because the person who sells a house to a first-time purchaser obviously must buy another home.  There is no doubt that increasing the grant would create considerable stimulus to the house building sector.  It would be a point of enlightenment, a forward thinking move and would have very beneficial spin-offs to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in view of the lack of research in the building sector &mdash; because of its fragmentation it is very difficult to have efficient research and development &mdash; a considerable sum of money be set aside to establish such an institution or forum.  I suggest capitalisation of at least £5 million and, perhaps, a similar sum from the industry.  I would like to see research carried out in relation to attitudes to road standards within estates. Road standards that are being insisted on by various local authorities, in particular by Dublin County Council, are of an exaggerated nature.  The spur roads off the feeder roads in many of our estates are so costly that they put up the price of houses to an inordinate degree.  The general design of estates could be looked at because it is said that in many of them housewives must walk long distances to reach schools, shops and services.  The urban sprawl that has taken place around the city in the last 20 years would have been carried on in a more efficient manner if research such as I suggested had been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Examples in other countries could be looked at but I also have great confidence in the arm of education concerned with our building industry to expect that ideas would be forthcoming from within our own industry for such improvements.  It is a type of improvement our building industry is not geared to suggest and certainly it is not geared to carry into effect. At present when land is zoned for building, a building firm submits a planning application which in most cases only covers a small portion of the land designated for building.  There is no overall concept of the development within a large area. Development is piecemeal and is not in the best interest of people who eventually <Col N="1243" /> live in those estates.  I suggest that a research and development unit is of great importance for the future of the building industry and the needs of our people.</P>
    <P>Another Department which will get substantial sums of money under the terms of the Finance Bill is the Department of Agriculture.  In that Department there is one area which is of significance to all housewives, the section concerned with the role of Irish potatoes in the future.  Irish potato growers are under attack from cheap imports from many different sources, the latest one coming from subsidised English potatoes which are supposed to be turned into animal feed.  In fact, they are not dyed and do not go to that sector.  Substantial quantities are being smuggled through the six north-eastern counties of our country for distribution in the twenty-six counties. This illegal and pernicious trade must be stopped because it is not to anybody's benefit.  Housewives are being conned into buying those imports through glowing press reports, unfortunately, which give a false impression of a superior quality that does not exist.  The consumer price index is suffering as is our balance of payments.  The existence of the Irish potato farmer is also at stake.  If this position continues housewives will suffer because they will be at the mercy of a small number of importers who will ruthlessly take the largest possible profit without any regard for our balance of payments, the needs of the housewives to get cheaper goods or the national interest.</P>
    <P>Later in the season, if this is not stopped, we will also have to face cheap imports from Cyprus and Turkey.  I mentioned before that it was my view that such imports were contravening the Treaty of Rome because of the low wages paid to workers in those locations.  It is grossly unfair to have potatoes coming in from countries where labour is being paid in the order of pence per hour.  I am led to believe that women in Cyprus are paid the derisory figure of 60p to 80p per hour to work in the fields where potatoes are produced while Irish farmers are paying the agreed industrial wage rates to the workers of their land.  It is unrealistic to <Col N="1244" /> think that this type of competition benefits anybody.  It does not.</P>
    <P>Irish potatoes with great benefit to everybody, should be brought under the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; campaign.  That campaign could be extended to protect Irish housewives on the one hand and, on the other hand, give our farmers a label under which they could sell their products with confidence.  That scheme is working successfully in the industrial sector and I do not see any reason why it cannot be extended to the potato producing sector.</P>
    <P>In relation to the performance of the Opposition on the agriculture sector I should like to refer to a statement made recently by a member who was the Coalition Minister for Agriculture.  This week he denounced the EEC farm price deal in a most derisory fashion.  I should like to remind the Opposition, and that gentleman, that when he was in the chair as our Minister for Agriculture he threw away, and virtually destroyed, the Irish lamb trade.  He failed completely to gain access to the French market, and the Parisian market in particular, for our Irish lamb.  That is our most important market for lamb but he failed completely to gain access to it.  He stated that it would be impossible for Irish lamb to gain access to the Parisian market but as soon as Fianna Fáil returned to power they gained that access.  Indeed, by doing so they saved the entire lamb industry and Fianna Fáil made sure that we would continue to enjoy that access.  That type of double-think and lying propaganda is no good to anybody.  If the Opposition are to be sincere in their attempts to persuade the Irish people that they have a better policy than ours they must do so in a truthful manner.  If the Opposition persist in carrying on with this attitude I fail to see how the country can continue to prosper.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came into power we can see the benefits of that in virtually every parish.  We can see new schools being built and opened and I cannot see how anyone could criticise borrowing for such productive purposes.  If we do not educate our children they will not be able to take advantage of the new industries which as a policy Fianna Fáil have <Col N="1245" /> brought in from abroad.  We have beaten the best in Europe to the punch in this respect.  We have pursued a policy of educating our children specifically for participation in these new industries through the opening of the NIHE in Limerick and another in Dublin.  This educational system will gear our young people to take advantage of industries coming in.</P>
    <P>It is only with such cohesive Government policies that we can overcome our difficulties and gear our young people for the jobs that are to come, and it is only with Fianna Fáil continuity that all our people will benefit.  Continuity of policy is the channel through which Finance Bills can reach out to every parish in the land.  Without it we will be back to the divided, floundering and day-to-day policies of the Coalition.  I am proud to be associated with this Bill and to have been given the opportunity to make my contribution to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the years, since the foundation of the State until a short time ago, the annual budget was regarded as the housekeeping preparation for the coming year.  It was usual for Governments, Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna Fáil, Coalitions, and again Fianna Fáil &mdash;Fianna Fáil most often &mdash; to attempt to balance income with expenditure through taxation, and occasionally, if expenditure exceeded income, to make arrangements to borrow.  Occasionally, as in the Second World War Supplementary Estimates for sizeable sums had to be introduced.  However, the big change in this procedure began with the return of Fianna Fáil in 1977 after they had promised everything to everybody, all things to all men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result was that when Fianna Fáil got back to power they found that their promises had created an almost impossible problem for them and then we saw developing a new arrangement by which supplementary budgets became the order of the day, one day after another. Because of that, the national budget at the beginning of the year now has become something of a national joke.  This supplementary budget ploy has been getting <Col N="1246" /> them deeper and deeper into difficulty until we have reached the stage when we are not having an annual budget or a budget every few months but one every day.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of January last and right up to budget day, every day saw the announcement of price increases of one sort or another and before the ink on this year's budget was dry and the echo of the Minister's speech had died away, increases in prices began again.  Still, we have heard Fianna Fáil backbenchers saying they are happy to be associated with the budget.  That is a sick joke because nobody but a fool would want to be associated with the running of the Government at the moment.</P>
    <P>In the past three years, despite what was said last night by Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; that the Government had been making arrangements consistently to improve the economy &mdash; we have found them, for instance, making decisions which they found to be unpopular and the following day reversing them. That has led to a situation in which it is now impossible to know what exactly is the Government's policy on any one thing.  They have been changing from one day to the other.</P>
    <P>It was amusing to listen to Deputy Fox condemning the work of the Coalition's Minister for Agriculture.  In my opinion he was the best Minister for Agriculture, though not a member of my party, we have had.  He succeeded in sealing up a number of mistakes made by his predecessor. Unfortunately his successor has made a mess of it again.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I have doubts whether Fianna Fáil are living in an entirely different world from the rest of us.  With a general election imminent, of coure, one cannot blame them for trying to put a bold face on things, but to hear them say they have made a success of the running of the country is too ridiculous for words. They say that increases in the cost of various items have not been of the Government's making, that the Government do not gain by them.  I should like to kill that straight away because when there are increases in prices the Government of the Exchequer gain by VAT which <Col N="1247" /> also increases.  When increased prices arise the VAT goes up automatically and this is true particularly of petrol.</P>
    <P>On top of all this the Government took subsidies off food and then allowed VAT to apply to food.  We can remember the time when the Government abolished the wealth tax on what are described as the filthy rich, the people with enormous amounts of money who do not know how the rest of the people live, those to whom hundreds of thousands of pounds mean nothing.  They were freed from wealth tax but in the same week the poor were made to suffer because of the abolition of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>This is the Government we have had for almost four years but who are due for the high jump, if they do not shy away from it like a horse coming up to Beecher's Brook and which, finding himself unable to get over it, refuses and shies away.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether Deputy Fox was saying that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign is a success or that it should be a success.  My opinion is that it is essential, if the country is to survive, that we all buy the goods we are producing, and that includes agricultural produce which is part and parcel of the Irish economy.  The terrible tragedy at the moment is that 85 per cent of the goods we buy in our shops throughout the country are imported.  Most of those goods are imported from or through England; there is a small percentage imported from the Continent.  No effort is made by the Government, the importers, wholesalers, retailers or the general public to attempt to sell Irish.  We must make an effort to sell Irish.  I have constantly complained in the House of the difficulty I have found when I tried to buy clothing or shoes which are made here. Irish goods have to be specifically asked for and even then you will still be offered foreign goods and told that they are of better quality.  It is the national attitude which will have to be changed.  Despite all the waving of green flags by Fianna Fáil, they do not give two damns about this country.  They think that if they are in power everything must be all right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1248" /> Let me give you one instance where even the EEC cannot be blamed for imports.  In 1975 furniture imported into this country from the eastern European countries &mdash; USSR, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania &mdash; amounted to just over £195,000.  In 1980 the figure is £1,143,000.  Is there any reason why some effort should not be made to try to stop importation of furniture from the Eastern block which is putting men and women in the furniture industry here out of a job?  Is there any reason except carelessness and downright laziness on the part of the Minister who could not care less?  In my constituency Navan has been recognised as the home of furniture manufacturing.  It is really too bad when this sort of thing happens without a comment or complaint from the Minister or the Government who are allowing it to happen.  Unless an effort is made to encourage in every way, even by including taxation where possible, the use of Irish goods, we are going to remain in the position in which we are at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox made reference to the importation of potatoes from Northern Ireland.  He seemed to think it was terrible to be importing from the North.  I always thought Fianna Fáil believed we were one country.  However, there is double thinking on this.  They think it is wrong to import potatoes from the North but it is not wrong to import bricks from the North.  Every day as I travel on the Dublin-Belfast road I pass lorries filled with Tyrone bricks to be used in the manufacture of houses in and around Dublin city while our own brick factories are closing down.  According to Deputy Fox, potatoes are different.  As long as we have potatoes from Cyprus and Israel, carrots from the USA, cauliflowers and cabbage from somewhere else imported in bulk and packed here &mdash; I made this statement before and the Minister was inclined to deny it, I have since double checked and find it is true &mdash; in Foras Talúntais buildings, in bags marked &ldquo;Packed by An Foras Talúntais&rdquo;, it is not surprising that people do not know they are buying foreign goods.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the fault is with those who <Col N="1249" /> prepare Irish goods for sale.  Perhaps it is because people do not go to the trouble of taking clay off potatoes.  We can buy clean foreign potatoes and we do not have to pay for a pound of clay in every stone.  Irish agriculture, like Irish horticulture and fruit growing, is suffering badly because of bad marketing and because we seem to encourage the purchase and sale of foreign imports.  This must stop.  It is a national malaise.  We had recently the importation of carpets and materials from foreign countries.  Two or three days ago RTE tried to explain why they imported carpet tiles for their new building in Montrose.  They said the type of carpet made here would not suit because they needed to put connections into electrical fittings on the floor and they had to have tiles which could be easily removed.  They said Irish carpet manufacturers did not make tiles.  Is it beyond the ingenuity of people in RTE who look after the floor covering to make the necessary arrangements to use Irish materials?  The architect who suggested that these tiles should be imported and used should be censured because he is as much to blame as RTE.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works has just left the House because I would like to remind him of his boob with regard to floor coverings in national schools here.  Imagine the Office of Public Works going to a school in which the children have received a brochure with a photograph on the front advising them to influence everyone they could to buy Irish because their future jobs would depend on the amount of Irish goods bought and sold here.  Then, when a new school was completed, the floor covering was bought in France.  This is hyprocisy.  It proves that, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they could not care less whether we buy Irish or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When Irish Life attempted to do the same thing, we did not allow them to do so; but we have guts and <Col N="1250" /> Fianna Fáil have none.  They were afraid to cross either the Office of Public Works or RTE.  Why did we introduce Frank Hall?  RTE should have a programme which would lampoon the present Government as we were lampooned.  He was told that the Government did not like that sort of thing.  They can laugh at others but not at themselves.  Everybody now knows the chancers we have, who in 1977 claimed they were going to make everything lovely in the garden.  In 1981, having made a mess of everything, they are claiming they have improved things. Long ago King Midas was supposed to have a gift, which backfired on him, of turning everything to gold, King Charles has a different gift.  Everything he touches has turned to ashes.  Everywhere we look we see the same thing happening again and again.  Everything is falling flat on its face because the Government do not seem to understand anything.  There are some very competent Ministers in the Government who are doing the best they can with the little they are getting.  But there are a lot of people in the Government who have not the foggiest notion of how to run the country.  That is partly the cause of all our troubles.</P>
      <P>I want to point out two things to the Minister for the Environment.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they said that if they got into office they would increase the number of reconstruction, water and sewerage grants.  For a few months they did and then they wiped them out completely.  Is the Minister aware that at the moment anyone who wants a connection to a water scheme, irrespective of family conditions, whether an unemployed labourer or a wealthy businessman, now gets no grant as they did under previous Governments. Now they have to pay up to £125 for the privilege of being connected to water mains and if that connection has to cross a road they must pay an extra £20.  Is the Minister really serious if he thinks that a Government who have on their census form queries about the type of water supply to each house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must now accept responsibility for what has happened since Fianna Fáil took office even though he was not at the outset a Minister. The money local authorities are allowed to raise is insufficient to keep their staffs going or do the works they should do and so they must raise some money in some way.  That is the explanation for the £125 for connection plus an additional £20 for crossing the road.</P>
      <P>In 1976 I introduced a low rise mortgage scheme to allow those in poorer circumstances to purchase their houses. They were subsidised for ten years.  This year some local authorities find they cannot continue that scheme particularly in the case of their own tenants who wish to buy out their houses.  Three weeks ago I asked the Minister if he was aware of that.  His reply was that he was not aware of it but he would write to me about it. Apparently he did not have time to write in the interval.  He had to go down to Meath and tell the people there how well the Minister for Education, Deputy John Wilson is doing for the schools down there.  I got no letter.  Perhaps the Minister when he comes to speak, if he does speak, will tell us that it was the tightening of the belt he talked about which has led to doing away with the low rise mortgage scheme for certain categories.  Perhaps the intention is to do away with it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a comment the other day to the effect that the Fianna Fáil Government had flown a kite.  It was not the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this occasion.  It <Col N="1252" /> was someone else.  The kite was to the effect that Fianna Fáil would increase the amount of money to anyone buying a new house from £1,000 to £4,000 and the Minister of State said it was not so now. Did he mean to promise it if there was an election this year?  So far this is the most promising Government the country has ever had.  The promise every damn thing under the sun so long as payment does not fall due before the next general election.</P>
    <P>In half an hour it is not possible to cover everything that should be covered but I would like to point out that the Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson, has been promising wonderful things and sanctioning schools here, there and everywhere. Sanction is, of course, no use unless the money is available to build the school.  Remembering that the Department of Education, through the Office of Public Works, have not found it possible to reimburse local managers money spent by them on, for instance, prefabs &mdash; prefabs they were forced to use in order to accommodate certain children last September &mdash; surely the Minister's statement here that he was embarrased by the amount of money given to him for schools sounds, to say the least of it, a little odd.  Perhaps I took him up wrongly.  Perhaps he was talking about the lack of money and the insufficiency of what he got.  That would certainly have embarrased him.</P>
    <P>He has stated on numerous occasions he was going to do this, that and the other.  Half of my correspondence at the moment is coming from people who want to know if I can find out for them what the possibility is of their being able to find places for their children in secondary schools next September.  As the Minister knows very well, thousands of children will be leaving primary school in September for whom there will be no places at all in secondary schools.  I tabled a very comprehensive series of questions some time ago about schools and I was given particulars of comprehensive, technical and secondary schools all over the place. It was obvious to me that the person who drew up those replies may have known a great deal about geography but did not <Col N="1253" /> know anything about the areas to which children have to travel to and from school.  At the same time we have the Minister talking like a big child about being embarrassed by the amount of money he got and telling everybody he is going to build schools here, there and somewhere else.  Let us have some hard facts now.  Let us see the schools being built.  Let us have the money available for the building of schools.  If it is not going to be made available then let us know that in time because people will have to do something else about it.</P>
    <P>Housing has been discussed here on numerous occasions.  Last year the number of local authority houses erected showed a big reduction on the previous year, but nothing like the reduction that will occur this year.  Neatly sown into budgetary figures is the fact that there is in real terms a very substantial reduction in the amount of subsidy allowed for local authority houses this year.  That means houses cannot be built.  The proof is in the number of houses started and the pace at which they are built.  I am appalled at the position which has occurred in relation to SDA loans.  Up to the end of December 1980 local authorities had been promised £5.7 million for SDA loans for new houses, secondhand houses and house repairs.  This year they are promised £3.4 million to be paid in monthly instalments.  I wonder if the Minister is aware that some local authorities say that, (a), they have got no money whatever for local authority houses so far this year and, (b), that they have got no money for SDA loans this year?  Is the Minister aware that people who want to build houses are now being told by local authorities that they have not got the money and that they cannot even tell people that they will have the money this time next year because they know that that money is not available and will not be available to them?</P>

      <P>It is not wrong and I can produce to the Minister letters to that effect if he wants them.  We heard a lot of talk about social welfare the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> I was very disappointed to hear Deputy Woods, Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare, say on the radio the other day something which I consider to be untrue.  A Minister should not make a statement unless it is the truth.  He stated that the position had improved in regard to the payment of social welfare benefits.  He said that the number of complaints was now very small and that he would know because every TD makes the complaints through his office.  I do not and I am sure I make more complaints than any Deputy in this House.  I notice that the play which was adopted by some of our people here has now been adopted by some of the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil where they have to put questions down on the Order Paper to find out why somebody entitled to social welfare benefits has not been paid.  It is a sign of the times.  I am not blaming the officials. They have neither the facilities nor the money.  They have been forced to adopt a system which has upset the whole payment of social welfare benefits.  Maybe there is a reason for it and I think I know what it is.  The money is not being paid and people are starving.  It is all right for the Minister for Social Welfare to say that they can go to the local authority which will give them home help.  Some of the health authorities told me that because they were so badly treated by the Government last year through forcing people to go to them because they did not get paid, they had expended so much of their money that this year it will require an enormous amount of money to cover all the items which they want covered.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Would somebody be able to tell me how much money is owed to the State by employers who have failed to stamp unemployment cards or pay RSI or PAYE tax over the years? Why have these people not been forced to pay?  I have in my possession a document which shows that one fairly small firm alone owed over £1 million.  The late Seán Dunne, who was a colleague of mine here for many years, used to say that the reason nothing was done about it was that the firm concerned was &ldquo;a friend of the corpse&rdquo;.  Two members of <Col N="1255" /> Fianna Fáil are on the board of that firm. It is outrageous that we should have such situation continuing.</P>

      <P>Let me again remind the House that last October in my very early days as Minister for the Environment, I gave my personal commitment, and that of the Government, to ensuring the future development and well-being of the building and construction industry, to ensuring a high level of house completions <Col N="1256" /> and an expanded programme of infrastructural services.</P>
      <P>The undertakings given by me in October last have been honoured by appropriate resource allocation as provided for in the investment plan and in the budget. Capital monies on a scale unprecedented have been provided for 1981 for roads, sanitary services and the building and construction industry.  I am confident that the massive increase in resources now made and proposed for the future will provide the necessary infrastructural base to meet the needs and challenges of the eighties.  In addition it will build up the necessary confidence to stimulate economic development, tourism and agriculture.  I welcome the positive approach expressed by varying organisations to the Government's vastly expanded capital programme.  I will now deal separately with some of the main services for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>When I spoke in the budget debate I said that, for the building industry, the budget was a good budget.  It was a good one because it provided a very substantial increase in public capital investment in the industry in 1981 and new incentives for private capital investment.  In addition it brought with it a lift-off in terms of new work, more employment, greater investment and a return to confidence and a preception of the end of recession. The building industry is now about to move into top gear with increased growth and employment right across the whole building spectrum and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's strategy for the industry laid down in the investment plan is based on confidence and a realistic balance between the country's needs and aspirations.  With the fastest growing young population in western Europe and an economy with equal potential the building industry has both a formidable task and an encouragingly bright future ahead of it.  Its task is to provide the necessary infrastructure for our future development while at the same time making one of the most substantial contributions to current employment.  It is for these reasons that the Government put together their investment plan package <Col N="1257" /> for 1981 providing greatly increased capital investment in all the major areas of infrastructure including energy, telecommunications, roads, sanitary services and housing.  Both output and direct employment in the building industry in 1981 will increase relative to 1980.  In addition, extra jobs will be generated in the building materials manufacturing and supply services.  As I said, the main generator of this growth is the increased capital provisions announced in the investment plan and provided for in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>Turning to housing, which is the most important sector of the building industry, Deputies will be aware that the record in housing completions in recent years has been good.  Housing completions have increased steadily from the 24,000 completed in 1976 to 27,785 last year, the highest number of annual completions ever.  The Government commitment to housing is reflected once again in 1981 by the public capital programme allocations to this sector which amount to £242.4 million, compared to the provisional out-turns of £159 million in 1979 and £201 million last year.  In order to eliminate any doubt about our housing achievements, I would like to quote some international comparisons which show that we have a record in this area of which as a small nation, we can be justifiably proud:</P>
    <P>&mdash;In 1979, we shared with France the record of having the highest number of houses completed per 1,000 of the population in the EEC; in 1975 the last period of Coalition we had the lowest rate.  I have no doubt but that we will also fare well when the 1980 figures are published.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Also in 1979, capital formation in housing expressed as a percentage of gross national product at 7.3 per cent was the highest rate in western European countries for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Government's commitment to the encouragement of owner-occupation is reflected in the fact that our rate of owner-occupation at 75 per cent is probably the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government are not, however, concerned <Col N="1258" /> simply with housing numbers for the country as a whole.  Our aim is to have a sufficient number of houses provided in the right place at the right time and at a price or rent designed to meet established housing needs.  It was for this reason that local authorities were asked in early 1980 to carry out assessments of the nature and extent of accumulated housing needs in their areas and of prospective needs expected to arise up to 1985.  This exercise, which is currently being finalised by the authorities, has been the most detailed and sophisticated ever attempted and involved the authorities in a comprehensive survey of some 25,000 houses.  Internationally accepted techniques of assessing housing need have been used and authorities are availing of a wide range of data from the 1979. Census along with information contained on applications for rehousing from their waiting lists and from results of inspections and surveys carried out by their officers together with local knowledge and experience.  I am satisfied that the assessments when analysed by my Department will form a good basis for identifying the areas of housing where directional changes in policy may need to be considered and for the determination of an overall national housing strategy into the eighties by the Government.</P>
    <P>One specific area of housing is deal with in sections 21 and 22 of the Finance Bill.  The Government have decided to make available a special tax allowance of 100 per cent of expenditure on development and construction incurred after budget day and before 1 April 1984 or the provision of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation and on certain conversions of existing buildings into two or more residential units.  The new allowances will be set against rental income in computing tax liability.  This is an important initiative by the Government because a need for moderate cost rented housing accommodation does exist and is not being fulfilled at present. I am sure that the new concessions will provide the necessary incentive to the private investment sector to become involved in the provision of rented housing accommodation to meet this existing <Col N="1259" /> need.  I look forward, therefore, to a positive and quick response from the private sector to the new concession.</P>
    <P>The provision of mortgage finance is of major importance and, in this context, I am particularly conscious of the importance of the local authority house purchase loan scheme in providing finance for those categories of persons who are not catered for by the commercial lending agencies.  Since resuming office in 1977, the Government have kept the loan and income limits at sufficiently realistic levels to enable the categories of persons for whom the scheme was designed to continue to benefit from it.  In January 1980 the loan and income limits were increased to £12,000 and £5,500 respectively.  The upsurge in demand which followed on these increases was unprecedentedly high and, while gratifying, made the financing of the scheme a major burden on scarce capital resources.  In spite of the many competing claims on the limited capital available, an additional allocation of £7 million was provided in 1980 to enable authorities to advance 7,309 loans to the value of £65 million.</P>
    <P>Demand for payment of loans under the scheme continues at a very high level and I am pleased to point to the record sum of £96 million which has been provided to meet demands for house purchase and improvement loans and supplementary grants which will arise in 1981.  This compares with expenditure of just under £20 million in 1977, the last year of the Coalition Government.  I have already notified authorities of the amounts available to them for expenditure on the scheme this year and I am confident that it will be sufficient to enable them to meet their commitments without undue delay.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the loan and income limits which govern the local authority housing loan scheme will be kept under continuing review to ensure that they remain at a realistic level.</P>
    <P>Building societies play a major role in the financing of the Government's private housing programme.  Almost 75 per cent of all private housing finance is provided by building societies.  Societies <Col N="1260" /> advanced 16,944 house purchase loans to the value of £269 million in 1980, providing mortgage finance amounting to £126 million in respect of 7,807 new houses and £143 million in respect of 9,137 others. I am pleased to draw attention to the fact that the Government's decision to make an interest subsidy available to societies with effect from 1 June 1980 was a major factor in attracting the inflow to societies which made this possible.  I expect that societies will make in excess of £300 million available towards financing the Government's private housing programme in 1981.</P>
    <P>On the local authority house building side, it has been this Government's policy to maintain a stable programme of about 6,000 completions each year.  Despite the financial difficulties which have beset the programme in recent years because of ever increasing costs, the Government have nevertheless managed to exceed this target each year since 1977, including 1980.  In order to achieve such a target, the level of work in progress must be maintained at a monthly level of at least 8,000 and I am glad to note that at the end of January the number of units in progress was 8,375, so that the programme is running at a satisfactory level at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the valuable contribution which the local authority housing programme is making in the area of employment.  At the end of December 1980 a total of 7,069 were engaged on the programme, compared with 6,769 for the corresponding month in 1979.  The average monthly employment throughout the year of 6,870 was the highest for recent years.  Taking the overall view, this Government have achieved an impressive record in providing local authority housing. The fact that the Government's target has been consistently achieved must be looked on as a manifestation of the Government's determination to honour its commitments to those in need of housing.</P>
    <P>The provision and maintenance of an adequate road network is one of my top priorities as Minister for the Environment. In Ireland, the road network is the infrastructural base on which depends, to <Col N="1261" /> a great extent, the prosperity of agriculture, industry, commerce and tourism. Our geographical position as an island on the periphery of Europe, together with our low density of population, has placed us in the position of being more dependent on the road network for physical communication and movement than any of our European neighbours.  The accelerated increase in the numbers of motor vehicles as a consequence of our economic and social development has highlighted the deficiencies of the road network. In particular, the early years of the last decade saw the growth in road transport imposing a heavy burden on the road network.  In consequence, strategic sections of principal roads seriously deteriorated and traffic congestion has become an everyday feature in a number of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The situation that had been developing at this critical period of our economic growth called for a reappraisal of our system of planning for road development. The Government, immediately on assuming office, set to the task of preparing a co-ordinated plan, involving a much larger scale of investment, to bring the network, particularly the principal routes, to a standard capable of meeting present and future needs.</P>
    <P>The Road Development Plan for the eighties, which was published in 1979, was an unprecedented step forward in road planning in Ireland.  The programme of works outlined in the plan is based on analyses of deficiencies identified in the system by studies carried out by An Foras Forbartha and by land-use, transportation and traffic studies carried out in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and several other urban areas, and also by the development plans of the local authorities and regional development organisations.  The programme has been generally accepted, not only by road authorities but also by commercial and transport interests, as a balanced and realistic one.</P>
    <P>The Government's objectives for the development of the road network as outlined in the road development plan, can be summarised as follows: the preservation of the overall network up to a satisfactory <Col N="1262" /> standard; the provision of an adequate strategic inter-urban road system connecting the principal towns, seaports and airports; the adoption of a minimum two-lane standard for the national route network, without prejudice to the necessity for higher standards for particular sections of that network; the provision of by-passes of towns on the national routes where these are considered necessary on planning, traffic or environmental grounds; a special programme to meet the need for new river crossings, ring roads and relief routes in the county boroughs and other major urban centres.</P>
    <P>The major road network is identified in the investment plan as deserving of considerably increased investment this year, along the lines proposed in the road development plan.  I am very pleased to have been able, in my first year as Minister with responsibility, to provide a massive £80 million in road grant expenditure this year for road improvement and maintenance works.</P>
    <P>On foot of this provision of £80 million I have been enabled to allocate grants to road authorities this year totalling over £87 million, of which £67 million has been allocated for improvement works and £20 million for maintenance.  This represents an increase of 49 per cent on the road grants allocated last year and of a staggering 227 per cent on the level of grants which were provided by the previous Government in 1977.  This level of finance, unprecedented in the history of the State, should leave no doubt in anyone's mind regarding the Government's and my determination to bring the standard of the road network into line with the demands of modern transportation needs.</P>
    <P>I have allocated over £31 million for major improvement works which are listed in the Road Development Plan.  In the Dublin region these schemes include a new road from Whitehall to the Airport; by-passes of Swords and Balbriggan; a new road linking Clontarf Road with the East Wall Road: a new bridge adjacent to Heuston Bridge and a by-pass at Palmerstown on the road westwards.</P>
    <P>In Cork City I have allocated grants for three new bridges over the Lee and a <Col N="1263" /> new ring road as recommended in the Cork Land Use Transportation Study.  I have also made grants available for ring roads in Limerick, new bridges in Waterford, Athlone and Galway and inner relief roads or ring roads in Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Tralee and Clonmel.  Other major projects outside the main urban areas include the Naas by-pass; new Cork-Mallow road; new road through the Curragh; and ring roads or by-passes at Mullingar, Navan, Carrick-on-Shannon, Dunleer, Collooney, Ballinasloe, Oranmore, Roscrea, Donegal, Midleton and Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>While the major works are, of course, the most dramatic element of the Road Development Plan, the plan also provides for a continuous year by year programme geared towards the essential development of the existing road lines including realignments, strengthening, widening, eradication of accident black spots and provision of hard shoulders.  I have allocated grants of over £21 million for such works in 1981.  I have also provided substantial grants to road authorities to supplement their own resources and also grants for special works, including bridge works, on roads other than national routes.  The need for strengthening and renewal of critical sections of the principal roads has not been overlooked and the grant allocations I have made provide for expenditure of over £6 million for a special programme for such works.</P>
    <P>The 1981 grants programme is, by any standards, an ambitious one.  The provision of major road improvements is not always easy and is never cheap.  Preliminary results of a special progress report undertaken by my Department on the major works programme for 1981 are encouraging and I am confident that the end of the year will see a major advance towards the development of a road network adequate for the eighties and beyond.  I am also aware of the valuable supplementary benefits to be derived from a full roads programme in that it creates activity in the construction industry, generates employment both on-site and off-site and utilises materials and <Col N="1264" /> equipment of Irish manufacture.  I expect that up to 11,500 road workers will be employed directly on the 1981 works programme which will represent an increase of over 600 on the corresponding figure for 1980.</P>
    <P>Apart from the country's public road network there is a considerable mileage of non-public accommodation roads which are of particular importance to the agricultural community.  Grants under the local improvements scheme cater primarily for the improvement of these roads.  I am pleased to say that the total provision for the local improvements scheme for 1981 is £2,714,000 which represents an increase of almost 36 per cent on the 1980 allocation.  The scheme is of particular benefit to the western counties and provides valuable seasonal employment in the rural areas.  This year it is expected that works undertaken by country councils under the local improvements scheme will provide the equivalent of 300 man-year jobs.  This year also a proportion of the expenditure in the western counties under the local improvements scheme as well as on selected county roads in these areas will benefit from EEC aid under the western package.</P>
    <P>Interest has been displayed by the private sector in the financing of road and bridge projects.  The Local Government Toll (Roads) Act, 1979, was specially enacted to facilitate private sector participation in such projects.  There is a firm proposal to provide a toll bridge over the River Liffey, the cost of which will be privately financed.  Public inquiries have been held into a toll scheme, which has been made by Dublin Corporation, and a bridge order application made by Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I will consider the report on these inquiries and give my decision on them without delay.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 24 of the Finance Bill are designed to provide certain tax incentives to encourage private sector participation in the provision of toll roads and bridges and multi-storey car parks.  Discussions have already taken place with private sector interests with regard to participation in such projects and interest has already been expressed in relation to <Col N="1265" /> the construction of multi-storey car parks in Dublin and Cork.  I am confident that the tax incentives provided under the Finance Bill will encourage the provision by the private sector of much-needed necessary additional facilities in this area.</P>
    <P>The existence of adequate water and sewerage services is essential to the development of any area and to the protection and improvement of its amenities. Such services provide the essential infrastructural base on which a number of other programmes such as industry, housing, agriculture and tourism must be based. They are a necessary pre-condition for the whole process of economic development at national and local level.  It is vitally important, therefore, that we have the necessary sanitary services schemes available to take advantage of the future improvement in the climate for productive investment.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House of the Government's and my personal commitment to making the necessary allocations, both now and in the future, in order to provide services on the scale required to meet future needs.  Our record in the past is of course impressive.  Between 1977 and 1980 alone the Government almost doubled the overall public capital programme provision for public water and sewerage schemes &mdash; from less than £25 million in 1977 to almost £47 million in 1980.  I am especially pleased to have been able, just as I have done for roads, to make provision for very substantially increased funds for 1981 &mdash; a total of some £67.3 million for public schemes for 1981 compared with the £47 million for 1980.  This represents an increase of some £20 million or 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>These extra funds have enabled me to approve contract documents for 45 new major public water and sewerage schemes with the estimated total value of about £27 million.  Local authorities undertaking these schemes are now free to invite tenders and financing will be arranged in due course.  Work and direct employment on most of these schemes will commence during the current year. Schemes released for commencement include: Mid-Galway water supply scheme; Kerry central regional water <Col N="1266" /> supply scheme &mdash; Contract 1; Tallaght water distribution network, Dublin; high level water supply improvements, Cork city; Bally bay/Lough Egish water supply scheme, County Monaghan &mdash; Stage 1; and Lettermacaward water supply scheme, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am also proud of the fact that, since 1977, the cost limit for small public water and sewerage schemes has been increased from £20,000 to £30,000; and that the overall capital provision for small schemes has been increased more than fourfold &mdash; from about £1 million in 1977 to £4.5 million in 1981.  Many extensions-improvements can be financed under the small schemes programme to meet urgent needs arising, pending the execution of major schemes. The programme also plays a positive and important role in helping to maintain direct labour force employment by sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the happiest and most satisfying features of rural life in this country has been the tremendous upsurge in recent years in the number of private group water schemes undertaken by local communities with generous grant assistance from the Government.  The Government substantially increased grants for group water schemes commenced on or after 1 November 1977 from a maximum of £200 per house to a maximum of £300 per house.  An additional grant of up to £200 is payable per farmer member of the group.</P>
    <P>The Government also took over liability for supplementary grants formerly payable by local authorities, thereby releasing ratepayers from the financial liability involved.  As a result of these measures, State expenditure on group scheme grants increased from £1.1 million in 1976 to £4 million in 1980, and group scheme installation increased each year from 7,930 in 1977 to over 10,000 per year in the years 1978 to 1980.  At the end of 1980, nearly 3,000 schemes had been completed and approximately 88,700 houses and over 70,000 farms had obtained water from group schemes.  In addition, work was in progress on the installation of water in another 8,000 houses and over 220 schemes had been <Col N="1267" /> designed to serve a further 7,100 houses approximately.</P>
    <P>My colleague Deputy MacSharry, Minister for Agriculture, has recently announced that the Government's programme for the development of agriculture in the west of Ireland has been cleared by the EEC Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures.  I will shortly be in a position to announce details of grants for rural water schemes in the west, 50 per cent of the cost of which will be recouped by the European Agricultural Guidance and Gurantee Fund, FEOGA.  At this stage, I can indicate that my announcement will include details of new capital grants for rural public water schemes, and greatly increased grants for private group water schemes.  I have no doubt that this grant assistance will give a considerable boost to the rural water supply programme in the west, and ensure substantial progress to our ultimate goal of a rural water supply in every house and farm in the country.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1978 over 950,000 ratepayers have been fully relieved of the burden of rates.  These properties include domestic dwellings, secondary schools, farm out-buildings and community centres.  These reliefs are substantial. Were it not for our decision to remove rates on houses, a modest house with £20 valuation would, in 1981, attract a rates burden of £285 in County Wicklow, £273 in North Tipperary, £296 in County Galway, £391 in County Mayo, £277 in County Cavan and £238 in County Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The farming sector has not been forgotten either.  This year, rate reliefs to farmers have been increased to an unprecedented level.  Up to now only farmers with land valuations of £20 or less got full relief of rates.  This year farmers up to £50 valuation are relieved of all rates on land.  This means that a further 80,750 holdings, those with valuations between £20 and £50, will be fully derated for the first time.  Farmers with land valuations between £50 and £70 now pay only half the rates on their land valuations. Farmers in urban areas will be <Col N="1268" /> entitled to the same rates reliefs as apply in county council areas.  These are worthwhile reliefs for the farming sector.  These relief measures for land alone, will represent a subsidy of some £62 million to ratepayers in 1981.</P>
    <P>In addition farmers, of course, continue to benefit from rates relief on their dwellings and on farm out-buildings which we brought in with effect from 1 January 1978.  The guidelines which have applied to local rate increases over the past few years have ensured that the business community and others who remain liable for rates have not had to suffer as a result of the changes in local finance.</P>
    <P>The contribution which the building and construction industry and road and sanitary service works must make to our economy is immense if we are properly to develop industry, tourism and agriculture in order to meet in the eighties the aspirations of our very young, growing and well educated population.  The provisions made in the budget and the Finance Bill are designed to ensure that the potential for expansion of these critical services is fully realised.  I am confident that the measures taken in the areas for which I am responsible will be a key factor in the future expansion and well being of our economy.</P>
    <P>I would also like again to assure the House of the future continued well being of the building and construction industry under the Government.  The industry can feel secure in the knowledge that in a time of difficulty my colleagues and I as a Government act, as we did last autumn by providing the necessary additional funds to stimulate the industry at a time when it was showing signs of slowing down; as we have now done by providing vastly increased capital allocations to create the necessary confidence to boost the economy.  I am glad to note that these decisions are already beginning to bear fruit.  Regretably, the lesson to be learned from the past experience is that the building and construction industry can feel no such security under the Opposition when in Government.  My colleagues in Government and I will in 1982 again provide the necessary capital to continue to finance the vastly expanded programmes <Col N="1269" /> now under way&mdash;and let there be no doubts about it we will be here throughout 1982 fully committed to seeing to finality the vastly expanded programmes now being carried out, especially in the areas of building and construction, including roads and sanitary services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker referred in detail to the Government's housing policy and to the fact that the record of the last Government in building 125,000 houses each year was a good, solid record.  I am glad that this Government have kept up that record although I am concerned about the number of council houses being built.  In 1976, 7,236 council houses were built by the Coalition Government and each year since then under this Government the number of local authority houses completed has continued to fall until in 1979, 6,214 council houses were completed.  That is a very serious matter to which the Minister did not address himself in detail apart from saying in his script that it was the Government's policy to maintain a stable programme of 6,000 completions each year in the local authority house building programme.  That is totally inadequate and the direction of the Government's house building programme has gone out of plumb.  This is because of the growth in population and the increasing number of people who cannot afford to buy houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the elimination of rates from private housing but he did not refer to the rapid increases in the price of new houses in the private sector. The Minister ignored this aspect because he knows that the increase in the cost of an ordinary house has jumped by one-third in the last three years.  That is a disgraceful record for a Government supposedly committed to controlling the economy.  One of the most important elements in the control of the economy relates to the control of prices for essential services and products, such as food, housing and clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No attempt has been made to control house prices.  I reject the policy of completing only 6,000 local authority houses a year as it is totally inadequate.  If the <Col N="1270" /> Minister looks at the list of approved applicants for houses in any county council or corporation he will be quickly made aware of the situation.  The length of the lists would indicate to any sane person that there is an urgent need to increase the number of local authority house completions per year to about 8,000 or 9,000. This Government are reluctant to do this and they are avoiding the real social issue which is the need to cater for the requirements of the less well off.</P>
    <P>In my local authority the rapid drop in the number of house completions by the local authorities in the last four years is causing serious concern.  Once again families are living in bad flats, substandard housing and in over-crowded conditions. I know of cases where people with TB are actually living in the house and that was unheard of three or four years ago. This is because of the failure of this Government to tackle this problem.  We have an emergency housing problem, perhaps not in the private sector but certainly in the public sector.  There must be a crisis situation in Dublin city.  The situation should be declared an emergency situation and it should not need me to remind the Minister of his neglect.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Department of the Environment about which the Minister spoke, the rate limitation on local authorities as practised by this Government is strangling local authorities.  On average local authorities are getting funds equivalent to about two-thirds the increase in the rate of inflation.  Most wise local authorities had a credit balance which they needed in order to make capital acquisitions such as site purchases for housing estates, for forward planning for schools and churches and so on.  These credit balances have been done away with.  There is no cushion for local authorities now to ensure that the essential development services can be catered for. This will mean that certain local authorities badly in need of rapid expansion will be strangled because of a lack of finance. There is a need to identify certain local authorities such as Waterford where the boundary has increased to four times its original size since 1 January 1980.  Here <Col N="1271" /> a new high level bridge is required and not the present replacement bridge; ring roads are required and the East Waterford Regional Water Scheme is vital to the development of the whole city.  Those needs will not be catered for under the present system of local authority finance, by the present limitation on rates.  For instance, the rebuilding of the courthouse costing in excess of £1 million will fall on the local rating authority.</P>
    <P>However, that kind of money is not available to the local authority because of the strangling policies of the Government. Things will grind to a halt.  Roads will not be resurfaced, houses will not be repaired and there will be serious redundancies in local authorities.  There will be redundancies throughout the country this year because of the limitation in the increase in rates that local authorities were allowed.  In Waterford city there was a special gang to deal with repairs to O'Meara estate.  We should have liked to have kept those people to deal with repairs throughout the city but, unfortunately, we had to let them go.  This was due to the short-sightedness of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the finances of this nation.  &ldquo;From Bad to Worse&rdquo; was the heading of an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 April.  That article stated the following:</P>
    <P>The shocking Exchequer deficit figures published yesterday must explode the credibility of the financial projections made by the Minister for Finance two months ago on Budget day.  Officially, the current Budget deficit for the whole of 1981 was to have been £515 million.  But in the first three months alone the deficit was £205 million, putting the public finances roughly on target for a deficit of over £800 million for the year.</P>
    <P>That is a shocking indictment of Government mismanagement, irresponsibility and incapability of dealing with the finances of the nation.  Since this Government took office their budget projections each year have been completely out of line.  In 1978 the budget deficit amounted <Col N="1272" /> to £810 million, or 12.9 per cent of GNP. In 1979 the budget was supposed to be £779 million, but it turned out to be £1,009 million.  In 1980 the commitment in the budget was for an overall deficit of £896 million but the outturn was £1,217 million, or 14.5 per cent of GNP.  This was 25 per cent in excess of the budget figures.  It appears that in 1981 there is the possibility of having an increase of 75 per cent in the planned budget deficit.</P>
    <P>This Government were elected in 1977 with a large majority.  They were supposed to be a strong Government, capable of getting the country moving again. The only things they have got moving in the past four years have been the larger dole queues and the queues for the emigration boats.  They also shifted their leader rather quickly.  Presumably he did not suit their strategy for the next election, but that is their business.</P>
    <P>The Government were given a mandate to get the country going, to use their own words.  It was expected they would manage the economy to ensure that budget deficits and the balance of payments were controlled and that inflation would be taken in hand.  According to their manifesto, employment would be practically eliminated and we were given to think that agriculture, industry and trade would flourish.  These expectations were put before the electorate at the last general election and they were the expectations of the electorate after the election.</P>
    <P>How sadly disappointed the electorate have been.  They are mesmerised by the figures released each day.  Last year the inflation rate was 21 per cent.  What a strong Government.  The figure for unemployment is 126,000; yet, the Minister present in this House, Deputy Nolan, tries to misinterpret the figure and is not prepared to allow for the necessary seasonal adjustment.  In the past few months he has been babbling on about how pleased he is to see a slowing down in the unemployment rate.  More than 126,000 people are unemployed but the Minister is pleased to note a slowing down in the rise in the unemployment figure.  That is great consolation to the <Col N="1273" /> man in the street who expected full employment from this Government.</P>
    <P>The lack of control over the finances of the country is quite disgraceful.  The Government should go to the country now with an apology to the people.  In the four years they have been in power they have made every mistake possible in the management of the economy.  The promises they made with regard to the economy have been broken and the people have been depressed at the way the Government have acted.  The people have been mesmerised by the internal bickerings in Fianna Fáil but they have also been extremely depressed by the workings of Fianna Fáil.  Every week sees a further rise in the inflation rate and this is frightening the workers, the old, the poor, the unemployed and the housewives.  Every week there is a budget of one kind or another whether it is gas, electricity, transport charges or price increases in food, clothing and footwear.  The policy of the Government has meant an enormous increase in prices.  I am sure they are quite pleased with their work.</P>
    <P>What about unemployment?  What about the talk of getting the country moving again, of getting industry to prosper and of getting full employment.  All these promises have been thrown out the window. Some 126,000 people are unemployed and over 25 per cent of them are less than 25 years of age.  The young people are totally disillusioned with the babblings of the Government.  We are a wonderful nation with many resources and if the country were managed properly we could achieve high prosperity in the context of a developing Europe. However, it needs the commitment of a Government to the long-term needs of the country.  That is the great failure of the Government.  Fianna Fáil have spent the future finances of this young country. Our children's money has already been misspent by this Government in the past four years, with no attempt whatever having been made to create an environment in which agriculture, industry and commerce could prosper.</P>
    <P>Where is the prosperity in agriculture now?  Commentators are contending that farmers are less well off than they were <Col N="1274" /> before we joined the EEC in 1973.  Last year alone approximately 20 per cent of our farmers' breeding stock was slaughtered or disposed of.  My reference here is the CBF Annual Report of 1980 which says, in relation to cattle numbers, that the breeding herd is now back to the 1972 level.  The beef cattle component of the herd is back to its December 1971 level. We are all also familiar with the fact that, on average, farmers' incomes over the past two years have fallen by a total of 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that we shall have a full debate on agriculture tomorrow evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring to agriculture as a component of the Government's mismanagement of the economy and I shall not dwell on it.  However, I feel bound to refer to it in passing and that is all I shall do.</P>
      <P>This Government have failed agriculture totally.  Their management of agricultural affairs stands in stark contrast with the good management of agricultural affairs under Deputy Clinton, when he was Minister for Agriculture in the last Government.  He went out, fought and won increases for our farmers.  We have had nothing but shilly-shallying on the part of the present Minister and his predecessor.  They have come home with bits and pieces from Brussels.  We are now getting only the crumbs from the tables in Brussels for our farmers.  There is no dynamic policy being pursued in Brussels by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to industry we all receive the Confederation of Irish Industry bulletins every week or so which make depressing reading&mdash;the continued lack of expectation of investment, lack of confidence in the economy, the serious drop in investment plans of companies throughout the country.  Of course that is a direct reflection of our rate of unemployment.  But industry and commerce were expecting more.  They cannot expect more of a government who are not prepared to ensure the control of the economy.  In their management of the economy, especially of their own finances, they have deprived <Col N="1275" /> the private sector of the requisite funds with which to expand and prosper.  It is the Government's mismanagement of their own affairs that has caused industry to become so disillusioned and unhappy. Time and again I have heard bankers and industrialists speak of the need for the Government to control their own expenditure.  Yet the Government continue to ignore the pleas, the reports they receive week in week out about the need to control their expenditure, and that is supposed to be a strong Fianna Fáil Government. The industrial and commercial sector will not prosper again until such time as the rate of inflation and the Government's finances are brought under control.  Certainly in the last four years there have been no signs that the Fianna Fáil Government are prepared to do either.  It is indeed sad that any government should act so irresponsibly, ignoring the real needs of the country.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit over the past few years, combined with the continuing serious budget deficit and with the consequent rapid growth of the national debt, now over £8,000 million, in the medium term will mean that we shall have to seek the support of the International Monetary Fund or the European Investment Bank on a large scale.  That, in turn, will mean that we will lose control of our economy, that we shall have to hand monetary and fiscal policy over to people who are not Irish. It will mean that we will have failed as a nation.  The Government are proceeding headlong in that direction, something which must be challenged in this House. It is obvious to me, and I think becoming daily more obvious to people generally, that this Government are unable to manage the finances of this nation.  An article by Paul Tansey in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 April highlighted our present serious borrowing position.  It was pointed out that our balance of payments deficit in 1981 is expected to be £1,300 million whereas in 1980 it was estimated to be £780.  In 1976 it was merely £157 million.  More important perhaps is the deficit on the balance of payments as a percentage of GNP which is estimated in 1981 to be in the <Col N="1276" /> region of 13.2 per cent.  These may be rather dry economic statistics to many people but they have very real financial implications for this country.  Speaking as an economist, it is sad to see all the vital statistics, all the vital economic indicators going the wrong way in such a rapid and continuous fashion.  I am speaking specifically about the balance of payments, the rate of inflation and the budget deficit, three key economic factors which will lead this country into serious financial trouble and for which the present Government must be held fully responsible.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer briefly to education in which sector there is also an emerging crisis.  I shall refer very briefly to the university situation in which in respect of the National University of Ireland alone there is a debt of approximately £6 million again indicating the serious financial plight of the universities. Indeed we could include in that major problem also Trinity College, Dublin.  It is vital that this State funds our higher level colleges and institutions so that we may produce graduates, especially in the technological sector, sufficient to cater for the needs of our society and economy. It is most regrettable that the budget of the past few years has neglected the needs of our universities which, in the long run will be tragic and will mean our nation will suffer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan) Thomas Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what Deputy Collins was referring a few moments ago when he said I felt happy with a statement I made in connection with a reduction in unemployment. Every Member of this House should be happy that for the first time in months we have reached a situation in which the unemployment figures are on the downward trend.  That was the reason for my statement.  I welcomed the fact that these figures were reducing and I sincerely hope in the next month, or the month thereafter, I shall be able to tell Deputy Collins that they have been further reduced.  Most people are aware that it is not the Government who are responsible for the high unemployment figures at present.  Indeed it should be said that the figures for unemployment in the <Col N="1277" /> United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Denmark are much higher as a percentage of the working population, than they have been here.</P>
      <P>There are, however, encouraging signs that the worst effects of the recession are now over and that there may be an upward trend not only in employment in the Community but throughout the world.  Between April and October last the seasonally adjusted register increased by an average of almost 4,000 per month. When one thinks of that surely it is nice to see that we have for the first time a reduction.</P>
      <P>The present recession can, I submit, be regarded as no more than a temporary setback to our job creation plans.  The revised employment and labour force estimates for the period 1975-80 published recently by the Central Statistics Office indicates the success of the Government's job creation programmes in the past few years and demonstrate that we are capable of providing jobs in the numbers required to cater for our rapidly growing work force.  In brief these estimates show that total employment increased by 31,000 on average per annum in the two-year period to mid-April 1979 and by 18,000 in the year to mid-April 1980.  These are the largest increases in employment ever achieved in recent history.  As a result of this rapid growth in the number of people at work in the three-year period in question, the unemployment rate declined from 9.3 per cent to 7.4 per cent.  This occurred despite the rapid growth in the labour force during this period, which averaged 22,000 a year.  That is an interesting figure to note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outlook for employment this year is brighter.  The prospects are for a gradual resumption in growth in the international economy following the sharp downturn in 1980.  Given our high dependence on foreign trade this upturn, combined with supportive Government policies, should result in significant growth in the Irish economy.  If domestic costs are kept in line with the pay terms of the national understanding this improvement in economic performance should bring about substantial employment growth this year, which should offset <Col N="1278" /> job losses and at the same time absorb the increase in the labour force.  In addition, if job losses are kept to a minimum through improved competitiveness the existing level of unemployment could be reduced further.  In a country like Ireland, where exports constitute such a high proportion of GNP, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of maintaining, and indeed improving, competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority achieved record numbers of job approvals in the past three years.  Despite the unfavourable climate for investment obtaining internationally last year the authority approved projects with an employment potential of over 35,000 jobs, an all time record.  The IDA aim to achieve a further 36,000 job approvals this year.  In all, as a result of projects already approved or planned, it is expected that 15,000 to 16,000 new manufacturing jobs will be provided this year. In addition, SFADCO expect to provide 1,500 new jobs this year and approve projects with an employment potential of 3,000.  The Government's Investment Plan for 1981, recently published, which provides for total investment of over £1,700 million will result in higher direct employment of over 10,000 mainly in the building and construction industry and the usual indirect employment with people supplying materials and services.</P>
    <P>Steps are being taken to ensure that our young people are equipped to take advantage of the new employment opportunities which these measures are providing.  Efforts are being made to improve the status and level of technological education in second level schools and to encourage young people, their parents and teachers to think about their attitudes towards technological studies and the growing industrial employment opportunities arising.  Projections of the demand for engineers between now and 1990 have been prepared and indications are that sufficient places will be available in third level educational institutions to meet this demand.</P>
    <P>The new educational opportunities programme was introduced to alleviate shortages in industries and services.  The <Col N="1279" /> courses provided under this programme are mainly in engineering and computer fields.  There is a very large increase in student intake for four-year courses for graduate engineers in 1980 and as a result there will be a significant increase in output of graduate engineers between 1983 and 1984.</P>
    <P>A campaign to advertise engineering technician courses in our regional technical colleges was undertaken by the Department of Education in mid 1980 and, as a result, enrolments were boosted considerably.  A series of schools-industry link schemes have been initiated with the aim of establishing links between local schools and industry with the object of enabling students to obtain first hand information of career prospects in industry and developing informed attitudes towards industrial employment.</P>
    <P>As the House is probably aware, in the Careers Information Section of my Department 254 leaflets are at present in circulation dealing with various types of jobs.  They include four new leaflets published in the past year.  The information for the leaflets is obtained from trade and professional associations, educational and training authorities, employers and trade unions in all the various fields of economic activity.  Each leaflet is revised at least once every two years and, accordingly, the updating of leaflets is an ongoing process.  Material for new leaflets is continuously being researched.</P>
    <P>About 4 million leaflets are distributed every year.  There are four main distributions to school libraries, youth organisations and careers guidance counsellors every year.  The leaflets are also issued free on request.  About 100 postal enquiries are received daily and up to 30 telephone calls for information.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the National Manpower Service, both in terms of staff numbers and the network of offices has continued over the past year resulting in a field staff now of over 300 and the operation of offices in 39 locations.  Further recruitment of placement officers is envisaged and four additional offices will be opened as soon as suitable premises are acquired.  The contribution made by <Col N="1280" /> the Occupational Guidance Service in assisting job seekers who are having difficulty in coming to a decision regarding their future careers has been recognised and the number of trained officers has increased with a further five in training at present.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £2.1 million has been provided for the work experience progremme under the 1981 budget proposals. This will allow for the continuance of the programme this year with a weekly participation rate of 2,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme, which is administered by the National Manpower Service of the Department of Labour came into operation in 1978 as a measure towards the alleviation of youth unemployment.  The aim of the programme is to give young people who are finding it difficult to obtain suitable permanent employment an opportunity of gaining experience of working life and learning some basic skills which will enhance their chances of securing a permanent job.</P>
    <P>Last year was a relatively good year for industrial relations.  The number of days lost through industrial disputes showed a considerable drop compared with 1979&mdash;a total of 404,000 as against 1,427,000.  In fact the 1980 figures represents the best performance in terms of days lost since 1975.  There are however serious deficiencies in our industrial relations system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Collins called an official strike, I was talking about industrial relations.  We must not be complacent, nor rest on our oars, now that an improvement on our industrial relations performance has been achieved.  We should strive to ensure that the improvement is not short-lived and that our commitment to a fair day's work for a fair day's pay is not lessened.  There should be enough means at the disposal of unions and management to discuss and resolve grievances before they are <Col N="1281" /> allowed to fester.  On the management side that means, first and foremost, accessibility. It also requires a consistent personnel policy which has been determined and agreed upon by all those in management.</P>
      <P>I would not advocate a dictatorship of the personnel function, but I would urge all line managers to remember that a good working atmosphere means greater efficiency.  In turn, a high rate of output can provide greater security and possibly financial benefits for the workforce. Where there is a serious grievance which is not capable of being solved by the employer and union concerned the resources of the State dispute-settling machinery are available as a means of reaching compromise.  The Labour Court has been expanded in the past year with the addition of a fourth division, and its operation has been made more efficient with the purchase of advanced technology work-processing equipment.  All this means that the waiting period between referring a dispute for investigation and the issue of a recommendation on it has been steadily reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the question of unofficial strikes, the Government are clearly concerned about the situation which obtains at present whereby a person or group of individuals who act quite without authority or support from their trade union and who engaged in unofficial picketing enjoy precisely the same legal protections as those who mount a picket with a full mandate from their trade union.  Duputies will be aware that consultations are currently going on with employer and trade union interests with a view to reaching consensus on a number of outline proposals for the reform of trade union law which I suggested.  When these consulations are concluded I intend to put specific proposals to the Government for a decision on their implementation.  Legislation on its own cannot, however, eliminate our industrial relations problems overnight.  The primary responsibility for the resolution of disputes rests on the factory floor with employers and workers. The most the law can do is to even any imbalance which may exist in the legal protection afforded to either social <Col N="1282" /> partner, and it would be wrong to suggest that our problems can be solved with a stroke of a pen.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention a subject which will have a vital influence on our industrial relations system in the longer term, and that is trade union education and training.  I am well aware of the important contribution which an informed and highly-trained trade unionist can make to rational negotiations as opposed to a minority who ignore agreed procedures.</P>
    <P>As an indication of my commitment to the ideal of trade union education, I have authorised the payment of £450,000 to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions towards the cost of their Education, Training and Advisory Services during 1981.  This sum represents an increase of 50 per cent over last year's figure, and nearly 120 per cent over the 1979 amount. I am sure the House will agree that this is a generous increase and one that will bear fruit in the years to come in the form of a more articulate, responsible and efficient trade union movement.</P>
    <P>In May 1978 my predecessor established a commission on industrial relations with a view to determining the areas in which improvements could be made to our industrial relations system.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I expect to receive the commission's report within a couple of weeks.  The publication of this report will offer an opportunity for what I hope will prove to be a well-informed and constructive debate on the vital subject of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>My Department continue to be involved in the activities of the International Labour Organisation and the Council of Europe.  Ireland has continuously supported the aims of the ILO, to advance the promotion of peace by social justice.  We became members in 1923.  In accordance with the obligations of our membership we hope to send a tripartite delegation to the 67th session of the International Labour Conference to be held in Geneva in June 1981.  The conference will consider the adoption of new instruments relating to (a) collective bargaining; (b) equal opportunities and equal treatment for men and women <Col N="1283" /> workers; and (c) safety and health and the working environment.  The conference will also discuss reports on the maintenance of migrant workers rights in social security and the termination of employment at the initiative of the employer.</P>
    <P>My Department make an annual contribution towards the expenses of the ILO, which is assessed at 0.16 per cent of the total ILO budget and a contribution towards the provision of fellowships for nationals of developing countries, preferably from Africa, at the ILO Advanced Training Centre in Turin.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour's main function in the EEC is to contribute to the formulation and implementation of EEC legislation and policy in the field of worker protection.  In 1980 the EEC Social Affairs Ministers adopted in council new legislation for the protection of workers against chemical, physical and biological hazards in their working environment and for protection of workers' wages in the event of insolvency of their employers.  They also adopted a programme for the exchange of young workers and guidelines for a Community Labour Market policy and agreed on new procedures for the greater involvement of the social partners, workers and employers, in Community decision making.</P>
    <P>However, the pressing preoccupation of the Council of Ministers has been the problem of high unemployment in the member states.  Various ideas concerning the possibility of some form of work sharing are being considered although it is recognised that any such measures would be peripheral to the key elements of increased investment and growth in any solution.  It is hoped that a joint meeting of Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Labour of the member states will be held so that the problems of unemployment can be considered by both Councils in one forum.</P>
    <P>My Department are responsible for the administration of the redundancy payments section.  They pay rebates to employers of sums paid by them to redundant workers or, where employers fail to <Col N="1284" /> make redundancy payment to workers, the Department pay the workers concerned from the Redundancy Fund and, if possible, recovers the amount due from the employers.</P>
    <P>The redundancy fund is financed by contributions from employers which are fixed at the rate of 0.2 per cent of reckonable earnings for the tax year commencing 6 April 1981.  The ceiling on reckonable earnings for this purposes was fixed at £8,500 for the same period.  I am at present carrying out a review of the operation of the redundancy payments scheme and the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>It is essential for our economy that our industrial training be geared to the needs of the labour market so as to ensure a well trained labour force to avoid as far as possible any bottlenecks in either supply or demand.  This calls for frequent reviews of the training provided and I am satisfied that the training agencies under the aegis of my Department, AnCO and CERT, are very conscious of this and keep their programmes under constant review.</P>
    <P>The 1981 non-capital Exchequer grant to AnCO is fixed at £21 million.  This represents an increase of 20 per cent over last year's allocation.  When the grant from the European Social Fund is added to this, it means that AnCO will have about £7 million more at their disposal than for the 1980 programme.  This increase will enable AnCO to increase by almost 10 per cent the numbers receiving training in 1981 over the 15,700 trained in 1980.  AnCO will also concentrate more on high-skilled training so that the potential of Irish manpower can be used to the full in the new and developing field of high technology employments.</P>
    <P>The stock of apprentices reached 21,500 at the end of December 1980.  This was an all-times high and AnCO is determined that every effort will be made to increase the intake of first year apprentices during 1981.  The additional funds being provided this year will enable AnCO to continue providing special arrangements for apprentices who may find their apprenticeship temporarily disrupted by the economic situation.</P>
    <P>This year's Exchequer capital grant to <Col N="1285" /> AnCO amounts to 9.5 million pounds, an increase of almost 50 per cent on last year's figure.  This substantial increase will allow AnCO to proceed with its plans to build new training centres.  New centres will be commenced at Loughlinstown and Baldoyle during 1981.  New training centres at Cork and Finglas in Dublin and substantial extensions to existing centres at Tralee and Ballyfermot in Dublin will be completed in 1981. There will be an increase of 955 training places compared with 1980 in addition to the employment which AnCO's capital development programme in 1981, as I outlined, will generate in the services and construction industries.  The selection of new training centre locations has been heavily influenced by the identified needs for vocational training facilities, the employment outlets, both existing and planned and the skilled needs of local industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, CERT caters for the education, recruitment and training for the hotel, catering and tourism industry.  The 1981 Exchequer grant to CERT amounts to £935,000 which is an increase of £105,000 over the 1980 allocation.</P>
    <P>The success of an enterprise depends to a great extent on its having an effective and efficient team of workers and management working hand in hand.  As I see it, one should complement the other.  I have, therefore, decided to continue with the subvention to the IMI this year and give them the same amount as last year.</P>
    <P>The theme of the International Year of Disabled Persons is &ldquo;Full Participation and Equality&rdquo;.  My Department are making a very significant contribution in the fields of employment and training.  I have responsibility for the implementation of the Government decision that a 3 per cent quota of disabled persons should be employed in the public sector.  My Department have already arranged for recruitment to the civil service to be opened up to disabled persons and special arrangements made to facilitate their appointment.  I am satisfied that these arrangements will lead to a significant number of disabled persons being offered employment in the civil service this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> My Department are also in regular contact with local authorities, health boards and State bodies to assist and advise them on how best they can implement the Government decision and proceed as quickly as possible towards the 3 per cent quota.  AnCO involvement in the training of disabled persons for open employment is increasing significantly. They trained 473 disabled persons during 1980 and hope to double that figure for 1981.</P>
    <P>The employment equality section of my Department is responsible for administration of equal pay and equal opportunities in employment legislation.  This legislation establishes the legal right of women to equal pay with men for like work and for equal treatment with men in entry to employment, training, promotion and all conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>All prohibitions on women at work, such as the prohibition on women working in industrial work at night, are being looked at to see if the concern which originally inspired them is well-founded. If it is necessary to protect women in special cases &mdash; as, for example, from working in lead processing during pregnancy &mdash; such protection will remain; but if any such protection does not appear necessary and results in discrimination in employment, we will give consideration to removing it from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency set up under the equal opportunity in employment legislation of 1977 has the task of publicising the legislation and overseeing progress.  They have monitored the cases being heard by the equality officers and the Labour Court and they encourage individuals to avail of the redress procedures set up under the Acts.</P>
    <P>The agency keep a watch on all discriminatory advertisements and on any sign of discriminatory practices in employment.  If they suspect a pattern of discrimination they are empowered to hold formal investigations and to issue non-discriminatory notices.</P>
    <P>The extent to which career choices for women are affected by subject choices in school is basic to the question of the removal of discrimination against <Col N="1287" /> women.  The Employment Equality Agency assisted by the Department of Education, the Department of Labour and the EEC, have commissioned the ESRI to carry out a research project on the subject and the project is well advanced.  A sum of £172,000 has been made available in the 1981 Budget for the Employment Equality Agency.  In the area of women's affairs the Department are also giving a grant to the Council for the Status of Women who are an umbrella group for over 30 women's organisations.  The council are consulted about any Government initiative with special relevance to women.  Suitable premises have been secured by the council in Merrion Square with Government assistance and a sum of £30,000 has been made available in the 1981 Budget for the Council on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>My Department are the national agency designated by the Government to be responsible for matters relating to the European Social Fund.  The fund is the financial instrument of employment policy of the EEC and has provided very substantial benefits to this country since our accession to the Community in 1973. In cash terms alone the amount in 1980 was over £175 million.  The annual amount has grown steadily over the years from £1.4 million in 1973 to £53.5 million in 1980.  This assistance has enabled us to expand our vocational training facilities at a much faster pace than would otherwise have been possible.  The main beneficiaries of the £53.5 million approved in respect of 1980 were: AnCO, £27.5 million; bodies concerned with the training of handicapped persons, £8.2 million; Department of Education, £6.3 million; IDA, £4.9 million; National Manpower Service, £3.5 million; CERT, £.9 million; Department of the Environment, £.5 million; and SFADCo, £.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about the safety of workers in their employment as well as covering several other pieces of labour legislation relating <Col N="1288" /> to such matters as hours at work and protection of young people in emplyment. We have moved in a matter of years from being a country dominated by agriculture to a country where industry and services now employ 80 per cent of our people.  In view of this it is obvious that considerable attention must now be given to ensuring that employees enjoy reasonable standards of hygiene and safety in their workplace.  I feel that a major contribution will be made to help improve safety standards in industry when the Safety in Industry Act, 1980, takes full effect.  The corner-stone of the Act is the mandatory establishment of safety committees in respect of existing factories before the end of 1981.  Apart from this the onus is put on the employers to set down in writing the arrangements which they have made in their premises to ensure the safety of their workers.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask both sides of industry to ensure the effective working of the Act.</P>

      <P>I understand that this debate allows for a full review of the economic situation and I want to enumerate, if that is in order, the areas in which I feel there has been a complete failure by this Government.  Despite what they may say in rosy speeches and through economists generally throughout the length and breadth not alone of this land but of the world, they stand condemned on the management of the economy here.  I have before me a report from the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> which is very critical of the Government's management of the economy.  As an ordinary man in the street I want to spell out what I find has been wrong with the management of the economy and the affairs of this State by the present holders of office The area most dear to my heart, which has been boasted about quite a lot by the Government, is the area of social welfare. It is the Government's duty to look after the poor and less well off in our society.  The record in this area over the last year in particular is anything but good.</P>

      <P>I am not in the habit of being interrupted or taking part in cross-talk but I think a sleight of hand was done in the area the Minister of State mentions and it was boasted around this country that there was a 25 per cent increase for long term recipients of social welfare.  However, when the unfortunate people had dependants, they found that that was not the case.  I agree that, if you go into the small print in the budget, it was spelled out at the time, but people were deceived by glib talk about a 25 per cent increase for long term recipients. They found that this did not apply for their dependants.  It was a con trick, something that the Minister should be ashamed of, to claim publicly that he allowed a 25 per cent increase in long term benefits when that was not the case.</P>

      <P>The con tricks were carried on in the Department of Social Welfare and to hear this is probably hurting them.  This is why we get the reaction of interruptions which are unbecoming from a holder of office.  Be that as it may, we will leave it for the moment.  In most countries in Europe the old age pension age is 65.  Here it is 66 by virtue of the fact that the previous Government reduced it consistently by one year for each year of their term of office.  The Fianna Fáil Government, in their long history of Government in this country, never reduced the old age pension age by <Col N="1290" /> even one fraction of a week or a day. That does not stand to their credit.  It has been said here many times recently that the payment of benefits has broken down completely in the Department of Social Welfare and I am told that we are harassing people working there.  I do not care whom we are harassing.  It is our duty to do so as representatives of the unfortunate poor in this country, the unfortunate people who are unlucky enough to be dependent on services from the Department of Social Welfare, when they cannot get what they are legally and justly entitled to and what they have contributed to.  I have here before me one case which I bring in as an example of what has been happening in this Department under this much-lauded Minister who thinks an awful lot about his responsibilities in that area.  I have supplied details to the Department of a man who went out sick on 23 January 1981 following an accident.  He was most anxious to work but was forced to stay out until 12 February.  He did not receive any benefit.</P>

He was still awaiting benefit, even though he had a full record of insurance over a number of years.  He had been forced to return to work on 12 February from sheer necessity. During the whole period he received benefit amounting to only £10.  Both he and I supplied the necessary reference numbers to the Department but without result.

    <P>Road grants in County Kildare have increased from £2.5 million to £5 million this year.  It must be remembered that £3 million of that sum is needed for the Naas by-pass which will serve every county in the southern part of the country and is a vital necessity.  Almost another million will be spent on a major project on arterial roads to the south.  The amount provided for the maintenance of roads in County Kildare will not last until September or keep the workforce <Col N="1293" /> employed.  All our roads are deteriorating at such a rate that industry will not come to Kildare or to the vast area of Ireland served by roads through that county because of their bad conditions. These roads carry three-quarters of all traffic in Ireland.  There are three arterial roads carrying traffic to the south-west, the south and Waterford, and deteriorating daily.  The Minister for the Environment had the cheek to come in here and boast about all the money he was providing for sewerage and roads.</P>
    <P>Two very big sewerage schemes are being carried out in Kildare for the last few years.  They are very necessary and welcome for the development of that county.  This year our allocation from the Department was not enough to continue these schemes.  Yet the Minister is boasting about all he is doing for sewerage schemes.  Who does he think he is codding? These are the facts.  By October most local authorities will have to lay off workers because the Department are not providing sufficient money.  The Department have control over the amount of money local authorities can raise and spend and therefore must accept full responsibility for the state of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the year some people's housing loans had been approved by the local authorities but when they wanted their money there was none available because the Department had not provided it and would not allow the local authorities to borrow from the central loan fund.  I do not need to tell those unfortunate people the facts because they have been forced to get bridging loans for months because of the Government's inability or refusal to provide the necessary money.  The situation has improved slightly in the last month or so but I wonder if, at the end of the year, there will be enough money to pay those people with whom the local authorities have entered into commitments.</P>
    <P>These people are making every effort to provide their own homes.  Many of them should normally have local authority houses but because of the Government's lack of policy to provide such houses they are forced into borrowing <Col N="1294" /> more than they could be reasonably expected to pay.  These are the facts and every TD knows I am speaking the truth. The Government do not have any reason to boast about their record over the past 12 months in providing houses and money to meet loans.</P>
    <P>I turn now to agriculture.  As spokesman for Agriculture, I will be giving most of my views on this subject tomorrow. Over the past year there has been a deterioration in all areas of agriculture but I am most concerned about employment in the processing industry.  There has been a lack of policy and initiative at European level to stop unfair competition, for example, in our meat industry.  Certain people are allowed to import from third countries materials for feeding compounds, such as tapioca which is used to the detriment of our barley growers. There is no levy or duty on this commodity but our producers are asked to pay a levy by the EEC because there is a surplus. We then import those commodities without paying a levy and this results in redundancies and losses to our farmers.</P>
    <P>This Government got into power because they promised we would process our own food.  I do not want to spell out the details now because I will deal with this matter tomorrow, but it was baldly stated in the manifesto that we would process all our own food.  Yet in the food processing industry we have redundancies on a scale never even imagined.  Erin Foods are closing vegetable plants with a consequent loss of employment.  The vegetable processing plant in Carlow is to be closed this year.  We had 1,000 acres which produced vegetables for the plant which farmers have been trying to keep going as a co-operative, but they did not get any help from the Government.  They were obstructed.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of policy we are asked to say is right.  The Government have the audacity to defend this policy, but there is no way it can be defended because it is the opposite to what was promised in the manifesto.  It has been said by people who are more prominent in the agricultural sector than I that we imported £450 million worth of food, and I suppose that is correct, but it would not be fair to say <Col N="1295" /> we could grow all that food ourselves. We cannot grow such things as bananas, oranges, tea and so on.</P>
    <P>However, about £150 million is being paid for food which is directly competing with us and which we should be producing and processing here.  A Government who allow that to happen should be ashamed of their record in that field. With regard to our vegetables we have found that no attempt has been made by the Department of Agriculture, or anybody else, to promote those products abroad.  There is no marketing system of any kind in operation or any type of market evaluation to inform our farmers of the way they should produce their vegetables.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about farmers alone but about more than 40 per cent of our population who are employed directly or indirectly in the agricultural sector.  I am concerned about the lack of Government policy in the marketing system for those vegetables. Erin Foods have been producing excellent types of vegetables and the workers in that concern have lived up to every target set by management.  The farmers&mdash;I am referring to those in the Carlow area&mdash;never welched on their contracts. We are producing high grade types of vegetables which, apparently, are not saleable on the world market.  Market research has not been carried out as to whether it would be possible to sell them on the world market or whether we should have diverted to frozen vegetables. Frozen vegetables are being imported hand over fist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be honest and say that the Department of Agriculture have failed to do anything about this matter.  Irrespective of the amount of oil or mineral <Col N="1296" /> wealth we discover our greatest wealth will continue to be the top six to eight inches of our ground.  That soil is the greatest potential for job creation if it is properly managed and if there is proper marketing of our produce.  We accept an inferior price for our beef throughout Europe because no attempt has been made to investigate or assess the market requirements or encourage the production of more beef and vegetables to compete on a favourable basis.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in their manifesto, assured us that they would encourage greater production of vegetables but we turn up with 126,000 registered unemployed.  That is the record of the Government although a former member of it assured me that we would have full employment by 1982. He told me that if we did not he would accept the policies I was advocating at that time.  It is no wonder that he is not a Minister now when he gave such an assurance.  That former Minister relied on private enterprise to produce full employment by 1982 by giving them tax concessions but he is aware that private enterprise reneged on him and did not produce anything.  He is aware that redundancies are the order of the day now across the board.  In the short time available to me I feel I have proved that the Government do not have any reason to be proud of their record in the economic field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in my contribution to this debate.  I have listened with interest to what Deputy Bermingham had to say about the food processing industry and, to a large extent, I agree with him.  I agree that there should be a greater emphasis on our food processing industry.  I cannot understand, and have not been able to comprehend why in places like Cork and Donegal, and around the country, farmers who have land lying idle go to markets and shops to buy imported vegetables.  It is all very well to blame the Government and say that they have not provided the markets but the fact is that a great quantity of basic items such as potatoes are imported from Holland and other countries.  Why is that necessary?  I suggest that the farmers, <Col N="1297" /> for whom I have a high regard and I admit that we depend greatly on them, through their organisations have a responsibility to produce the vegetables that are being imported now in vast quantities. It is a waste of our resources if we do not do so and, as Deputy Bermingham said, there should be a greater concentration on food processing.</P>
      <P>I should like to read some quotations from economic debates which took place during the period of office of the National Coalition.  I do so because of the criticism that has come from Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Kelly on our economic situation. Deputy FitzGerald, while in America, issued a statement outlining the difficulties our economy was in.  I do not think he should have issued such a statement in America.  It was damaging to the efforts being made by the IDA and the Government, supported by all parties, to get increased investment here.  For him to issue a statement in America can only be construed as dubious patriotism.  It was wrong and it was a mistake.  In the course of the Christmas Adjournment debate in 1975 the Taoiseach said the Government then could have battened down the hatches and allowed the ship to be blown about at the mercy of the economic storm until it blew over.  We could, he said, have cut public expenditure back sharply, raised taxes substantially and restrained borrowing.  He went on to say that the consequences for employment and the standard of living of the weaker sections of the community would have been appalling.  he said that they rejected that option and, instead, aimed at careful expansion.  Certainly, he said, we did not expect that it would get much worse. Regrettably, he said, that happened.</P>
      <P>In the course of the same debate the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Farm income is unique in being largely dependent on EEC decisions under the common agricultural policy and on such factors as weather conditions...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary, who was Minister for Labour in the National Coalition, in the course of that debate, explaining the reason behind Government borrowing said <Col N="1298" /> there was no way the community could avoid the obligation of paying for the extra impost caused by oils and raw materials.  He said that in our situation the choice before the Government, in so far as it lay within their power, was to maintain employment at the maximum despite the increased costs.  He said the Government were correct in maintaining public expenditure at the highest possible level.  That is contrary to what Deputy O'Leary said here yesterday.  It is the exact opposite.  What he said in 1975 supports the action the Government have taken in recent times.  Yet, that Deputy had the gall to say in the House that the Government were doing the wrong things, that they should reverse the process.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary, the Labour Party, and the Fine Gael Party, will have to come clean and let the people know their intentions.  They cannot continue to promise financial aid to the farmers, a reduction in PAYE, financial aid to private enterprise and to almost every sector of the community that happens to be putting pressure on them and, at the same time, say they will reduce foreign borrowing. They must explain to the people how they will reduce foreign borrowing and public expenditure.  That is in contradiction of what they said when in Government. Indeed, it is the direct opposite. They are very wise now.  Let me quote the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully:</P>
    <P>When I listen, particularly to former Government Ministers, I wonder, if they were as wise when they were here as they are now, would it not be a great country?  In Opposition I knew instant solutions to everything.  It was only when I crossed the floor that the things I suggested were not as easily solved as they appeared from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>They can blame us now but I can bring to them their own words when they were in Government.  Deputy Kelly was then Parliamentary Secretary and, in a long and characteristically colourful speech on a confidence motion in October 1974, he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The truth is that the Government have failed to control the upward price spiral. I am not a bit depressed at the troubles surrounding the Government which the Taoiseach did not deny.  The problems which the Taoiseach outlined yesterday far exceeded anything the other side had to deal with since the War and I have no doubt that with courage and solidarity the Government will win through these troubles and get the country safely to the far side.</P>

Deputy Kelly likes to look across at this side and seek out divisions here.  Will Deputy Kelly tell the people that in the coming election his party will unite?  I do not see any evidence of it.  During the brief period Deputy FitzGerald has been leader of the party he has tried to broaden the party's base. He has brought some of the more liberal elements into the party and chased from the organisation some of the older, more distinguished members who do not want to contest the election in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>We had an instance over the weekend of a prominent member, who beat Deputy E. Collins for a vice-presidency of the organisation, saying something about abortion.  While I am on that subject, I ask Fine Gael to ask all their members in all constituencies if they are opposed to abortion.  Let them give a commitment, because if they do not I certainly will, that I will be canvassing them on that. Fine Gael are on a very slippery slope and I do not think the people will be conned by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been approached by a number of people in the self-employed sector on the question of buying pensions.  The 1967 Finance Act contains a section enabling self-employed people to buy pensions.  I will refer to a man of 35 years of age, married with a family, who considers it unwise not to provide for a pension.  The vast majority of people at that age will have pensions when they retire.  This man has been in <Col N="1301" /> the business of housing management, repairing and letting flats.  Because he owns the premises but does not serve bed and breakfast, that Finance Act provides that he cannot buy a pension.  A letter dated 3 November 1980 from the Department of Finance stated:</P>
      <P>The reason for the exclusion is that the rents may normally be expected to provide the source of income, regardless of a person's age or health, which is not the case with income from a trade or profession or non-pensionable employment.</P>
      <P>If we bring this to its logical conclusion we will have geriatrics and sick people working in and looking after the housing sections of corporations and county councils, doing that man's work, fixing slates, damp-courses and windows.  If one owns a shop or a farm one can buy a pension under the self-employed system, but if one receives rent instead of profit or turnover one cannot do so.  The recent budget shows that the Government want to encourage people into the business of letting private accommodation.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to come back to this when he is replying.  If a man is self-employed he is using the land and buildings to make a profit.  The farmer does the same.  If a man is letting property he is providing a basic need for people in the same way as the farmer does when he produces food.  Therefore I do not row in with those who suggest that it should not be possible to rent private accommodation and buy a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a very serious development has come to my attention concerning the dividends on savings accrued by people in credit unions.  It is a shame that credit unions savings are now taxed on their dividends.  The Revenue Commissioners have written to credit unions asking for returns.  Most people in credit unions are small savers.  They save for the convenience of having their money deducted at source, towards the purchase of a house, for an extension to a house or towards a rainy day.  Their sayings are rarely over £2,000 or £3,000.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this aspect of taxation.  Credit union savings should be exempt from taxation on dividends.  They serve a community <Col N="1302" /> purpose.  Credit unions in my constituency have helped enormously.  They are not commercial banks.  We are not going back to the old moneylenders or the hacks who lent money at exorbitant interest rates.  There should be some recognition of the work which credit unions do.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are now taxing FCA allowances.  The people who join An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil are volunteers and deserve to be called patriots. These weekend soldiers, support the regular Army in times of stress, security difficulties and so on.  This new development of taxing their meagre allowances is wrong and should be corrected.  There is no justification for it.  In some cases they have long distances to travel to the Army barracks where they serve.  They may live and work in Dublin and may have to travel to the Curragh.  They get no travelling allowance.  If they are officers, they have to purchase expensive uniforms.  They do not get a uniform allowance.  Apart from that, as a former member of the FCA, I was never taxed on my allowances.  Why, suddenly, are members of the FCA being taxed?  It will militate against recruitment to the FCA.</P>
    <P>I want to mention delays in county councils in dealing with planning applications. I know of an instance in Kinsale where there is a planning application in for 250 houses.  A decision on the application has been dragged out by the county council for the past two years. The developer has indicated that, as soon as he gets planning permission, he can give immediate employment to 100 people for seven years.  Bureaucracy is delaying this kind of development.  The Kinsale development is acceptable to the majority of the local public representatives. Yet, officials are holding up this development.  The same applies, to a large extent, to delays in decisions of An Bord Pleanála.  Jobs are at stake.  If an Bord Pleanála need to be beefed up let us beef it up &mdash; give them more staff. Why should people who want to invest money in development have to wait six months or a year for planning permission? It is wrong and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> I want to discuss the Government's record in youth affairs.  During the period of the Coalition Government in office, Deputy Bruton was Minister of State at the Department of Education and was transferred to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He remained, nominally, at the Department of Education but there was no development in youth work.  I made inquiries when I was elected to this House and I discovered that the Department consisted of one man.  That man had no brief.  He had not even got an office or a secretary.  That has changed completely.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tunney, has won general recognition throughout the youth movement as being a successful Minister.  The Fianna Fáil Government had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in late 1977 to pay the accumulated arrears of youth organisations, including the National Youth Council of Ireland.  I do not recall any reference to youth work services in the Fine Gael White Paper on Education.  I want to put it on record that our commitment to youth continues.  For instance, the grant allocation to youth in 1977-81 was £261,300.  In 1980 it was increased to £543,000.  The grant to Comhairle le Leas Oige in 1977 was £200,000.  In 1981 it was £328,000, a 64 per cent increase.  There was another important increase in the grants to VECs to assist youth and sporting activities at local level.  In 1980 it was £218,000.  In 1981 it was £492,000 an increase of 126 per cent.</P>
    <P>From quotations I have given earlier, Fine Gael are condemned by their own words.  They cannot, as a party, stand up in the House and shed crocodile tears about the difficulties the Government have.  The Government have, and always will have, difficulties.  We will face those difficulties and have no hesitation in meeting the challenge.  When the election comes, whether it be this year or next, the people will renew their confidence in this Government.  I have never impugned anybody's motives as to their activities in the House but I was appalled to hear Deputy Paddy O'Toole, in his long tribute to Deputy Garret FitzGerald, cast <Col N="1304" /> aspersions on the integrity on the motives of the Taoiseach.  How dare he?  He has no right to pass judgment on anybody's motives.  All Members in this House are motivated by patriotism and by the need to do something for the country.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach will still be Taoiseach after the next election because the record and the words I have quoted of the Coalition Government condemn them out of hand.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Begley now going to stand up and attack the Fianna Fáil Government? Let him go back over his own economic debates.  He will see they were a dismal failure and the people should be reminded of that.  How do all their candidates stand on the issues that were raised over the weekend?</P>

      <P>I challenge the Deputy to name these people outside the House. He has his opportunity now if he wishes to take it.  There is no doubt that this Bill is an indictment of the Fianna Fáil Government. There are glaring omissions and glaring faults.  The Government and the Fianna Fáil Party seem to be completely <Col N="1305" /> insensitive to what is happening around them.  I was mildly amused when Deputy N. Andrews went back to 1974 to quote what Deputy John Kelly or Deputy Bruton said as well as the then Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  It is amazing that, when he was reflecting on what was said in 1974, he did not look at what his own spokespersons said at the same time. I will give one short quotation from Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, who is now Minister for Finance.  Speaking in the debate on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill in 1976 he said:</P>
      <P>The best cartoon I ever saw was a headstone in a newspaper last week with the words: &ldquo;In fond memory of the pint.  Erected by Richie Ryan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He could now truthfully say: &ldquo;Erected by Gene Fitzgerald.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not enough for his colleagues to blame him.  They too have to accept their share of the blame for the situations which has arisen.</P>
      <P>It is all here in black and white.  I see the Minister of State at the Department of Finance is smiling.  No wonder.  You could buy two pints then for what one pint costs today.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As national output declined unemployment rose but, despite declining national output and rising unemployment, money incomes in the non-agricultural sector rose by 23 per cent in 1975 and in the public sector by 40 per cent.  The profits on which private industry rely to finance investment development declined and all but disappeared. Our public finances, under the combined pressure of the escalating costs of servicing the public debt <Col N="1306" /> and this rapid rise in public service pay, got completely out of control.  Budget deficits rose from £5½ million in 1972-73 to £10 million in 1973-74, to £92 million in 1974, the nine-month period, and £259 million in 1975.  Corresponding with those budget deficits Government borrowing rocketed from £199 million in 1972-73 to £385 million in 1974, the nine-month period, and to £733 million last year.</P>
    <P>Everybody realises it is a question of think of a number.  These are the words of people who are now in responsible positions, one is the Taoiseach and the other is the Minister for Finance.  Would they care now to read what they said then?  Little did they think at that time they would be holding the purse strings today.  I suppose it is a pleasant surprise for the Minister to find himself in the position he is in today.  Little did they think then they would find themselves in the crazy situation in which they are now. Everybody realises it is a crazy situation. The Taoiseach was going to give the country wonderful leadership by taking it out of the financial mess in which it was.  What is the situation now?  Borrowing has gone out of control.</P>
    <P>I shall not continue on this because it is really old hat, but I want to make reference to a Fianna Fáil cumann meeting.  I have here particulars of a meeting called of a Fianna Fáil cumann in Kerry on 16 March 1977: election of officers for 1977; discussion on the forthcoming general election which will take place and preparation for same within the cumann area; discussion on the state of the economy and the result and its effects on the people of our area; discussion by the Minister for Finance on the withdrawal of the farmer's dole, school buses, children's allowances and other financial aids which will affect the way of life of the cumainn areas.  Compare what was said in 1977 with what we have today.  It is farcical.  The Government must be having a horrible nightmare when they reflect on what they said when the National Coalition Government were in power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> Before the general election in 1977 our fishermen were told: &ldquo;You have your 50 miles.  There is no question about that as soon as we get back into office.&rdquo;  Within a couple of months of taking office the Minister for Fisheries sold our fisheries at 2 a.m. in Brussels.  Now it seems that we will not have even a 12-mile limit.</P>
    <P>Cad mar gheall ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta? Bhí a lán cainte agus díospóireachta ag muintir Fhianna Fáil lasmuigh de na séipéil go léir ag rá dos na daoine, dámbeadh Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht go mbeadh údarás ag muintir na Gaeltachta, go mbeadh siad in ann a slí bheatha féin a dhéanamh amach.  Anois cad tá tar éis a tharla, ó fuair muintir na Gaeltachta an tÚdarás?  Cad tá ins an Údarás céanna?  Níl ach sop in áit na scuaibe.  Ó tháinig an tÚdarás isteach beagnach bliain is ceithre mhí ó shin, cad tá ag tarlú do mhuintir na Gaeltachta?  Tá na monarchana anseo is ansud a chuir Tomás Ó Domhnaill sna Gaeltachtaí céanna á dúnadh.  Tá daoine ag gabháil timpeall agus iad ag baint an dole des na feirmeoirí beaga.  Tá easpa airgid ag na comharchumainn.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta san, na mná tí atá ag coimeád na páistí scoile i gcóir na coláistí samhraidh, cé mhéid d'ardú a fuair siad i mbliana?  Tá a fhios ag gach aoinne go bhfuil an boillsciú ag rith de réir 21 faoin gcéad.  Cad a fuair na mná tí?  Fuair siad 15p breise sa ló chun páiste a choimead. Páistí scoile atá ag dul go dtí coláiste samhraidh caitheann siad trí bhéilí ar a laghad gach lá agus is dócha cupán tae sara dtéann an páiste go dtí an leaba san oíche agus ina dteannta san cupán bainne ar 11 a chlog ar maidin.  Cad a fuair na mná tí céanna&mdash;15p breise, trí phingin go leith i gcóir gach béile?  Ar chuala tú a leithéid riamh?</P>
    <P>Chuir sé ionadh agus imní orm nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht le Aire na Gaeltachta ag rá go raibh a lán ní déanta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Níl tada déanta acu agus nuair a bheidh an toghchán thart beidh a fhios ag an Rialtas seo nach raibh siad ábalta dallamullóg a chur ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bhí mé ag gearán i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta, dúirt mé nach raibh aon chumhacht ag na baill <Col N="1308" /> agus rinne mé iarracht ar cúpla leasuithe a chur síos nuair a bhí an Bille ag dul trid an Dáil anseo.  An t-iar Aire a bhí ann, Donncha Ó Gallchóir&mdash;ní raibh sé ábalta iad a ghlacadh&mdash;agus anois tá Údarás againn nach bhfuil aon tsuim aige i muintir na Gaeltachta agus an taon suim atá ag an Údarás céanna anois ná air flights atá ar siúl acu go dtí tíortha thar lear, le Aer Arainn.  Sin é an t-aon ní fónta atá á dhéanamh acu anois.</P>
    <P>Many people who listened to the preelection broadcasts in 1977 will remember the famous remark made by Deputy Eileen Lemass on the 1.45 news bulletin that there would be no more rising prices. What has happened since then?  Will Deputy Lemass tell the people in her constituency that she has honoured that commitment?  Look at the price of petrol. When we said certain circumstances were beyond our control, in no way would the then Deputy Gene Fitzgerald accept that.</P>
    <P>Anyone who wants to read a fairy tale like the fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen should read some of the contributions made by the present Minister for Finance when he was an Opposition spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party.  He talked about petrol and said people could not do without their cars.  He also spoke about motor taxation.  He criticised the then Minister for Finance for increasing motor taxation.  At least the then Minister for Finance was honest about it.  He did not say, as was said in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, that he would abolish car tax. That is what Deputy Gene Fitzgerald said.  Everybody now knows that it has gone from £5 to £10 to £20.  If they are much longer in office I do not know where it will stop.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Andrews speaking about all the telephones installed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Reynolds.  He is very vain about them.  When he is seen on television he appears like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan.  The telephones are installed but they are not connected.  Thousands of telephones are installed all around the country but they are not working.  The Minister for Finance has only to look at this own <Col N="1309" /> constituency to know what I am talking about.</P>

They have been suspect in the past and they may be suspect again now.  There is no doubt that there will be a very serious shortfall in local authority funding for the coming year.  Deputy Bermingham spoke at length and he maintained that the crunch will not be felt until October.  At the estimates meeting in Kerry some weeks ago it was pointed out that the country manager had not enough money to erect one public light on any crossroad or outside any church in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister for rising prices has arrived.  This Minister screamed at Senator Justin Keating when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce. <Col N="1310" /> Nowadays we hear in the RTE news bulletin, in a very abridged form, that the Prices Commission have recommended certain price increases.  When Senator Justin Keating was Minister they usually said &ldquo;Minister Justin Keating has now sanctioned the following price increases&rdquo;.  This Minister screamed the loudest and the longest and I am glad that he is here now to justify the exorbitant increases on foods, how he abolished food subsidies, increased the price of bread, oil, butter, sugar and the price of meat.  Deputy O'Malley has been responsible for sanctioning those price increases.  If a general election is imminent we can be sure that the Minister is sitting on a lot of price increases recommended by the Prices Commission. Before the 1977 General Election a few newspapers reported that there were massive price increases on the way, that a confidential document had been leaked out to a reporter.  That was goodbye to the National Coalition.  Will the same thing happen now? I see Deputy O'Mally smiling cynically.  Deputy O'Mallley does not have to live on the breadline nor does he have to deal with people who are waiting months for their unemployment benefit and he does not have to queue for the local assistance officer for the price of a loaf or a pot of jam.  Minister O'Malley is far removed from that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for rising prices is more apt.  The Minister has the appearance of a nice guy going to America, to Tokyo and of flying back from Hong Kong with massive factories in the pipe-line.  Does the Minister ever think of County Kerry?  In south west Kerry the Minister for Finance even refused to meet a deputation of honourable people who journeyed to the city to discuss the serious situation in the Cahirciveen area where four factories had closed.  I know that this Minister met a deputation and said that something was in the pipe-line but that was over two months ago.  Those <Col N="1311" /> people are on the dole and there is no prospect of anything for that area.</P>
      <P>Everybody seems to be shot shy of the Minister but I am not because the Minister was a tough man in Opposition and if he had something to say he said it.  This Minister will go down in the history books as beating Deputy Justin Keating by a distance as far as price rises are concerned.</P>
      <P>What are the Government plans for local authorities?  Do they intend to abolish them altogether?  When we came to Government in 1973 a famous White Paper had been produced by Deputy Molloy as Minister for Local Government. In that White Paper it was intended to abolish a number of urban authorities. I am beginning to think that there is again a serious move in the Department of the Environment to abolish local authorities. The local authorities have not enough money to collect domestic refuse from a new housing estate, to erect a public light outside a church gate, to fill a pot hole, and neither can they afford to keep on staff some of whom have been working for them for about ten years.  Right-minded people have to ask themselves &ldquo;what is the function of the local authority?&rdquo; I would like whoever is replying to this debate this afternoon to tell the members of local authorities if they have outlived their usefulness and if it is intended to abolish county councils.  It is only right to spell it out if that is the case.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that farmers are getting a very rough time particularly farmers who were encouraged by the various agencies to expand and develop. Quite a number of these farmers were encouraged to borrow from the banks and now due to the depressed state of agriculture they are finding it difficult to meet their repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>To meet their repayments some of them are selling their stock or their tractor.  It is imperative on the Government to step in here and help farmers because these people would not be in <Col N="1312" /> debt in the first place except for the fact that they were encouraged to get into debt under the farm modernisation scheme.  If the Department of Agriculture were on the ball and paid the grants promptly when they fell due some of the people would not be in the serious situation they are now in.  I hope that the Department of Agriculture will take note of farmers who are waiting for grants in excess of £5,000.  Many of these people are in debt to the banks and it would be better for them to pay the banks with the grant rather than sell their stock.</P>
      <P>I never thought the Department of Social Welfare were so short of money that they would have pension officers in motor cars parked outside post offices following people home checking on their means.  It is a despicable practice on the part of the officials of that Department. When people reach the age of 66, when there is occasion for an official of the Department to visit them, there should be an understanding attitude shown in the course of that interview.  Bearing in mind some of the questions asked and the way some of these interviews are conducted, it is no wonder some of the interviewees have occasion to visit their doctor the following morning.  Indeed it is a wonder they do not suffer heart attacks, never mind not sleeping that night.  Surely a public relations exercise is called for.  When people are entitled to certain benefits, no matter what they may be, common courtesy should prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy O'Malley, the Minister present, read what he said in 1976, what he said in 1977, or even in 1975 about the Coalition Government, he would certainly be saying to himself now: by God we are living in a very strange world indeed, little did I think that I would be in a position to do something about what I was saying then.  The Taoiseach has contradicted himself so many times, the Government have lost all credibility.  The sooner they go to the country seeking votes the better.  If they get a vote of confidence we will say congratulations. But I am quite sure that if they go to the polls now they will get a rude awakening. As some wit here in Leinster House said when the 1977 election was called&mdash;the <Col N="1313" /> National Coalition will come back in a minibus; I think the Fianna Fáil Party will come back in a taxi.</P>

      <P>It is a strange quirk of human nature that we seem to relish wallowing in doom and gloom. Indeed a casual observer glancing through the pages of any of our national daily papers would be forgiven for supposing that Irish industry&mdash;about which I want to talk today&mdash;is rapidly grinding to a halt.  If there are such prophets of doom listening to me today I shall try to educate them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We should start by looking at a few hard facts which will show quite unequivocally that the manufacturing sector has made a significant contribution to the expansion of output, investment and employment since this Government took office in 1977.  Manufacturing output, despite a decline of 2 per cent in 1980, expanded at an average annual rate of 5½ per cent over the past four years.  This rate of expansion is the fastest in Western Europe.  It compares with 3½ per cent for Germany and a rate of just over 1 per cent in the United Kingdom during the same four years.  The major driving force behind this expansion has been the growth in industrial exports.  They represent an average annual growth of 13 per cent in volume at a time when world trade was growing at less than 5 per cent per annum.  Industrial investment, spurred by the growth in IDA project approvals in both domestic and overseas sources, has grown at an average annual rate of 15 per cent in real terms over the last four years.  Even in the recession-hit 1980 it amounted to over £600 million. This expansion of investment is more than double the Japanese and German rates of expansion, and treble the United <Col N="1314" /> States rate during the same period.  Manufacturing employment has responded accordingly.  The IDA Industrial Plan 1978-1982 set a target to create 68,000 IDA-backed jobs in the five year period of the plan.  More than 40,000 first-time jobs were created on the ground in the first three years of the plan, or 104 per cent of the target for that period.  This level of achievement has taken place at a time of international recession, and I freely acknowledge that we are experiencing the full brunt of such a recession. I wish it were not so but it would be the height of economic naivety to imagine that Ireland, a small open economy, could fully shelter itself from the impact of a recession of such magnitude.</P>
    <P>Despite this unfavourable economic climate the momentum of Ireland's industrial drive has increased.  While the present recession is having severe effects on existing industry and on our efforts to create new industrial employment, I believe that Irish industry is now in a better position to withstand adverse conditions than it has ever been.  Indications are that during the current difficult period there was a higher than average proportion of job losses, resulting from firms shedding labour rather than closing down altogether.  A high proportion of jobs lost during the recession will therefore be quickly regained as trading conditions improve.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The townlands served by Malahide Garda station are set out in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  The total strength of the Garda Síochána at Malahide on 31 March 1981 was 12 as compared with nine on the corresponding date in 1971.</P>
      <P>Malahide Garda station closes at 1 a.m. each night, including week-ends. The Garda authorities have indicated that the present opening hours of the station have been so fixed as to enable the station party to carry out the maximum amount of outdoor police duties while maintaining an adequate office service.  They consider that an extension of the opening hours would not be feasible at present having regard to the current strength of the station party, but the matter is being kept under review.  There are, of course, arrangements for providing a police service in the area from the district headquarters when the station at Malahide is closed.  Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should appreciate that the special crime prevention patrol, which was introduced last July on an overtime basis in larger urban centres with a view to combating street crime and vandalism, are operating in the Malahide area.  Apart from the resources allocated to the local station the resources of the crime task force and the special task force based in Dublin Castle are available to Malahide when the need arises.  The Deputy, the Minister for the Environment and others involved in community associations have raised the subject matter of this question to me.  I have said that I will ask the Garda to have another look at it.  I am prepared to do that.  There is quite a large increase in the population and I appreciate the difficulties there are in the area.  The Deputy should also appreciate that the Garda advise that it would be better if the manpower that would be needed to keep the station open from 1 o'clock were actually doing patrol work.  They are having another look at it.  When that examination is finished I will be in a position to tell the Deputy more about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of (a) crimes and (b) incidents reported to Malahide Garda station, County Dublin, during (i) 1980 and (ii) 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers of indictable crimes reported or known to the Garda as having been committed in the Garda sub-district served by Malahide station are as follows: 1980, 174; 1970, 35.</P>
      <P>The numbers of non-indictable offences in which proceedings were brought are: 1980, 2,800; 1970, 1,325.</P>
      <P>Presumably by &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; is meant those calls on the Garda which require an input of police resources&mdash;for example, sudden deaths, fires, traffic accidents and so on.  Such incidents arising in the Malahide area are reported primarily to Garda Central Control at Dublin Castle but they are also reported to Malahide station itself, to the district headquarters at Coolock, the divisional headquarters at Whitehall and may indeed be reported to any station.  Statistics of such incidents cannot be readily extracted from the records at these centres and the compilation of the figures would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

We have in operation in the city since last July a system whereby quite a number of gardaí are available for additional patrols, particularly at certain times of the day or night as thought fit by the Garda authorities.  These patrols have been very effective and they have been welcomed by the Garda and the community. If the Garda chief superintendent for the area feels there is a need for additional patrols over and above what are already there, provision will be made to help him out in this regard.  I am quite prepared to consider that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to his Question on 26 February 1980, in which I explained the issues involved in considering the question whether the erection of new stations at places such as Portmarnock was the best way of providing effective policing in the areas.  As indicated in that reply, essentially the same issues arise in a number of areas, and certain pilot schemes may have to be introduced for test purposes before taking firm decisions in the matter.</P>
      <P>The current position is that a Manpower Deployment Study Team have carried out a detailed examination of how the most effective police service can be provided for all developing areas in Dublin city and county and the results of this examination are being considered at present.  Until this process has been completed a firm decision cannot be taken regarding new policing arrangements for areas such as Portmarnock.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants information by way of an answer to a supplementary question, I will give it to him.  There are gardaí operating in the Portmarnock area.  The question is whether there is a police station there. At present a survey is being conducted there by a manpower deployment study team and this team comprise members of the Garda Research and Planning Unit and members of the Operations Research Unit of the Department of the Public Service.  They are examining the area with a view to ascertaining how places such as Portmarnock can best be served in terms of policing.

      <P>The distribution of the business of the High Court among the several judges is a statutory function of the President of the High Court and I understand from him that the pressure of business coming before the High Court in areas other than family law has been such that he has been able to assign only one judge at a time to deal with family law business.</P>
      <P>The Government have recently appointed an additional judge of the High Court and it is the President's intention, with effect from the commencement of next term, that is, 27 April, to have two High Court judges dealing full time with family law business.</P>
      <P>Further relief in this area is provided for in the Courts Bill, 1980, which is at present before the Seanad and which proposes, inter alia, to confer a considerable amount of the family law jurisdiction at present being exercised by the High Court on the Circuit and District Courts, thereby enabling litigants, who now have to come to Dublin to have their cases disposed of, to have such matters dealt with locally.</P>

      <P>The general reorganisation of the Defence Forces which was put into operation in September 1979 takes cognisance of the requirements of modern military thinking and the particular needs of our Defence Forces and their roles, training and equipment.  The structure of the Defence Forces as a whole and of many corps, and so on in particular have been subjected to intensive review over the past decade resulting in the revision of the ranks of many appointments.  The percentage of non-commissioned officer appointments has risen from 28.8 per cent in 1969 to 33.8 per cent in 1980.</P>

      <P>Under a review, in 1978, of the scheme for the assignment of cadets and officers of the Army to courses of third level education, cadets appointed in 1978 and subsequent years did not attend university as part of their cadet course.  Instead, on being commissioned as officers, those who were considered suitable and who were willing to undergo such courses were assigned to third level courses.  All the officers who were commissioned in 1979 and 1980, with the exception of six officers who were selected to commence pilot training in 1980, were assigned to full time courses of third level education.</P>
      <P>The amount provided in 1979 and 1980 for attendance at third level courses of education were the amounts which were expected to be required to meet the cost of attendance of officers at such courses and were adequate for this purpose. It is intended to continue the practice of assigning newly commissioned officers to third level courses and I am satisfied that the amount provided in the current year will be adequate to meet the cost of such attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Keeffe</b> asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement on the escape of two men from Mountjoy Prison within the last 24 hours; and whether the Minister is prepared to say what steps are being taken to ensure that there is no recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary reports available to me indicate that two prisoners, members of a working party of nine who were engaged in food preparation in an area adjoining the kitchen, escaped from Mountjoy Prison at about 7.15 a.m. today.  The escape was effected by the prisoners climbing over a boundary wall with the aid of a high door which had been brought to the area in question by contractors engaged in building operations. The detailed circumstances surrounding the escape are being investigated.</P>
      <P>As regards steps to ensure there is no recurrence, I must make it quite clear that Mountjoy Prison is not a high security prison and that in it, as in other prisons, a choice has to be made between a regime that seeks to maximise security and a regime that is reasonably liberal. That involves a calculated acceptance of the fact that escapes are liable to occur from time to time.  To put this in perspective, I would point out that prison escapes are commonplace in other countries but, except in those cases where they involve persons known to be dangerous or to have been involved in some major crime or something of that kind, we hear nothing about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is established practice when an escape occurs to investigate fully the circumstances and to take such remedial action as the circumstances permit.  This includes the taking of appropriate action if the escape is due to culpable negligence on behalf of any individual or individuals. This kind of investigation is based on a <Col N="1355" /> basic policy that, while the risk of escape must be accepted, this cannot excuse any negligence on the part of staff charged with the custody of prisoners.  I must nevertheless make it clear that, while any negligence that might be involved is taken very seriously, this does not and cannot mean that I could give an assurance that there cannot be any further escapes.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies who put down the question want to ensure that secure custody is to be sought as the paramount objective of the prisons they can say goodbye to all those schemes we are operating to improve the lot of prisoners.  Even then, security would be less than absolute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We support completely and unequivocally a balanced approach to this question and we wish the schemes which are being introduced belatedly every success.  Is the Minister satisfied with the situation in which there has been a very high number of escapes or abscondings over a period of time?  Specifically will he now undertake, or has he already undertaken, an examination or review of areas of our prison system which could be argued to be especially vunerable, and some of which we discussed in this House before and in respect of which the Minister has given some commitment &mdash; for example, wood yards and areas like that?</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister referred to negligence on the part of the staff.  Does he accept that, where requests were made over a period of time by governors and staff of these institutions which were not responded to sympathetically by the Department of Justice, he would not imply automatically that there was negligence whenever an escape took place when the necessary precautions sought by the staff were not granted by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of what the Deputy is saying has nothing whatsoever to do with this question.  I have given a reasonable account of what happened.  Nothing the Deputy suggested today or in past contributions in <Col N="1356" /> the House would have helped the situation. I accept his sincerity when he says one must try to maintain a balance.  That is very important.  The Deputy must also accept the fact that escapes can take place.  There has not been a very high level of escapes, although Deputy O'Keeffe has tried to maintain that there has.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the past 12 months there were three escapes.  There were a number of absconders from open centres. There were two absconders from Shelton and 32 from Shanganagh.  These are open prisons.  I do not think the fact that these people absconded from these open prisons means that they should be closed down.  Nothing the Deputy has said would have prevented what happened last night.  It appears &mdash; an investigation is taking place and that is why I say it appears &mdash; that a builder who is involved in a building scheme within the prison had some doors delivered late yesterday evening.  Two of these doors were not put into position last night and one in particular was left where it should not have been left.  The two gentlemen in question decided to use a door up against a wall.

When I raised the question of prison escapes on 19 February he said that from the start of the year to 19 February there had been a total of 23 escapes and abscondings.  He also told me that, arising out of an escape from Mountjoy, steps had been taken to remedy the deficiencies which had been brought to light to prevent further escapes.

I do not propose to have that type of regime in Mountjoy Prison.  If I did, the daily temporary release scheme would fall by the wayside.  The community works scheme would fall by the wayside.  There would have to be cut-backs in recreation, on visits by prisoners' families and friends, and in workshop operations.

      <P>A high proportion of the jobs lost during the current recession will be quickly regained as trading conditions improve because of the fact that a higher than average proportion of them has resulted from firms letting people go and remaining in business rather than from outright closures.  The same cannot be said, as I discovered yesterday at the Industry Council in the Netherlands, in respect of many other European countries where the heaviest losses have occurred in sectors of industry like steel, ship-building and motor cars in which prospects of recovery to the previous levels of employment are either dismal or non-existent.  In spite of this recession industrial job creation here had its best ever year last year.</P>

      <P>By achieving a total of 35,000 job approvals the IDA substantially surpassed its own target of 30,000. It is confident that in 1981 it can break its own record.  It has set a target to negotiate and approve industrial products during the year with the potential to generate <Col N="1510" /> 36,000 new jobs in manufacturing and service industries.</P>
      <P>Irish industry is expected to provide over 50 per cent of these jobs and more than 10,000 of them are likely to come from small indigenous firms.  Despite the difficult worldwide economic situation the IDA are confident that the present high level of activity can be continued. Manufacturing investment in 1981 is expected to be £700 million representing a volume increase of 8 per cent on the record figure achieved in 1980.  During 1981 the IDA will intensify its efforts to encourage all its clients, existing and potential, to broaden the scope of their investment.  It will aim at total business concept, which is new in its promotions here and it will encourage such companies to consider investment not just in production plans, which has been the invariable practice up to now, but also in the establishment of research and development facilities and the setting up of marketing, servicing and head office type functions.  A concerted drive will also be undertaken to increase the volume of local purchasing.  I believe this development will strengthen our industrial base further, ensure a greater level of linkage by overseas companies and provide greater employment opportunities for our growing population.</P>
      <P>The availability of the new 10 per cent tax rate on manufacturing profits is a major new incentive for companies selling on the domestic market.  It is of considerable benefit particularly to indigenous industry, which should be unceasing in its efforts to maximise the benefits and opportunities which it presents.  Many of our newly-established small manufacturing companies were born out of the needs of large industry.  I am confident this new rate of tax will prove a significant incentive for greater development of interim industry linkage.  The IDA and SFADCo will both encourage domestic small industry fully to exploit the opportunity which this new tax rate presents to maximise the opportunities arising from the setting up of major projects both at their construction and operating stages and to exploit any opportunity for export substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> I am sure the House is well aware of the dramatic growth which has taken place in the electronics industry in recent years.  I do not propose to go over that well-trodden ground again today.  Suffice it to say that more than £350 million has been committed to date by overseas electronics companies in fixed asset investment in over 70 manufacturing facilities. Today the industry provides employment for over 14,000 people and produces a wide variety of electronic products ranging from micro-processors to medical and scientific instruments to large computer systems.</P>
    <P>This investment would not have taken place and neither would employment have been created on such a scale if the IDA planners had not the foresight to recognise the growth potential of the industry.  This potential was recognised back in the early seventies and they responded by undertaking an intensive marketing drive to persuade the key names in the industry throughout the world to locate in Ireland.  The planners in the IDA have not been idle since the early seventies.  They continue to monitor international trends which have taken place as a result of rapid technological advances.  This monitoring is constantly taking place to alert the IDA to new areas of potential growth and to allow them to react swiftly and effectively when new areas are identified.  The intention is to get this country involved in the major new areas of technological development at the earliest stages.  In that way, as our experience with electronic industry has demonstrated, the most benefit will accrue.</P>
    <P>The forward thinkers are now turning their attention to the possibilities presented by the growing demand for technical services.  In 1973 the IDA introduced their present service industries programme on a pilot basis.  This programme has been moderately successful and is expected to generate 1,500 job approvals this year.  The IDA have recognised the growth capacity of the services industry particularly in the technical sector. That sector has a much greater potential for generating high quality <Col N="1512" /> employment and substantial foreign exchange earnings than have been tapped to date.  This area is seen as being complementary to the sophisticated manufacturing base which is being built up here at present.  An example of this can be taken from the electronics industry.  For example, ten years ago computer services, data processing and software hardly existed as a separate entity.  Now more individually tailored software is the fastest growing sector of the computer industry which is itself a high flier.  American and European trade associations have both forecast their respective markets to grow at 6 per cent per annum over the next five years.  This puts the estimated value of the computer services industry at around £6,000 million in Europe and at £80,000 million in the US by 1983.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the changing relationship between the hardware and software costs in data processing.  The hardware costs of computers are increasingly being overwhelmed by the software costs.  Deficiencies in software capability may prove in many countries to be the greatest inhibition on further hardware investment and development.  The Government recognise that the needs of the technical services sector are primarily people-orientated and that it relies more on intellect than on capital equipment.  It is therefore an important target sector in the national effort to create professional employment for school leavers and graduates. The Government also recognise that, if we are to fully exploit the potential of this sector, an incentive package must be designed which takes into account the special features of the sector. In the past the IDA relied on a combination of training grants, capital grants and the tax incentive of export profits sales relief to attract companies in the technical services sector to Ireland.  Their success in this field has been limited by the fact that this sector is not at all capital intensive and, accordingly, the attraction of capital grants for potential companies is significantly reduced.  Recognising the enormous potential of this sector for us in the 1980's and beyond, the Government have decided to equip the IDA with a specially designed incentive package. <Col N="1513" /> Accordingly, I intend introducing legislation in the Dáil in the next few weeks to amend the Industrial Development Acts to allow the IDA to approve special employment grants towards the employment of persons in service industries which contribute significantly to regional and national development.  This is a totally new development in our industrial and job creation strategy.  Our obligations under the EEC Treaty require that new incentive schemes be approved by the Commission and such approval is now being sought.</P>
    <P>The main differences between an employment grant and the normal IDA capital grant will be that in the case of the employment grant it is not related to the creation of capital equipment but to the provision of employment.  This new incentive is designed to assist promoters in meeting part of their payroll costs, which is the main operating cost for a technical services industry project during the first and critical year of the project. It is considered that more than half of the supporting jobs in this sector will be of a graduate, professional or technical nature or of a similarly high quality.  The IDA will continue to utilise training grants as a major incentive for this sector. This is a particularly attractive form of incentive from our point of view because up to 55 per cent of such grants are usually recoverable from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>This sector is particularly suitable for Ireland because by its nature its capital costs are small, its transportation costs are negligible, it is a low energy user, it creates high quality employment by requiring brain power, which we do not lack, it earns substantial foreign exchange and therefore makes a contribution to our balance of payments.  Other advantages relate to the fact that service projects entail little importation of capital goods or of raw materials.  The vital ingredient for success is the expertise of the labour force.  We have now, through the efforts of our second and third level educational institutions, the best equipped young generation ever to emerge from here.</P>
    <P>The IDA have identified key areas in <Col N="1514" /> the technical services sector on which they will concentrate their activities when they have the new incentive package to offer in respect of computer software services, design and planning, commercial testing laboratories, headquarters operations, research and development, both free standing and otherwise, and contract research centres.  The proposed programme is deliberately selective and based on a detailed examination of a wide range of service sectors which have a potential for new job creation and are strategically important to future economic and industrial development.  This list of areas is indicative of current priorities and it does not mean that worthwhile projects in other areas will be precluded. In pushing ahead with this intensive programme we will endeavour to stimulate indigenous efforts to the greatest possible extent as well as seeking to attract major growth companies from overseas.  This development will rely heavily on an improvement taking place in our telecommunications and transportation networks.  The Government are confident that, as a result of a massive programme of investment which we have undertaken, the essential infrastructure will be in place when it is required.  The recent marked improvement in telecommunications in the past year are very heartening.</P>
    <P>I expect that this new incentive policy for these services will result in the annual creation of 5,000 jobs in this sector by 1985.  The new programme will represent a much smaller cost to the State in terms of job creation than the existing IDA manufacturing programme.  This is not to say that we will weaken in our resolve to provide additional manufacturing employment but that the two programmes will go hand in glove.  I will refer to the electronics industry once again to illustrate this point.  The provision of specialised computer software services is a further step along the road towards maximising the benefit associated with having some of the most go-ahead producers of computer hardware in the world manufacturing here.  This is the type of progressive integration that the IDA, under this new and imaginative <Col N="1515" /> programme, will seek to achieve in other areas.</P>
    <P>The second half of this decade will see ever-increasing worldwide demand for technical services and information.  The new incentive package with which the Government propose to equip the IDA will make it possible for Ireland to be in on the ground floor of such development and for us to capitalise on the opportunities presented for employment creation. I see this sector charting the way forward into the 1990's and beyond.  This sector will be complementary to the sophisti&mdash; cated manufacturing sector already established.  Together they have a major role to play in helping us achieve our twin objectives of full employment and a rise in the standard of living for all.  The success of our economic performance in the last four years must be measured against the record of other developing economies to be fully appreciated.  The level of increase in manufacturing investment from output and exports speak for themselves. There can be no argument against hard facts.  The Government's policy of accelerating productive investment has underpinned this successful outcome. Our investment has been very high during the last two years, with fixed investment running at an average level of over 13 per cent of GNP.  Among OECD countries this ratio has been matched only by Japan.  This has been one of the most favourable features of our economy and it is why we were able to achieve last year a record level of new job approvals.</P>
    <P>This Government are determined to remain growth-oriented despite the present state of world economic activity and demand.  The more investment there is today, the more jobs there will be tomorrow when the current recession has passed.  One of our primary objectives now it to maintain growth in our manufacturing output and industrial production. There is no other way to develop a modern economy except through growth in manufacturing output.  Living standards cannot be maintained or improved unless the productive sector is expanding and expansion can be achieved only by <Col N="1516" /> manufacturing goods at international prices and marketing them effectively. Our objective is to beat the problem of rising costs by improving efficiency in every activity throughout the economy, by changing our attitudes to productivity, by improving the infrastructure, by helping our young people to grasp the opportunities of tomorrow's world of technology, by making a determined effort to switch from imports and by redoubling our export sales efforts.  Our aim is to increase the output of all the productive sectors of our economy, to raise living standards and create employment.  In fact, we cannot afford low productivity in any sector of the economy, whether in the productive sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, or in support services, such as transport, construction, the public service or commerce.  What we need is a national commitment to eliminate inefficiency, waste of any kind and, if we still have it, complacency.</P>
    <P>Measures in the Finance Bill to stimulate investment by private enterprise in infrastructural projects, such as rented accommodation, multi-storey car parks, toll roads and bridges, will help maintain employment levels in the construction industry and will underpin our economic development thrust in coming years. The Government's investment commitment, £360 million, has been earmarked in the investment plan for industry alone during 1981 and the introduction of the 10 per cent corporation profits tax rate in during 1981 for manufacturing industry are positive measures which should contribute to helping Irish industry to weather the present difficult period and to face the challenges of the eighties.  And challenges there will be.  However, we should not be dismayed by these challenges.  We must not allow ourselves to become discouraged by the present temporary economic difficulties.  These are serious and difficult times, but we should not forget that we have many strengths in our industrial sector built up over the last quarter of a century.  We have, perhaps for the first time in our history, a reasonably healthy industrial base, with competent managment personnel who know what they can achieve, who know they can <Col N="1517" /> measure up to competitive international standards.  We have some of the most modern factories in Europe, with a solid base, and the new growth industries of chemicals, electronics and pharmaceuticals. This is an economy in which young Irish businessmen can experience the best international management practices and be exposed to the latest technological developments.  It is an economy in which these young Irish businessmen should be and are being stimulated and motivated to set up indigenous companies to complement the trust of the foreign multinationals and to go on to develop new overseas markets for new, innovative products designed and made in this country. In this regard I am particularly pleased to see, during the last three years in particular, the growth of indigenous industry and the emergence of high quality native managers and entrepreneurs to manage these industries.  I have initiated and encouraged this trend because I believe it is the way of the future.  I believe that over the decade of the eighties the growth potential for small industries will be greater than ever due to the increasing number of spin-off opportunities now arising from new, larger scale industries.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the eighties will see a vast array of new businesses and job creation opportunities becoming available to Irish entrepreneurs and managers. I believe we can face the challenge of the years ahead in a spirit of optimism based on our record, our resources and our prospects.  We have now built up a momentum of economic growth which will carry us forward and which, with proper guidance, can be sustained.  There are very few countries I can think of that have the opportunities or the potential of Ireland.  We have a strong national policy, we know what our goals are, we have a solid agricultural base, a modern industrial structure, growing skills of management and a small share of international trade.  The economic fundamentals of Ireland are, in my view, unique in the opportunities they afford our people if we wish to grasp them.  Our own greed, as expressed in a desire for incomes and social services greater than the economy <Col N="1518" /> can bear, and our conservative resistance to change and innovation are the only things in the long-term that will kill that chance.  Cyclical things, like the present world recession, only temporarily delay progress.  If we decide to kill that chance, then it will have been our decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of this Government to our economic problems, as expressed in the Finance Bill and in the speech of the Minister for Finance when introducing it here yesterday, reminds me powerfully of a death bed conversion, or, which is rather different, of an attempt to persuade the electorate that a death bed conversion has in fact taken place.  Of course, we know it has not.  But from the opposite benches there has come a stream of speeches, many of them tailored almost as if we had been in Government for the last four years, stating that measures are now being taken to put the things that are wrong right and to put the country back on the road to prosperity. There is no account of how it got diverted from the road to prosperity, apart from the odd statutory reference to the oil crisis, which of course is real enough.  It reminds me of the story of the long time sinner who was finally persuaded by his grieving family on his death bed to have the priest in.  The priest came to see him, went through all the rituals and, coming towards the end of these, asked the dying but still conscious sinner: &ldquo;Do you now renounce the devil and all his works and pomps?&rdquo; Something stuck in the old man's throat and he said: &ldquo;Hold on now.  This is no time to be antagonising anybody.&rdquo;  This is the kind of financial and economic response we have by the Government to our very serious economic problems, which at least in part &mdash; we can always argue about how much in part &mdash; are their responsibility for having created.  They like to give the impression of repentance.  They like to give the impression that things will be all right, if only from now on we follow their nostrums, we accept their good faith and believe in their collective wisdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the other thing to pay attention to is the fact that in the orchestra on the benches on the far side of the House <Col N="1519" /> there are different players with different instruments.  When the occasion suits them they will be gloom and doom merchants and, when the occasion suits again, they will be the people who will say that everything is getting better. There are, for public consumption, two Fianna Fáils, the Fianna Fáil of the Taoiseach and the other Fianna Fáil.  I was amused by a reference in a paper the other day to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, describing him as the Opposition's favourite Minister. Having listened to his speech here this afternoon, there is little favour we could find with many of its aspects &mdash; and there are one or two other aspects to which I will come in a moment.  But, if there is an idea abroad that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is the Opposition's favourite Minister, then I should like to take whatever steps I can to disabuse people of this notion.  There is perhaps reason for this because the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is well known for his habit of extending two metaphorical fingers in the direction of his Taoiseach whenever he feels the humour on him to do so. Whether on economic issues, the North or anything else, the Taoiseach can barely move a step without an O'Malley fire cracker exploding somewhere around his feet.  Of course there is some interest and amusement on this side of the House when the internal tensions of that party and Government become so publicly visible &mdash; they divert us, but they are no more than a diversion.  I have to say in relation to this party, that there are no favourite Ministers in Fianna Fáil.  We are in a state of deep gloom when we see them individually and collectively.  They are all in it together.  Whatever their public relations, whatever their fancy footwork, whatever their attempt to present themselves as the acceptable face of a modern capitalist party, there is no such thing, as far as those benches are concerned, as any acceptable face of a party like Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The electorate will be invited, when considering the Government's economic performance, to vote in favour of this <Col N="1520" />&ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; face of Fianna Fáil rather than the unacceptable face of Fianna Fáil.  It is our job to persuade them that there is no such thing, that if you vote for any Fianna Fáil candidate, no matter how charming and likeable he is, you are voting for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the economic policies they have introduced and maintained in the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the degree of unreality which now attaches to those economic policies that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism can come in here and say that the fundamental purpose of the Government is designed to maintain growth.  He might deserve a hearing if there was any growth to maintain. Growth has been axed to the roots and everybody from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Irish Industry, farming organisations and every organisation in between are almost universally convinced that we will be very lucky if we get growth off the base line this year.  We have to agree with the Minister when he says that growth is ultimately the answer to the economic problems we find ourselves in.  The political and ideological disagreements arise in relation to the instruments by which that growth can best be encouraged and fostered.</P>
    <P>We find a degree of schizophrenia on the Government side that is amazing and one wonders why people continue to accept it so much.  On the one hand the Government are preaching a principle of private enterprise and saying that private enterprise is the motor of the economy and, on the other hand, there is a degree of interventionism by the Government, although it certainly does not go as far as we would like and is not as subtle or as flexible as we would like it to be, but is, nevertheless, in total contrast to the ostensible rhetoric they come out with in defence of the private enterprise system. We have, for quite some time, had a substantial interventionist policy in relation to manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, following his mentor, the Minister for Energy, in releasing his Ard Fheis speech in advance this afternoon, <Col N="1521" /> has now indicated to us that he proposes to bring in legislation to extend the scope of the activities of the IDA to the service sector.  We are not against interventionism but we believe it should be described as what it is.  We also believe that if an Irish Government adopt interventionist policies they should be in a position to claim some of the fruits of that intervention directly rather than simply allocating grants and other kinds of subventions, with a few or no strings attached, to private industry, which may or may not be efficient and may or may not be socially responsible.</P>
    <P>The service sector will be of growing importance in the Ireland of the future. It is only logical that any interventionist policy should be extended from manufacturing industry into the service sector although we will have to hold judgment until we see the small print of the scheme the Minister proposes before we can tell if there is a requisite degree of public accountability and social accountability for this massive extension of State financing. We must also ask the Minister, when we start thinking seriously about the most basic resource we have, the six inches of soil which lies on the top of Ireland, when will he instruct or encourage the IDA or some other body set up for the purpose to do something about providing industrial and service jobs, which are not just based on Government handouts, grants and subventions, but on an intelligent, methodical exploitation of our renewable resources, which are the most precious resources we have and which we possess to a degree which virtually no other European country does.</P>
    <P>The Irish climate is a cross for all of us to bear but it also ensures we can grow and produce agricultural produce better almost than any other country in Europe. We have yet to apply to the agricultural sector the kind of management, investment and encouragement which the industrial sector has been receiving for many years and the service sector is now to receive as well.  We are approaching the thing from the wrong end.  The results are plain to see.  They are continuing job losses in industries, which are very often founded by multinational companies and <Col N="1522" /> which prove to be too fragile to exist for any extended length of time in the conditions of free trade or which are upset by any momentary worsening of recessionary trends.  At the same time, we are experiencing a massive shortfall in agricultural incomes and the flight from the land.  One wonders if there will be anybody left to fly in ten or 20 years time.  At the same time, the problems of adequately funding our social services are exacerbated by the fact that we have the highest dependence ratio of any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is easy to see, looking back on it, why successive Governments have gone for the strategy I have been criticising rather than the one I am suggesting.  This is because nothing can provide a job more quickly than a multi-national company with an IDA grant package and a heap of tax incentives.  This policy of &ldquo;never mind the quality, feel the width&rdquo; has resulted in the short-term provision of a lot of jobs in the country but it has failed to tackle the underlying structural problem of providing an industrial base related to our indigenous resources and particularly to downstream agricultural based industries.  When there is a recession in the countries from which much of this investment and many of those jobs come, when the technology with which they have provided us becomes a little bit too expensive to operate here by comparison with the countries in the Far East, when OPEC raise their prices yet again, these countries will draw in their tentacles and Ireland, as the furthest outstretched tentacle, will be the first one to be withdrawn.  There is considerable doubt as to whether this policy which has produced jobs in the short term, and I am not against jobs in any way, will be successful in the long term or whether it will end up simply with the IDA continuously resupplying jobs to meet the job needs caused by the redundancies in other IDA industries there were put in ten or 15 years previously.  Even now, though the industries are not the same industries that were put in then, the number of redundancies is noticeably in excess of the number of jobs being created.  We are running very hard but not even in order to stay in <Col N="1523" /> the same place.  We are running very hard but we are travelling inexorably backwards. The moving staircase is too fast for us to catch up with.</P>
    <P>In response to all these problems which even the Government must admit to, all they can offer us is more of the same.  It is true that any intelligent and reasonable economic policy will, for the next few years, involve some belt tightening but it is equally true that, first, the belt tightening that will be needed will be substantially worse than would have been the case if Fianna Fáil had not been in power for the past four years and also that it will be much more difficult to secure national understandings or anything of that kind if people see that the axe is not being wielded on a uniform basis and that some people are being asked to bear more of the cuts than is the case with other people.</P>
    <P>In this context the tax system is of critical importance.  I have almost come to the conclusion now that the Government are losing heart in their attempts to persuade taxpayers that we are on the way to introducing a fair system of taxation. We know that wealth tax has been abolished.  I shall not weary the House with a repetition of that but what is less publicly known is that the yield from the capital gains tax has been reduced by 70 per cent compared with the tax that was enforced when the Coalition were in office.</P>
    <P>Because people have short memories they forget that these various taxes &mdash; the wealth tax, the capital gains tax and the other capital taxes &mdash; that were introduced by the previous Government were intended to replace death duties which were being abolished.  Now not only have death duties been abolished but so have all the taxes that were introduced to replace them.  In this year alone if death duties were in existence at their previous level, there would have been at least £40 million to £50 million more coming into the Exchequer.  I doubt that that would have been sufficient to do everything that needs to be done but it would have been better than a slap on the belly with a wet <Col N="1524" /> fish which is all the Government are offering at this time.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to consider the alleged tax concessions announced by the Government.  I use the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; because instead of tax concessions we have tax impositions.  It flies in the face of the ordinary use of language to describe what the Government are doing as a tax concession.  On 24 February 1981 I asked the Minister for Finance the amount of extra finance he expects to collect in income tax in 1981-1982 compared with 1980-1981 and the amount by which that sum will exceed the cost of the income tax concessions for 1981-1982 as announced in the budget.  The answer was that tax estimates are prepared by reference to financial years and that it is estimated that the increase in income tax collection in 1981 compared with 1980 will be £131 million and that the cost of the income tax concessions as announced in this year's budget is estimated at £66 million for this year.</P>
    <P>If one subtracts £66 million from £131 million, one is left with £65 million.  In other words, the net imposition of this budget in terms of income tax is of the order of £65 million.  The Minister tried to put a brave face on the matter later by pointing out that to help him balance his books he wanted to add the cost of the concessions announced in the 1980 budget.  The logic of this escapes me because if we are to add the cost of the concessions of the 1980 budget, why could we not go back to the 1979, to the 1978, to the 1977 or to any other budget? Why stop anywhere?  I do not think that the taxpayers are being fooled.  I am convinced that they are very much aware, perhaps silently but some of them sullenly aware, that the alleged concessions are not concessions in any sense.</P>
    <P>What impertinence, then, on the part of the Minister in announcing in the budget as a concession the slight addition in the PAYE allowance, an addition that was wrung out of him at the midnight hour by the negotiators in the national understanding talks.  We all knew that was coming but it was put into the budget by the Minister as if he had just discovered <Col N="1525" /> it under a head of cabbage at the end of the garden.</P>
    <P>There is one small point of detail to which, in the interest of equity, I should like to draw the Minister's attention and which would cost virtually nothing to put right by way of an amendment to the Finance Bill.  I refer to the situation in which if a man marries before the end of the tax year and if the woman he marries in dependent on him in the sense that she does not have a job outside the home, he is entitled to a refund of tax for the year in which he marries.  However, the reverse does not apply if a woman who is working outside the home marries a man who is not so employed.  I hope that the Minister will right this small anomaly.</P>
    <P>Also, not only for the Ard Fheis or from the point of view of Fianna Fáil's election manifesto, I invite him to include in the Finance Bill something concerning the taxation of bank profits.  I was amused to read in the newspapers this week that a prominent accountant had defended the financial, economic and profit structure of the banks.  I have no doubt but that the gentleman concerned is an excellent accountant but to hear him defend the banks is like hearing an alcoholic defend the pubs.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank in their submission to the Commission on Taxation have estimated that if the banks were paying tax on their profits in the same way as other businesses pay tax on their profits, there would be an extra £40 million accruing to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank are not exactly populated by revolutionaries waving red flags or charging up and down corridors screaming for people's heads and if they assess the true tax liability if the banks were to be assessed on the same basis as other companies and come up with the figure of £40 million more than the banks are actually paying, there is something obviously wrong.</P>
    <P>Banks are sometimes generous to their clients.  They do not foreclose and so on but we should be very careful in assessing whether this is paper generosity or actual generosity.  The inescapable facts are that banks that have lent unwisely, that have allowed people to use bank finance to <Col N="1526" /> buy, perhaps, non-productive assets, to buy at too high a price and to repay during too long a period, have no option but to hold back.  The banks have a vested interest in the survival of those who owe them money.  There is nothing generous about that.  It is pure self-interest, the instinct for survival but to describe it as some kind of altruism stretches credibility to the very limit.</P>
    <P>In relation to tax, I should like to bring to the Minister's attention a question I asked on 2 April.  In his budget speech and generally this Minister and the Government have placed considerable emphasis on indirect taxation.  I asked the Minister the VAT refunds in each of the past five years and what percentage of VAT in each year such refunds represented. The Minister told me that in 1979 21.7 per cent of all VAT collected was issued again in refunds and in 1980 that proportion had risen to 28.2 per cent; £184.6 million collected in VAT was given back to traders and other suppliers in refunds.  I am not saying that they were not entitled to refunds but there is plainly a major financial problem here if there is such a rising graph of refunds as a proportion of revenue in such a major item of indirect taxation.  I would ask the Minister to give some attention to this matter and to tell me whether there is something as sinister in it as there appears to be.</P>
    <P>From the Government benches, the CII and other conservative sources of inspiration and alleged economic wisdom there is one simple answer to all our problems, namely, that people should take home less in wages, that they should produce more and accept less than the rise in the cost of living in order to safeguard jobs and safeguard our economy. <i>The Irish Banking Review,</i> which is published by the Irish banks and which, no more than the Central Bank, could be regarded as a source of radical and revolutionary comment, points out in its March issue, in an extended article on productivity, that industrial productivity in Ireland is actually marginally above that in Britain and, secondly and more importantly, that there is no necessary correlation between incomes and economic chaos.  It identifies the fact that, <Col N="1527" /> apart from Britain and one or two other countries, Irish productivity can be assessed as lower than in other countries. However, it goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The very fact that these estimated levels of productivity are lower in Ireland than in Europe suggests that changes in technology, economic structure and dependency ratios could give Ireland a higher material standard of living (as conventionally measured) than at present.</P>
    <P>There is nothing here about working people pegging their demands or about forcing people to work longer hours or for less money.  There is a very strong suggestion that technological changes, changes in the economic structure and in the dependency ratio, which are rather more difficult to achieve and take a longer time, are the long-term answer to our economic problems.</P>
    <P>In the coming election the electorate will have one central economic question to decide: whom do they want to see presiding over changes in the economic structure of this country?  When they look at the changes which have taken place in our economic structure during the past four years they would be very ill advised to entrust that task again to a Fianna Fáil administration.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cluskey is still an unbeliever and a cynic and does not believe that the telephones work.  His view is a reflection on the labour force in the Department who are, in my view, doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>The Opposition asked for an economic debate but, following their contributions, one must ask whether they have availed of this opportunity.  There were calls time and again for such a debate, which should be concerned with the handling of the economy by the Government.  If the Opposition believe that the economy is going in the wrong direction, surely some suggestions could have been forthcoming. I would have expected Fine Gael to let us know their economic policy since this was very much fudged over at their recent Ard-Fheis.  Have they got such a policy?  If so, what is it all about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused at Deputy John Kelly's recipe for reversing economic decline during his speech to that Ard Fheis.  He said that with Fine Gael there is only a will and that the road back to economic recovery is a narrow, stoney path to national solvency and self-respect.  I hope he takes the opportunity in this debate of spelling out exactly what this means.  I and many others believe he is talking about right-wing monetarism as practised by Mrs. Thatcher.  If so, let him spell it out. If this is not what he means, perhaps we should listen to what his leader said.  He was obviously afraid of what Deputy Kelly had said.  Deputy FitzGerald said that in no circumstances whatsoever would his party embark on the pursuit of some straitjacket policy which would risk causing more unemployment and more doom in the economy.  What is he trying to convey to the Irish public?  I had hoped he would take the opportunity to speak in this debate and tell us what he really means, which I believe to be the exact opposite to what Deputy Kelly means. He is trying to take a middle-of-the-road path and shade his economic policy towards acceptance by his marriage-partners-to-be sitting opposite.  He is <Col N="1529" /> trying to be all things to all men and this is not possible.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that we are in an economic recession, the worst since the thirties.  It is even worse than the recession in the post-war period.  The question concerns what the Government are doing about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are quite clear about the road we are taking, but I am not sure that the Opposition know which road they are on because they cannot read the signs.  We have said quite clearly that we will not choose unemployment as an instrument to solve our economic difficulties. In relation to the current deficit in the budget, we say that we will phase it out over a period and we make no apologies to anybody for borrowing for infrastructural purposes.  We are doing the jobs which are necessary to enable the economy to grow from a proper infrastructural base.</P>
      <P>In this regard telecommunications has a major role to play.  For the first time there has been a recognition that one of the greatest retarding factors in the development of our economy is the lack of adequate telecommunications services, whether for industrial development, for social use so that people have an equal opportunity of communicating, or whether it be in the furtherance of this Government's policy of decentralisation and regionalisation.  In 1980 we spent £123 million in the development of communications and this year we will spend £220 million.  This Government are putting their money where their mouth is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I had only ten minutes <Col N="1530" /> because the Opposition wasted time fighting over small points.  This is a debate about the direction of the economy and where we should be going.  I believe there is fuddled thinking on the Opposition benches.  One Deputy wants to go right, another left and a third wants to go to the middle.  We are going in a straight line and stating our policy.  We are not going along the road which has had devastating effects on the British economy.  If Deputies want to know how successful that policy has been they should read yesterday's scary headlines.  In Britain a total of 2,263 firms failed in the first three months of this year, 174 a week compared with 160 a week in the last quarter of 1980.  We are not following that road, although we believe there are people on the other benches who would.  They do not have the guts to come out and say that and want to hide behind smoke-screens, as they have always done.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the policy being followed in Britain which is not suitable to Ireland.  There was a shock to the correction of the inflation rate yesterday with the publication of manufacturing and input costs, which increased for the third month in a row.  That is not the panacea for all ills, as some people might think.  We have put our resources towards maintaining as far as possible our living standards while reflecting a social conscience by continuing Fianna Fáil policy of looking after the less well off in our society during very difficult times.  That is what we will continue to do.  That is the philosophy the Irish people have always responded to.  We are spending the money building up the infrastructure and we make no apology for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan asked where we stood in the public and private sectors.  If he cannot understand that by now I will have a very difficult job convincing anybody else where we stand.  It is quite clear from our investment plan &mdash; £1,700 million have been invested &mdash; where we stand and what we are doing.  Do the Labour Party disagree with £49 million being invested in CIE, £18.5 million in new buses which we need so badly?  Would they disagree with spending up to £60 million on the electrification of the <Col N="1531" /> Howth-Bray line to solve some of the major traffic and transport problems in the Dublin area?  If they would, let them say so, because that is where we stand in the private sector.  Would they disagree with £19 million being invested in Aer Lingus?  Would they disagree with the final balance of £2 million being invested by Aer Lingus in a £20 million project in Rathcoole?  Is that not putting investment where it will generate economic activity? Is that not spending money to create jobs at home when we know some of our major markets have been contracting?</P>
    <P>We all know consumer demand is on the floor in Great Britain and that 45 per cent of our goods are sold there.  I believe we are now looking to the areas where the real markets are.  Not alone are we in a recession but I believe we are seeing a restructuring of the world economy. Over recent years we have seen a transfer of wealth from the West to the East.  We all know that the major expertise is available in the West but the resources are in the East.  Our future lies in gathering whatever share we can of the markets in the Far East.  It was brought home very forcibly to me in the last few weeks when I backed an Irish trade mission in Libya to see what opportunities exist there, not alone for our private enterprise and exporters but also for State agencies. There are many opportunities there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is damaging to our economic prospects and social development because it enshrines provisions which have already fuelled the inflation spiral and undermined essential social services.  It is irrelevant in so far as it does nothing to get to grips with the deep-seated problems of the Irish economy. We in the Labour Party strenuously oppose the Bill for both of these reasons.</P>
      <P>The Bill has a shameful aspect also.  As one would expect from this Government, it contains further financial gifts for the speculator class who grow rich on profits earned from the social needs of their fellow citizens.  They do not deserve tax incentives; they need to be effectively and justly taxed on their profits and on their accumulated wealth.  I would remind the House that only yesterday the Dublin Stock Exchange saw many of the parasites within this community reaping hundreds of thousands of pounds of unearned capital gains as a result of share manipulation and on the basis of nothing more than rumours of oil.  What hope is there for the poor and the unemployed in a society in which many still look up to and admire such undeserving profiteers? We in the Labour Party are totally opposed to any form of tax gift to speculators.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill enshrines the budget provisions.  The budget, in theory at least, is the annual expression of Government economic and social strategy.  As such, this Bill cannot be anything other than a miserable evidence of failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> This Government's economic strategy lies in ruins.  Any pretence of planning or of management has been abandoned in favour of public relations.  No credibility whatever attaches to the Government's policies or to their predictions.  The very process of budgeting, of official estimates of receipts and spending and of policy elaboration have been brought into real and damaging disrepute.  The facts of the situation speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Economic growth has collapsed.  GNP growth in the region of 1 per cent provides absolutely no basis for a realistic assault on our great social problems and offers no hope to our growing population. This economy requires an average rate of growth in excess of 4 per cent per annum if it is to have any hope of reducing unemployment significantly and providing adequate resources for essential investment and public services.  The momentum of growth promised in the 1977 manifesto has been lost, not just because of world recession, but because of mismanagement and misdirection of resources.  Votes have been paid for rather than jobs created under Fianna Fáil's crazy priorities.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is continuing to increase in real terms.  This week's figures show a real rise of almost 2,000 on the live register over the past month.  Unemployment is now at an all-time record level of over 125,000.  Last Monday's edition of &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; very clearly underlined the depth of the human tragedy which exists where there is mass unemployment. Youth unemployment is now a major fact of Irish life &mdash; and perhaps our greatest political challenge.  Let no one forget the cynical and totally unprincipled approach of the Government to the young people of this country in 1977. Perhaps the message of &ldquo;Let's Make It Our Kind of Country&rdquo; was really directed to the property speculators and wealth tax evaders.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, which is still the country's basic economic activity, has been allowed to decline at a rate which is quite unbelievable. Almost all of the early gains of EEC membership have been frittered away in certain sectors and crucial investment has been curtailed.  The Minister <Col N="1535" /> for Agriculture, unable to act without the constant attentions of the omni-present Taoiseach, has handled the Brussels negotiations in a naive and thoroughly unprofessional manner leaving many crucial issues unprovided for, including the critical need for a calf subsidy, to rebuild the national cattle herd.</P>
    <P>The deficit in the balance of payments is, once again, becoming a major constraint on our economic development. Linked with the spiralling growth in foreign borrowing it threatens our future prospects.  There has been a great deal of misleading talk by the Minister for Finance and others about this vital subject. The fact is that the trade deficit last year was in the region of £1.3 billion and the balance of payments deficit reached £750 million, about 10 per cent of GNP. This serious situation came about despite a fall in imports because of the cutback in industrial investment.  Ireland's external competitiveness was substantially undermined by the Government's heedless and inflationary behaviour.</P>
    <P>The rate of price rises is now over 21 per cent annually.  This rate seriously jeopardises the national understanding and puts the social welfare provisions of the budget into a rather different light from that implied in the Government's propaganda. On that point let me state that &mdash; contrary to the deliberately created impressions that increases of 25 per cent had been given all round &mdash; a widow with three children on contributory pension will receive 17½ per cent and on non-contributory pension less than 17 per cent &mdash; in a year of more than 20 per cent inflation.  So much for the Government's compassion and for its honour in social matters.</P>
    <P>The public finances are deteriorating into a hideous mess.  Last year saw a budgeted deficit of £347 million on current account end up as a final deficit of £547 million, an error of £200 million or almost 60 per cent.  Exchequer borrowing amounted to 14½ per cent of GNP.  In January, just nine weeks ago, the Minister for Finance solemnly told this House that this year's deficit would be of the order of £515 million or 5¼ per cent of <Col N="1536" /> GNP.  Today, could anyone seriously believe that the final outcome will be much less than £850 million &mdash; or 8 per cent of GNP?  At that rate Exchequer borrowing will soon go to £1.6 billion, or almost 16 per cent of GNP.  These staggering figures are evidence of something that must be characterised as worse than incompetence.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the entire budgetary process is being undermined by this Government. To slightly misquote the Taoiseach, sufficient for the day are the headlines thereof.  Never mind the deliberate distortions, the creative use of figures, the manipulation of previously trustworthy official documents, such as the Book of Estimates.  Tell the people that social welfare is going up by 25 per cent when he knows the true figure is 17 or 18 per cent.  Tell the people that the deficit will be £500 million when he knows the true figure is £800 million.  It will be all right on the night, the headlines will be good. Let tomorrow look after itself.  That is the Government's deplorable approach to the budgetary process.  But one cannot fool all the people all the time and the facts are speaking for themselves today, only two months after the charade of the budget speech.  There is now not even a semblance of economic planning.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came to power they have produced four so-called planning papers, green or white.  They run to a total of about 350 pages of altogether irrelevant verbiage.  They contain some of the most remarkable economic nonsense of the age.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House of the Programme for National Development 1978-1981, published just two years ago with much PR activity and media attention. Table 2.1 of that document predicts four things for 1981:</P>
    <P>that unemployment would be no more than 23,000 &mdash; 75,000 less than at the end of 1978:</P>
    <P>that inflation would be below 5 per cent:</P>
    <P>that economic growth would be 5 per cent annually; and</P>
    <P>that the exchequer borrowing requirement  <Col N="1537" /> would be below 8 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Comment is really superfluous.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the fact that the figures are ludicrously wrong.  It is that a Government should lend themselves in the first place, to such blatant economic nonsense.  No-one who contributed to that document, including the Taoiseach who would like us all to believe that he was on Innishvickilaun between 1977 and 1979 instead of mismanaging the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, could seriously have believed those predictions. Yet they were solemnly published as the policy of the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>Planning does not exist.  It did not exist when Deputy O'Donoghue presided over his little empire round the corner.  It does not exist now when the Taoiseach presides over everything.  Planning cannot be said to exist when every word uttered by economic Ministers is belied immediately by their own actions.</P>
    <P>For example, in the 1980 budget speech the then Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;We cannot ask the taxpayer of tomorrow to pay for the services we require today.  That would be socially unfair and economically irresponsible&rdquo;. He produced a 60 per cent error in the current deficit at a cost of £200 million.</P>
    <P>This year, this Minister waxed eloquent on the same theme and said: &ldquo;Borrowing for current purposes must be reduced with all practicable speed and on an orderly basis.&rdquo;  Eight weeks later we read of new evidence that current spending is again out of control with every likelihood of a £300 million error in 1981. It is both depressing and demoralising.</P>
    <P>Planning has been abandoned.  I believe that it is this fact which, more than anything else, has hit at business confidence today.  Fianna Fáil sought re-election in 1977 on the platform of competence in economic management and they made great play of their capacity to plan and to produce orderly progress across the whole spectrum of economic activity.  Many a chamber of commerce echoed to applause for the well-phrased <Col N="1538" /> expressions of awareness and understanding&mdash;under Fianna Fáil a climate would be produced in which business would prosper as the most up-to-date techniques were applied.</P>
    <P>Today all that is evident is that far from using up-to-date techniques of commercial planning, Fianna Fáil have employed some of the most blatant old fashioned techniques of vote-catching and that they are now bereft of other ideas.  The facts, as I have said, speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have totally failed to deliver on their manifesto programme and they stand condemned for dishonesty, misleading advertising and transparent incompetence.</P>
    <P>There must be a change.  Fianna Fáil cannot, and will not, deliver that change. I believe it is necessary in this important debate to spell out the way in which Labour would bring about the change which is essential if there is to be a future of hope for the people of this young country which has become, in a real sense, the country of the young.</P>
    <P>The challenge which we now face is immense.  Our country needs to be transformed if an end is to be put to under-development, low incomes, unemployment and social injustice.  We must provide 30,000 net new jobs a year over a decade or more if we are to achieve full employment.  This will demand a rate of sustained economic growth never before achieved or even contemplated in this country.  The Irish economy will need to grow up to one-and-a-half or two times as fast as the rest of the EEC in order to approach full employment and acceptable living standards.  This will call for profound changes in past national policies.</P>
    <P>The greatest failure of the Irish economy to date has been the inability of the private enterprise system of itself to deliver full employment.  Side by side with affluence among some sections of the population and progress in certain sections of industry and agriculture, there are still many of the familiar characteristics of under-development.  Past policies have failed and if they are continued they will not succeed in the future.  The need is for a planned economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> The Labour Party's belief in a planned economy goes back to its earliest statements on economic policy.  In contrast with the other political force in the country, Labour believe that the State must accept the primary responsibility for economic development.  It must plan by directing the use of capital so that investment will go into the industries and types of agriculture which are most beneficial to the community.  In a national plan which has as its objective a thriving, expanding economy, a wide range of social services and a high level of general welfare, profit and corporate power cannot be accepted as the sole determinants of investment.</P>
    <P>Planning is essential.  By planning we do not mean a reheated and repackaged version of the discredited economic programmes of the past or the pathetic series of Green and White Papers of the present administration.  By planning we mean a cohesive national strategy for both economic and social development based upon clear and democratically accepted goals, with policy instruments and planning structures designed to mobilise all sectors in a genuine partnership.</P>
    <P>I would place very great emphasis on the question of planning structures.  In the absence of such structures it is only too easy to substitute the <i>ad hoc</i> gimmick for well thought-out strategy.  The abolition of the Department of Economic Planning and Development was a disservice to the whole concept of planning. Despite the shortcomings of that Department, and of their one and only Minister, they represented a clearly evident, official location for planning at the national level.  Not alone must there be a planning Department but there must also be a new emphasis on the planning function of the Government as a whole through a restructuring of the back-up services to the Cabinet itself.  And, the planning process must be made both democratic and participatory so that all sections of the community will be involved in decisions which affect their economic future and social well-being.</P>
    <P>Planning must concentrate upon clearly stated objectives.  I would identify <Col N="1540" /> five national objectives in the economic field which require priority attention at the present time, each one of which should be the subject of open and public debate but, above all, of firm and courageous government decision.</P>
    <P>First, the formidable job creation target of 30,000 net new jobs a year must be made the prime national policy goal.</P>
    <P>Second, the evil of sustained high inflation must be recognised and dealt with.</P>
    <P>Third, there must be a new and determined drive for growth in the economy, led by a vigorous State enterprise.</P>
    <P>Fourth, order and control must be restored to the public finances of the State within the ambit of the national plan.</P>
    <P>Fifth, there must be a real balance between the economic and social aspects of the national plan, in the interests of justice and harmony.</P>
    <P>Full employment must be restored to the position of a premier policy goal and must be sought in a realistic and determined manner.  The fatuous claim of the Government that full employment could be achieved in four or five years has done much to discredit them, but also to discredit economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>Full employment will not be tackled effectively if this country continues to follow the policies which have brought us to the present unhappy situation of 125,000 officially unemployed and perhaps 40,000 more out of work.  We must seek and apply policies which go to the heart of the problem and which carry the wholehearted support of the entire community.</P>
    <P>Within a national development plan there must be a coherent industrial strategy. This strategy must fundamentally rely on Irish resources and on the utilisation of the most advanced technologies under Irish control.  There is not the slightest possibility that private enterprise alone will meet these demands.  The State itself must provide the motor for a <Col N="1541" /> sustained and successful programme of industrial development through the rest of this century.</P>
    <P>Public enterprise must be central to the planned development of the Irish economy, leading in both technological advance and employment creation.  The public sector must be underpinned by sound legislation and by effective central administration, stressing the need for a high quality of management and for innovation. Clear objectives must be set and there must be workable structures for accountability.  All State enterprises must be properly funded through direct State equity participation.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the State sector is crucial, having regard to the scale of the economic task facing the nation.  Expansion will involve more public acquisition in key areas of economic activity, the creation of new State enterprises, especially in areas of technological advance, and a systematic programme of diversification in the existing commercial State organisations.</P>
    <P>At the centre of the expanding public sector will be a national development corporation which will supervise and promote the State manufacturing and service enterprise, define the areas of growth and technology where relevant openings exist, plan for the expansion of the State sector by all appropriate routes, and supervise the necessary State holdings in mining, offshore development and so forth.</P>
    <P>The State sector will not alone have concern for increasing the number of jobs.  It must have a leadership role in improving the quality of work.  Industrial democracy must be extended to the entire public sector and made fully meaningful by the establishment of works councils which will ensure the full participation of the work force in all aspects of development.  The example of the public sector will then be extended to the private enterprise area.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these general principles and goals, Labour's strategy for the public sector will be seen to be comprehensive and realistic.  It stresses the importance of putting effective control of major areas of the economy into public hands <Col N="1542" /> while ensuring that such a policy will result in innovation and efficiency rather than conservatism and bureaucracy.  This policy, like any other, must serve people's needs and the nation's interest and must never be allowed to become a sterile, doctrinaire position devoid of flexibility and relevance.</P>
    <P>State enterprise, properly structured and properly directed, can be the most powerful source of dynamism in an Irish economy geared to satisfy the needs of all the people.  The idea of the State sector as inefficient, uneconomic and bureaucratic has arisen because over the years there has been no coherent philosophy of State involvement in the economy. What Labour propose is a new economic structure in which society's goals are articulated in a democratically based plan and pursued through a system in which the people's own enterprises will play the major roles of leadership, innovation and effective performance.</P>
    <P>One very, practical consideration should serve to underline the need for Labour's approach to the public sector. Ireland's economy today is subject to the very real threat of an almost total takeover by, or sell-out to, foreign interests. About two-thirds of the new jobs planned by the IDA in the period up to 1982 will come from new foreign investment or from existing foreign owned undertakings. The sell-out of Irish companies in manufacturing and commerce is equivalent to the sell-out of Irish land holdings and it is not in the long-term interest of the country.</P>
    <P>A walk around any supermarket or clothing shop will show that fewer and fewer Irish-controlled brands can find shelf space.  Ireland today is seen to be an adjunct of the North of England for the marketing purposes of the multinationals. Whether the shopper is looking for cornflakes or for shirts, for biscuits or for socks the likelihood is that foreign brands will predominate or have a monopoly.  This cannot be good for our economy and it will be countered in many cases only by direct State action.  Such action is essential.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise will, of course, continue to carry much responsibility in our <Col N="1543" /> search for new and better jobs.  Its role is accepted and must be fully supported. Problems in this respect will exist only if the private sector permits itself to remain the prisoner of doctrinaire ideas about its own role since entirely new attitudes are required in today's economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The externally controlled sector of Irish manufacturing industry in 1973 accounted for almost 30 per cent of jobs, two-thirds of all exports and one-third of gross output.  By 1977 its share of employment had reached almost 40 per cent and the period ahead will see this figure exceed 50 per cent.  The present plans of the IDA foresee half of the new jobs created between 1978 and 1982 coming from new foreign investment, while at least one-third of the remaining jobs to be created will come from existing foreign-owned firms.</P>
    <P>I understand the <i>rationale</i> of IDA policy and I applaud the vigour with which that policy is pursued by the staffs of the authority.  What I question is the underlying philosophy of the IDA approach and of the Government policy which is behind it.  Reliance on mainly foreign private investment for the future development of industry can indeed produce short term results, but it will inevitably bring about a situation in which we have little or no control over our own industrial destiny.  Power over jobs and investment will more and more lie in the head offices of multinational corporations, with all the uncertainty which that position will inevitably entail.</P>
    <P>The future role of the IDA must be critically reviewed so that it concentrates its attention on the creation of a modern, competitive industrial sector in which the major share of ownership and control will stay in Irish hands.  Such a strategy will involve the IDA in placing priority on support and development of existing and new Irish enterprises and on joint ventures between the Irish public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a clear need for a strong code of law and practice in relation to take-overs of Irish industrial and commercial undertakings.  We must seek to <Col N="1544" /> ensure that the assets of our national industrial sector will not be sold out of domestic control without an opportunity for legal action to protect essential national interests.  This is not a recipe for undue State interference but rather a commitment to ensure that Irish business law and administration are brought into line with national policy priorities.</P>
    <P>Great economic power and influence are concentrated in a small number of private financial institutions, many of which are controlled from outside the country.  The decisions which these institutions take concerning the use of their resources clearly affects the quality of the country's overall economic and social life.  To say that they should continue to make these decisions without regard to the country's needs, as determined by Government, is virtually to deny the right of the Cabinet to govern.</P>
    <P>Public control of the financial sector is essential if the needs of the ordinary men and women in Irish society are to prevail over forces which operate only for the profit of the few.  In far too many matters of direct concern to the people the rules are set by the financial institutions with scant regard for their consequences.</P>
    <P>First, the role of the Central Bank must be changed to give it positive powers to effectively control financial activity with authority and within the guidelines laid down by Government.  The Central Bank, in turn, must be under the direct control of the Government, who alone must have ultimate responsibility for economic policy.  In a democracy this is the only acceptable situation.</P>
    <P>Second, in seeking support for the concept of public control of the financial system, we must also establish the principle that banks or other financial institutions should be taken into public ownership where this is necessary for the achievement of economic and social objectives.  The example of so many European economies can serve us as a guideline for appropriate action in this regard.  In France, Italy and Austria, for example, the state owns a major part of the financial and banking services. Almost half of French banking is state owned, while in Austria the proportion <Col N="1545" /> is over 70 per cent.  In Germany half of the building societies are in public ownership. The Labour Party see the systematic entry of the State into the banking, house finance and credit sectors as central to any worthwhile national plan.</P>
    <P>Third, State involvement in the financial sector must be linked to overall economic and social strategy.  The example of Italy is interesting.  Four of Italy's largest commercial banks are owned by IRI, the Italian State development corporation, which controls and co-ordinates so much of that country's industrial sector. Labour's blueprint for a major industrial development corporation will take fully into account the need to integrate industrial investment policy and financial strategy.</P>
    <P>Fourth, control of interest rates is a central issue.  It should not be thought that this is an easy matter to deal with in a small and open economy like that of Ireland.  However, the positives role of the Central Bank which Labour envisage will enable the State to exercise influence and to intervene directly in the interest rate system.  A selective policy, with differential interest rates according to the nature of individual loan applications, can be adopted together with direct controls over bank profit levels.  Major projects of long-term economic and social importance must not be sacrificed on the altar of banking orthodoxy.  Lending to the State sector in particular must be subject to the considerations of national rather than banking policy.</P>
    <P>The attack on inflation must be given major priority.  In this I want to identify just three main elements which must have our attention and our commitment in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>First, we must accept the direct link between inflation and job losses.  Lack of competitiveness is leading to redundancy and to factory closures.  It is hitting large sections of our basic agricultural sector and of the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>Second, while much of our inflation is imported, too much is being created domestically by direct Government action and by inappropriate approaches to income growth.  Our own actions are <Col N="1546" /> fuelling inflation and adding to already existing trends.</P>
    <P>Third, inflation is to a large extent the product of psychological attitudes. Fianna Fáil have generated inflation by the deliberate stimulation of unreal expectations among many sections of society through the dishonest promises of the 1977 manifesto.</P>
    <P>The only approach to winding down inflation is a planned one.  Our economy must be brought into close alignment with the mainstream of European economic trends through the positive approach to planning which I have already proposed.  There must be a long-term, planned approach to incomes policy based upon the successful continental models of permanent consultation between Government and the employers, unions and farmer organisations. The current national understandings represent only the first step towards a truly comprehensive approach in which all aspects of the incomes question can be tackled in the context of overall national development.</P>
    <P>Incomes policies relating wages and salaries with investment and employment will not succeed in a capitalist economy. The belief that worker restraint will lead to higher growth, lower inflation and increased employment is a fanciful conception unless it is accompanied by profound changes in the ownership structure &mdash; in other words, in an economy organised on socialist lines.  Hence, fundamental to Labour's policy for the planned economy and industrial development is the achievement of worker democracy.</P>
    <P>There must be co-ordination of incomes policy and taxation policy.  During the current debate on taxation it should be remembered that the present unjust and unbalanced taxation system is almost exclusively a Fianna Fáil creation. The work of the previous Government towards achieving more progressive and equitable taxation was opposed bitterly by Fianna Fáil when in opposition, and in Government they have systematically dismantled those taxation measures introduced by the previous Government which sought to achieve greater equity and social justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> The present taxation system is simply the most visible piece of evidence pointing to the injustice of so much of our social structure.  It will not be properly dealt with unless that whole structure is dealt with too.</P>
    <P>There must be action now on the tax front.  The demands for PAYE reform must be complemented by the restoration of an effective capital tax, by the introduction of foolproof methods of assessing professional earnings &mdash; for instance, by introducing a mandatory receipting system for doctors and others &mdash; and by an effective and just farm tax.  What was commenced with Labour in power and in the teeth of a world recession must be carried forward now.</P>
    <P>Taxation is only part of the total scene, as I have said.  Our attention must be turned to other injustices which abound. A fair deal for the PAYE sector must be matched with a fair deal for the unemployed in jobs; a fair deal for the pensioners in a dignified standard of living; and a fair deal for the poor and low paid in simple justice.  We must not be content with raising the tax yield from the speculative groups in our midst.  We must put an end to all of their anti-social pursuits in the interest of society at large.</P>
    <P>Fair taxation of farm profits must be accompanied by a fair deal for small farmers, for farm workers and for those young people who want to get a start in farming.  Justice is indivisible and must be seen to be so.</P>
    <P>Policy against inflation must also contain effective means of consumer protection and a price control system that is understood by the public.  Price control is no panacea.  But neither must it become a toothless and divided structure recognised only as the bearer of bad tidings. Greater independence for all aspects of the consumer and price control services must be ensured.</P>
    <P>When I rose to make this speech the Minister responsible for communications was critical of the contributions that had been made on this side of the House.  He said that this party and Fine Gael in their contributions to the debate were not putting forward alternatives.  There is no <Col N="1548" /> doubt that what I have just said on behalf of this party is a very clear alternative indeed.  One need not agree with our approach.  One does not have to subscribe to our policies, but it would be blatantly dishonest even for the present Government not to acknowledge that we have spelled out a clear alternative to the approach towards solving the economic and social ills which have bedevilled this country since the inception of this State.</P>
    <P>Because the speech I have made is highly political in content it will probably be dismissed, since in this country we do not like talking about real politics.  We would rather have exchanges of parliamentary pleasantries across the floor of the House as to who shot whom in 1922. This party, since its foundation in 1912, have been tempted at all times to inject real politics into Irish political life and over the last few years we have become increasingly encouraged in that pursuit. We believe that what we advocate is giving a clear choice to the Irish electorate: conservative, as represented by the Government, not in their verbiage but in their actions, and progressive, even radical, as advocated by this party.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it, the last 60 years have proved beyond doubt that the conservative approach will not and cannot lead to anything except the list of economic and social ills voiced in this House over the last two days.  You cannot get full employment under the present system.  It is not possible.  You cannot get social justice under the present system. It is not possible.  You cannot hold out any hope to our young people so long as we continue under the present system.  It is not possible.  The only way forward, and we are totally convinced of this, is by the adoption of the policies I have outlined on behalf of this party.  We are aware that the young people are becoming more and more aware of that fact and will respond to our appeal for support in allowing us to implement these policies on behalf of all the people.  Fianna Fáil have failed dismally and there is no way, with their outlook and their vested interests, they can succeed in achieving full employment and social justice and equity in our society.</P>

      <P>I read the Minister for Finance's speech.  I did not hear it delivered yesterday; I listened to parts of the speeches of his colleagues and read more of them.  I must say that, even in the days when the National Coalition felt most embattled and when the people were agreed that we were right to feel embattled, I never heard such a pathetic defence being made for ourselves by our speakers, and such a pathetic effort to put a face on the indefensible, as the Government offered us yesterday and today in what I call this second budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plaintive cries from people who were full of confidence a few short years ago, the Minister opposite, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Reynolds, who was the last speaker for his side, that we should say what we would do, come very poorly from an Opposition, as they then were, who were so slow to outline anything except handouts when they occupied these benches.  Of course, we have not failed in quite the way the Minister opposite would wish the public to think we have failed.  Ever since moving across the floor of the House at the people's wishes to the Opposition benches, we have produced a constant stream of policy documents and statements.  While the Minister and his colleagues will scarcely suppose that we are so naive as to unmask every detail of an election programme, for all we know months or maybe a year in advance, by the form our criticisms of the Government's performance has taken we have made clear the <Col N="1550" /> lines on which reform and restructuring of this stricken economy should proceed.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the plaintive pleas that the Opposition should tell the Government what to do &mdash; although, in fact, we have offered the Government some very concrete advice, which, in my own spokesmanship field as I will demonstrate in a little while, the Government very sensibly have taken &mdash; which impress me, but the desperation which has crept into some of the backbenchers' speeches.  Deputy Andrews is my constituency colleague against whom, believe it or not, I have no personal animus. He behaves towards me on a constituency basis, so far as I know, with at least the normal quantum of fairness and civility.  I have no complaints about him on that level at all.</P>
    <P>He came in here today and made a speech in which he actually dipped back into the Dáil Official Reports of 1974 and 1975 in order to find speeches of mine which I made when I was merely a Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that he would there discover some unguarded word or phrase of mine of frankness implying that I was prepared to concede a few inches of territory to the then Opposition.  He thought that was still a useful weapon at this conjuncture to use on behalf of the Government of which he is a supporter.</P>
    <P>How pathetic can a speech and a Government be?  He is not the only one.  I am sorry to say his speech and that of another Fianna Fáil Deputy last night also contained the first promise that the Fianna Fáil election campaign will be so desperate that they will not even stop short of smearing candidates' characters.  Deputy Andrews gave the clearest possible notice of that.  So too last night did Deputy P.J. Morley.  It is not so much these straws in the wind but, when the Government get to the point of threatening that when an election is called they will look into the ideological credentials and personal beliefs of every candidate, and make damn sure that the public know about them, the comparison I make is the legend about when Cromwell was besieging Clonmel and he was being held up by the gallant defenders for longer than his plan <Col N="1551" /> or, if the Minister wishes, his strategy required.</P>
    <P>He was walking around the fields in gloom one day when what did he find only a silver bullet.  He said to himself: &ldquo;Begob, these fellows must be really down on their uppers when they are melting silver plate to fire it out of guns, and when the only metal they have left is silver.&rdquo;  There are many items in that little historical parallel which I would not wish literally transferred to the present situation; but when I find Deputy Andrews and Deputy Morley insinuating that we can expect that kind of character-smearing of our candidates, or the candidates of the Labour Party, in the next election I say to myself that these are the silver bullets of which any decent man or decent woman should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>Let us leave aside these trivial parts of the Government's case and get down to the hard meat.  What about coming to the hard meat of the Minister's own speech? The Minister was anxious to tell us about the Exchequer returns.  Before he did so, he told us that the Government's &ldquo;plans for social and economic development were sound and prudent&rdquo; and, he said, &ldquo;recognised as such by reputable, independent, economic commentators&rdquo;. Who are these reputable, independent, economic commentators?  I will give way to the Minister if he will name just one.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke here yesterday.  There is a little convention which I know seems to be trivial these days.  Perhaps it is childish and old-fashioned and very square of me even to mention it.  There is a convention that one does not tell lies to the Dáil.  I know it is often more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  Let us suppose the Minister has some respect for it.  If so, I have to assume he really meant what he said here yesterday when he assured the House that their &ldquo;plans for social and economic development in the future were sound and prudent, a fact recognised by reputable, independent, economic commentators&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister tells us who this reputable commentator is I should like him to flick open the Minister's speech and look at page 24 of the script.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Exchequer returns for the first quarter of the year were issued last week and some commentators interpreting these have suggested that the budget deficit is running ahead of target. These figures, however, do not represent the expected trend for the year as a whole because there are a number of important factors which did not come into play in the first three months.</P>
      <P>Indeed there are, but they are not on his side of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pattern of receipts and issues so far is, in fact, generally in line with expectations.  On the current expenditure side, 24.1 per cent or less than one quarter of the total amount budgeted <Col N="1553" /> for the year has been spent in the first three months.</P>
    <P>I admit that a schoolboy, or somebody with as much grip of the general picture as the Minister for Labour, Deputy Nolan &mdash; and I will have something to say about him in a few minutes &mdash; might assume that, if you have got away with 24 per cent of your budgeted expenditure with only 25 per cent of the year gone, you were doing all right.  In fact, you had your nose ahead.  As the Minister ought to know, and as those advising him ought to know &mdash; perhaps they were simply told to delete this, or he deleted it for them &mdash; the historic patter is that expenditure in the first three monmths of the year runs perceptibly below a quarter and mounts as the year goes on.</P>
    <P>Let us take the figure of 24.1 per cent for the first three months.  Let us call it 25 per cent, if the Minister likes, in round figures.  I know I am taking up .9 of a percentage point, but let us suppose we are absolutely level-pegging for the first three months.  What will provide for the 25 per cent increase in social welfare, not one penny of which has been spent or could have been spent in the first three months because it only came into force this day last week?  Where will the money come from for that?  What will the deficit look like when that is added on?  What about the second phase of the national agreement which, whoever else will not get it, the public service will get?  Public service pay and pensions absorb over half of the national budget and we are talking about a 7 per cent slice of that.  What will the deficit look like when that is accounted for?  From the best estimates I can get the likely shortfall this year, based on some of the items on the expenditure side which could not have figured in the first three months of this year, is about £300 million.  For the Minister to make a Second Stage speech on a Finance Bill, which by agreement of the House was extended to include a budget debate, and make no reference to heavy expenditure items is something which is not far off the silver bullet technique so far as debating is concerned.  As soon as the search parties have come home with <Col N="1554" /> independent reputable economic commentators between their teeth I would like to hear their comments on that point. We will see how reputable they are if they attempt to defend that.</P>
    <P>This kind of debate has gone on here ever since these parties changed sides.  In 1979 and in 1980 we predicted that Government spending would have to overshoot the budget target.  Who turned out to be right?  Was it the Minister and his Department?  Was it the Government of which Deputy Haughey is now leader but of which he was then a member and was widely credited with knowing something of such matters?  Was it Deputy O'Donoghue, Deputy Lynch, Deputy Colley?  Or were the Labour and Fine Gael Parties right?  I know that appealing to a record does not prove a point but it lends a certain confidence to the tone in which one may reiterate a simple point the next year based on similar arguments.</P>
    <P>In relation to special public service increases a sum of £100 million was provided last year and this was widely overshot. Much less than that has been budgeted for this year, but the signs are that it will be overshot for electoral reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister only barely mentioned the unemployment situation in passing, although I recollect that in 1976-1977 that was the theme on which the then Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was the most vocal.  One could not hear oneself think in here with the roaring and bellowing that the Deputy produced on the subject of &ldquo;jobs for our young people&rdquo;.  Let us have a look at the jobs for young people and at the man who is in charge of announcing and defending the figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan, I assume is a decent man.  I have no animosity against him or fault to find with him, except that he does not know what he is talking about.  I assume that the Minister is not trying to deceive people.  I would not claim to have caught the Minister out in a lie so I will not allege that he has deliberately said something false.  That would be too unjust.  Therefore, I assume that the Minister for Labour means what he said in his press handout on 6 April last.  What the Minister said then forces me to conclude, assuming that he is not telling a <Col N="1555" /> lie, that he does not know the first thing about unemployment trends.  If Deputy Tom Nolan were just plain Mr. Tom Nolan and I had to explain this to him I would say &ldquo;It is like this.  What we call unemployment is what we have when people have not got jobs, but there is such a thing as seasonal employment. These are mostly outdoor jobs, of which there tend to be more available when the weather gets better in the spring; and there are fewer of them available later in the autumn when the rain becomes unbearable and the evenings close in. These jobs are building jobs, jobs on the roads and on the bogs.  Whether the unemployment picture is good or bad there is within a range of thousands a fluctuation which is as regular as the rising and the setting of the sun&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are corresponding factors in other countries and that there are seasonal fluctuations in employment in other countries.  I would say to him &ldquo;The weather tends to improve here round about March.  The evenings start getting longer, people start going out and working more on the roads and on the bogs and building starts to pick up because of the more favourable conditions.  This occurs even in bad times and there is always a bit of an upturn in these sectors.  The result being that usually by about the end of February we find that the crude unemployment total which may be very high will fall a little, because however bad it is there is still a little activity in building on the bogs and on the roads.  People who were laid off during the winter are taken on and perhaps more will be taken on until late autumn and then they will be laid off.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make the Minister opposite, and the notional Tom sitting on his three-legged stool in the corner, to whom I am trying to teach the simple facts of unemployment trends, a present of the following prediction: that they will probably find the crude unemployment total tailing off a little bit more over the next few months.  It will probably shed a couple of hundred each month until September and if it does not keep improving until September the Government are in <Col N="1556" /> real trouble.  To back up that generality, I will tell the House what has been happening over the past nine years.  There is no point in going back any further because it is the same every year.  There has not been a single year in which the crude unemployment total has not fallen between the end of February and the end of March.  In 1973 it fell by over 4,000, in 1974 it fell by over 2,600, in 1975, at the depth of the recession, it still fell by 170.</P>
    <P>We did not issue any statements clapping ourselves on the backs for that.  One did not find Deputy Michael O'Leary exposing his ignorance about unemployment trends in that way.  In 1976 it fell by 1,500, in 1977 it fell, in that month, by over 1,200, in 1978 by 900, in 1979 by 3,500, in 1980 by 800 and this year by 200.  The drop in this year &mdash; as they say also in Merrion Street &mdash; is &ldquo;of the same order&rdquo; as the drop we had in 1975.  But in 1975 there were 23,000 fewer people on the dole than there are now.  In 1975 when the &ldquo;Minister for Hardship&rdquo; was in control, when all the other people about whom it was so easy to speak and shout, sneered and roared contemptuously from this side of the House &mdash; one was Deputy G. Fitzgerald, then with no responsibilities to carry and nobody seeing what metal his bullets were made of.  It was easy then of course to complain about unemployment but there were 23,000 fewer people unemployed in 1975 than there are now.  That did not prevent unemployment from getting substantially worse in the following year, as I predict it will in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>Now, to go back to the little chap in the corner: &ldquo;So you see how it is now, Tom, about seasonal unemployment.  Do not any longer, Tom, please, issue any statements like this.  If you ever become a Minister for Labour, if you ever grow up and get that job, do not ever issue a statement like this saying that you are `welcoming the reduction in the live register figures for March' and saying that `this was the first decline in the monthly figure since the deepening of the present recession earlier last year'.&rdquo;  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The March figures vindicate the <Col N="1557" /> Government's strategy of increasing productive investment so as to create new jobs and preserve existing jobs to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>I know there will be some little fellow charging off now to Deputy Nolan, perhaps even now has done so, saying &ldquo;Kelly down below there is tearing strips off you or that that &mdash; deletion &mdash; is making hay of your statement.&rdquo;  I am sorry if I am causing him pain.  But a Minister for Labour who wants to be taken seriously, and a Government who want to be taken seriously, ought not to have statements like that coming out, when they discard and eliminate the seasonal factors in unemployment figures, because the figure is now 1,800 worse than it was four weeks ago.  Of course we did not hear much about that from Deputy Andrews &mdash; I beg your pardon, I thought I heard over the intercom the name P.J. Morley, but it may have been some other P.J. in the ranks over there; I thought it was Morley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment, now, this is quite important, if it was not Morley I wish to apologise to him because I would not wish him to think that I was accusing him of anything so low if he did not in fact say these things.  But it was a Fianna Fáil Deputy whose initials are P.J. &mdash; I am sure there are a few of them &mdash; and I will check up on which of these people with the characteristic initials it was.  At any rate they were full of talk of that kind, full of flipping open the speeches which junior Members of the Coalition Administration, like myself, had made six or seven years ago, but not so good about making sense of unemployment figures, the Exchequer figures or anything else.</P>
      <P>On public service pay the Minister opposite said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay costs are, of course, of crucial importance and not simply because of their Exchequer implications.  At a <Col N="1558" /> time of international recession, when it is essential for us to improve our competitiveness in world markets, we cannot afford to allow public service pay to increase in a manner totally out of line with what is happening in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Who is speaking here?  Whose voice is this?  Suppose I were an archaeologist, in a couple of hundred years' time, and I found embedded in the foundation stone of a monument &mdash; the Tomb of the Unknown Minister of State or something of that kind &mdash; this single page, I would say to myself: which government was responsible for this?</P>
    <P>...we cannot afford to allow public service pay to increase in a manner totally out of line with what is happening in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I would say to myself: that sounds very like the tough talk of Richie Ryan, Liam Cosgrave and those who went in for it, those who managed to get wage agreements in 1976 and 1977 to a level which made possible the industrial recovery of 1977 and 1978.  That sounds very like that tough Government which did not mind doing unpopular things and which screwed down the inflation rate until it fell far below the 10 per cent mark.  That sounds very like them; that sounds like the crowd who put an embargo on recruitment into the public service.  It does not sound at all, oh no, like a Government who paid out to a large part of the public sector a figure considerably more even than an arbitration board had recommended.  Above all it does not sound like a Government or a Minister who had increased the size of the civil service in four years by 12 per cent or 13 per cent, and for what?  What are they all doing?  But they have to be paid too.  It is not simply the level of awards, it is the number of people to whom you pay them. If you have got a very small, skeleton service &mdash; and I am not advocating that the service should be necessarily stripped down to the point where it is undermanned &mdash; but where you have a very small service, public or private, in other words, if you are running something <Col N="1559" /> which is capital-intensive, and not labour intensive, it does not really matter what the size of your pay awards is because they are not a large factor in your calculations. But where the size of your service and the number of people you have to pay is growing, and growing uncontrollably, when you yourself have not got the guts or the political will to stop it in case you lose a few lousy votes, then the point has been reached that you are disqualified from complaining about the inroads the public service pay is making on the Exchequer and the economy.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be the era of the microchip, the era of the new information technology which constitutes a threat to employment.  It is the era, according to all the experts, which will decimate employment in banks and insurance companies, in service industries of all kinds.  But apparently all these office aids do not make any impact on the public service which the public have to pay for.  That goes on inexorably, remorselessly growing in size.  If the Minister who inherited, God knows, a big enough civil service from us, had kept it that size and refrained from extending it by 12 per cent or 13 per cent in four years, mark you, it would not really have mattered had he overshot on percentage levels in pay rises.  Let me do myself a bit of political, electoral good by saying: we could have been perhaps more generous with the public service, not that I recommend treating people unequally, but we might have been able to have been even more generous with the public service had there been fewer of them to whom we had to be generous.</P>
    <P>Therefore we find now, in this piece of paper that the archaeologist has dug up, that archaeology has betrayed us, we were all wrong, it was not in fact the Minister for Hardship or his associates who produced this bold phrase about not allowing public service pay to increase in a manner totally out of line with what is happening in the private sector.  They have allowed it, not merely in percentage terms but in the gross impact on the Exchequer in regard to the number of <Col N="1560" /> people who must receive these increases. If ever a Government, and particularly a Minister for Finance was discredited in presenting almost any argument about the economy it is the Government of Deputy G. Fitzgerald.  Mind you, it would be quite unjust to put all the blame on him, he is a recent arrival only and we do not know how long he is staying.  I am almost sorry to introduce this into a debate of this kind but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a very touching and beautiful allegory of human life.  I am sorry to have thought of it off the top of my head in comparing the passage of Deputy O'Kennedy through the Department of Finance with that image.  But, in a sense the speed of his arrival and departure &mdash; mind you, not caused by any accident but utterly predicted and known to the man who appointed him &mdash; is the single greatest disgrace in the economic management of this State in the last four years, and it is against heavy competition that I am awarding that palm.

His opinion of his own conceit was so high and his opinion of his own mastery of those details was so great that it did not really matter who he had in the Department <Col N="1561" /> of Finance; he was only a cipher, easily manipulated, a pawn that just with the press of a switch on the intercom he could put right if he got a couple of hundred million pounds wrong in a calculation on the morning.  He might easily do that because Deputy O'Kennedy, by training, education and background had no greater competence to fill the Department of Finance than Deputy Dick Burke would have had at the end of 1975.  What would have been said had Deputy Liam Cosgrave sent him to the Department of Finance for a year, knowing that he would be going to Brussels a year later?

      <P>I have got one more thing I want to deal with.  I am afraid it is a rather technical matter and will take me the rest of my time.  I will try to abstain from polemics while I make those points. The Minister for Finance said yesterday:</P>
      <P>There is a growing realisation internationally that the successive oil price rises are unlike other temporary setbacks to growth that have occurred over the last 30 years.  The price of energy, as a factor of production, has permanently risen to a much higher level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of us are lucky with the kind of jobs we have.  I have always recognised that I am very priviliged in my job outside the House.  I believe one of the worst jobs is that of somebody in the public service who has to write a Minister's speech.  For all I know he comes in in the morning with the same kind of bothers at home we all have, with screaming children and so on, and he groans to himself: &ldquo;What will I put in this man's mouth?  I had better fire in something about the cost of oil.&rdquo;  He gets a few words down.  I always find that is a help.  &ldquo;There is a growing <Col N="1562" /> realisation&rdquo; is always a great start to a sentence.  It carries him through a line and it gives a bit of bulk to the speech.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister for Finance tell us something that we do not know, for a change?  It is incredible that a Minister for Finance could tell us this.  I hope Deputy Corish will not mind if I mention the name of his distinguished predecessor in the leadership of the Labour Party.  I remember the late Myles na gCopaleen making unmerciful fun of the late Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, because on a couple of occasions he said, which was not such a very odd thing to say in 1948 or 1949, that air transport was here to stay.  Deputy Norton used often say that in his speeches.  The late Myles na gCopaleen used make unmerciful fun of him for that. I feel that to be told in this day and age by a Minister for Finance that &ldquo;there is a growing realisation&rdquo; is as though the thing is only still dawning, that there are corners the dawn has not yet reached, even in this House, if the Minister's implication is to be taken seriously.  The Minister apparently realises that dear oil is a fact of life.  Has he asked himself what the Government or the people in his own Department are doing in response to that new fact of life other than whingeing about it and complaining about it?  What have the Government done, in concrete terms, as distinct from talk, by way of trying &mdash; I do not mean tinkering with the problem &mdash; to produce alternative energy sources and wind down our oil consumption and demands?</P>
    <P>In the 1980 science budget the National Board for Science and Technology say on page 52:</P>
    <P>The search for new energy sources and conservation technologies has given rise to unprecedented levels of expenditure on energy research, development and demonstration projects, by government and industry internationally. The Irish situation has been less satisfactory in that necessary programmes and related resources need to be substantially increased.... Although national expenditure has grown rapidly to an estimated £2.3 million <Col N="1563" /> in 1979, Ireland ranks last but one among OECD countries in terms of realtive expenditure in energy research, development and demonstration.</P>
    <P>That may not seem to be very important to the Minister but that is a very damning thing for a country, which is the scene of a &ldquo;growing realisation&rdquo; that dear oil is here to stay.  In order to put that into perspective let me tell the Minister that £2.3 million spent on energy research and development is between .1 and .2 of 1 per cent of what the country spends in electricity bills a year.  It is only a fraction of 1 per cent of what we pay the ESB for the electricity it sells us.  That is what we spend in research and development on energy, even though there is a &ldquo;growing realisation&rdquo; that dear oil is here to stay.</P>
    <P>The only country in the OECD, which has 20 members or so with a lower proportion of GNP devoted to energy research and development than us is Greece.  I do not know what their reasons are, and I will not criticise them for being even worse than we are.  The Government and the Minister for Finance are in a very weak position to lecture us on the subject until they can pull their socks up in regard to research and development of alternative energy techniques and of conservation and better use of techniques for the very dear energy we have at present.</P>
    <P>Since we have been invited non-stop by the other side to say what we would do I will tell the Minister and the opposite side of the House what actually we have done.  Admittedly, being in Opposition, we can only say, but before the Minister sneers too loudly at anything we have said I want to draw his attention to a curious little fact.  My party published in May 1980 the only detailed policy on energy which any party have ever produced. The document was in preparation for about eight months before that.  The final stages of putting it together were from January to March 1980.  My strong impression during the latter stages, when the thing was nearing completion and we were showing it to some outside experts for their views, was that our procedures <Col N="1564" /> were not entirely watertight.  Some of the people we consulted, no doubt quite innocently, passed on this or that because, almost contemporaneously with the publication of that document, the new Minister in charge of energy, Deputy Colley, began a series of policy U-turns, policy statements and policy attitudes, which contrasted radically with the attitude taken by his predecessor, Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>I will not annoy the House by simply reading out stretches of our policy document. I will briefly mention eight areas I have identified as ones in which we were ahead of the Minister for Energy in stating plainly what we stood for and what we believed.  These are things in which he subsequently imitated us.  He will not admit it but I have a moral certainty that our policy document is in his hip pocket and permanently stays there.  That is where it will remain until he has used every idea in it.  Before anybody thinks I am complaining about that, I want to say I am not complaining about it, I am delighted about it.  I have perhaps gone too far in trying to make things easy for the Minister for Energy because I can see that he is on the right path.  He is at least on the right path from the sounds he is making.  Not a lot of action has come out from the far end so far.  He is on the right path so far as his stated attitudes are concerned.  As the House may have noted.  I have refrained from trying to hound him.  I do not think that a man who is doing what is right should be hounded.  I have been as constructive as possible in the one or two Bills that he has brought before the House and this has been because of my recognising in these Bills my own spurious offspring in the political sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We were the ones to put first, in the form of our policy document, a firm recommendation that the Carnsore proposal should be put on the long finger, that there should be no proceeding with a nuclear project there.  This was not because of any ideological or religious <Col N="1565" /> objection to the project.  We did not have any such objection.  I must admit that the Labour Party were against any such move from the start.  We considered that any such move would be unduly expensive, wasteful and unnecessary in our present circumstances and that it was something that should be resorted to only as a last option, after every other option had been explored but had failed.  A couple of months later Deputy O'Malley's policy was put into reverse by the Minister for Energy.  Also, in that document of ours which was issued in May of last year we were the first to state that we were committed to the building of a pipeline to take natural gas from Cork to Dublin and beyond Dublin to the Border for piping into the North of Ireland, if necessary.  I shall not use the word &ldquo;steal&rdquo; or anything of that kind because I am glad that that policy also lodged with the Minister for Energy and made sense to him.  It is now Government policy.</P>
      <P>We were the ones, too, to point out that enormous quantities of the heat that is generated is lost by being pumped into rivers and lakes or by going out through chimneys in our network of generating stations.  Obviously, much of the energy that is generated is used in the generation of electricity but a large proportion of it is dissipated into the air or into our rivers. In other countries such heat is made use of by way of district heating systems, combined heat and power stations, whereby whole suburbs or even whole towns are heated.  I have a great deal of respect for the ESB and for their achievements, but up to the time of our suggestion in regard to the use of heat lost through these generating-station chimneys, they had not done anything that was visible on the surface with the exception of heating a few experimental glasshouses in, I think, Shannonbridge.</P>

      <P>A couple of weeks ago this item of Fine Gael policy turned up, too, and a suggestion which we had disinterred and which had been made as long ago as 1975 by two ESB engineers that the waste heat from the Ringsend power <Col N="1566" /> station should be used to heat 4,000 to 5,000 households in Dublin is back on the table.</P>
      <P>We were the ones who suggested that there should be a dispersion of wind farms with experimental windmills in order to avoid the problems intermittent throughout the country and starting with one on an island.  That policy was adopted also by the Minister for Energy who even went further and named Inisheer as being the island to be used for the experiment. We suggested also that waste should be burned in order to generate electricity even if the waste output was not enough to operate a complete station in which case it could be combined with other fuels to produce electricity and heat.</P>
      <P>I was amused to note recently that the Minister for Energy went to Denmark to find out about such developments.  It was not necessary for him to have made that journey, because we had done all the work.  I recall being at a film show and demonstration about 18 months ago on the results of the Danish research.  Therefore, all that information is available here.  I am convinced that it was in our document that the Minister found the idea; but good luck to him if he succeeds in this area.  I will cheer him on and there will not be any question of sour grapes when I am invited to the opening, regardless of who is in power at the time.</P>
      <P>We were the ones, too, who suggested the possibilities of small-scale hydro power.  I am not talking about the large hydro-power stations because the rivers that are of sufficient size and fall to justify such stations have all been used.  There are many smaller streams which for more modest purposes could be used in the generation of electricity.  We find that our suggestion in this regard is now under active consideration by the Minister for Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something else which we suggested but to which I have not yet heard him refer was that the IDA should endeavour to attract firms to this country who could be made to develop the technology of small-scale hydro generation so that we could make machines here for this and sell them abroad, unlike the telephone <Col N="1567" /> system that the Minister tells us he is trying to sell to the Libyans.</P>
    <P>Again, we were the ones who suggested that the North-South electricity link should be reopened.  That suggestion is now back on the table.  In the preface to this document of ours I suggested that the co-operative principle should be harnessed in energy development.  We find this suggestion incorporated in the Turf Development Bill.  I have reservations of a legal kind and which I shall not go into now about the proposal to distinguish between private and co-operative developers but the Minister is on the right track and I hope he will be successful in this area.  Every effort should be made to make people aware of the advantages of the co-operative development of small bogs.  Such development would be much more profitable than private development.</P>
    <P>Just as was the case with regard to the ESB 55 years ago, this party in terms of all these policies, have pioneered the developments of which future generations will reap the benefit.  Therefore, I do not wish to hear any more from the other side of the House about our being short on suggestions.</P>

      <P>I should like to begin on the note on which Deputy Kelly ended and to repeat that there have been very few worthwhile or constructive suggestions from the other side of the House.  As usual, we have had plenty of the negative type of suggestions.  For the most, the contributions from the Opposition have been disappointing.  I was particularly disappointed with the contributions that we had from them yesterday afternoon.  We have heard little from them today that is new.  I appreciate the reasons for Deputy Kelly having to leave but I am sorry that he cannot stay because I have a few words to say to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I expect that the Deputy will be reading the report of the debate later.  The first point is that the Deputy should not be under the misapprehension that all the thinking in the field of energy belongs to Fine Gael. Indeed, the many points he mentioned were adverted to by the Government long before we heard them from Deputy Kelly.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the first indication of the Government's commitment to this whole area was when the Department of Energy were established.  The Minister for Energy has been extremely active in respect of a question that Deputy Kelly has raised, that is, the question of our reliance on oil.  By way of supporting the Minister this year in his efforts in the investment plan, I provided £290 million by way of capital expenditure, the vast proportion of which goes to switching our reliance on oil to other fuels and to other sources of energy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly was wondering whether any commentators have agreed with the Government's economic strategy.  I can assure him that there has been such agreement.  At short notice I was not in a position to resurrect for the Deputy details of those who commented on the plan and of how correct it was or of those who commented on the budget but the reaction was favourable.  I can tell the Deputy, however, that there was an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> last week in which was quoted the views of an international banker and economist.  This gentleman is reported as having said that Ireland has continued to be the fastest growing EEC member in recent years and one of the most rapidly developing economies in the OECD despite general adverse conditions since the mid-seventies oil crisis.  I hope that Deputy Kelly will accept this as favourable comment and I would ask him to accept that I am not one who would ever tell lies to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey said that we must accept that there is a direct relationship between inflation and job losses.  I would <Col N="1569" /> accept that there is such a relationship though it would be wrong to attribute all job losses to inflation because there are many other factors involved.  For example, a world recession can affect job losses, markets, industrial harmony and other areas also, but having said that I do not wish to underlay the importance of the role of inflation and the importance of trying to control it.  Yesterday and today I have stressed the Government's concern to bring down inflation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey also outlined the framework for a future Utopia.  He said that in his view this was the only hope for full employment and social justice.  Time does not allow me to analyse Deputy Cluskey's philosophy in detail but I doubt if many will be convinced that he has produced a formula for success.  The policies of the present Government provide the only formula for achieving the objectives of full employment and social justice which Deputy Cluskey and all of us want to see.</P>
    <P>If I am disappointed by Opposition contributions to this debate it is because none of the speakers put forward definite proposals for handling the economy. Deputy Kelly spoke about his great document on energy needs in the future, but never commented on the way he thought the economy should be handled.  I want to correct a claim made by Deputy Horgan that capital gains tax receipts had been reduced by 70 per cent as compared to when the previous Government were in office.  The fact is that yields from the tax amounted in 1976 to only £0.43 million and in 1977 to £1.47 million.  By contrast, the yield in 1980 was £6 million. This is the kind of incorrect statement which has been made in this debate.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government were in office they were referred to by many as the prophets of doom and gloom. Obviously the prophets have maintained that outlook throughout their period in opposition and we have listened to the same style during the past two days.  We have heard claims for increased spending, decreased taxation and deflationary cutbacks in borrowing.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat my statement of yesterday. The decisions taken by the Government <Col N="1570" /> have been positive, that our imaginative economic policies are both sound and prudent and will leave us in a position of strength to take full advantage of the expected upturn in the economy later in the year.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the points raised by Deputies on the Finance Bill I would first like to respond to the learned critics of our financial and economic policies.  Deputy Bruton spoke at length on the Exchequer returns for the first three months of the year.  He saw these figures as confirming his opinion that the budget targets are illusory and will not be realised. The Deputy, of course, interpreted the figures to suit his own purpose.  He was eloquent on the subject of expenditure but he studiously overlooked the fact that current expenditure up to the end of March was less than one quarter of the total amount budgeted for the year overall. This is surely the most significant figure in any assessment of the overall pattern.  Equally misleading was the Deputy's invalid claim that none of the £80 million provided in the budget for special pay increases was spent in the first quarter.  The fact of the matter is that almost £14 million of this provision was spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask for a copy of the Minister's speech?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>No.  The Deputy was not here at the beginning of my speech when I was speaking off the cuff. A partial copy of my speech is available which the Deputy may have if he wishes.</P>
      <P>I now repeat that the figures for the first quarter are in line with expectations. Deputy Bruton can hardly be taken seriously when he suggests that my budget statement should have included projection of the Exchequer end-March position. On the Revenue side the changes announced in the budget did not have a significant impact in the first three months but this will change in subsequent quarters.  The increased Post Office changes did not take effect until 1 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The excise duty increases did not take effect until late in the first quarter and of course a large percentage of payments following these increases were delayed because of deferment arrangements.  I would also draw Deputy Bruton's attention to the substantial increase in the intake of corporation tax later this year which has been provided for.  I have already pointed out that in drawing comparisons with 1980 there are special factors which must be taken into account.  Because of a purely technical timing arrangement, there was an increase of approximately £50 million in central fund services in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year.  Deputy Bruton dismissed this as an inconsequential matter but we are talking here about a figure of £50 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Another special factor which improved the 1980 figure was a backlog of general tax revenue arising from the Post Office strike of the previous year.  Neither does Deputy Bruton acknowledge the effect on revenue in the first quarter of this year, by comparison with 1980, of the major income tax concession announced in the 1980 budget, or of the changes in the payment dates of income tax by the self-employed which were announced at the same time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy went on to draw comparisons with the first quarter of 1978, claiming that debt repayments have trebled, that current expenditure has doubled but that current revenue has only increased by 73 per cent.  He said that this shows an unfavourable pattern in our finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the figures quoted by the Deputy are wrong.  His figure of £1,199 million for current expenditure in 1981, and his corresponding 1978 figure, include voted capital services, which have increased at a very fast rate since 1978. <Col N="1572" /> Excluding these services, current expenditure increased by 88 per cent, compared with an increase of 73.6 per cent for current revenue.  For the year as a whole, however, revenue is expected to be 94 per cent higher than in 1978.</P>
    <P>The trebling of debt repayments mentioned by the Deputy refers to the figures published in the Exchequer statement as &ldquo;issues for the redemption of debt&rdquo;.  I am not clear on what the Deputy is implying here.  The figures do not reflect either the overall debt position or the cost of servicing the debt, since they include movement of funds from the Exchequer to departmental funds and the Central Bank and normal Exchequer bills transactions, many of which are &ldquo;in and out&rdquo; transactions which are matched by corresponding figures on the receipts side of the Exchequer statement.</P>

As I have said, the national debt and the cost of servicing this debt have grown at a much slower rate since 1978.  They have not even doubled, much less trebled as implied by the Deputy.  I would regard such comments as mischievous.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the Exchequer returns, let me emphasise again that the Government are committed to reducing the borrowing requirement.  We have put into effect the measures necessary to achieve this and we will see to it that these measures are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton had much to say on the subject of planning.  He claims that to improve our economic performance we must have a plan and that the government have no plan.  Obviously the Government's investment plan 1981 is being overlooked by the Deputy.  This Government are committed to planning.</P>

      <P>At times it appears that some people on the other side of the House have very short memories.  This Government are committed to planning &mdash; unlike the Coalition Government which preceded us.  We have published five planning documents.  Our predecessors published one short document in 1976.  The programme of planning undertaken by this Government in 1977 was highly successful in enabling growth rates to be achieved which were among the highest recorded in the industrialised countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We adopted a planned approach to extracting the maximum momentum from the then favourable international economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the international environment deteriorated we did not adopt a passive approach of claiming that there was little we could do.  Our response was Investment Plan 1981 &mdash; an imaginative and carefully thought out strategy to deal with <Col N="1574" /> the effects of the current recession while pursuing essential development.  The plan comprises an investment programme of record proportions which will lead to a considerable increase in the productive capacity of the economy &mdash; laying the solid foundation for future growth.</P>
    <P>The plan is also having an immediate dynamic effect.  By the end of the year we estimate that its implementation will have directly created 10,000 new jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and indirectly will have given rise to many more.  The plan represents the best possible means of meeting this country's immediate requirements while improving our potential for future growth.</P>
      <P>As for the longer-term, Government planning must be concerned with the practical realities.  It would not be consistent with these realities to publish detailed annual targets for the next five years or thereabouts when the course of international developments cannot be predicted with any certainty.  The draft EEC medium-term programme foresees that, even with a recovery from the present recession, there will be a period of slow growth in demand ahead.  It calls for a major effort by member states to improve their competitiveness by giving priority to investment in productive capacity.  We are in agreement with this principle and the investment plan gives concrete evidence of the priority we have accorded to investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a small open economy, inflation largely reflects the price we have to pay for imported oil and other goods and services.  Nevertheless, the Government are concerned that on the home front there are difficulties, particularly in relation to domestic costs, which are affecting our competitiveness.  These difficulties must be overcome so that we can plan realistically for growth and employment in the medium-term.  This, and other issues, are being drawn together by the Government in their current planning operations and practical steps are being <Col N="1575" /> taken to deal with them.  To improve our economic performance and to achieve long-term growth, we must have regard to the very real constraint imposed by the balance of payments deficit on our freedom of action and we must have specific measures to deal with it.  This is the essence of practical planning and not the publication of the unpredictable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton complained at some length about delays in finalising the annual Estimates of expenditure.  He suggested that the Estimates should be submitted to the Dáil at least in August or September of the previous year so as to allow adequate time for discussion of the figures and for changes.  I have no reason to disagree as a matter of principle with the Deputy's viewpoint and I do not see this as a matter of party politics.  I am aware that in many European countries the Estimates are settled before the beginning of the financial year.</P>
    <P>But there are practical difficulties in the way of speeding up the process of preparing the Estimates.  The procedure which the Deputy has in mind would impose considerable extra work on the Dáil.  Also, unless the Estimates were considered in the same context as resources, I fear the tendency would be to press for bigger programmes rather than adopt a prudent attitude towards spending.</P>

      <P>From the amount of time devoted to inflation during this debate it would appear that the Opposition do not recall that in the three years from 1974 to 1976, the average annual rate of inflation was 19 per cent.  On two occasions in 1975 under a Coalition Government this country experienced its highest rate of inflation for the decade &mdash; 24 per cent.  In the three years from 1978 during this Government's term in office, inflation has averaged 13 per cent.</P>

      <P>Indeed in 1978, the Government succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation to 7½ per cent, the lowest annual figure in the past decade.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton indulged in some creative arithmetic to the effect of exaggerating our rate of inflation.  He has taken the rate of increase of about 6 per cent in the quarter to mid-February last and multiplied it by four to get an annual rate of 24 per cent.  That figure of 24 per cent is meaningless.</P>
      <P>You cannot take the figure for a quarter, which inevitably shows the impact of once off factors which will not continue, and operate as if it gave any real indication of the annual rate of inflation. If I wished to follow that approach I could take the increase in consumer prices in the preceding quarter, at about 3 per cent, and use it to arrive at an annual rate of 12 per cent, half the Deputy's figure.  I could also take the figure in the quarter to mid-February 1975, under the Coalition, of 8 per cent and use it to arrive at an annual figure of 32 per cent.</P>

      <P>I will not adopt this approach because, as I said, it is meaningless. The fact is that, allowing for the effects of the budget, the percentage increase in average consumer prices this year over last, which is a proper measure of annual inflation, is expected to be less than last year, as Deputy O'Leary was prepared to admit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the provisions on taxation for married couples, the increases in social welfare benefits, well above the rate of inflation, are only two examples of worthwhile changes which had to be paid for somehow.  The Opposition cannot legitimately criticise us on the one hand for the size of the current budget deficit, and on the other for taking steps <Col N="1577" /> in the area of taxation which will reduce that deficit in relation to GNP.  Deputy O'Leary has sought to argue that increases in indirect taxation are, because of their impact on prices, damaging to the national understanding.  I have seen nothing to suggest that increased direct taxation is attractive to trade unions or to their members.  I would ask them not to take the narrow view of looking solely at the impact of the budget tax increases on prices, but to look at the budget as a whole, and to weigh the benefits it is bringing in the way of improved employment prospects, higher social welfare payments and increased equity in the direct tax system.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have said that I have shown interest in their approach to our economic problems, as if this were a criticism. They could have taken it as a compliment if they had coherent policies to put forward &mdash; that is the deciding factor there &mdash; but they have shown no signs during this debate, of having policies on inflation or in any other economic area. Deputy O'Leary, for example, has recalled the Coalition's use of subsidies to affect the rate of consumer price increase.  But how could increased consumer subsidies be provided at Exchequer cost, while the current budget deficit was being reduced, as sought by the Opposition, unless taxation was increased or other expenditure cut?  What taxes would they like to see increased? These are the questions the Opposition have left hanging in the air.  They do not have any idea how to answer them nor did they in the four years in Government when Deputy L'Estrange sat so quietly on the back benches, ashamed of his Government's performance and never opened his mouth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I was never ashamed of them.  They were a good Government. In 1976-77 the Minister, when in opposition, was crying for subsidies.  Are subsidies wrong now the Minister is in Government?</P>

      <P>Similarly, the <Col N="1578" /> agreement reached last week on Community farm prices will have a very small impact on consumer prices.  Do the Opposition then oppose the farm price increases?  How is their criticism of the size of the farm price increase reconciled with their views on consumer prices? Have they proposals which would give a bigger Community farm price increase, a smaller impact on consumer prices, and a reduction in the current budget deficit, all at once?  From what we have heard in the past two days, I doubt it.</P>
      <P>Finally, as usual the opposition have not got a common list of priorities.  For Deputy Bruton, the inflation rate is the number one priority.  For Deputy O'Leary it is the reduction of unemployment. Quite different economic policies follow from one's decision on which is the priority area.  The current British Government, for example, places particular weight on reducing inflation.</P>

They have queried the budget arithmetic and have tried to create the impression that the figures do not match reality.  I notice, however, that they have steered clear of the subject of social welfare.  They have not acknowledged the substantial improvements in social welfare benefits which were announced in the budget and which came into effect in the past week.</P>
      <P>All independent commentators have readily acknowledged that these increases are particularly generous in our present circumstances and are real proof of the Government's concern for the less-well-off sections of our community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These social welfare improvements are costly.  The budget includes a provision of £111 million for them for this year.  This money must be raised elsewhere and the Government <Col N="1579" /> took the decision to increase taxes on a number of non-essential items to pay for them.  Would the Opposition have chosen to keep the social welfare increases at a much lower level?  Or would they have met the cost of these increase through more direct taxation?  There are no other options and yet the Opposition keep hinting that there is some magic formula somewhere that will bring all the pieces together painlessly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to Ireland's credit standing in the international banking community.  I can assure the Deputy that the terms on which Ireland can borrow on the international capital markets clearly confirm our ranking as a prime credit on these markets.</P>

      <P>In January of this year, on the Dollar Eurobond Market we secured identical terms to the European Investment Bank which, as Deputies will be aware, carried in effect the combined guarantee of the ten member states of the community.  Moreover, a global assessment of country credit ratings released only last month by a leading international financial publication confirms that, compared with a similar assessment in 1979, Ireland has improved its rating and now stands among the countries rated the best credit risks in the world.  The study was based on objective ratings supplied by a representative sample of a very large number of banks throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Ireland's favourable standing among the international banking community was also highlighted within the last fortnight when, during the course of a visit to Dublin, the president of one of the ten largest banks in the United States expressed his confidence about the medium term prospects for the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the international bank referred to by Deputy Bruton I would point out that the bank concerned has recently indicated that it is prepared to lend funds to my Department.  I need hardly point out to the Deputy that banks will not offer to lend funds unless they <Col N="1580" /> are totally satisfied as to the standing of the borrower.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to exhort Deputies to avoid making comments either publicly or in private discussions with banks which might damage our international credit rating and thus involve increased borrowing costs to the economy.  Our patriotism as public representatives deserves at least that, even from the most irresponsible Opposition this country has ever had.</P>

      <P>In my opening statement yesterday I referred to our position on European Community policy. Since the budget debate both the Taoiseach and I have discussed further the international economic position, and the appropriate response to it by the member states, with our Community partners.  These matters were discussed by the Taoiseach not only at the European Council at Maastricht, but also with Chancellor Schmidt during his recent visit to Bonn, and they were the dominant subject of interest at the meeting of Community Finance Ministers in Breda in the Netherlands which I attended last weekend.</P>
      <P>The Finance Minister of all the member states agree that there are economic problems within the Community at present. In every member state unemployment and inflation are both serious, and are not amenable to quick, easy solutions. But these problems can be resolved, if the people of the community respond with sufficient determination, vigour and discipline.  All of my fellow Finance Ministers shared the opinion that one of our principal political tasks is to bring this message home in our respective member states and I have taken the opportunity offered by this debate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly apologised to me for his absence from the House when I told him I would have something to say about his <Col N="1581" /> comments.  I regret he is not present to hear what I have to say but I appreciate the reason for his absence.  Deputy Kelly is reported in the press to have taken the view that my activities at Breda were somehow inappropriate.  He has conjured up visions of the Finance Ministers of other countries objecting to the line I adopted.  I can calm his fears.  Nobody resented the statement of Ireland's position. We were there as men with common, difficult problems which we are all trying hard to resolve.  Our debate was entirely constructive, and devoid of any adverse reaction to my viewpoint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly's position is somewhat odd when compared with that of his party leader.  In his comments on the Taoiseach's statements following the European Council at Maastricht Dr. FitzGerald was highly critical of the Government's approach to EEC matters, claiming that we lacked any strategic approach, that we are passive and that there has been no serious effort to advance our vital interests.  The economic policy of the European Community is a matter of vital interest to us, yet when I raise it Deputy Kelly seems to find this inappropriate.  He says that the other member states would resent our &ldquo;hard neck&rdquo;.  They were the words he used in the course of his stage performance in Terenure, or wherever it was.  We have shown no &ldquo;hard neck&rdquo; but where this country's vital interests are concerned I would make no apology for showing one if needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly might study his own party leaders's comments on the Taoiseach's statement.  Dr. FitzGerald wanted to know why the Taoiseach did not press the argument that what is needed at present, in the countries of the Community that are best placed to do so, is the application of short-term demand stimuli.  The Taoiseach did, of course, argue for a positive Community economic policy, as he made clear in his statement in Maastricht.  I too argued at Breda on these lines.  Yet Deputy <Col N="1582" /> Kelly disagrees because I followed an approach close to that favoured by his party leader.  In other words, which of them wants to go which way?</P>
      <P>And this approach is not without success. I am the last to exaggerate our influence on the Community economic policy. But we can point to the path we think it should follow.  Community economic policy has today taken a more expansionary path through joint action by France and Germany.  The German Government decided this morning to finance, through the international capital market, and in close co-ordination with France, a new investment programme centred on the energy sector.  This is the very kind of approach I favoured at Breda.</P>
      <P>The Irish pound has now entered on its third year of membership of the European Monetary System.  Most commentators would agree that the system has been a success.  It has brought considerable stability to the exchange rates of the participating currencies at a time when other major currencies, such as the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen, have been subject to major fluctuations.</P>
      <P>From an Irish viewpoint the system has, in addition, provided an arrangement more suited to our needs than would the continuance of a link to the pound sterling.  Over the past two years sterling has appreciated by approximately 30 per cent against the other EMS currencies.  This was due largely to the influence of North Sea oil and the high interest rate policy of the UK Government. In these circumstances, the retention of the link to sterling would have cost this country's industrial, agricultural and service sectors dear in economic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish pound's position in the European Monetary System band has been characterised by stability from the start. Sterling's appreciation outside the system has, of course, complicated our efforts to reduce inflation and this is a source of concern to the Government.  However, this in no way invalidates the correctness of Ireland's participation in the European Monetary System, which continues to be <Col N="1583" /> a zone of monetary stability in a turbulent international monetary environment.</P>
    <P>Between the end of 1978 and early 1980 the average rate of inflation in the main OECD countries rose from 7 to over 12 per cent while the price of oil more than doubled.  This substantial worsening of actual and anticipated inflation was directly reflected in an upsurge in interest rates.  Moreover, Governments world-wide took the view that in the face of the external price shock the over-riding priority was to prevent inflation from becoming embedded in the system due to a parallel explosion of domestic cost and price increases.  The policy response was, therefore, to maintain and indeed tighten monetary targets which further reinforced the upward tendency in interest rates.  The scale of the rise &mdash; six to eight points for short-term rates &mdash; was very similar and rates in almost all cases exceeded their previous peak levels in the major countries.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from what I have already said that there is a very large degree of interdependence between countries.  This interdependence has been reinforced over the past 20 years or so by a rapid expansion in the quantity of goods and financial assets traded across borders, and these trade and capital flows have become quite sensitive to price and interest rate differences.  The result has been that while, on the one hand, countries have benefited greatly in the form of larger outputs from the increased specialisation, on the other, the rise in interdependence has an associated cost in terms of increased vulnerability to disturbances arising in other countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a good example of a small and open economy and it should be clear, therefore, that interest rates here are determined to a very large extent by international developments.  This explains why interest rates rose in tandem with other countries in late 1979 and early 1980.  I would like to answer Deputy Bruton's statement last evening that the Government are forcing up interest rates.  To do this I need do no more than draw attention to the fact that at mid-1979, when the interest rate rises began, the <Col N="1584" /> prime commercial lending rate here, that is, the rate charged for short-term loans to best customers, was the highest in the EEC.  The current rate, on the basis of the latest information available, is now fourth lowest in the Community.  It should be clear, therefore, to all that prime rates in Ireland have fallen and fallen significantly relative to other EEC countries over the past year and three-quarters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On three separate occasions in 1980 the banks announced reductions in rates which brought the prime rate here from 18 per cent to its current level of 14 per cent.  This is in marked contrast to Deputy Bruton's allegation that the Government are forcing up interest rates.  Quite on the contrary, the Government where possible have taken action to ease the burdens of the high cost of capital.  The Government took measures through the ICC to widen the facilities available to industry by relieving the borrower of the exchange risk on loans denominated in other EMS currencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>More foreign borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time the scheme was introduced loans of up to five years were being made available at 13½ per cent while comparable domestic loans were 18¼ per cent.  The Government also introduced through the ACC a productive investment scheme, based on borrowing in EMS currencies for the agricultural sector and this was bolstered by a further similar facility made available through the associated banks.</P>
      <P>The Government also took measures, when rates were highest, to ease the burden of mortgage repayments on house purchasers.  Since these schemes were introduced domestic interest rates have fallen while those of EMS countries have in general tended to rise in line with conditions in the international markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no question, therefore, of the Government forcing up interest rates, and Deputy Bruton's allegation <Col N="1585" /> that they do this by trying, as he put it, to grab more and more of the available money to finance their own deficits, displays a fundamental ignorance of the operation of the financial system here. As he should know, the demands which the Government make on the volume of domestic savings are carefully tailored so as not to upset those markets.  The inference which the Deputy made, that there can in some sense be a &ldquo;crowding out&rdquo; effect in an economy as open as ours, does not stand up to serious examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton said that he was very worried about the balance of payments deficit.  The Government are well aware of the fact that it is a constraint which must be watched very carefully.  However, we must be clear about why it is rising, because therein lies the key to answering the question &ldquo;what should be done about it?&rdquo;  In my opening statement I said that the oil import bill will be about £900 million this year, a truly staggering figure.  We cannot do without oil.  It is vital in production and transport.  But we can act to contain our demand for it, and this Government are doing just that.  Again, we can act to ensure that whatever oil may be in our offshore areas is found and brought into production as soon as possible, and again the Government are acting vigorously in this area.</P>
      <P>There are also other policies which have a favourable impact on the balance of payments deficit which we are pursuing, for example, by ensuring that Irish goods are used wherever possible.  But there is one policy which we are not prepared to follow, and that is to force the economy into recession in order to cut the import bill.  That would probably work.  Recession might also hold out to some the prospect of reducing inflation, an objective which is, according to Deputy Bruton, Fine Gael's first priority.  Is that the approach his party favour in dealing with the balance of payments and inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to some points raised in the <Col N="1586" /> course of this debate on the text of the Finance Bill.  Deputy M. O'Leary inquired as to whether the allowances in respect of rented residential accommodation, which are provided for in section 21 of the Bill, would be extended to such accommodation completed but unoccupied prior to budget day.  The intention of this section is to stimulate new investment leading to new building activity and employment creation in the construction industry.  To allow past construction work to qualify for the allowance would be clearly inconsistent with this over-riding objective.  The introduction of any new allowance must take effect from a given date, which in the case of capital allowances has normally been budget day or immediately afterwards, and this unavoidably means that earlier activity cannot benefit.  In this case I would point out that residential units which do not qualify because they were completed before budget day can always be placed on the market for sale to owner-occupiers, the market for which in most cases they were intended and which will continue to be the dominant element in the housing market for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy N. Andrews in relation to the self-employed and pensions.  I should explain that the relevant sections of the Income Tax Act deal only with the conditions which must be satisfied if premiums paid to secure a pension are to qualify for income tax relief.  They do not prevent any person, be he in the business of letting property or not, from entering into a contract with an insurance company which would provide for his retirement.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday that the Commission on Taxation are required to recommend such changes as they consider necessary so as to achieve greater equity in the tax system and I will give consideration to what they have to say on this matter to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Niall Andrews also suggested that dividends from credit unions to members should be exempted from income tax.  Under section 43 of the Finance Act, 1972, the income of registered credit unions is exempted from income tax.  This is an exceptional measure <Col N="1587" /> of relief which does not apply to other financial institutions.  It provides a very substantial benefit for credit unions and their members and I am satisfied that it gives due and adequate recognition to the important role of the credit union movement in the community.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again the Government's determination to strengthen and expand the economy <Col N="1588" /> so as to achieve real long term improvements in the standard of living of our people.  The investment plan and the budget are part of our overall strategy towards reaching this objective.  This Bill, as well as underwriting the budget measures, provides additional incentives for financial and economic improvement.</P>

      <P>Last night the reasons were stated quite clearly by me as to why we could not accept this Bill.  It is full of restrictions and it would completely tie up grocery retailers with premises over 5,000 square feet in such knots that it would be impossible for them to plan their future developments and expansion.</P>

      <P>As spokesman for my party and as a rural Deputy I would like to commend this Bill to the House.  At the outset I indicate my support for the Bill, not with any idea of bashing the supermarket system but because I believe we can achieve a good mix of supermarkets and small traders.  As a rural Deputy I must defend the role of the small trader and the contribution he has made to the well-being of our people down through the years.  His contribution in good times and bad has been worthwhile and that is why I support wholeheartedly the efforts of the Fine Gael Party to promote the interests of the small trader in this Bill. Looking at the situation one must be concerned at its seriousness.  In rural Ireland five supermarkets control 50 per <Col N="1591" /> cent of the trade.  In Dublin city they control 70 per cent of the trade.  Surely we must be concerned at this imbalance and it is my humble opinion that this serious trend must be arrested to ensure the survival of the small trader in the eighties.  If that is not done frightening prospects will face consumers in the years ahead.  Since 1961 small traders have decreased from 17,500 to 8,500 in a market of £900 million per annum, a substantial figure relative to the growth in GNP and in relation to an industry employing 45,000 people.  In Italy 10 per cent of the market is controlled by multinationals. Surely the Government must be concerned to ensure the survival of our small traders who have served us so nobly and well down through the years.  Unless corrective legislative measures are taken we will be faced with the prospect of a monopoly supermarket system.  Should that occur I fear for the consequences in the foreseeable future.  It was made very clear by the last speaker that the Government will vote down this Bill this evening. Like many others I will be asking why?</P>
      <P>I will also be asking why we are not as concerned as our neighbours in the United Kingdom where the planning authorities play a vital role in decision making on the location of supermarkets and in all matters pertaining to population, layout, new towns, and so on.  There is a definite planning input in England. No effort is made here under the Planning Acts to ensure that multinationals and supermarkets are planned to meet the needs of the people.  Why are we not as concerned about the small man as they are in England?  That is a question which will puzzle many people when this Bill is voted down here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a country of small traders and small businessmen.  It frightens me to think that five supermarket companies control such a vast proportion of our retail trade.  I stand by the small shopkeeper in a mixed retail economy, that is, a blend of the supermarket and the small trader.  There is room for both.  Unfortunately, because of the trend in the retail trade at the moment, the small trader is <Col N="1592" /> defenceless.  Unless legislation is enacted his future is bleak.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to curtail the frightening expansion of the multinationals, not to stop it.  It is intended to promote the proper development of the trade in a combination of large and small traders.  The small trader will not get much out of this Bill.  This effort to defend the rights of the small trader will go by the board because of the votes of the Government Party.  I consider this to be progressive legislation.  In the long term it is in the interests of the consumer who is the most vital factor in this aspect of Irish life.  We must be concerned about the consumer.  In the short term the consumer may gain but, when the battle is over and the small trader has been wiped out, the consumer will pay the piper.  The consumer will be faced with the prospect of monopoly supermarkets.  There will be one price to be paid, and no alternative.</P>
    <P>As a layman I believe below cost selling should be banned.  In 1972 we went half way towards that by introducing legislation which banned the advertising of below cost selling.  I am very concerned about the grim determination of five multinational companies to wipe out the small trader even at the cost of five years' losses to ensure a complete takeover of the Irish trade.  We know why they can carry that loss.  They have massive resources, many of them imported from abroad, and they are prepared to fight it out to the finish.  We know what the finish will be.  They will win.  The small trader will be the loser and the consumer will be the final loser.</P>
    <P>I read a supermarket advertisement recently which referred to price war prices.  That is a clear indication of their vicious determination to eradicate people who have always been part of our community. Since I was a young boy the small trader was regarded as a man who served us well at all hours, every day, in good and in bad times.  In bad times we had the &ldquo;book&rdquo; as it was called.  As elected representatives we owe it to the small traders to ensure that they, their families and their employees, have an equitable share of the market, and a fair opportunity to <Col N="1593" /> fight for survival in the eighties against the might of the multinationals.</P>
    <P>The price cutting campaign is a gimmick. If they were genuine in their effort to reduce prices they would give a greater spread over the needs of the consumer. Instead they pick on several items of lesser importance to get people into the shop.  After that you are at the mercy of their gimmicks.  They are very selective. They will not service a non-viable area. They are prepared to go into a substantial market area only.  They are not prepared to serve the public where losses may be involved.</P>
    <P>As spokesman on employment for my party I am also concerned that the excessive development of the supermarket system has affected the food processing industry to a great extent.  There were 1,200 jobs lost in that industry last year. We had 35,000 people employed in that industry.  Unless serious steps are taken to curtail the sale of foreign processed goods through supermarkets there will be further substantial redundancies in the processing industry.</P>
    <P>One question bedevils me.  Where is the Government's concern, as stated in their 1977 manifesto, to develop and promote our food processing industry?  The vast majority of the supermarkets are not concerned with the Buy Irish campaign. This can be confirmed by anybody looking at the shelves in a supermarket to see where the goods were made.  The supermarkets are not concerned about our jobs, our economy, or our people.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which has helped the supermarkets in their efforts to beat the small traders is their lack of interest in the trade union movement, salary structures and proper wages for their staff. Travelling through the country I can see that they employ young cheap labour.  By under paying their staffs they can cut prices.  As I said, I presume the Bill is doomed.  I am concerned and I will continue to be concerned about the small shopkeepers.  Unless legislation is enacted by whatever Dáil is here after 5 May to defend our small traders they will face a doomsday situation.</P>

      <P>I should like to give the <Col N="1594" /> House a resume of my credentials when I speak in support of this Bill.  My father was a small shopkeeper.  I am sure the Minister will be glad to hear I am a qualified and trained supermarket manager. In my day we ran a chain of supermarkets and a wholesale group in the west of Ireland, not as far down as Mayo but in Sligo and Donegal.  Sometimes I wonder why, but I gave it all up to represent the people of Donegal in this House.  Twenty years ago I was a supermarket manager in London and all we were concerned with was building up our turnover and making as much profit and as much commission as we could.  When H. Williams opened their first supermarket here in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not mention names of firms or of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The first supermarket was opened in Dublin and when I came back from England a year or two later we opened the second supermarket in Sligo and we gradually built up a chain of three supermarkets.  Of course the square footage involved 17 or 18 years ago was quite small in comparison to presentday supermarkets. In those days a supermarket measured around 2,000 to 4,000 square feet.  They were not on the massive scale of the hyper stores in the city at present. Some of these massive establishments are bigger than 30,000 square feet.  The supermarkets are not the only attraction. They have possibly two or three acres of free car parking space around them and also nowadays supermarkets are combined with a butchers shop, a drapers shop, a chemist and so on.  A supermarket can sell anything that anyone would want and this creates the tremendous attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not object to the attraction but I object to multiples being determined to put a lot of the smaller shops out of business.  This is not just a party political thing and the Minister should know this. Ten years ago there were 15,000 shops here and they have now been reduced to 7,500.  Over 50 per cent of them have gone.  From my experience in the business I know what these big supermarkets <Col N="1595" /> are liable to do and I would be very concerned if the Minister had not some legislation in mind to introduce here.  Our Bill is not perfect and as a spokesman said last night we would not necessarily introduce it in this form were we in Government with the kind of advice and expertise that the Government have.  The Minister should at least give us a commitment that he has some legislation along these lines to safeguard the welfare of small shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>Groups such as VG, Mace, Spar and NMC were set up to safeguard the livelihood of small shopkeepers.  In such a group they could combine their purchasing power.  This is important because as we know the price is based on the number of case lots that any firm or group can purchase.  These groups were also set up to introduce special offers and they had the advice of experts in marketing.  However the multi-nationals have outpaced these groups because many of them do not need to make a profit like the small shopkeeper.  An English firm with a number of outlets here lost millions in Irish trading last year but they are not worried because the parent firm in England has made hundreds of millions of pounds and they can write off one against the other. Their thinking is that they do not mind losing money for a short time because in the long term when they have the market to themselves prices will gradually be increased and consumers will have nowhere else to go and they will gradually make up their losses.  I defy any supermarket organisation to contradict that.</P>
    <P>There will always be a place for the small efficient corner shopkeeper because that person is willing to work until 10 or 11 at night for his livelihood. There will also be a place for the small shop beside a supermarket because the overflow from the supermarket will keep that shop alive.  However over the past 10 years nearly 50 per cent of the small shopkeepers have gone to the wall. Unless legislation is introduced shortly a lot more shops will close up.  There is legislation to curb the size of supermarkets in England, France, Holland and Belgium.  There is legislation in all the <Col N="1596" /> countries around us but we have not awakened to the fact that legislation is needed here.</P>
    <P>This Bill may not be exactly right but there are some good points in it.  This Bill says that any supermarket organisation over 5,000 square feet wishing to open here should get a licence from the Minister. That is a reasonable thing to ask. We are not asking existing supermarkets to get a licence to operate.  We are only asking for a licence for new supermarkets. Surely it is terrifying to realise that five supermarket chains in Dublin city control 70 per cent of the entire retail turnover of the city.  Is it too much to ask the Minister to guarantee that three supermarket chains combined should not have more than 45 per cent of the market. If legislation is not introduced and the small shopkeepers come to us in a few years' time we will not be talking about a 45 per cent share of the market but possibly about a 70 per cent share of the market for three supermarket chains.</P>
    <P>I am all for low prices and fair competition but I condemn the present setup where supermarkets are undercutting each other.  We all know from our experience that we can get people into our store by picking out four or five items and selling them below cost.  The items generally picked will be butter, sugar, cornflakes and so on.  Few of these supermarket chains have not picked three or four of this type of item to entice people into their stores.  We know also that many of these supermarkets are not making their profits out of the grocery section &mdash; much of their turnover may be from the grocery section &mdash; but a lot of their profit emanates from the hardware, soft goods, wines and drapery sections, commodities having nothing whatever to do with the retailing of food.  These people are tremendously organised as far as merchandising is concerned and, once they entice people into their shops, impulse buying takes place.  They do not mind losing 2p on two lbs. of sugar or 3p on a packet of cornflakes, because if they manage to sell a pair of shoes probably they will get approximately £2 back on that sale alone.</P>
    <P>Of late I have wondered whether we have gone stark, staring mad when we <Col N="1597" /> walk into any of our supermarkets today. Unlike the supermarkets about which I was speaking, of 2,000 or 3,000 square feet only, those nowadays are not interested in selling Irish goods.  I can remember ten or 15 years ago when cornflakes were manufactured here, when Willwoods were going strong on the far side of the city selling Irish products.  I can remember Irish eggs and chickens being sold here.  I would ask the Minister the next time he goes into a supermarket to lift the packet of cornflakes and see where they have been manufactured, or the pot of jam, or packet of biscuits.  The chances are that it will be no longer Jacobs or Bolands but some other brand imported from England or Germany.  What is even worse, lift a box of eggs and see where they have come from.  Today one in every three eggs eaten in southern Ireland is imported from Britain or Northern Ireland. In addition, one in every four chickens eaten in southern Ireland is imported from Northern Ireland.  The point I am making is that these people do not give two damns as long as they can get their commodities cheaper than the small shopkeeper, cheaper than the groups. They do not give two damns about unemployment in Ireland at present.  Of late I have asked myself are we sane at all here, when one sees the amount of imported goods being used, the amount of food eaten in southern Ireland which has been imported, when the next day in the papers we see an unemployment figure of 130,000.  Unless we get across the message to housewives, to storekeepers, to stock Irish goods, to promote and merchandise them, it will only be a matter of time before practically every egg, chicken and packet of biscuits eaten in Ireland is imported.</P>
    <P>This might not be a perfect Bill but, before this country goes down on its knees, before the remaining small shopkeepers go down on their knees, before another 2,000 or 3,000 of them have to close their doors because of unfair competition, let us look into our hearts and realise that this is indeed unfair competition. The multinationals in this country do not care whether they make £200,000 today because they know they will make <Col N="1598" /> a lot more in four or five years' time. Somebody once said that nobody gains from a war.  Nobody will gain from this war.  In the long term the people who will lose will be the shopkeepers, the housewives, who will eventually be asked to pay the piper to get their goods, thereby ensuring that these multinationals make the millions they do in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation here in which multinational groups can capture such a huge slice of our grocery trade would have met with all-party disapproval heretofore.  I am disappointed this evening that we have had no commitment from the Minister that the Government will really tackle this problem in order to curtail the development of these multinational supermarket groups and their chains around the country.  I would have thought that the Fianna Fáil Party, the present Government, would have agreed with the Labour Party on this motion.  Indeed, I would have thought that all three parties would have been in agreement on this subject and I am really disappointed that there is not this cooperative spirit which is needed in regard to this very important matter.  The present Government represent a group of people many of whom were small farmers, shopkeepers or business people in the past.  I put it to the two Government representatives sitting here this evening to look inside their own cumainn throughout the length and breadth of the country and establish whom they represent. The present Government were not sent here by the multinationals.  They were sent here to do a job on behalf of the people of Ireland.  That is why this Bill is so relevant.  Unless the direction the Government are taking at present is realised, unless they are fully aware of exactly what they are doing, then they have completely lost sight of and are out of touch with the people they represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are speaking here this evening about the uncurtailed development of supermarkets in this country.  We are speaking of a situation in which the major portion of our grocery trade is moving out of the hands of Irish men and women. We in Fine Gael &mdash; I should like this to <Col N="1599" /> be clearly understood &mdash; are in favour of supermarkets, we are in favour of progress, we are in favour of the consumer. But we are not in favour &mdash; and this is where we differ from the present Government &mdash; of allowing these multinational chains and supermarket groups to continue to develop, the ultimate result of which will be the total elimination of other people engaged in the business.  We want progress, we want growth, but we do not want them at the expense of other people involved in this very important sector of our grocery trade.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government have not taken action before now. With a general election in the offing, I should have thought the present Government would have had the commonsense to realise what a major issue this is with the people of Ireland who are concerned at what is happening at present in the grocery trade.  The people are concerned about the growth in the importation of every type of food sold in supermarkets. The Government have refused to take any action.  There is no check on the funds that are paid into political parties. I believe that it is necessary to have such checks carried out.  Why do the multinationals continue to wield the power they are exercising at the moment?</P>
    <P>A large supermarket group have stated that they intend to continue the price war until they wipe out their opposition.  That is the most ruthless statement I have ever heard.  Who are the opposition that particular supermarket group intend to wipe out?  They are a number of Irish supermarket groups and small grocery shops throughout the country.  We have a duty to ensure, irrespective of what price war is going on, that they can continue in business.  The power of Dáil Éireann should be used to ensure that those people are not wiped out.  It will not be the fault of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour party if those small supermarkets and grocery shops throughout the country go out of business.  The blame will rest squarely on the shoulders of the Government because they have waited until it is too late.</P>
    <P>This matter has been mentioned on <Col N="1600" /> radio, television and in our national newspapers.  It has received widespread publicity throughout the country but the Government are not doing anything.  The final responsibility rests with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. They will have to carry the responsibility for failing to act.</P>
    <P>The geography department of UCD carried out a survey late last year and presented a report.  I hope that report has been studied by the Minister.  I have not been able to verify the accuracy of it but there were some disquieting points raised in it.  The report showed that the supermarket chains were manipulating prices to eliminate competition from the small family grocers and the small supermarkets by cut-price selling.  Quite a number of our national papers referred to this report.  It showed that the large supermarket chains were charging higher prices for food in the poor areas of this city than they were charging in the better off areas.  That should have led to immediate action by the Government but nothing has been done.  The elderly and the poor people have no means of travelling long distances to where some of the large supermarkets are, if there is not a supermarket in their own area.  Perhaps the large supermarket chains know that in the better-off areas of the city people are more selective.  This report showed they made excessive profits from the poor areas of the city.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to investigate what was said in this report and to bring in legislation if necessary.  Nothing was done.  Some people say that the large supermarkets help to keep down the price of food.  When they are making food dearer in the poorer areas of the city it shows the regard they have for consumers. The Minister will not be able to do anything at the moment because we are going into recess.  He should certainly do something after the recess.  If he does not want to get involved in the low cost selling I will give him an idea which might help.  When one goes into a supermarket to buy an item which is being sold at below cost one is permitted to buy one, two or three items but one is not allowed to purchase any more of that particular <Col N="1601" /> item.  If an article is offered at below cost on a shelf in a supermarket, a purchaser should be allowed to buy out the entire stock if he wishes.  If people were allowed to do this below cost selling would be sorted out very quickly.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of below cost selling because of the serious effect it has on small supermarkets and grocery shops throughout the country but people should be allowed to purchase unlimited quantities of whatever items are being sold at below cost.  That could wipe out below cost selling very rapidly but I do not understand why the Government are not acting at this stage.  All I am asking is that they would find the energy to do something now in this area because if positive action is not taken we will lose up to 80 per cent of our grocery trade. The remaining 20 per cent will be those in the really small towns and villages and in scattered rural areas.  These will survive. Before this happens I am confident that the people will decide that they want action and that they will let their views in this respect be known at the next general election, whether that may be in the near future or at the end of the year.  I expect this issue to be a major one in that election.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports in this area, the last one having been commissioned in August 1979.  That report was completed in December 1979 and was in the hands of the Minister in November 1980 but during all of that time he allowed a certain situation to develop the result of which has been the price war.  We have seen the results of this price war.  More than half of the Irish food market has been taken out of the hands of the Irish people and about 50 per cent of that market consists now of imported foods.  What further proof does the Minister need before taking action? He must know that there are between 45,000 and 47,000 people involved in the food industry.  If some action is not taken now there will be further redundancies in this industry.  The action that the Minister is being asked to take is simple and straightforward.  It is to curtail the size of these supermarkets, as is happening in <Col N="1602" /> many other European countries where the efforts are proving successful.  We should have been able to take note of the lesson that we were getting from other countries but we failed to do so.  Efforts to limit the size of supermarkets would not prevent the orderly development of these premises.  Such efforts together with a ban on below cost selling would have provided the answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>The action we are advocating is important, too, in another respect.  Life in our towns has been centred around the main streets but what is happening now is that the big supermarket chains are building on the edges of towns, sometimes a mile outside them, with the result that life is going out of the centre of our towns.  Such a development cannot be of benefit to our people.  The whole structure of life in our towns is being changed by the development of these supermarkets on the outskirts. In many areas such development is causing problems of congestion and so on.</P>
    <P>The size of the supermarkets being built is to the detriment of the orderly development of our food industry.  We are speaking mainly here about the grocery trade and I shall not depart from that except in passing to ask the Minister to remember that we are speaking about the food industry.  Tomorrow evening, perhaps, we shall be speaking about the hardware section of Irish business or about the electrical or some other such aspect of our business activity as they are affected by the takeovers by these multinational chains.  This whole process is something that we should be giving a lead in now and that lead can be given by the way in which we tackle the development of the food industry.  If we fail to take action in respect of that industry these multinational groups will come in and, having taken over our food industry, will take over also many other sections of our business and industrial life.</P>
    <P>We as a nation must learn to stand on our own feet and realise that we are in a competitive world.  Having regard to our record in terms of inflation we are losing our competitiveness and because of this we must make every effort to help the people in industrial life to survive.  The <Col N="1603" /> Minister must understand fully that if we fail to help these people we are failing in our responsibilities.  In years to come people will be very critical of the kind of growth which the Government have allowed in this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister's purpose in accepting the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission was to distract public attention from the basic problem of food price increases.  The report was a convenient way out.  The Minister wishes the public to believe that he is doing something about controlling prices by accepting this report, but the contrary is the case.  While supermarkets may reduce the prices of some items, the consumer will suffer in the long term.  In many instances similar prices may be offered by other shops in the vicinity but the massive advertising of the large supermarkets succeeds in attracting customers to their premises.</P>
    <P>This may be the last opportunity to discuss the matter in this House during the life of the present Government.  In my view it will be a major issue in the coming general election.  It is a matter which has received considerable attention from the media.  This whole question concerns the manufacturing and processing of food, its packaging and distribution and sale to consumers.  Jobs are at stake in our food industry and the editors of our national newspapers have a responsibility to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government are opposing this Bill and I believe the people will give them their answer when the general election is called.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank those who have contributed to the debate on this Bill.  Some of the contributions were very effective and informative and showed that the contributors had a grasp of the problem and saw the efficacy of the Bill in squarely confronting the difficulties which now face the retail grocery industry.  Normally a Private Members' Bill is torn to shreds by the Government who have at their disposal the expertise of the parliamentary draftsman in pointing out anomalies and inadequacies in <Col N="1604" /> the Bill.  I am heartened to note that this has not happened in the case of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There was one pathetic effort last night by a Deputy from the Government side who, having been stopped from reading his script, resorted to reading the Bill. All he could say after each section was that the Minister was being given too much power.  That may be a fault, but as things stand I would prefer the Minister of the day, even a Fianna Fáil Minister, to have power rather than have it in the hands of multiples and multinationals, where it lies at present.</P>
      <P>Where is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism?  Is he afraid to contribute to a debate on a Bill concerning an industry for which he is responsible? Ministers are important and very busy people but I have seen Deputy O'Malley around the House both last week and this week.  There may be some excuse in the case of a one-week debate because a Minister may be out of the country, but this Minister is within the precincts of this building and in some minutes will probably vote against this Bill.  I am damned if he will come in and speak to defend his action.  This surprises me because through the years the one thing Deputy O'Malley has shown is guts but even that seems to be deserting him now.</P>
      <P>This Bill has come hot on the heels of the publication of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on below cost selling.  When that report appeared, having been eagerly awaited by the industry and by all of us in this House, its recommendations were accepted willy-nilly by the Minister.</P>

    <P>Section 7 of this Bill deals with below cost selling.  There was some excuse for those who compiled the report in not recommending a ban on below cost selling. In 1978 and 1979, when the report was complied, these people had no experience of the kind of vicious price war that has raged here for the past few months.  The Minister, however, has not the same excuse.  He has had the advantage of reading the report and of seeing this price war in action.  With the experience of hindsight he ought to have been able to say that he would have accepted <Col N="1605" /> the recommendations in the report on below cost selling were it not for the fact that due to recent experience he now knows it ought to be banned.  He flunked it and accepted the recommendations in the report.  What do we get from the Minister and from his Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher?  A promise that the Restrictive Practices Commission will sit once more to consider the real issue, the trading terms which multiples get from suppliers and manufacturers.  This offer is being made despite the fact that the grocery trade &mdash; RGDATA, IADT and NAIR, the three arms that represent the trade &mdash; are painfully aware that since 1972 a report was available to the Minister giving the exact replies to the specific questions which will be asked to be considered by this promised commission. As these people rightly said, it is a waste of public money and they have publicly expressed their non-desire to take part in their hearings.  They can be subpoenaed and summoned to give evidence at the hearings because of the official standing of the commission, but they are going there under protest and reluctantly, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in a statement issued by the Government Information Services referring to a meeting held between him and the IADT/RGDATA representatives on 12 November 1980, said:</P>
    <P>The Minister assured the delegation that he shared the concern of the independent sector of the trade and that he was determined that the correct course of action to deal with these problems be identified and implemented at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>The problem with Fianna Fáil is that they are forever trying to identify things and never reach the identification stage.  I am sure if they had ten murderers in a line up of 11, they would not pick out the one non-murderer.  We, are in an economic mess for the same reason, that is, that they will not admit there is a problem nor identify it.  The Minister is still trying to identify the problem relating to the grocery industry when any five year old son <Col N="1606" /> or daughter of a grocer could tell him in ten minutes what the problem is.</P>
    <P>In the commission's report, paragraph 2.21, there is reference to the expansion of multiples.</P>
    <P>Most of the multiples indicated that they planned continued expansion. Where one multiple opens a new store in an area already served by another, the trade which the former gains may be largely at the expense of the latter, but over all it is to be expected that the opening of new multiple branches will bring about a further transfer of trade from the independent to the multiple sector.</P>
    <P>That is the considered view of the commission. The same view has been expreseed by the Confederation of Irish Industry who gave evidence to this commission.  We have now reached the stage where close on 50 per cent of the total trade of £900 million is in the hands of the multiples.  Yet the Minister is prepared to sit back and try to identify, according to him, the problem that exists when the problem is staring him in the face.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.</P>
    <P>This Bill is realistic and implementable. The fact that it has not been torn to shreds by the Government, that it has been accepted as being a practical effort to solve this problem, should mean it will be accepted by the Government, and amended to their way of thinking, without destroying the fundamental parts which deal with the two main factors &mdash; the uncontrolled expansion of multiples and below cost selling.  The <i>modus operandi</i> in which expansion is to be controlled is practical.  I have been careful to draw on existing legislation &mdash; for example, the Mergers Act, 1978, and the Casual Trading Act, 1980 &mdash; to ensure that the method used to apply control is practical and in accordance with the wishes of the parliamentary drafts people.</P>
    <P>On below cost selling the commission recommended that it be allowed to continue. Deputy White, who had some years experience, has given the Minister a lesson in what he should already know. Where below cost selling some items <Col N="1607" /> takes place the housewife is paying through the nose for other items.  If a multiple store drops 2p, 3p or 10p on the price of a loaf or a pound of butter, they will make not 2p or 10p, but £2 or £3, on a pair of shoes in the footwear section, or they might make £5, £6 or £10 on a suit or a dress in the drapery section. That is the way they operate and it is a well known fact.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind that the multiple outlets account for nearly 50 per cent of the grocery trade.  To back up what Deputy White said, only yesterday from no less a man than the Taoiseach, I got the following figures in relation to imports of clothing and footwear.  The value in millions of pounds in clothing imports since 1977, when it stood at £90.2 million, is now £201.6 million, and footwear imports have risen from £22.9 million in 1977 to £56.9 million today.  These facts are also relevant to food and vegetables, because approximately half of our total <Col N="1608" /> food and vegetable requirements are imported.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to wheel the scrum around and be seen as the saviour of the consumers, but he is now off-side If he can stand up and shed crocodile tears for the consumer, why has he allowed prices to spiral over the last three years?  Below-cost selling is not favourable to the consumer, and the Minister knows it.  The Consumers' Association of Ireland and the Irish Housewifes' Association have expressed that view publicly on radio and television.  Two supermarkets who were in on the ground floor and who gave evidence supporting below-cost selling are now screaming for mercy and asking the Minister to intervene.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and express my dismay and disappointment at the fact that Deputy O'Malley did not have the guts to come into the House and speak to this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising a matter which has been described in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> as &ldquo;the great breathalyser escape&rdquo;.  Under the Road Traffic Act, 1968, amended by the Road Traffic Act, 1978, all samples of blood and urine taken from suspected drunken drivers are sent to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for analysis.  On 23 October a fire destroyed part of the bureau premises. The result is that samples subsequently taken and sent to the bureau have not been analysed.</P>
      <P>Despite this, gardaí continue to arrest people, breathalyse them and take blood or urine samples.  Samples taken between 23 October and 15 February, when the bureau was brought back into operation will not be analysed at all.  As a result, it is estimated that nearly 3,000 persons who had been charged with drunken driving will not be charged.</P>
      <P>A number of questions arise from this situation.  At this stage, more than six months later, it behoves the Government to give a full explanation to the House of the occurrence.  I suggest the Minister for the Environment must give an explanation why alternative arrangements were not made immediately after the problem arose.  The obvious alternative was to have the samples analysed elsewhere. The response of the Minister to such a suggestion may be that the 1978 Act requires that such samples shall be sent to the Medical Bureau and analysed by the bureau as soon as practicable.  The answer to such a response is that if amending legislation had become necessary the Government should have brought it before the Oireachtas and in that way provide for alternative arrangements.</P>
      <P>However, there is a more serious aspect which the Minister will have to deal with.  Why was this affair covered up for so long?  Failure to make an announcement over a short period until such time as alternative arrangements have been made could be understood, but I suggest that alternative arrangements could have been made and the position remedied by way of amending legislation within a couple of weeks.  That was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have to consider what has been happening throughout the last six months.  Many gardaí consider they had been made fools of.  They continued to operated the Act, to arrest people they suspected of drunken driving, breath-tested them and took samples of blood or urine from them.  A special drive was made by the Garda during the Christmas period although, as the Government were <Col N="1611" /> aware, the analysing facilities were not available.  Indeed the Government were aware that these services were not in operation for a considerable time afterwards.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael spokesman, I have a special responsibility for and interest in the Garda.  The non-disclosure by the Government of the situation put many gardaí in an invidious position.  Did the Government consider what the reaction of the public would be when people who they knew had been arrested were not prosecuted?  Did the Government think of the damage this could do to the good name of the Force?</P>
    <P>Consider the position of the people arrested.  Under section 22 of the 1978 Act, copies of the certificates of the Medical Bureau should be forwarded to them &ldquo;as soon as practicable after analysis&rdquo;. Those people were left sweating for months.</P>
    <P>I also have to suggest that there was a massive cover-up as far as this House and the general public were concerned. Whatever about the merits of non-publicity prior to February, and the Minister may argue about that, when the system was out of operation, surely a public announcement should have been made immediately thereafter.  The whole affair is evidence of Government mismanagement. They were unable to respond to a situation when it arose.  They were unwilling to disclose the situation thereafter to this House, to the Garda or to the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, about 3,200 people would have been involved in this matter and would have been summonsed if things had proceeded normally.  The position is that fees would have been paid to doctors for breathalysing those people and for carrying out blood and urine tests.  The cost would have been in the region of £45,000 paid by the State in expenses alone which will not be recouped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feeling of grave injustice by the Garda about what happened.  They have been doing their best, especially over the Christmas period.  Samples have <Col N="1612" /> been taken, people have been arrested and difficult procedures have been followed. All this has been a complete waste of time and the Garda feel very strongly about it.  I have spoken to a number of gardaí today who are very upset about it. Under the old section dealing with drunken driving, people could have been arrested and charged.  People who were convicted on dates prior to that and who will be convicted on dates since at &mdash; October 23 and February 16 &mdash; feel they are scapegoats.</P>
    <P>It is something the Government should have made known to the public far earlier. Alternative premises should have been provided and, if they were not in a position to do that, the Garda should have been instructed to proceed under section 49.  They would have been able to bring cases before the courts and to get convictions.  They may not have been able to get borderline convictions but obvious cases could have been dealt with. I am amazed that something has not happened before now.  The legislation was commendable and quite successful.  It is very serious to see this breakdown now. The Government have been neglectful in this matter in not taking action before now and should make a complete and public apology for their failure in regard to this matter.  The whole issue has been badly handled.  State money has been wasted, doctors' fees have been paid and Garda time has been wasted.  The Minister should apologise to the Garda Síochána who have done so much to try to enforce this commendable legislation which has fallen into disrepute because of the monumental blunder by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Medical Bureau of Road Safety was established under the Road Traffic Act, 1968, to carry out analysis of blood and urine specimens for the Garda. These specimens are from persons suspected of offences of driving, or being in charge of a vehicle, with alcohol in their system in excess of a specified level.  The bureau after analysis issues a certificate of the results of the analysis in each case for evidence in any prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> The bureau premises, which are located at Earlsfort Terrace, were damaged by an outbreak of fire on the evening of 25 October 1980.  No specimens for analysis or analytical records were lost and all specimens received had been analysied up to the date of the fire.  The temporary use of other laboratories by the bureau was considered but was found to be altogether impracticable.  Delicate and complex laboratory equipment of the kind used and suitable accommodation for it obviously cannot be replaced overnight. All efforts were directed, therefore, towards the restoration of the laboratory and office facilities in the old premises.  The bureau resumed analysis on 23 February 1981 and all specimens received by them on or after 16 February 1981 have been analysed in their turn. The issue of a certificate following the analysis normally takes place a week or so after receipt of a specimen.  Specimens received during the period 25 October 1980 to 15 February 1981 have not been analysed because of scientific and forensic considerations.  I am sure the Deputies will appreciate that the idea of any makeshift arrangement to deal with blood samples would have been completely out of the question in view of the legal implications.</P>
    <P>I should also point out to the Deputies that, apart from the power to prosecute <Col N="1614" /> based on measured blood alcohol, there is power to prosecute under sections 49 and 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, on the basis of clinical examination or other evidence, for driving or being in charge of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  It would be a matter for the appropriate authorities to decide whether prosecutions should or could be taken on that basis in any of the cases where the bureau was unable to analyse.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that everything possible was done to overcome the difficulties which stemmed from the fire and, in view of the foregoing, I would not accept that there was anything more than a temporary and unavoidable interruption of the bureau's analytical functions.  There was no question of a cover-up.  All interests concerned knew the facts, including the Garda authorities.  In retrospect I have no doubt, and I understand from the authorities in the Department of Justice that they have no doubt, that the decision to continue the breathalyser procedure after 25 October was correct and totally sustainable.  The breathalyser is, possibly, the greatest preventative agent in road accidents, a feature of this being the reduction by 53 of the number of road deaths in 1980 over the previous year.</P>

The arrangements made for the allocation of manpower as between foot patrols and other duties in any particular area are matters for the Garda officers concerned.  The number of gardá on foot patrol in Cork varies considerably from time to time and depends on factors such as the available resources, local circumstances, other demands for Garda services and the time of day or night.</P>

    <P>* Mr. Hardiman is paid a salary of £12,593 by the NBST solely in his capacity as its part-time chief executive.  Total salary paid to him in 1980 is £13,073.

As regards (c) I would refer the Deputy to Dáil Debates of Tuesday, 26 June 1979, (Vol, 315 Col. 903), where a similar question was answered and with which a comparison of membership of the various boards can be made.

    <P>When I became aware of the intention to discontinue this telephone service I had discussions with the association as from 12 March 1981 in an endeavour to have the service continued.  They agreed to continue answering the telephones and to review the situation.  Following this review the association notified me that <Col N="1502" /> on and from 30 March 1981 no telephone inquiries would be accepted in the sections dealing with the payment of disability and associated benefits.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the association are continuing with a view to having normal telephone services restored as soon as possible.  In the meantime I have had a number of additional telephone extensions provided from the Áras Mhic Dhiarmada switchboard to my private office to deal with queries regarding disability, injury and maternity benefits, which are the only benefits involved.</P>
    <P>In the present difficult situation, however, only a restricted service can be given and I would accordingly request that telephone inquiries regarding these benefits be made only in urgent cases.

      <P>On the 11 July 1980, proceedings under section 45 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, were instituted by the Minister for Labour against the firm in question for failure to pay a number of agricultural workers the statutory minimum remuneration provided for in the Agricultural Employment Regulation Order made on 20 September 1978.</P>
      <P>The Minister also applied for an order under section 45 (2) of the Act for payment of arrears of wages to the four workers concerned.  The summonses were dismissed on the grounds that the enterprise was not agriculture.</P>
