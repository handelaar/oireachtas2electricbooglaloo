      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education why he did not consult with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation or the management authorities before he raised the age of admission to national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>By letter of 16 November 1981 I was officially informed by the INTO that at its special congress in Limerick on Saturday, 14 November 1981 the following resolution was adopted:</P>
      <P>Congress declares that the Organisation shall seek a Declaration in the Courts that the Minister for Education is in breach of contract or has induced a breach of contract of teachers in National Schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet been informed of the nature of the pleadings which the INTO will advance in court in support of their case.  I consider that it is reasonable and prudent that I should not at this stage be induced to make statements in relation <Col N="1804" /> to the general issue which might subsequently come to be regarded as prejudicial to the defence which the State would put forward in the case.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that I should not answer these questions at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if he consulted the Attorney General and if the view of the Attorney General was that he should not answer the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thing I should do is to follow the precedents that have been set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not regard the right of a Member of this House to put down a parliamentary question to elicit information for the benefit of the House and the country as being a sacred right and one that should not be interfered with just because the Minister wants to get out of answering a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the important rights a Deputy has in this House is the right to table a question at Question Time and it is a right I would always defend. However, the Deputy and the House will appreciate that precedents grow up during the years in relation to answering certain types of question and it is normal to follow such precedents.  For instance, on Tuesday, 20 November 1979 the then Deputy John Horgan asked the then Minister for Education the following question:</P>
      <P>If he will hold an inquiry into the dismissal of a teacher (details supplied); if he has satisfied himself that the dismissal was carried out in accordance with the rules of his Department; if he will quote the rule concerned; if an officer of the Department when contacted by telephone by the teacher concerned, instructed her to return to work until the postal strike was over; if the Department furnished an oral ruling to the INTO in this particular case; the date and contents of any such ruling; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson): The person in question acted as a substitute teacher for a period on the staff of a national school and, accordingly, was not employed by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated that she intends to institute legal proceedings in relation to a matter connected with her employment as substitute teacher.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to make further comment at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that the case in question was one of a contract between a teacher and a board of management rather than a matter directly affecting his Department? Further, will he not admit that this is a question related to the whole country?  Is it not the practice for the Questions Office to reject anything that is <i>sub judice</i>? Is he contending that this matter is <i>sub judice?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last week, I think there is some confusion between matters that are <i>sub judice</i> and in which notice of intention to take legal proceedings has been given.  For instance, in the question on Tuesday, 20 November 1979 the question of a contract which the teacher had or did not have in that case was the subject matter of that question.  Because notice of intention to take legal proceedings had been given, the Minister of the day felt constrained to answer in the way he did and the Questions Office allowed the question to be tabled and answered. The similarity between that case and the one here is striking.  There are other precedents as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious matter of principle involving the rights of Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson, you may remember quoting to me a precedent which I had occasion to look up after Question Time and the information <Col N="1806" /> you gave me was not quite correct.  It was about a number of questions being answered together.  They were not answered individually on the occasion to which you referred me, they were answered together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, to support a suggestion made by another Member of the House, I indicated that we should take time off to have some consultation on the matter that the 17 questions at that time put down by me to the then Minister for Education be taken on the following day.  Does the Minister, as a third party commenting from the outside, tell the House that the question of the Department of Education refusing to comment on contract between two contracting parties is parallel to this question before the House now on a matter of interest to the whole country, not as an individual case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House one of the numbers of precedents that exist in relation to matters such as this.  I do not want to delay the House in quoting the other precedents involved in the recent past except to say that I have done nothing out of the ordinary and have merely continued the practice which was engaged in by my predecessor in replying to questions of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely will realise the big difference between giving notice of intent and the actual serving of the writ which would make the matter <i>sub judice</i>.  How long can the Department and he shelter behind a notice of intent and how long will that last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am not the author of the letter that has brought about this situation.  As I said last week, I regret this situation at least as much as if not more than the Deputy who tabled the question.  I would far prefer to be in a position to explain to the House the answers to the questions concerned and the matters involved.  I would much prefer to be free to do that.  The question which I quoted previously which was answered in November 1979 related to <Col N="1807" /> an individual case.  There are other precedents in relation to the general cases also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he has notice of intent from the INTO, which is a lot more than the Minister gave to the INTO or to the management authorities or parents when he announced this circular.  Why did he announce this directive on 12 August when probably he knew full well that the INTO offices were closed, as they always are between 4 and 14 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the Minister did not consult and does not want to admit now that he did not consult anybody, either the managerial association or the relevant trade union with regard to this?  Is that not the plain, unadorned fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already replied to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter I would be very concerned with the rights of Deputies to put down and receive answers to questions.  We are having a surfeit of attempts to override the traditions and procedures in this House without having it extended into this area also. In pursuance of that anxiety of mine I want to ask this question.  Am I right in thinking from the Minister's reply that he is refusing to answer these questions because he has received a letter from the Irish National Teachers Organisation? Does he realise that the question also deals with consultation with the management authorities?  Is he suggesting that because he received a letter from the INTO, that prohibits him from dealing with a question about another body entirely, namely the management authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not refusing to answer any question.  I have already answered the question as best I am able <Col N="1808" /> in the circumstances.  As I pointed out to the House in the course of that answer, I consider that at this stage I should not be induced to make statements in relation to a general issue which subsequently might come to be regarded as prejudical to the defence which the State might put forward in the case.  I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will appreciate that that is the difficulty which I face in relation to making any comment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I am asking the Minister if he understands that the question is in two parts.  It refers on the one hand to consultation with the INTO and on the other hand to consultation with the management authorities.  Whatever may be the rights of his refusing to answer a simple question about consultation with the INTO because he has received a letter from the INTO, is he seriously and honestly contending that, because he received a letter from the INTO, that prevents him also from giving us a simple answer as to whether he consulted with the management authorities who are a totally separate and distinct organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One final supplementary. Could the Minister tell the House if he was advised not to answer the question, and, if so, by whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.  I think it would be inappropriate to answer the second part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the adviser legally qualified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was advised by the same source as advised my predecessor when he formulated the reply to the question of Tuesday, 20 November 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that he has now set a precedent in terms of industrial relations between the <Col N="1809" /> Department and the INTO?  Is he taking constructive account of the move within that organisation at the moment arising out of that precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very concerned that a constructive attitude would be taken on all sides in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information that a legal case is going ahead?  Has he consulted, as I have, with the office of the INTO on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have already informed the House that I have information that the legal case is going ahead. The information is by letter of 16 November last from the INTO, the relevant passage from which I have already quoted to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister consulted with the INTO since then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a legal case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>In relation to Circular 24/81 in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly familiar with this process but I would imagine that when one gets notice of intention to take legal proceedings against one, one does not ring up to know when one might get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate whether he has received any information, good, bad or indifferent, from the management authorities that they intend to take legal proceedings against him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, does that not, in the normal precedent and tradition of this House, indicate that the Minister should answer fully that section of the question, as there is no threat of any legal action from the management <Col N="1810" /> authorities?

      <P>I am advised, as I have already pointed out to the Deputy in reply to supplementary questions on Question No. 5, that that is the normal procedure followed within the Department of Education in handling Parliamentary Questions in which matters of this type might arise.  I have already given an example from November 1979.  I have a further example.  On Tuesday, 30 May 1980, the then Deputy, Dan Spring, asked the then Minister for Education the reasons why he had not sanctioned the appointment of a principal at the School of Engineering in the Regional Technical College in Tralee, County Kerry.  The then Minister for Education answered:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Legal proceedings were threatened in this case in relation to the procedure for the filling of the vacancy by the vocational education committee.  I considered it necessary in the circumstances to seek legal advice.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that I should make further observations in regard to the matter at this stage other than to say that a decision will be expedited as much as possible.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The only source for this figure that I have is from a confidential memorandum produced by the Minister for Finance suggesting that savings of £19 million might be brought about if the age of entry for primary school children was raised to six years, which was submitted to the Cabinet and to the Minister for Education.  My only source of knowledge of that circular is from the fact that Deputy Wilson quoted from that internal memorandum produced by the Minister for Finance and submitted to the Cabinet.  He said that the date of the circular was October, 1980, when Deputy Fitzgerald was Minister for Finance and Deputy Wilson Minister for Education.</P>

Did he consult experts within his own Department in regard to the very special case that pertains to this type of area to determine the complete and total <Col N="1817" /> lack of any form of alternative for those very serious, significant, formative months in a child's development?

      <P>I have already explained, in reply to Question No. 7 by Deputy Blaney, that no two-teacher school will become a one-teacher school as a result of this change.  As the Deputy knows, the school at Hedgestown had, for one-quarter, fallen below the retention figure necessary to retain two teachers prior to the change in the age of entry requirement.  Consequently, any difficulty which is or may be experienced in that school was not occasioned in any way by the change in the age of entry requirement but by other factors stretching back over the past 12 months.  I understand however that arrangements are being made, which I am endeavouring to encourage, to see that the enrolment at the school at Hedgestown will continue and that the Hedgestown school, which is a school with an honourable tradition, will continue to be a two-teacher school.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Question No. 7, I referred the House to the general comments I made during the course of the debate on a Private Members' Motion some weeks ago.  In relation to the question posed by Deputy Burke, because the problems in that school are extraneous and quite separate from anything relating to the question of the age of entry, I felt it was appropriate to deal with it in case people in that area might be misled by the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>I do not anticipate that the decision to raise the age of admission to primary schools will affect school transport services in a way which would be educationally disadvantageous or necessitate major adjustments in relation to its administration. In view of the resolutions adopted at the special congress of the INTO on 14 November 1981 that congress declares that the organisation shall seek a declaration in the courts in relation to the amendment of the regulation govering the enrolment of pupils in national schools, I am afraid that it is not open to me to make further observations on the subject matter of these questions from the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister review the qualifying number of ten children to establish a school transport service?  At the moment we have a ridiculous situation because a child of four years can be carried to the school but would not be admitted until he is four-and-a-half years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The question of allowing farm accounts, as accepted by the Revenue Commissioners, instead of rateable valuation for the purpose of the means test under the 1981 Higher Education Grants Scheme was considered earlier this year, but it was decided against.</P>
      <P>I have full sympathy with the spirit of the Deputies' questions and have asked some time ago for a thorough investigation of methods whereby farm accounts, as accepted by the Revenue Commissioners, could also be accepted for determining income eligibility for higher education grant purposes.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government, on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government 1981-1986, have already made substantial upwards adjustments in the valuation thresholds for means test purposes in this regard.</P>
      <P>The details of those improvements are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) parents whose family income <Col N="1830" /> derives from a holding of rateable valuation not exceeding £64 &mdash; as compared with £35 previously &mdash; are for purposes of the means test eligible for maximum maintenance and lecture fee benefits while, for a lower rate of grant aid, the maximum rateable valuation has been raised from £50 to £96;</P>
    <P>(ii) fees grants may be paid in the case of rateable valuation up to a maximum of £112, while the previous maximum was £50.</P>
    <P>In addition to the investigation regarding farm accounts, I am also reviewing all aspects of the Higher Education Grants Scheme with a view to seeing whether other improvements can be effected.  It is intended that such changes as may be possible will be made in time to come into operation for the 1982 scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister said that audited accounts are accepted by the Revenue Commissioners in assessing the gross or net income of any individual who may be self-employed, would the Minister accept that the certified audited accounts of farmers should be accepted as an assessment of means for the purposes of third level education grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the utmost sympathy for the general tenor of the Deputhy's question and the objective he is endeavouring to achieve.  There is a particular difficulty in relation to farm accounts as agreed by the Revenue Commissioners in so far as normally they are not agreed for several years after the accounting year.  Consequently there is a difficulty in relating them to the year of application for higher education grant purposes.  I am examining the situation to ascertain whether some method could be devised which would relate the accounts procedure more to the year of application.  If I can in any way bring about a situation where acceptable farm accounts as accepted by the Revenue Commissioners can be related to the year in which the application for the grant is made, I would hope to introduce it in the 1982 scheme.</P>

      <P>The level of fees for the certificate examinations in 1982 was decided by the previous Government in December 1980 in connection with their consideration of the Public Estimates for 1981 since these fees are paid and credited to appropriations-in-aid in that year.</P>

I was asking the Minister would he give a commitment to social welfare recipients and those on lower incomes who are finding it very difficult to meet the high costs of these examination entrance fees for their children.  Given that we are supposed to have free post-primary education it is ridiculous that people who get free school books should have to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I discovered that I inherited this decision by the previous Government to increase these fees.  The additional estimated income from the increase had been included in the Book of Estimates for 1981 although the actual fee increase had not been announced. Subsequently the fee increase had to be announced by me because these application fees are paid during November and December of the year prior to pupils sitting the examinations.  Consequently I was then in a position in which this decision had already been taken by our predecessors in office.</P>
      <P>I should mention, in relation to the Supplementary Estimate, that an additional sum of £849,000 was necessary to meet, amongst other things, the cost of the recent arbitrator's award to examiners and superintendents of public examinations during 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that, once again, I must draw to your attention, Sir, that access to the Parliament of the people of Ireland is obstructed in an unacceptable way.  I would ask you to cause inquiries to be made as to why it is that it is only on Tuesdays and on other days when the Dáil is meeting that a combination of Dublin Corporation, other public service authorities and the Garda make access to this House virtually impossible for many Members and certainly passage through adjoining streets very difficult for members of the public.  I would ask you, Sir, as a defender of democracy and of citizens' rights, of all the Irish people &mdash; and particularly the people of Dublin &mdash; to investigate why this should be so and to ensure that remedial measures are taken so that a system of orderly, peaceable protest can take place together with a passage of traffic through the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I suggest, in that connection, that the steel cattle pens that are in the gutters at Leinster House, together with the rubbish, litter and weeds therein should be removed forthwith, which would enable the peaceable citizens of this country &mdash; if they want so to do &mdash; to march up and down at least six to eight feet nearer the House, thereby freeing six to eight feet to public throughfare for the passage of buses and cars through this city?  If, Sir, you find in this process that there are vested interests more interested in causing obstruction and thereby getting overtime I would ask that you would <Col N="1834" /> insist that the freedom of the people of this city and country to move freely will be regarded as sacrosanct.  I would suggest that that should be the overwhelming interest of you, Sir, and of all those of us who have been elected by the democratic process.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may or may not be aware that this morning the chairman of the refining company said to the employees, amongst other things, that if the Government did not purchase the refining plant the refining company would scrap it.  That would suggest that it has not very much value in the eyes of the refining company.  I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate that I have no wish to interfere in any way with the Government's negotiating stance in this regard.  But I am asking the Minister of State once more for a firm undertaking that, because of the strategic national interest involved, the Government will ensure that we are not left with no refining capacity in this country.  Can the Minister of State give us that undertaking, from which will follow the undertaking I have sought in regard to the staff?  I have no desire, nor have my party, to interfere with the Government's negotiating stance &mdash; in other words, however it is achieved is a matter for the Government &mdash; but the essential thing is that it be achieved.

Does the Minister of State not accept that it is essential for us, particularly as an island, to have some refining capacity within our jurisdiction?  If he does, does he not accept that whatever the nature of the report the Government receive it does not alter that basic fact?  If we proceed from there, then whatever other steps are necessary in regard to the refinery, in regard to the companies that own it, is a matter for the Government.  But the essential feature is that we retain refining capacity.  Does the Minister not accept that?</P>

      <P>The statement is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Government have given detailed consideration to the situation which has arisen from the decision by the companies concerned to cease refining operations at Whitegate because of the scale of the present and future dis-economies which they see in such operations as compared with the alternative of importing all their requirements in processed form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been examining whether it would be in the public interest to purchase the refinery and have it operated on their behalf.

    <P>The position was discussed at meetings between the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Energy, Mr. Michael O'Leary, T.D., and the Minister of State, Mr. Eddie Collins, T.D., with the directors of the Irish Refining Company in Dublin, at a meeting in London between the Tánaiste and the Chairman of the Irish Refining Company, Mr. R. L. Lintott and also at a meeting attended by the Taoiseach, Dr. Garret Fitzgerald, the Tánaiste and the Directors of the Company.  The Government have therefore proposed, and the companies have agreed, that the present status of the refinery should be maintained by the companies for a further period of about three months, i.e. until the end of February next.</P>
    <P>During that period the Government will have prepared or commissioned a number of reports and studies covering economic and technical issues on which they consider that further expert, authoritative advice is necessary before a final decision can be reached on the policy they should adopt in this important matter.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Tánaiste why the Government see fit to deprive the Opposition of the right to the normal Adjournment Debate at the end of this session.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the Tánaiste, the Adjournment Debate on this occasion is considerably less than that normally allowed by the Government. Last year was exceptional because we, as a Government, had provided at the start of the term a considerable period of Government time for discussion on the economic situation, at the request of the Opposition.  The Tánaiste may not be aware that there was a tentative agreement on this occasion between the Whips that Tuesday this week would be devoted to tidying up a number of measures the Government are anxious to deal with and that Wednesday and Thursday would be allocated for a full Adjournment Debate. In the circumstances of this particular year and the outcome of the Government's performance this term, does the Tánaiste think it satisfactory, from the point of view of the procedure of the House, the general public or the rights of the Opposition, that the decision to allow two-and-a-half days for an Adjournment Debate should, without agreement or consultation, be changed by the Government to a mere five-and-a-half hours on Friday?</P>

We are giving one hour less than we had last year for the Adjournment Debate.  The Opposition may say more time was given last year but our reply is that we gave more time on the Finance <Col N="1915" /> Bill.

      <P>My questions at this stage are not directed to the adequacies or inadequacies of the Government's performance. They are directed to the procedures and traditions of this House.  I am asking the Tánaiste if he regards it as satisfactory that this House should be asked to deal with seven Bills and two motions between now and Thursday. Does he not consider that that is a negation of the normal established procedures and traditions of this House and that it is not fair that this House, as a parliamentary assembly, should railroad seven Bills through in this manner?</P>
      <P>In regard to one of these Bills, the Housing Finance Agency Bill, I would like to have the Ceann Comhairle's opinion. I want to recall the exchange which took place in this House on Tuesday, 8 December 1981 on the Housing Finance Agency Bill, and I quote from Volume 331, columns 1265-1266, of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the position of the Minister and the Government we shall have to regard all the arrangements we have entered into as being negatived.  We have gone to great trouble to facilitate the Government in this situation. <Col N="1917" /> There are a number of very complicated Bills coming before us, legislation to which, in the normal course of events, we would like to give very considerable time.  We have, very reluctantly and in the interests of the people concerned, agreed to curtail our rights. Part of the understanding was that this Bill could be mentioned before the Recess but would not be taken until the first day after the Recess.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tully: I assume it will not be taken unless there is agreement between the Whips.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that.</P>
    <P>I assume it will not be taken unless there is agreement between the Whips. I am following normal procedure and I am surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition making that point.  I am suggesting that if agreement is reached we are prepared to take this next Tuesday.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: I will not push it any further now but there is either a breach of agreement or a misunderstanding, because my understanding was that the Second Stage would be ordered today for the first day after the Recess.  If the Minister agrees it will not be taken without the agreement of Whips, I am satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: Perhaps the Whips might consider this further because that is not my understanding of the position.  Therefore further discussion between the Whips is desirable.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: We have to get a date for Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to listen carefully to what I have to say.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tully: The normal practice is that a date is asked for and if it is agreed the Bill is taken on that day.  I suggest the Second Stage be ordered for next Tuesday, if agreement is reached by the Whips.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> And this is where the Chair comes into the discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: It can be ordered for next Tuesday but will not be taken unless the Whips agree.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, as the arbiter of business in this House clearly stated, according to the Official Report, that the Housing Finance Agency Bill would not be taken unless there was agreement between the Whips.  I should like to ask you if it is now in order, therefore, for the Government to propose that that Bill be taken without the agreement of the Whips.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter under discussion was whether or not that Bill would be taken today.  I said, and it is in the Official Report, that the debate would not be taken today unless there was agreement by the Whips.  It was subsequently decided, apparently, that it would not be taken today.  I do not know what Deputy Haughey is kicking up a row about.</P>

On the basis of that statement we accepted the position.  I believe there is something very fundamentally important at stake here: whether or not in this House we can make arrangements across the floor which will be honourably kept.  That is what is at stake both from the Minister <Col N="1920" /> for Defence and the Chair's interpretation of the position of the Government with regard to this piece of legislation. Your interpretation was, and I have to quote your words: &ldquo;It can be ordered for next Tuesday but will not be taken unless the Whips agree&rdquo;.  I do not think any motion, closure motion, guillotine, time motion or anything else can obviate that specific statement and guarantee of yours as the arbiter of business and order in the House.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I wish to put two questions to the Tánaiste.  My first question is in relation to Item No. 12, which the Tánaiste has omitted from his list.  That concerns the European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies Order.  I should like to ask the Tánaiste, in view of the importance of the work done by this association and the fact that Ireland has been selected as the centre for this programme in health studies, when the Government plan to take that motion.  It is a simple one and, presumably, would pass through the House quickly.  It certainly will have our support.  I understand that the group concerned made representations to the Government to have this motion passed urgently.  It involves incorporation for the group, and that is important for them now.  When is it intended to take this motion and why has it been decided not to take it before the Recess?</P>
      <P>I should also like the Tánaiste to make a statement to the House on the measures the Government intend taking to deal with the critical situation that has developed because of the lack of staff in the Eastern Health Board to deal with 4,000 applications for shoes.  I understand they have been set aside until after Christmas. I am sure the Tánaiste realises the urgency of this and I would be obliged if he would make a statement to relieve the concern of everybody about the steps which have been taken in this regard.  He should make some arrangements to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>It is only with great reluctance that I am moving this motion today.  I had hoped that I would not have had to resort to this procedure and I fully admit that it is not the ideal way to go about parliamentary business. It is a course of action which, in the normal course, I would not be prepared to pursue.</P>
      <P>When I met the Opposition Whip to discuss business for this week, I proposed a number of items of business, seeking agreement to conclude the business before the Christmas recess.  Agreement was easily reached on all the items proposed with the exception of the Housing Finance Agency Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed, as an alternative, that the Dáil should reconvene on January 20 instead of January 26, to take the Housing Finance Agency Bill.  There was an announcement made in the House that we would resume on 26 January but because of the urgency of this measure I felt we should come back some days earlier.  This was not agreed to.</P>
      <P>My proposal also provided that all the other items of business would conclude on Tuesday at 8.30 p.m., while the Appropriation Bill was to be taken on Wednesday morning.  The Adjournment debate was to start at 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday and continue until 5 p.m. on Thursday.  Finally, there was to be no Private Members' time.  While the Opposition agreed to that proposal they would not agree to take the Housing Finance Agency Bill on January 20.  It became quite clear, therefore, that the Opposition party were determined not to take this Bill at all.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency Bill is urgently required to meet a desperate social need.  It is a measure which will enable the Government to establish an agency which will ultimately channel private sector funds&mdash;of the order of £200 million&mdash;into housing.  There is a serious shortage of funding for housing in the country at present and this measure is designed to give the necessary injection of resources to alleviate the problem.  I fail to see how anyone can justifiably oppose the Bill or indeed delay it for five minutes given the circumstances.</P>
      <P>This motion allocates time for taking a number of items over the remainder of this week.  It differs from that which was proposed and agreed in that the Housing Finance Agency Bill is included and in order to facilitate adequate debate on the Bill the sitting hours have been extended to 10.30 p.m. today, Wednesday and Thursday.</P>
      <P>Also, the originally suggested two-day Adjournment debate has now been replaced with a one-day debate to take place on Friday.  This falls in line with what happened last year.  At that time the Government felt one day was adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> The long established practice whereby the Whips meet regularly to try to agree on business, time allocations and generally to arrange the business of the House has, in my experience, been very useful and has worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>It is quite usual for either Whip to seek to postpone or, indeed, to bring forward a particular item of business.  On this occasion agreement was just not possible. I was quite prepared to leave taking the Housing Finance Agency Bill until after the recess, admittedly coming back for two sitting days before the planned resumption date on January 26.  This legislation is not at all complex and the Government are very anxious to have the Bill enacted as early as possible so that the Housing Finance Agency can commence their work without further delay. If it is not enacted before the budget there will be a delay which present circumstances just cannot justify.  The Opposition will be afforded ample opportunity to voice their misgivings about this measure during the debate this week.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, this is not the way I would like to go about organising the business of the House and I hope that in the future I can count on the usual co-operation, hitherto so readily given by the Opposition, in arranging the business of the Dáil.  Without that co-operation the ordinary routine of scheduling Dáil business will become unbearably cumbersome.</P>

      <P>We are prepared to give every reasonable facility to the Government to transact business.  That is our duty.  We are not, nor have we been, obstructive.  An impartial observer going over the record of the last term would readily admit that we have accommodated the Government in their wish to get through the programme of business and legislation.</P>
      <P>What is on the agenda for today is no less than two orders and seven Bills to be put through in one week.  I know that every experienced Deputy on the Government benches realises that this is an impossible task.  What we are being asked to do is unrealistic and is not in accordance with the practice and procedures of the House or with good legislative principles.</P>
      <P>The Government, in particular Fine Gael, made considerable play of their commitment to reform the Dáil and Seanad and to open debate.  The Fine Gael manifesto stated that because of out-dated procedures the Oireachtas plays little effective part in either the making of laws or the expert criticism of them.  It is the Government, not the Oireachtas, who exercises the power. That statement was in their election manifesto and would lead any reasonable person to believe that Fine Gael intended to do something to remedy that situation and that a major Bill, such as the Housing Finance Agency Bill, would have a special committee to take evidence from members of the public and other groups. What happened to that approach and the promise to make the Dáil more relevant, reform procedures and see that the Oireachtas carries out its legislative function? Is that what we see in the guillotine motion before us?  Where is the opportunity for the House to consider this important legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the way the Government are behaving on this occasion that <Col N="1934" /> their statement in the election manifesto was a mockery.  They did not mean it.  It was something that sounded nice and attractive to put before the electorate but on the first occasion when we put it to the test, what happens?  We see the railroading of legislation through the House without the agreement of the Opposition in a most cavalier and arrogant fashion.  We are not prepared to let the Housing Finance Agency Bill go through on the nod as the Government want us to do.  I want to make our position clear.  The Government Press Agency has been very active endeavouring to create a wrong impression about that legislation and misrepresenting our position in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I want to go back over the discussions held during the last few weeks and explain to the House and the public what exactly happened.  The Government came to us a few weeks ago in an attempt to settle the business that would be undertaken for the rest of this session. They explained they were anxious to take the Youth Employment Agency Bill, that they had to get the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill and they also mentioned the Housing Finance Agency Bill.  We had serious doubts about the Youth Employment Agency Bill and the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill going through in the curtailed time that the Government suggested.  However, we recognised that there was a public issue involved.  We did not want to appear to be holding up the Youth Employment Agency Bill although we would have liked a great deal of time on Committee Stage of that Bill.</P>
    <P>There were some things in that Bill we did not like and there were other matters we thought should have been in it.  It was an ideal type of Bill to discuss on Committee Stage, with all the experience of Members of both sides of the House brought to bear.  Many Deputies know a great deal about youth employment and the problems in this area.  That was a special occasion for all of us to get together, to try to make the best we could of the legislation and make sure we had a worthwhile Youth Employment Agency.  However, because of the way <Col N="1935" /> the Government organised business up to then, time was not available and, reluctantly, we agreed in a co-operative manner to let that legislation through.</P>
    <P>An even more serious situation arose in regard to the rent restrictions legislation. The Government knew since last July that legislation was needed in that area but they only come along with it at the very last moment.  Again, we were presented with major, complex and complicated legislation with far-reaching implications which the Government asked us to let through without proper discussion or debate because of the urgency of the public need.  Again, we agreed.  We agreed with the Government to let those two Bills go through last week on the tentative, broad understanding that today we would tie up whatever other pieces of legislation were needed and have Wednesday and Thursday for an Adjournment Debate.  There will, I hope be agreement on the Government benches that that was the broad scenario on which we agreed.</P>
    <P>Then suddenly something happened. Some change took place.  Some political need arose.  I do not think it was the fault of the Government Chief Whip but someone in the Government decided that the housing agency Bill had to go through before the recess even though there was hardly time to deal with the two other Bills I mentioned.  The housing lesislation is very important, affecting the very important aspect, housing.  The Government then decided this had to go through irrespective of the undertakings they had given us.  I have read out in the House a clear statement of the position both from this side of the House, from the Government's side and from the Chair, that whereas we would order the Bill dealing with the Housing Finance Agency it would not be taken this side of the recess without the agreement of the Whips. Unfortunately the Government, for some reason of their own, saw fit to break the specific agreement with regard to that legislation and also to throw aside the normal traditional way of dealing with the business of the House.  They want to throw aside well-established procedures <Col N="1936" /> and railroad this time motion through the House discarding any wish of the Opposition and the well-established workable procedures established over many years.</P>
    <P>I want to make our position clear on the Housing Finance Agency Bill because attempts have been made by Government spokesmen and commentators to misrepresent our position on this matter. We are not opposed to this legislation. All we are asking is that we be given adequate time to discuss it: first, to have a debate on it on Second Stage to see what the Government intend in this area and, then, after a reasonable interval, to have Committee Stage and see exactly what the Bill purports to do.  As the Minister of State has said, housing is a basic need.  We do not want to see something that could have a very important bearing on the whole housing finance situation pushed through the Dáil without being fully discussed and debated and all the implications considered.  If the Government had agreed to take the legislation after the recess we would not have any wish to hold it up.  We just ask that it go through the normal procedures and that adequate time be taken to discuss what is involved.  We are objecting to the fact that major legislation of this kind is being rushed through the House without proper debate and discussion and without anybody in the House or outside really knowing what will happen.</P>
    <P>There are very important questions that must be asked about this legislation, questions that as of now have not been answered.  The Bill before us is merely a skeleton piece of legislation.  It does not give any indication of what will happen or how the Bill will work.  We know that Deputy O'Brien&mdash;now Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, but at the time in the Department of the Environment&mdash;made what seems in retrospect to have been a premature announcement about the agency and what was intended.  Shortly afterwards he was contradicted to some extent by the Minister for the Environment but, on the basis of what he said at the time, a very reputable financial correspondent of one of the daily newspapers made a devastating attack on what was proposed and on <Col N="1937" /> the legislation.  He proved that what was proposed was both absurd and illogical.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that we must consider this legislation.  There was the announcement by the Minister of State and there was a trenchant analysis by a reputable financial correspondent of what the Minister of State had said and what was proposed.  There was no reply to the analysis given by that correspondent. At this stage the proposal to set up the agency is a very doubtful proposition at best.  I cannot resist the conclusion that this was something cooked up for the Fine Gael election manifesto.  A new housing finance agency to provide plenty of money for housing sounded very well. It was a nice, rounded concept to put into an election manifesto.  All we are seeing now is an attempt by the Government to follow through on that fairly loose proposal in their election manifesto without any serious thought or consideration of what they are about.  There was an undertaking to establish a housing finance agency and this Bill will do that.  That is the height of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a skeleton Bill.  For instance, it purports to set up a new agency.  The explanatory memorandum states that the responsibility for running that agency will rest with the agency themselves.  At the same time the Bill is completely silent on who will run and direct that agency.  There is nothing in the legislation to indicate to us who will be the board of directors or the board of management.  Will they be civil servants? Will they be outside people?  Will they be people in the local authority area or finance people?  There is nothing whatever in the legislation to give us any clue about that.  We are asked to rush this legislation through without really being in a position to give any thought to what is involved.</P>
    <P>An attempt has been made to suggest that this legislation is designed to make a great deal of money available for low income families to enable them to provide housing for themselves.  If that were so I do not think that we would hold the Bill up for one moment.  If we were satisfied that this was clear from the legislation itself and that that was the way <Col N="1938" /> things were going to be, even in the curtailed, limited circumstances in which we are asked to deal with it we would certainly facilitate the passage of this Bill as quickly as possible.  However, we do not know that that is the position.  As far as we can see at the moment there is nothing whatever to prevent this Government, if they are in a position to find £200 million, from channelling the £200 million immediately and directly into housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities are there and local authority housing is starved for finance.  The SDA loans system is there, starved for finance.  Those two ready-made vehicles are available immediately to the Government to enable them to pump all the money they want into housing today, to-morrow and next week.  If money is available there is no need for any new agency to get that money into either local authority housing or private purchase housing.  Why then do we need this new agency?  Is it, as I suspect, simply a wish by the Government to go through the motions of carrying out a very loosely thought out election promise?  I think it is and that we have to come to that conclusion about it. In so far as this Government have done anything at all about housing so far they have been curtailing and limiting the finances available.  My colleague, Deputy Raphael Burke, has given a number of instances in that regard.  The Government in regard to mortgages, mortgage interest and housing finance generally have been cutting down and cutting back rather than expanding or developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation I and this side of the House do not believe that this Bill is needed now in order to get more money into housing quickly, to get more houses for people and give a shot in the arm to the construction industry.  That is not what is going to happen, and we would wish to know far more about this legislation, how it is to operate, who is going to run and control it, in what areas it is to operate.  I ask the Government very seriously and sincerely if they know exactly what the effect of this legislation will be <Col N="1939" /> on housing finance generally.  Housing finance is a very important area of our public affairs.  A number of organisations and institutions are operating already in the area providing finance for housing in different ways.  As I have said, there are the local authorities, the SDA loans system, the building societies, the banks provide some money for housing through bridging loans, insurance companies provide some money for houses and other financial institutions of one kind or another are all involved in a fairly complicated, interdependent system which interacts on itself in providing finance for housing.  Here we have a new body proposed which, we are told, is to raise £200 million for housing.  Where is that going to fit into the scene?  What are the implications of the operation of this new body for all those organisations already operating in the field?  Will the new agency replace them, complement them, work together with them?  What is proposed?</P>
    <P>This is a big field, a complicated, complex subject, and the Government should not ask us in this House to rush legislation through practically on the nod.  There is nothing to be lost from the Government's point of view in taking their time with this legislation.  It will not necessarily take a great deal of time.  All we would ask in regard to this legislation is one or two days for Second Stage and then a reasonable interval so that we could see what amendments we wanted to put down and in what way we could improve the Bill, what it is going to do and how it will operate.  That can be done immediately after the Dáil resumes.  It would be far better and more desirable from everybody's point of view if the Government had agreed to go along that road, when they would not have had the odium in their first term as a Government, their first Dáil session, of having to bring in this draconian motion to cut across all our established traditions and procedures in this House and acting in this cavalier fashion as far as the Opposition are concerned. The Government, the Tanaiste and Deputy Fergus O'Brien, as Chief Whip, owe us an explanation as to why they thought it necessary to proceed in <Col N="1940" /> this way.  Any examination of the position will show that it is not really from the point of view of getting more money into housing or making more money available for the financing of, purchasing or building houses that this is being rushed through.  Some other consideration is in the Government's mind and if we knew what that was perhaps we could help them in some way in regard to it.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are perfectly entitled to resent not alone the way the Government have departed from the proposals to give us a two-day Adjournment debate but also the derisory five-and-a-half hours they have offered us.  I think that they intended to insult us as an Opposition by that proposal.  They know full well all that is happening in economic, social and political areas at present and that the Opposition cannot possibly make any assessment of the Government's performance or indulge in any constructive criticism of that performance in five-and-a-half hours.  I invite the general public and the media to contrast what the Government are doing here with our behaviour as a Government. I want to make a claim regarding my predecessor, Deputy Jack Lynch, and myself and I want to speak more particularly about myself at the moment because my stewardship was in the more immediate past.  When I was Taoiseach I never once failed to meet a request from the then Opposition for a debate.  The records of this House will show that I, as Taoiseach, and my Government were generous to a fault in facilitating and obliging the Opposition in regard to giving them Government time to debate particular questions in which they were interested. We gave them debates on the general economic situation, on Northern Ireland and EEC affairs.  Any time the Opposition looked for a debate in the last couple of years we readily and immediately provided Government time for a debate.  We have not received any Government time in the last session for any debate on any issue which was of interest to us.  We have been confined exclusively to Private Members' Time.  I contrast that with our behaviour in Government when we made Government time available to <Col N="1941" /> the Opposition for serious debate on important current issues.  I have always endeavoured to make the Dáil as relevant as possible in that way by providing time to discuss all important issues as they were happening.  In that regard our record will show that it was we who were really interested in making this House relevant, in having discussions and debates here which were current and topical.</P>
    <P>The Government are being cavalier and arrogant and acting against the best traditions and procedures of this House in offering this derisory five-and-a-half hours next Friday for an Adjournment debate.  There are many issues at present upon which the general public are greatly confused.  Perhaps the most important of these is the issue of taxation.  Nobody knows quite where he or she stands on the taxation issue at the moment, and least of all the Government.  For once, I feel a certain sympathy for the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who had to appear on television to talk about the Government's present position in regard to taxation.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Government he had to come before the public on television and indicate that he was not quite sure what they were going to do on taxation.  He had also to go through the humiliating experience of indicating that the Government &mdash; whatever was going to happen &mdash; certainly would not honour their election promises. The forthcoming Adjournment debate should have provided us in the Opposition, and the general public, with an opportunity of trying to ascertain exactly what is afoot and what the Government intend doing about this gimmicky £9.60, about their election promise to reduce direct taxation, about a shift to indirect taxation, about the budget deficit. Are they, as promised, going to reduce that to nil in four years?  All these are very important issues which are very much in the public mind at present.  There are a great many questions to be asked <Col N="1942" /> on what exactly the Government have in mind and intend to do on these issues. We needed an Adjournment debate this week to discuss these areas for the benefit of the House, the general public and the business community who will be greatly affected by whatever plans or proposals the Government will bring forward in this area.</P>
      <P>There are many other issues which could, with great advantage, have been proposed and discussed in the Adjournment debate.  However, the Government have decided not to give the House a proper Adjournment debate &mdash; and have decided that unilaterally.  Their attitude was that, if the Opposition would not agree to taking this Housing Finance Agency Bill before the recess&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to hear from the Government exactly what their justification is for withdrawing their tentative agreement &mdash; I could put it more strongly than that &mdash; to a two-day Adjournment debate at the end of this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I resent the suggestion which has been emanating from the Government that we are against helping lower income families to obtain access to a new sort of finance for housing.  That is not what is involved. There is no question of that.  If we were satisfied that this new housing finance agency would make a contribution to housing finance we would support it gladly.  As of now, there is too much in the air as far as this legislation is concerned. The area and the subject matter are too important to be pushed through in the way that the Government wanted it done.  We pressed the Government to provide as much finance as possible for housing and for housing purchases in the private sector.  There is no problem about that.  If the Government have the will and can provide the finance, the vehicles and mechanisms are already there.  There is no need for the trapping of this new housing <Col N="1943" /> finance agency.  As far as we can see, it is only window-dressing.  If the Government can, in the course of a sound and adequate debate, persuade us that there is room for this new agency and that it could supply a social need, then we would support it gladly.  As of now, we have nothing to go on, except this rather incautious interview which Deputy Fergus O'Brien gave on television and the announcement which he made at the housing seminar in Cork.  On that basis, the whole thing is too uncertain.  There are too many questions to be answered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We got the impression from the Government that if we allowed them to rush through the two matters about which they were vitally concerned &mdash; the Youth Employment Agency and the rent restriction legislation &mdash; they were easy enough about the Housing Finance Agency and would be prepared to leave that over for full consideration later on.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Government decided to proceed in this way with this time motion, trying to put through these seven pieces of legislation, none of which would be properly considered or would receive the attention it deserved.  That is not the way to do business.  It is a bad move by this Government at the end of their first full session.  Even at this stage I suggest that they withdraw this cavalierly imposed time motion and discuss with us, through the normal channels, how to finish up this parliamentary session on a reasonable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have given full evidence of our wish to be helpful, co-operative and constructive when it comes to Government business.  That is still our position.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak briefly on this issue, to take up a couple of points made in the course of the afternoon by Deputy Haughey and to make a couple of points arising out of the amendment to the Minister of State's motion which is also before the House.  Deputy Haughey attempted here a little while ago to create the impression &mdash; I have to say I believe deceitfully &mdash; that business in this House is ordered by agreement. That is not so.  In the Seanad the House orders its own business and to that extent it could be said that the possibility is open that what the Government want will not be taken if the Opposition can vote them down.  But the situation here, as Deputy Haughey and all his party know, is that the Government order the business.  I completely acknowledge &mdash; and I spent four years doing this &mdash; that most of the time, almost all the time, efforts are made, very long and severe efforts at times of stress, to achieve agreement with the other side before the Government produce the Order of Business.  But in the last resort the Government order the business and it must be so because they cannot be expected to debate with the Opposition until they reach consensus on a scale of priority and on their respective judgements on the importance of a particular Bill.  The Government have their own scale of priorities.  It may be that it is wrong to attach the priority that they do to the Housing Finance Agency Bill. It may be that the points which Deputy Haughey made against that Bill are justified or have some substance.  I do not believe they have.  But it may be so and we may be very wrong in including this Bill in our schedule.  But the best judgment the Government can make is that this is where it belongs because if the thing is delayed over the Christmas recess it will mean a loss of perhaps two-and-a-half months in the coming into effect of this agency.  Reluctantly &mdash; and I am absolutely agreed with what Deputy O'Brien, Minister of State, said because it is an undesirable procedure &mdash; the Government, <Col N="1945" /> in default of agreement, have had to press ahead with their right to ask the House to allocate time even in a sense which is unwelcome to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Housing Finance Agency Bill itself, I am not going to debate the rights and wrongs of this item but I think it is right to say that it is the only item effectively on which what otherwise might have been an agreement fell down.  I am subject to correction but I think I am right in saying that the Government and Opposition had reached agreement on completing all the other items this week.  Well might Deputy Haughey speak rhetorically and with emphasis about local authorities and the SDA loans scheme being &ldquo;starved for finance.&rdquo;  How come they are starved for finance at the latter end of 1982?  Who was in charge of the Estimates at the beginning of the year?  I am delighted to have so emphatic and spontaneous a confirmation from Deputy Haughey that that is the case.  It is because the traditional sources of housing finance are in difficulty and obviously cannot meet the need which the people recognise, and because of all the other difficulties which surround us, that we believe there is an urgency about this Bill which leads us to include it in a motion, the necessity for which we regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to go into the merits of this Bill.  But it would do no harm just to cite for the House something which Deputy O'Donoghue, the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, said on 21 October 1980 in regard to the Fine Gael proposals on housing finance which are very similar to what is now before the House in the form of a Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue still enjoys a high regard with the House, with the press and with the public as a very wise old owl when it comes to economic matters. I must say I could not restrain a bit of a laugh this morning when I saw a picture of him in the paper wagging his finger at us over having got our sums wrong.  We may have got our sums wrong to the extent of £150 million through relying on figures which were the most recent figures available to us.  That is very <Col N="1946" /> small skittles compared to the thousands of millions by which Deputy O'Donoghue's sums were wrong in his direction of this country's economy in the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.  If I could have detected, after he left office, any change of policy &mdash; as some people were inclined to think might be the case once they heard Deputy Haughey on television in January 1980 &mdash; I would be inclined to say that at least Fianna Fáil had found the bad apple in their barrel &mdash; I am sorry to use that expression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is relevant because it bears on the Bill, the inclusion of which is a point at issue here.  He said:</P>
      <P>I conclude on a personal note.  I am very interested in the Fine Gael proposal for housing finance.  I recall writing an article on that very topic, outlining that very scheme, which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few years ago.  My recollection is that proposals to harness the sort of funds described had been going on for quite some time as a result of suggestions which had been developed over the past year or 18 months by various members of the Government. If the Opposition party find that this policy is implemented it will not be a question of our pinching their clothes but rather they recognising the policy which we are already pursuing.</P>
      <P>In other words, I have the authority of Deputy O'Donoghue for it that, far from this scheme taking anybody on the Opposition side by surprise, it is really a scheme of their own, or as near as makes no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the form of the amendment which Deputy Moore put down, I want to say two brief things about it.  It is true that it does not provide expressly for an Adjournment debate.  But if one looks at it carefully one will find that it does appear to provide seven hours for the Appropriation Bill on Thursday, 17.  I am open to correction on this; but I think an Appropriation Bill is, in this House, virtually a formality.  But of course one can, if one wishes, push it into dimensions where it is about the same size as a budget or Adjournment debate.  I have no doubt that that is what is intended in allotting seven hours to this topic.  But in criticising the five-and-a-half hours which we had hoped to allocate expressly to an Adjournment debate we are told that this is so deliberately unreasonable as to be insulting to Deputy Haughey and his colleagues. It is one hour shorter than the time which they did not think there was any insult in allotting to us this time last <Col N="1948" /> year on this same debate.  The only reason it is an hour shorter &mdash; and I have no doubt in the world that the Minister of State will concede the extra hour if that will make peace &mdash; is not because any time is being taken out of the day for other business on the Friday, but because it is proposed that the House should rise at 4 p.m. instead of 5 p.m., it being the last Friday before Christmas and Deputies being anxious to catch trains.  But if that is a consideration beneath Deputy Haughey let us concede another hour.  It will not matter to Deputy O'Brien or myself.</P>

      <P>The last thing I want to mention bears on the question of Private Members' Business.  I think I am allowed to say that Private Members' time, until the year 1974 when the Standing Orders of the House were amended, did not begin in the calendar year until after financial business had concluded.  That meant that a very small amount of time in comparison with present day standards was allotted for it in a particular year.  In 1975, when I had this job, I calculated the amount of hours on average which, in the preceding seven or eight years, had been spent on Private Members' Business and it came out at 17½ hours per year. The average is now nearer 90 hours a year.  In other words, it is getting on for five times more.  There is no shortage of Private Members' time these days.  I do not think the Government have appropriated Private Members' time, as they are entitled to if pressure of business demands it.  That has been the position since October.  I am not taking credit for it, but that is what has been happening. <Col N="1949" /> Listen to what they are proposing in their amendment: they want a three-week ration of Private Members' time in the last week before Christmas &mdash; three hours today to debate the midlands' needs in regard to industrial development; they want three hours on Wednesday to debate taxation; they want three hours on Thursday to debate the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>They are all important, as the Chair sometimes tells us, but how honest or straightforward is a proposal like that?  Is it seriously being put up to a Government under pressure of time that at a juncture like this we should allocate a three-week ration of Private Members' time, generous though that is by comparison with the days before the National Coalition amended Standing Orders in 1974 in reply to an Opposition motion?  That, it seems to me, casts a doubt on the candour of all the rest of their arguments, even if they did not contain logic in themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some of the Bills that are listed here in the guillotine motion to be passed by 10.30 p.m. today, by 11.30 a.m. tomorrow and by 10.00 p.m. on Thursday, and to draw the attention of the House to the significance of what will have to happen under a guillotine motion of this kind with Bills of that type.</P>
      <P>The first one I will refer to is the Courts Bill, 1981, the Committee, Fourth and Fifth Stages of which will have to be passed tonight whether they are debated or not.  One would assume that any Bill contained in a guillotine motion would be one of urgency.  It is highly improper of any Government to attempt to guillotine legislation not of urgency.  This Bill has one provision of substance, to appoint two more High Court judges.  At the moment there are 12 High Court judges and it is proposed to have 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment only 11 High Court judges can sit at any given time because there is accommodation for only 11.  That <Col N="1950" /> was the position even before a fire in the Four Courts recently reduced the accommodation still further by the destruction of Court No. 4, which awaits refurbishment by the Board of Works who are sometimes not the quickest at repairing things after fires, as some Members of the House know.  We are therefore in a position that a Bill providing for three surplus High Court judges is being guillotined through tonight.  What urgency is there in that?</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins has an amendment down for the Committee Stage of that Bill which very probably will never be taken.  His amendment is an attempt to get at least two judges stationed outside Dublin where there is accommodation available for them and where there are arrears that could be overcome by a judge being more or less permanently stationed in Cork, Limerick, Galway and so on, commuting between those cities.  That amendment, unhappily, will never be moved or considered by the House.  The Bill provides for three surplus High Court judges for whom there is no accommodation. This comes about at a time when the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is about to be increased dramatically from £2,000 to £15,000, thereby diminishing the work of the High Court very considerably, yet we are still asked to guillotine through this Bill which, if it is desirable from any point of view, is not necessary from the point of view of urgency.  It is neither necessary nor urgent.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981 of which the Committee, Fourth and Fifth Stages would have to be passed by 10.30 tonight.  That is the final one of the six items of business, four of them Bills, listed in the guillotine motion.  That Bill is an effort to get round the unconstitutionality of two parts of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  It has been conceded in advance by the Government, as it should have been, that as soon as it has been passed this Bill will be referred to the Supreme Court, and the reason we were prepared to have that Bill taken this week and finished, but in circumstances in which we would be able to debate it, is that it cannot be referred to the Supreme <Col N="1951" /> Court until it has been passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>The predominant legal opinion in relation to the Bill is that it is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will have to examine it in a month or two, whenever the time comes, and one of the remarkable things the court will have to advert to, inevitably, is the fact that Dáil Éireann never debated a complex Bill of that kind on the Committee, Fourth or Fifth Stage, a Bill whose possible unconstitutionality is admitted by all in advance.  The fact that such a Bill had not been debated would help to make it unconstitutional, or make the Supreme Court take a more jaundiced view of it. However, the situation we are asked to accept today is that not only will it not be debated but it will not be debated at all on Committee Stage, though it is very much a Committee Stage Bill.  Anybody who knows anything about rent restrictions knows how complex it is, the importance and significance of the individual words and phrases, and what a huge corpus of law has been built up in relation to rent restrictions over the years.</P>
    <P>It is vital that that Bill would be fully debated on Committee and Report Stages, but by virtue of its position at the end of this list of six items, none of which has been started yet, it will be guillotined through, and whatever chance the Courts Bill might have of some discussion, this Housing Bill has no chance at all.  Do the Government seriously think that that will improve the prospects in the Supreme Court of it being found to be constitutional, when the major House of the Oireachtas did not have an opportunity to debate it on Committee or Report Stage?  It seems to me to be most unwise, to say the least of it, to guillotine a Bill of that nature, because it will almost certainly lead or contribute to its constitutional demise, and the whole affair to a great extent will have been a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The next Bill on this motion is the Insurance Bill 1981.  Assuming this motion is accepted, it is listed to be taken at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow and to be concluded not later than 11.30 a.m.  The <Col N="1952" /> House will sit at 10.30, and it may be, because of the depth of feelings that exists, understandably, in the House, that the whole question of the Order of Business will take more than a minute or two.  Today, it took half an hour or more and, because of the anger felt by some Members at a motion of this kind and at the general rather arrogant conduct of the Government, tomorrow the whole question of the Order of Business and so on may well take the best part of half an hour.  If that is to be the case, little more than half an hour will be allowed for the Second, Committee, Fourth and Final Stages of the Insurance Bill.  Even if only the Minister and I spoke and he replied, I could not see the Second Stage taking less than an hour.  Although it is a short Bill, it is complicated and has many important principles involved in it.  It has had a long history with which I am familiar. I would have a good deal to say about it in the normal way if I were allowed time in the House.  Even assuming that we are able to complete the Second Stage &mdash;and that seems unlikely&mdash;we will not be able to have any Committee, Report or Final stages by 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw your attention, Sir, to the fact that the Bill contains a provision the result of which was not foreseen by the draftsman or by the Government when they approved of the Bill. Nor was it foreseen by the company concerned, the Irish Life Assurance Company. When I drew their attention to it, as I did recently, they were very perturbed at the consequences of it, and immediately talked in terms of amending the Bill.  The company concerned accept that an amendment is necessary.  How can I on the Opposition side or the Minister on the Government side put down an amendment?  There is no conceivable way in which the Second Stage debate will be finished by 11.30 a.m. and I cannot put down an amendment, nor can the Minister, until the Second Stage has been passed.</P>
    <P>The consequences are serious.  They are not just technical, legal or legislative. It is proposed in this Bill to allow the Irish Life Assurance Company, 91 per cent owned by the State and regarded as <Col N="1953" /> a semi-State body, to take over any life or general insurance company in the State or outside the State or to form a subsidiary for the purpose of carrying on business inside the State or outside the State in life assurance or in general insurance.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of that very broad power being given to the Irish Life Assurance Company, which goes away beyond the immediate objective of allowing them to take over 60 per cent of the Church and General Insurance Company, is to establish them as legislatively capable of taking over any insurance company in the State and carrying on any insurance business in the State.  Inside this House and outside it for many years demands have been articulated from time to time by large numbers of people for the State to take over motor insurance. The State had no vehicle through which to take over motor insurance up to now. At 11.30 a.m. tomorrow, if this is guillotined through, the State will have such a vehicle and the Irish Life Assurance Company will be that vehicle.</P>
    <P>I do not need to tell you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that motor insurance in Ireland is not an attractive proposition. If the Irish Life Assurance Company are forced into this situation&mdash;and the Bill as it stands unamended will certainly force them into it&mdash;they will be stuck with something that is not attractive and which prudent insurance companies try to keep out of to the greatest extent they reasonably can.  The weakness of Irish Life is that they are subject to public control and Government direction.  It is not impossible to envisage a situation in which the Irish Life Assurance Company might suddenly find themselves the unwilling recipients of a very high proportion of the motor insurance business presently written in this country.</P>
    <P>It is fairly easy to envisage a situation in which that could suddenly arise.  If it does arise, Irish Life will have taken on immediately a major loss-making operation and the losers by that&mdash;and Irish Life inevitably must be concerned about this &mdash; are the existing and future policy holders of the Irish Life Assurance Company. When they took out their policies <Col N="1954" /> with that company they did so on the basis that it was a well-run life company which did not dabble in a major way in other loss-making operations in insurance.</P>
    <P>Is it fair to the policy holders to put them in that position?  Is it fair to do so without any debate on that point in this House?  It is not.  Even Members of the Government, if they look at this objectively and calmly, will agree that it is not fair or proper.  Deputy Moore`s amendment on this point provides for a discussion lasting nine hours on this Bill on Wednesday from 1.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. That is about the minimum needed to discuss the Bill effectively.  Ideally it should be discussed on two separate days. The Second Stage debate should be on one day and the Committee Stage debate on another day to allow for the preparation of amendments arising out of the Second Stage debate and the reply to it. In the circumstances, in his amendment Deputy Moore has done the best that can be done in allowing nine hours for it.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, if the Bill is not passed, the take-over of 60 per cent of the Church and General Insurance Company by Irish Life will be impeded, as it has to go through some time in January. There is no great dispute in principle between the Government and ourselves on the Bill.  The Government simply did not advert to the sort of situation which now arises and causes concern to the company.  The Government should be reasonable enough to accept amendments of the kind which must be made, and which even the company feel must be made.  How are we to have any amendments tomorrow?  The Second Stage debate will not have been completed by the time the Bill is guillotined through.</P>
    <P>This is an abuse of the guillotine procedure. Many people would say the guillotine procedure is an abuse of parliamentary procedure.  I will not go so far as to say that.  There are times when it has to be used.  I recall using it in 1972 after we had 165 hours of debate on one Bill. I tried to bring the discussion to a close after the former Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien stood there with a large dictionary in his hand for six-and-a-half hours <Col N="1955" /> talking about one word.  That was the sort of debate we had.  I remember I guillotined the end of that Bill after 165 hours of debate.</P>

      <P>I am not making the case that, in all circumstances, the use of the guillotine is invalid or improper.  I have demonstrated that there are circumstances in which everyone would agree it was valid and proper.  I am certainly making the case that to guillotine through in one day alone four Bills and two motions, all of which are complex to some degree and some of which are extremely complicated and very important, and have far-reaching consequences which were not foreseen apparently by the draftsman, or by the Government when they published them, is going too far.  It is an abuse of the position.</P>
      <P>The Government should now think again and not throw into this list unnecessary Bills which are certainly not urgent to create judges who cannot sit and function because there is nowhere for them to sit, and not guillotine through without any discussion a Bill which will be analysed line by line and word by word by the Supreme Court, although the lawmaking authority, this House, did not consider it at all.  That is not acceptable. The House should make it clear that it is not acceptable.  I hope that, on reflection, the Government will take the same view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not deal with the Housing Finance Agency Bill in any detail because Deputy Haughey has already dealt with it.  But it appears to me to be one of those snow jobs of the kind the recently passed Youth Employment Agency Bill was, <Col N="1956" /> that it is really meaningless, that if it is going to pick up any additional funds it can do so only at the expense of other parts of the market.  One of the theories is that some kind of inflation-proofed bonds will be issued.  If they are &mdash; and they pay some very low real rate of interest&mdash;it means that the Irish gilt market is virtually at an end.  Even though the current yield on long-dated gilts here is, I think, 18 or 18½ per cent, with inflation running at 21 per cent one is suffering a net loss.  That is one of the many points that would appear to arise on that kind of Bill, of which very little detail is given in the Bill itself.  But there is no possibility at all of discussing that.</P>
    <P>While many guillotines may well be regrettable this is more than just regrettable. This is more than just a display of the parliamentary arrogance that we saw from the last Coalition and which cost them so dearly in the end.  This is one where positive damage will be done by the passage of legislation in its present form without discussion and without amendment, when even the bodies concerned themselves admit of the need for amendment.  But that amendment cannot be made.  In other words, we are being asked to guillotine through Bills which we know, and the people concerned know, are wrong.  Still, as a matter of principle, the Government have to walk them through the House, including ones that are in no way urgent and in any event cannot operate for many months to come.  In regard to the Courts Bill, it may be some years to come before accommodation is provided for the judges, who have nowhere to sit at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore I think the House should think very seriously about this, that the Government should reconsider it in all the circumstances and that some form of discussion be held, because it is not easy to settle these things across the floor of the House.  Some consideration should be given to some type of discussion being held between the Whips with a view to solving this problem rapidly, with a view to withdrawal of this guillotine motion and the agreement of the business for the remainder of this session between the Whips and parties.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in condemning this guillotine motion of the Government, the attempt to merely make a sausage factory out of this Chamber with regard to legislation &mdash; merely to manufacture Bills rather than debate them and give them the consideration they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I take, first, the business suggested to be discussed today, there was, as part of a voluntary agreement between the Government and Opposition, a list of items to be discussed and decided upon last week and also this week.  The Government received the full co-operation of the Opposition last week.  Despite our worries and the fact that we were concerned that insufficient consideration was being given to some measures, in the interests of co-operation with the Government and not to be seen to be in any way churlish &mdash; the word used by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry &mdash; we agreed to allow legislation through which in normal circumstances would have received much more consideration and longer debate.  One such Bill was mentioned <Col N="1960" /> by our party leader earlier, the Youth Employment Agency Bill. Another was the Fire Bill, the end of the Report Stage of which went through in one hour by agreement last week and on which the Government received the co-operation of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>This week the Government have reneged on the second part of the two-week agreement, particularly with regard to the two-day Adjournment debate. Such a debate is very necessary because it gives Deputies the opportunity to air their views on the Government's performance in their first term of office. They can also highlight the areas where the Government have reneged on their pre-election promises.  At present unemployment is running at 133,000 and rising. I intend raising this point on the Adjournment debate.  One of the main agencies for the maintenance and creation of employment, the Irish Goods Council, do not have a board since the mandate of the previous board expired early last October.  The Minister for Energy failed to appoint another board, thus leaving the council to operate in the dark.  I hope the Government will reconsider this guillotine motion and give two days for an Adjournment debate.</P>
    <P>By 10.30 p.m. tonight we are expected to pass the Housing Act, 1969, (Continuance) Order, 1981.  This order will make provision to control the demolition or use otherwise than for human habitation of certain houses, to amend section 66 of the Housing Act, 1966, and to make provision for other matters connected with the aforesaid.  This matter needs to be debated at considerable length because of its implications for housing and the availability of dwellings throughout the country.  We are also expected to pass the Merchant Shipping Bill, 1981.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the Courts Bill but I am very concerned about the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  This Bill will go through Committee, Fourth and Fifth Stages without debate, despite the fact that there are major amendments down to try to improve this legislation prior to its going to the Supreme Court for decision. Since the start of business today the <Col N="1961" /> Minister for the Environment circulated a further amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly and I have put down amendments.  One deals with the setting up of a Fair Rents Tribunal to be established by regulation by the Minister to comprise a president, who shall be a Circuit Court judge, and six other members. The setting up of a Fair Rents Tribunal was a firm pre-election commitment given to the electorate by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  Such a commitment was also given in the Gaiety Theatre document after the election.  The Government have reneged on that commitment in this Bill.  Tonight, because of this guillotine motion Coalition Deputies will avoid discussing this amendment and thus save themselves the embarrassment of walking through the lobbies and voting against setting up the Fair Rents Tribunal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very important amendment put down by the Fianna Fáil Party states that in cases of hardship created by increases in rent resulting from this Bill, State assistance shall be provided to the tenants.  We have had only a half-hearted commitment from the Government in this area but we want to discuss this point and have this written into the legislation. Another amendment covers rent.  It says that the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the court, would be reasonable and fair having regard to the respective economic circumstances of the landlord and tenant and the character and situation of the dwelling.  This is a <Col N="1962" /> major amendment which will completely alter this Bill.  We will not have an opportunity to discuss any of these amendments tonight, to vote on them or to know if the Government will accept some of them.  This Bill will go in its present form before the Supreme Court without reflecting the views and opinions of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the Housing Finance Agency Bill, which is to be debated tomorrow and Thursday.  The Minister of State said the Housing Finance Agency Bill, 1981, was urgently required to meet a desperate social need. That is poppycock, and he knows it.  This measure will enable the Government to establish an agency which will ultimately channel private sector funds into housing. The Minister already has the necessary machinery to channel private funds into housing if he will only use it.  This Bill has been described as a skeleton Bill by the leader of my party, and he is quite right.  It goes no further than setting up the agency and vaguely mentions raising money from the private sector through bonds.  If the Government want to raise money on the bond market they already have the necessary machinery under the Office of Public Works legislation.  If they want to provide extra funds for the hard-pressed building industry, this can be done under existing machinery.  To say that the construction industry will grind even closer to a halt if we do not have the Housing Finance Agency Bill through is a fallacy.  What is the intention of the Bill?  It merely sets up an agency. It does not tell us anything about the agency, who will direct it, or, for example, the type of loans that will be provided by the agency.  I can assume from the statements made by Deputy O'Brien when he was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that the agency will be on the lines of the proposals contained in the Fine Gael election manifesto which suggest the provision of loans on the basis of repayments of 17 to 20 per cent of income and that percentage to stand through the life time of the loan. I cannot be sure that that is what is intended because Deputy O'Brien's original announcement was withdrawn on his <Col N="1963" /> behalf by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Peter Barry, the day after the original statement.  We cannot be sure what the situation is because there is nothing in the Bill about it.  However, if we take it that the 20 per cent of income to last through the life time of the loan is correct it will not be the saver of the building industry which the Minister of State, and the Government, would have us believe.</P>

The Fine Gael proposal is fair enough for most young couples starting off and there is a certain attraction because there is a low deposit.  However, we must consider the situation that will arise as the years go by and incomes rise by about 10 per cent, which is a lot lower than the national average for the last ten years.  On the basis of a £20,000 loan over 25 years one of the financial correspondents of the <i>Irish Independent</i> wrote a superb article indicating that over that period the borrower would have repaid in the region of £140,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry will not put me off by his interjections.  On the basis of a £20,000 loan over 25 years a total of £140,000 will be repaid under the scheme.  There is nothing in the Bill that could not be done by existing agencies. The money can be made available by the Government and if it is a question of raising private funds they can be raised in the form of bonds, a scheme envisaged by Fine Gael.  The latter could be introduced under existing legislation relating to the Office of Public Works.  The money should be used through the SDA loan scheme.  From March 1973 until the Coalition were chased out of power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They were chased out by the people.  From March 1973 to June 1977 the National Coalition did not increase the income or the loan limit under the SDA loan scheme.  In our period of office, from 1977 to 1981, on at least four occasions we increased the loan and income limits.  In April last, as part of our housing package, we increased the income limit to £7,000 and the loan limit to £14,000.  At the same time we introduced a mortgage subsidy scheme to assist young couples in the first three years of home ownership.  What have the Government done since July?  They removed eligibility for SDA loans from single people who represent 22 per cent of first time house buyers.  They removed the mortgage subsidies from single people and tightened up through regulations the operations of the SDA loan scheme.  The SDA loan situation has ground to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed is money, not agencies. <Col N="1965" /> The Government should make that money available and forget such whitewashing operations as setting up a housing finance agency.  Many questions need to be answered about how this agency will affect the availability of funds for housing, the effect it will have on the building societies and the damage it will do to the building industry.  We are not aware whether SDA loans will be made available through local authorities.  The Bill proposes to establish a new bureaucracy with inevitable cost increases. Offices must be set up and staff must be paid.  Local authorities operate the SDA loan scheme now at a cost of about ½ per cent of the mortgage rate for administration and I should like to know what percentage of loans granted under the proposed agency will be devoted to administration.  The new agency is unnecessary and can be damaging.  I am anxious that we have a full debate on it so that we can obtain the Government's views. We do not know the Government's views.  We require considerable debate on Second Stage followed by time to reflect on the type of amendments necessary to improve the provisions of the Bill, if improvements are necessary.  That cannot be done in the time allocated in the motion.  The motion envisages discussion on Wednesday and Thursday and that is not sufficient.  There will not be time for the Government, or the Opposition, to reflect on the provisions in the Bill.  Most legislation that comes before the House is amended by the Government on Committee Stage.  It is at that stage that the Government consider, and in many cases accept, Opposition amendments.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  The Government have tabled a number of amendments to that Bill.  In other words, on reflection, the Minister is of the opinion that the Bill can be improved.  Only this afternoon we received details of a further amendment from the Minister to section 1 of that Bill.  The same goes for any Bill going through the House.  When legislation is discussed here in a proper manner both the Government and the Opposition <Col N="1966" /> are given the opportunity of tabling amendments to improve the legislation but how can that situation prevail when, for instance, there is major interference in the existing structures for making available loans for housing?  How can such legislation be considered properly when it is being rushed through without there being time for amendments?  The Government are suggesting that the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981, that the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill 1981, that Committee, Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill 1981 be taken today and that the Housing Finance Agency Bill be taken tomorrow and Thursday.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to do business.  It can only lead to bad legislation.  To proceed in this way casts serious doubts on the sincerity of the Government.  The Minister for Finance held many press conferences prior to the election concerning the improvement of Dáil procedures. He talked about open government and of how this Chamber could be made more important and more democratic.  He discussed the issue also on the <i>Today Tonight</i> programme on television but after all that we find that in their first term of parliamentary time, the Government in a wrap-up propose a guillotine motion of this order.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in asking the Government to reflect on what they are doing.  Their predecessors in Coalition from 1973 to 1977 tried the same type of jack-boot tactics but the Irish people showed them the door on the first available opportunity.  If the present Administration continue to behave in this highhanded way, the same fate will await them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael-Labour Coalitions are associated in the public mind with high unemployment.  Deputies opposite may regard that as unfair but they know it to be true.  In the minds of the rest of us these coalitions are associated with unreasonable and unfair guillotine motions such as the one before us today.  On reading the motion I was reminded of what was done by the last <Col N="1967" /> Coalition who introduced guillotine motions for many Bills but what was appalling, and something I could hardly believe, was that they were prepared to propose guillotine motions on Bills that had not even been circulated.  I congratulate this Coalition on the fact that they have not done that.  To that extent they must be given some credit.  At least they are making progress compared with their predecessors so far as the question of guillotines is concerned.  However, the motion before us is unreasonable and unnecessary.  I say that because it is clear to anybody who has listened to what has been said from both sides in this debate so far that there was substantial agreement between the Government and the Opposition on the business to be dealt with before the Christmas recess.  As Deputy Haughey pointed out earlier, part of that substantial agreement was arrived at because we on this side of the House did not wish to obstruct the Government in legislation that they considered important and urgent.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there are two items now which the Government propose including in the guillotine list on which there was not agreement and I suggest that the reason for there not being agreement was that it was not sought or that it was not sought adequately.  I refer to the Insurance Bill, 1981 and the Housing Finance Agency Bill, 1981.  From what I have heard, not in the House but outside, there may be a degree of urgency about the passing of the Insurance Bill.  If there is any such urgency I am sure the Government side would acknowledge that if that had been explained to us and agreement sought through our Whip, there would not have been any problem about such agreement being forthcoming.  To the best of my knowledge that was not the position, except subsequently.</P>

      <P>Let us not argue about what went before, but my understanding is that if agreement had been sought there would not have been any problem so far as our party are concerned.  As Deputy O'Malley has pointed out there may be a substantial defect in that Bill which could be improved by way of amendment, an amendment that would be in the national interest.  The Government may be of the same view, though I do not know of any proposal yet for an amendment on the line needed.  However, the point I am making in regard to that Bill is that it presented no insuperable difficulty. The whole problem seems to have centred on the handling of the Housing Finance Agency Bill.</P>
      <P>Today Deputy Haughey read from the Official Report what had transpired here when that matter was being discussed and an order was being made for Second Stage.  Most people will agree that what emerged was unusual in the sense that where there is a dispute about something like this we would not have the evidence cut and dried in the Official Report.  On this occasion this was the situation but in addition the whole matter was summed up and spelled out authoritatively by the Ceann Comhairle.  That is a very unusual situation.  Despite that and despite the clear spelling out that agreement was being given from this side of the House to the ordering of Second Stage subject to agreement between the Whips, the Government, having got substantial agreement on the business to be transacted and on the length of time to be allocated for the Government debate, changed their stance and insisted that the Housing Finance Agency Bill must be put through all Stages this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened carefully for any kind of rational explanation for what the Government did but I have not heard any.  I <Col N="1969" /> have heard the Minister of State make some general observations which would be true if related to the need for finance for housing but which are not true on the face of it in relation to this Bill.  If what he said is true and this Bill was necessary for the salvation of the building industry, why was it not at the top of the list of priorities of the Government on which it was seeking to get agreement with us? Why was it that the Minister for Defence, acting for the Government in moving the order for Second Stage, did not say that this was a matter of vital urgency and must be taken next week?  The record, as read out in the House today, shows clearly that that did not happen.  Either the Minister was not briefed as to the great urgency of it or, as I suspect, he knew the score very well but something happened to change the situation.  From the point of view of a political observer the most interesting aspect of this is what changed.  What made the Government suddenly decide that they had to have all stages of this Bill.  As Deputy Haughey said it is a skeleton Bill.  One cannot gather from it or the explanatory memorandum what the Government intend to do.</P>

      <P>The International Wheat Agreement, 1971, has two parts: (i) The Wheat Trade Convention for the regulation of the commercial wheat market; and (ii) The Food Aid Convention for the supply of food aid in the form of cereals to the developing world.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Community Ireland was obliged to concede to the Food Aid Convention as the original member states and the Community itself were a party to it.  We therefore acceded to the Food Aid Convention in June 1973.  In 1974, 1975, 1976, 1978 and 1979 the Government, with the approval of Dáil Éireann, agreed that Ireland should adhere to the extensions of the convention. The Wheat Trade Convention was extended on the same occasions in order to maintain the framework of the International Wheat Agreement.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, I was not aware that copies of the manuscript were not available.  Through some misunderstanding they were brought to the General Office rather than to the usual distribution point here.  I assure you, Sir, and the Opposition, that no discourtesy was intended.  I had adverted to the background of our involvement in the convention since we joined the EEC.</P>
      <P>In view of the deteriorating world food position, a new Food Aid Convention was negotiated in March 1980.  The new convention was approved by this House on 24 June 1980 and Ireland duly ratified on 30 June of that year.  The convention came into force on 1 July 1980 and was due to expire on 30 June 1981 at the same time as the expiry of the fifth extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House seeks approval for the extension of the Food Aid Convention 1980 to 30 June 1983. The Wheat Trade Convention is also being extended to cover the same period. The effect of the two extensions, therefore, will be to extend the life of the International Wheat Agreement pending the possible negotiation of a new agreement. Ireland together with her Community partners signed the protocols extending both conventions on 14 May 1981.  Instruments of ratification must be deposited by 31 December 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention, 1980, which the protocol under discussion today seeks to extend, binds its adherents to providing total annual contributions of 7.592 million tonnes of cereals for developing countries.  The European Community and its member states have undertaken to supply a minimum of 1,650,000 tonnes of cereals in the form of wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption.  This contribution is discharged partly by the Community from its own resources and partly by the member States nationally in accordance with an agreed scale. Ireland's national contribution, which is channelled through the world food programme, is in the region of 4,100 tonnes <Col N="1982" /> per annum.  The cost of this is borne by the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Ireland is pleased to adhere to the extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1980 &mdash; a convention, which, as Deputies will recall, increased the minimum annual contribution of aid from 4.226 million tonnes to 7.592 million tonnes. Ireland's national commitment under the 1980 convention represented an increase of approximately 1,000 tonnes per annum over the previous convention.  Total accumulated contributions to the Food Aid Convention by Ireland by virtue of our own national commitment between the years 1975 and 1980 amount to more than £3 million.  In this year's Vote for Agriculture a further £440,000 has been allocated for the purpose of fulfilling our obligations under the convention.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree that the most immediate problems facing developing countries are hunger and malnutrition. Beginning this year the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations designated 16 October each year as World Food Day in an effort to develop a sense of national and international solidarity in the struggle against these twin evils.  I wish to pay tribute to the fine work done by Gorta in organising a one-day seminar to mark World Food Day and to the enterprise it showed by holding an auction on the same occasion to raise money for the food production projects which are Gorta's special concern.</P>
    <P>All informed opinion agrees that the primary objective of developing countries which are prone to food deficits and of the developed countries wishing to assist them must be to stimulate native production and so to reduce dependence on commercial imports and on food aid. It is for this reason that Ireland has consistently supported the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD, whose objectives are increased food production, reduced rural poverty and improved nutrition in developing countries.  For the same reason we have since 1980 contributed 2,350 tonnes of fertiliser to Sudan, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Lesotho under the FAO's <Col N="1983" /> International Fertiliser Supply Scheme. We particularly respect the approach of the World Food Programme which consists of using food supplied by donors as an aid to the economic and social development of countries.  Food donations are used, for example, as part of worker's wages, as a way of attracting children to school and improving their health and as an incentive to voluntary participation in Community development.</P>
    <P>For all that, it is, however, abundantly clear that in a world where at least 420 million people do not have their minimum food requirement each day, direct food aid actions continue to be essential to save lives.  The European Commission has again recognised this stark fact by including in a wide-ranging Plan of Action against Hunger in the World a proposal for a food aid action consisting of 230,000 tonnes of cereals for the neediest countries.  I am happy to say that the Development Cooperation Council which I attended in Brussels on 3 November agreed broad guidelines covering all facets of the Plan of Action.  As soon as a favourable opinion has been delivered by the European Parliament, the Council regulation giving affect to this £26 million food aid action will be adopted.  The Community will thereby have demonstrated that it can on occasion respond swiftly to a political impetus, in this case the impetus provided by the Paris Conference on the least developed countries which laid very particular stress on those countries' food and agricultural problems.</P>
    <P>The continued need for the International Community to channel food aid to needy populations is unquestionable. The Food Aid Convention is the preeminent international vehicle for the supply of food aid to developing countries. It is in this spirit that I recommend to the House the Protocol extending the Food Aid Convention, 1980.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party fully support the extension of the Food Aid Convention 1980 to 30 June 1983. Irish people have in common a very real interest in and concern for the whole of <Col N="1984" /> the developing world, often called the Third World, to which over many years we have contributed in terms of manpower when we did not have much to give and now, as a State, what we can give in the way of expertise and some money together with manpower and participation in the various international conventions concerned with food aid.</P>
      <P>This convention has been in operation for some time.  Since our accession to it in June 1973, on acceding to membership of the Community, we have given our share of the overall quota under this convention relating to food and cereals for human consumption.  This is only one aspect of the overall question of aid to the Third World.  This is essential not only from the moral and social points of view but also from the point of view of the economic survival of the developed world.  This is an important factor which should be emphasised.  It is not only a matter of doing the best we can for charitable, moral and social reasons.  It is in our own enlightened self-interest to ensure that the Third World survives and improves its standard of living and thereby becomes a greater consumer market in the years ahead for the goods produced in the developed world.</P>
      <P>This whole argument was put very well in great detail in the famous Brandt Report, the report of an independent commission on international development. Very distinguished people throughout the world co-operated in its preparation.  It was chaired by Willy Brandt.  As the House is aware, it is called: &ldquo;North-South: Programme for Survival&rdquo;.  That programme is not just for the survival of the Third World or the southern part of the world and not the northern part.  The whole tenor of the argument in this magnificent treatise is that the survival of the whole world is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survival of the developed world is at stake if a large percentage of the population in the southern hemisphere generally deteriorates in its purchasing power and its standard of living to the extent that it can buy nothing from the developed world.  That would affect the developed world enormously.  That <Col N="1985" /> essential argument is the whole basis of the Brandt Report.  Apart from the moral, social and charitable commitment which we must have to ensure that our fellow human beings do not literally starve, to put it at its lowest, the commitment goes beyond that.  There is a very real commitment in our own interests, or should be such a commitment in our own interests.  By &ldquo;our own&rdquo; I mean the interests of the developed world to ensure that the standard of living in the Third World is raised to the extent that they can participate with us in economic prosperity.  Therefore, there are very strong, financial, economic and political arguments, arguments that go along with the whole survival of organised society, strong political arguments, equally strong as the obvious moral, social and charitable arguments.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that this book, which is published in popular form &mdash; available in the Library &mdash; published in paperback form by Pan World Affairs, available at a price of a little over £2, should be an obvious Christmas gift to all young people in the coming year, and that is only a week or ten days away.  If ever there was what I would regard as compulsory reading &mdash; it is certainly compulsive reading &mdash; it is the sort of situation that is set out very well in the brief 300 odd pages of this report.  There are there strong arguments enunciated for the sort of aid that is given in a limited way here in the form of the Protocol before the House, in the Food Aid Convention. But, of course, we participate in many other areas, bilaterally and multi-laterally on other aspects.  This convention is concerned merely with wheat and cereals which are, of course, important.</P>
    <P>A central chapter of the Brandt Report is chapter 5 relating to hunger and food. In that chapter I notice that the figures are even more horrific than those mentioned by the Minister when he said:</P>
    <P>... it is, however, abundantly clear that in a world where at least 420,000,000 people do not have their minimum food requirement each day, direct food aid actions continue to be essential to save lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> I note, and now quote from chapter 5, page 90, of the Brandt Report, under the heading of Hunger and Food, the figure is even more alarming than that given by the Minister:</P>
    <P>Eight hundred millions are estimated to be &lsquo;destitute&rsquo; in the Third World today, as this Report has already noted: most of them by definition cannot afford an adequate diet. In some low-income countries studies have shown as many as 40 per cent of pre-school children exhibiting clinical signs of malnutrition.  No one can state the exact numbers in the world who experienced hunger and malnutrition, but all estimates count them in hundreds of millions; millions who will either die from lack of food or have their physical development impaired. It is an intolerable situation.  The idea of a community of nations has little meaning if that situation is allowed to continue, if hunger is regarded as a marginal problem which humanity can live with.</P>
    <P>I appreciate why the Minister should be conservative in presenting a document of this kind.  But I think he would agree with me that it is no harm for it to be said here that this figure of 420 million who do not have their minimum food requirement each day, if anything, is on the conservative side.  One has here in the Brandt Report a figure nearly twice that, of 800 million people who are estimated to be destitute in the Third World today.</P>
    <P>There is the problem, a growing problem, as the Brandt Report goes on to show, under a heading International Responsibility which talks about the expansion of population in that particular part of the world, that side by side with this problem of 800 million destitute people there is the situation of population explosion.  By the year 2000 the estimate is that and I quote again from the Brandt Report:</P>
    <P>Only major efforts of investment planning and research can make enough food available for the six billion people the world will probably hold by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> That includes the whole world, encompasses the whole globe.  We are talking now about six billion people by the year 2000.  We are talking about a situation in which the Third World, with its expanding population, can bring the whole of that world, the developed world as well, down to a level well below the sort of level to which we currently feel and have felt entitled in recent years.  Therefore the expectations of all people on this globe are linked to the expansion of food production, circulation of food to people who need it and, above all else, the generation and training of the expertise required to work and manage land better. Side by side with this paradox of starvation and malnutrition is the terrible situation of land which is potentially viable, potentially great in the precise Third World areas that has not been developed, has not been given the expertise and management required to develop it to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>In passing I might say there is one aspect here which concerns some experts within the European Economic Community, some people within that Community who would seek to curtail the policies of the common agricultural policy, who would seek to curtail food production, to reduce the amount of money being made available from the European Fund resources to agricultural production and to the common agricultural policy. I want to emphasise here one important point not often mentioned.  It is this, the common agricultural policy, within the Community, is not just, and should not be regarded as, a narrow protectionist policy for Community farmers.  It is something much greater than that, looked at in the context of the debate we are having here concerned with the Third World.  Here is a food production policy that was initiated by the founding fathers of the European Economic Community who, in their very great wisdom to get to the essentials of matters, said that we must, as a priority, have a working food production policy.  This has been organised and has been functioning but in recent years has encountered very severe criticism, particularly from Great Britain <Col N="1988" /> since her entry into the Community &mdash; very misguided, negative and wrong criticism because if the community agricultural policy fails then the only working food production policy organised by a group of nations on this globe fails.  What should be done is to intensify and organise the common agricultural policy within the Community to a greater degree.  To organise the distribution of surpluses from such a Community is to have a complete and practical policy between the Community through the Lomé Convention &mdash; thereby associating the Community in all the ramifications of agricultural policy with these countries.  We must ensure the transfer of food to them and help them to improve their own agricultural expertise and technology. There need not be any conflict because the more sophisticated agricultural development becomes the more technological and commercial sectors flourish.  Europe has much expertise to export to the Third World, particularly to the countries with whom it is associated through the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>Far from diminishing it, European statesmen should be looking towards the enhancement of the common agricultural policy to ensure that we have more efficient production.  We are all agreed that inefficient production should not be sustained under the CAP.  The aim should be more efficient production of food for export at reasonable rates to Third World countries, accompanied by expert assistance in the processing of such foodstuffs. It is entirely negative to think of cutting back on agricultural production in our Community which has a system that works and can produce more, if given the right incentives, for the benefit of Third World countries.</P>
    <P>It is very significant that whenever difficulties arose in Poland in recent years Community surpluses were available to sustain that country because of our efficient production and marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>People such as our British neighbours and others within the Community who would lightly cast aside the common agricultural policy are embarking on a short-sighted policy because by the end <Col N="1989" /> of the century food will be as scarce a resource as oil now is.  By the year 2000 there will be six billion people in the world and the main problem will be scarcity of food.  Already large segments of the world are afflicted by starvation and malnutrition. In the years to come statesmen and leaders of opinion will be faced with the problems of food production and it is nothing short of lunacy to suggest that the one working system of food production &mdash; the common agricultural policy of the EEC &mdash; should be diminished.  This point of view is shared by enlightened people within the Community with whom I have discussed it.  The French Government share the view that we should apply a stimulus to agriculture which will lead to more efficient production.  We should think in terms of expanding food exports and sending experts in various sectors of agriculture to ensure that the methods we apply in Europe can be replicated throughout the world.  There is no competition involved.  There will be so much pressure on food resources in the years ahead that there is no danger whatever to food producing exporters of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The major problem facing the world is the necessity to increase food resources 100 times above present levels.  That theme runs through the Brandt Report but the gravity of the problem is not appreciated by many people.  It is total madness for people within the Community such as our British neighbours to advocate a policy which would in any way restrict food production when the whole propulsion of policy should be towards expansion.</P>
    <P>I know that problems arise from time to time in regard to the distribution of surpluses and people refer to mountains of various types of food.  That is another problem which should not be beyond the capacity of the developed world to solve, provided the political will exists.  The least of the problems is that of distribution and sale of surplus agricultural products, and it is suicide that food production should be curtailed.  It is a point of view which defies comprehension.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Report states that there must be an end to hunger, that it is an international responsibility and that it <Col N="1990" /> can only be done in a comprehensive way.  The coming together of the Common Market countries sets a headline in that respect.  Parallel with the distribution of cereals from subscribing countries to the developing world, there must be an increase in domestic food production.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to An Foras Talúntais who have done a magnificent job in sending agricultural experts, technicians and research personnel at all levels to a number of African countries.  An Foras Talúntais is held in very high esteem in most of the East African countries ranging from Sudan to Tanzania, and I am sure the Minister of State will bear this out.  The ESB and Bord na Móna have also worked very well in some of these countries.  We are talking here about food production and food aid and in this area the Agricultural Institute have done heroic work.  I do not like to refer in this House to individuals but on this occasion I would like to refer to Dr. Tom Walsh, a former director of the Agricultural Institute who did heroic work over the years and I think he is still associated as chairman with some of the development agencies under the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Report says food production must be a worldwide priority and domestic efforts need world support.  A number of countries came together and produced the International Wheat Agreement, which is in two parts &mdash; the Wheat Trade Convention and the Food Aid Convention, both of which are being discussed here tonight.  We acceded to this agreement in June 1973.  What is happening about the proposed changes in the International Wheat Agreement? What practical effects will these changes have?  I am sure they are no more than organisational changes and that the essential policy thrust will remain the same.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Report referred to all forms of aid and expertise which the developed world try to bring to the developing world, that is, how to get this aid to the people who need it.  One of the big problems in this area is that of administration and organisation, and this is where expertise can help.  It is all very <Col N="1991" /> well getting the food to the areas concerned but what is very important is how the matter is dealt with on the ground, and how the aid is distributed.  It is also very important that there is a follow-through when the experts leave.  There is not much point in experts organising a co-operative or improving agricultural production methods if, when they leave, nobody is left behind to carry on the work.  Therefore training personnel to continue with this work is very important.</P>
    <P>There is a very challenging part of the Brandt Report under the heading of &ldquo;Hunger and Food.&rdquo;  It says that investment is better than food relief.  That idea also runs through the Minister's statement. Because of the enormity of the problem this type of food relief is important in the short and medium term, but investment is even more important.  The Brandt Report stresses building up the infrastructure of these countries, their educational and technical training and relating it to working the land rather than investing prestigious industrial undertakings. This is very important.</P>
    <P>There are chapters in this report on agrarian reforms and appropriate farming systems.  Here too we are talking about how best to organise a situation of that kind; and the co-operative idea would appear to be the right one, although it is often not an easy one to inculcate in parts of the Third World. The report also says that hunger cannot be isolated because there are other problems which affect the economies of these countries, whether it is Lesotho, Tanzania or Sudan.  The hunger problem on its own, although it is terrible, must be looked at in conjunction with all other problems and not on the narrow basis of providing of food aid alone.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote a few recommendations from page 103 of the Brandt Report:</P>
    <P>There must be an end to mass hunger and malnutrition.  The capacity of food-importing developing countries, particularly the low income countries, to meet their food requirements should be expanded and their mounting food <Col N="1992" /> import bill reduced through their own efforts and through expanded financial flows for agricultural development. Special attention should be given to irrigation, agricultural research, storage and increased use of fertiliser and other inputs, and to fisheries development.</P>
    <P>Agrarian reforms are of great importance in many countries both to increase agricultural productivity and to put higher incomes into the hands of the poor.</P>
    <P>International food security should be assured through the early establishment of an International Grain Arrangement, larger international emergency reserves, and the establishment of a food financing facility.</P>
    <P>Food aid should be increased and linked to employment promotion and agricultural programmes and projects without weakening incentives to food production.</P>
    <P>Liberalization of trade in food and other agricultural products within and between North and South would contribute to the stabilization of food supplies.</P>
    <P>Support for international agricultural research institutions should be expanded with greater emphasis given to regional co-operation.</P>
    <P>These are the basic recommendations in the very simple language of the Brandt Report.  If I was to emphasise one point it would be covered in the few lines which say:</P>
    <P>Food aid should be increased and linked to employment promotion and agricultural programmes and projects without weakening incentives to food production.</P>
    <P>This means we should have a two-tiered type of development.  Food aid should not be considered alone; it should be linked to a positive programme encouraging agricultural development in the areas affected.  In other words, if a Third World country is given food aid it should not be given as a once off situation; it should be linked with the provision of expertise.  These experts should be able <Col N="1993" /> to show the inhabitants how to grow food in their areas.  They should show them how to organise production and co-operatives, how to prepare the land, have inputs of fertilisers, organise drainage and set up a farming scheme that will enable the people in the area to produce the foodstuff appropriate to their soil and climate.</P>
    <P>In that way there is a real and positive investment for the future.  We should not have aid delivered for the sake of aid, desirable though that is, and in many cases where there is total hunger and malnutrition there must be aid.  Brandt recommends in that regard that the aid should be linked to positive agricultural programmes for the areas in receipt of the aid.  That sort of investment input should go side by side with the aid distribution and delivery.  That is a very fundamental and sensible way to organise this basic matter which is of concern to the whole world.  It is not just of concern to the people of Lesotho, the Caribbean, the Pacific or Bangladesh, important as it is to them as human beings, but it is of concern to us also.  If we in the supposedly sophisticated developed world think we can live in isolation while a growing population of destitute people surround us, people who do not have the capacity to buy from us, people who will create political instability by reason of their destitution, then we do not deserve to survive either.  We will not survive economically, commercially, or politically in terms of the type of world that will have the population mentioned by Brandt by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I support this measure and Fianna Fáil support any and every measure of this kind, be it national, international, bilateral or multilateral within our resources. While I understand the limitation imposed by our own budgetary position, we should always take a progressive attitude in this respect.  I wish well the proposed all-party committee to be set up to deal with this matter.  It is an appropriate area for a joint committee.  It is so important and fundamental that it should be viewed by us all in a very broad manner. It is difficult to get this message over in <Col N="1994" /> the developed world in which there are shortages, people in our country and in this city who are having bad times.  It is difficult for the whole of the developed world because in many ways even the more prosperous countries in the developed world have their problems in regard to unemployment.  But that should not take from the fact that their problems, however difficult, can be contained to some degree compared to the problems in the developing world.  In the developed world if an appeal to idealism does not work then we should appeal to self-interest because there is the self-interest aspect in that we will not survive if billions in the Third World go down in the economic and social sense.  That will lead to such a political revolution throughout the world that the developed world will not survive.  We should think deeply and clearly about this matter and recognise that we are all very much in one world. There is no question about the interaction and mutual interests of all of us on this globe and no question of any of us isolating ourselves any more.  We are one family on the globe and it benefits all of us and behoves all of us to ensure that the family progresses to the best degree of equal prosperity possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister's statement on this matter. It is important that those who have any influence in our community, especially those with influence with the decision-makers, devote their time and energies to ensure that we do not neglect our brothers and sisters in the Third World.  We must be even more conscious than the citizens of other countries about the effects of famine and the disasters it can bring upon people.  To a great extent we have given the lead to the rest of the world in looking after people in the Third World.  Our wealth is not great and our input in relation to the amount of financial aid we can give is limited, but nevertheless down through the centuries we have shown that we are willing to go to the Third World to try to educate the people there.  No matter in what way we couch the atrocities that are committed on our brothers and sisters in the Third <Col N="1995" /> World by depriving them of food, we must remember that there is only one cure for their complaint and that is to supply them with food.  We can help the Third World in various ways.  We can help by exporting food to them or by educating them to be self-sufficient.  The latter is a long term prospect that will require a lot of patience and skilled personnel. No matter how daunting the prospect, this is something we must tackle immediately.</P>
      <P>As members of the white race we have a lot to answer for because we deprived a lot of those people of their natural wealth.  We polluted their environment, we sold their stock and we cut them away from the basic resources on which they depended for living.  A famous writer once said that when the white man arrives in any area the continent ages quickly. That writer was correct.  While we may claim that our hands are clean in relation to that type of activity, we cannot ignore the plight of our fellow human beings. We hear a lot about wheat, butter and beef mountains and surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of man to bring about a situation whereby that surplus of wealth will be transferred to the Third World without the economies of developing countries being seriously affected.</P>
      <P>We read in the newspapers of tens of thousands of tonnes of wheat being burned because of there being a surplus of wheat and because the market would be affected if those surpluses were to be kept in circulation.  Can there be any greater crime than the disposal of such a commodity in this way when people in other parts of the world are starving? Surely none of us who has any moral values can condone such action.  We may understand it from a capitalist point of view but from a humane point of view there is no justification for it.  We must not stand idly by and allow it to happen. We must try to ensure that the wealthier countries devise some kind of system whereby these surpluses can be transferred. As Deputy Lenihan has said, this can be achieved if there is the necessary political will to do so.  It is for us to try to ensure that there is such political will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1996" /> Unfortunately, however, food that is sent to some of those countries whose people are in need very often falls into the hands of those for whom it was not intended.  This results from the type of system that is operated.  It is a loose system which is open to all sorts of corruption. There are the corrupt people in the middle raking off what is the right of the ordinary people of the countries concerned. Therefore, not only is it important that we send food to the Third World but it is also important we ensure that there is a proper follow-up to supervise its distribution.  There is a great example of this sort of work in our home town of Bandon where private individuals have got together to help the Ugandans.  I am reluctant to mention names here but no praise can be great enough so far as the work of Miss Sheila Hayes is concerned in this area.  She oversees the whole operation.  Not only is there money being sent to Uganda to enable the people to buy food but there are being sent also huge quantities of what is regarded here as surplus medical equipment, equipment which would be thrown away otherwise on the grounds that it is not suitable but which is of much help to the Ugandans. If we could have a similar type of operation in every town and village we could do a great deal to help the peoples of the Third World.</P>
    <P>There is the problem, too, of education. We must go further than has been the case up to now.  We must send out trained and skilled personnel, especially those trained in the area of agriculture, but with special emphasis on irrigation which seems to be the key to making the peoples of the Third World self sufficient. In order to enable these people to begin to help themselves they need the services of such skilled personnel.  This whole problem is enormous and one that we will not solve here this evening, though we can make some little dent in it by our approach.  Not nearly enough publicity is given to this matter.  Tomorrow morning, for instance, the newspapers will be likely to give a good deal more publicity to a row in the Dáil of a couple of minutes' duration than to the very important issue we are discussing, an issue which is worthy <Col N="1997" /> of the support of the people.  I hope that in the years to come we will continue to do everything possible to help our brothers and sisters in the Third World. As Deputy Lenihan has mentioned, if we fail in that respect, even for the most selfish of motives, in the words of the Brandt Report we may not be around too long to help even ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of addressing a few remarks on this motion especially at a time when European leaders are concerned with the future direction of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is appropriate that this Parliament should at this time be approving the 1981 Protocol for the First Extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are one of the greatest food-producing countries in the world.  Any measure that will enable us to dispose of our surplus food will be of benefit to the Community as a whole.  Unfortunately, though, this is not as easy as it may seem. Some people may ask why we do not transport our food surpluses to the Third World.  The fact is that the peoples of the Third World are not in a position to buy food.  If they were in such a position there would not be the need for the amount of charity that has been extended to them down through the years.  The Irish people are among the most charitable in the world when it comes to giving aid to the starving millions of our brothers and sisters in the poorer parts of the world.  I am always irritated when some prominent churchman condemns Irish politicians and Irish people generally for their lack of commitment to the Third World.  We must remember that ours is a small, underdeveloped country and that its potential in the field of food production has not been reached yet.  The time is now opportune for European political leaders to devise ways and means of framing the CAP so that increasing amounts of our surplus food products can be channelled to the peoples of the Third World. It angers me to read reports of how the butter mountain is being disposed of by selling butter to Russia at low prices. That is a most retrograde step because Russia is one world power that loses no <Col N="1998" /> opportunity of exploiting the situation among the starving peoples of the Third World.  The most recent example is their intrusion into the affairs of Afghanistan. It is extraordinary when we assess the situation to discover that we assisted those people in their acts of aggression by allowing them to buy cheap food.  This is an opportune time to devise ways and means of sending surplus food products to the starving millions in the Third World rather than to Russia.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is sacred to us because of our capacity to produce food.  To those who speak about dismantling it, I say channel your thinking towards relieving the situation in the Third World.  We hear daily about butter mountains, beef mountains and milk lakes.  We have a vested interest in any new measures that will be taken in the future to ensure our surpluses are channelled to starving people.  It has been said that it is not only food they need but expertise and skills.  At present we are more concerned with the disposal of surpluses. We have been active in the field of bringing expertise to underdeveloped countries.  We also have made a contribution in the technical field.</P>
    <P>We are a food producing nation.  My constituency has some of the best agricultural land in the country.  It is appropriate that I should be concerned that no opportunity of disposing of our agricultural produce and finding new markets is lost.  Milk can be converted into powder and this can be flown across the world and disposed of quickly.  We made great strides in that area in recent years and should commend all those who have been responsible for securing markets for us. They have done something to relieve the hunger, stress and hardship endured by those in the Third World.  While it may appear in the eyes of the big powers that our efforts in the 1981 Protocol are insignificant, they are significant for a small country.  We should be proud of the role we have played through the years.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more distressing than to be told daily that there must be cutbacks in milk production and, if not, that a levy will be imposed.  We are told we must cut back on our beef and butter production. <Col N="1999" /> If our markets were properly organised and there was new thinking, there would be no need for cutbacks.  We have the ability to produce.  We can produce the finest food in the world.  We have a climate which, while inclement, enables us to produce quality food in abundance.</P>
    <P>I have seen irrigation systems in operation in middle eastern countries.  If these are perfected people in these countries will become self-sufficient and we will have problems in regard to the disposal of our surplus food.  No impediment should be placed in the path of progress. If we have expertise let us pool it with other countries and ensure that those in great need get the benefit of man's skills. What is needed is to ensure that man has the capacity to exploit his own expertise and skills.  We should compliment ourselves on the progress we have made towards relieving the distress, hunger and hardship of those in the Third World.</P>
    <P>To dispose of surplus food to Russia is a retrograde step.  This has never been touched on by political leaders.  Instead of transporting food to Russia we should channel it in the direction of the Third World.  I hope the Minister will ensure that every effort will be made to guarantee that our food surplus is channelled in that direction.  Charity groups make collections and send money abroad. Instead of that we should send surplus food.  In that way we would also be helping our economy.  I welcome the opportunity of making those few observations. No words of mine would be adequate fully to do justice to the efforts that have been made by successive Irish Governments and people in ensuring that aid is sent to the Third World.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Protocol for the First Extension of the Food Aid Convention. We are a remarkable nation and have a remarkable capacity to survive. Not much more than 100 years ago we survived a most appalling famine.  Having come through the recession of the thirties we emerged as a proud people.  We were given courage by our leaders to face the <Col N="2000" /> poverty and deprivation of the period. When things were bad our leaders did not demoralise the nation.  I regret to say that this is what the Government are now inclined to do.  They are inclined to bring about national demoralisation, not recognising our history as a people of great courage who came through periods of famine and hardship.  It is not more than 30 years ago when we went through times which were more difficult than those we have at present.  Despite what the political leaders say about us the people will not be put down by the prophets of doom and gloom who suggest that our nation will go bankrupt.  It is very difficult to bankrupt a nation, but one way it can be done is to talk the people into it.  I come back to the motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was not straying from the motion.  In all our years of difficulty and hardship missionaries, teachers and volunteers, at great cost to themselves and to the people, went to Third World countries to assist in any way they could.  They continue with such work in Africa, Asia, the Philippines, Latin America and other parts of the developing world.  We have not been found wanting in this regard.  I am not being critical of the Minister of State but I am critical of an attitude that demoralises our people.  I remind the House that the people will not tolerate this.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on producing recently a good information film on Lesotho and our activities in that country.  I hope he and the officials in his Department will continue with that work. Officials in that Department are among the finest people and I hope they will be allowed to continue producing such films in order to inform our people of what we are doing for the developing world and that despite our difficulties we will provide for people less well off than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979 great promises were made about the aid we would provide over a period of four years to the Third World but recent announcements indicate that <Col N="2001" /> the Cabinet have reneged on that promise. I regret very much that that promise is not likely to be met.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the nation could afford to provide all the aid within four years. We did not suggest that: the Government made the suggestion and the House should be reminded that they have fallen down on that promise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keegan referred to the mountains of food in the European Communities and the sale of butter to the USSR. We must not forget that whatever difficulties there have been in the West with regard to development aid to the Third World and whatever difficulties may have existed in respect of the Munro Doctrine of the United States in Latin America, Russia is the least generous in its aid to Third World countries when one considers its gross national product.  It supports some movements that seek to set up certain régimes and it is prepared to send arms and ammunition to propagate its creed.  I agree with Deputy Keegan that we should ask the EEC to review the supply of butter and other commodities to the USSR and see if the mountains of food in European countries could be sent to the Third World where food is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>One of the most important factors in the coming 50 years will be population growth and this was referred to by Deputy Lenihan.  He had a long and distinguished career in the Department of Foreign Affairs and I have no doubt he will be back there shortly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>He referred to difficulties with regard to population growth and the environment.  At a recent meeting in Strasbourg under the auspices of the Council of Europe it was stated that if world population continues to grow at its present rate, by the year 2025 there will be a population of 12,000,000,000 people.  If the population increase continues at that rate to 2050 we will not have enough food in the world to feed the population.  As Deputy Lenihan mentioned, that will include us.  Is Armageddon <Col N="2002" /> to come in 2050 or are we to bring about an increased awareness in the developed nations of their obligation to future generations?  The present staggering growth in world population will continue for some considerable time and it will be one of the strongest forces shaping the future of our society.  In the Brandt Report entitled &ldquo;North-South: A Programme for Survival&rdquo; it is indicated that more than 1 million people are added to the world population every five days and in the 1980s and 1990s it will increase to close on 2 billion, which is more than the total number of people in the world during the first decade of this century. That statistic speaks for itself.  It shows the seriousness of this subject.</P>
      <P>In the most difficult of circumstances the Minister has done a good job in his Department and I will not hesitate in praising the work he has done.  He is totally committed to Third World development but he should ensure that his Cabinet colleagues give more support in this area.  On page 106 of the Brandt Report there is the following comment:</P>
      <P>Many countries have shown both that economic and social development itself helps to limit population growth and that public policies can contribute directly to the decline of birth rates. The countries where birth rates have recently most declined have usually been those which have managed to spread the benefits of development widely.</P>
      <P>That extremely important statement should be noted specially by Members of this House, by the Minister and his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women play a key part in the whole question of conquering hunger.  This should be recognised, and they should be helped and rewarded.  They feed and care for the children who are the most vulnerable to ill health, a fact which programmes take into account only very little. Also, as stressed earlier, women play a major role as agricultural producers, often working with poor technology for no pay under bad working conditions. One of the most deplorable developments in the Third World is the campaign <Col N="2003" /> of the multinationals to send powdered milk and canned baby food to the Third World, to the less developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and so on, and thus the women in those countries are not encouraged to breast-feed their children.  That is a retrograde step and a scandal of which this House and the Minister are aware.  A basic principle of the Third World rights is that people should not be imposed upon by the multinationals who are selling by very strong sales methods items of food which are contrary to the traditions and unnecessary to development of the population there.</P>
    <P>We have a tradition of service overseas and in the Third World in particular. Organisations like Trócaire and CONGOOD, the umbrella organisation, appear to be under-financed, particularly CONGOOD, in the administration of their offices.  That is a pity.  The Minister might have a look at that area to see if he can find sufficient funds to assist the people who are at their wits' end trying to bring about greater public awareness. I said earlier that the Minister had presented recently a very good film documentary which will be available on cassette to schools around the country.  I hope many of the schools will avail of it, but I hope also that the Minister will not overlook the need of CONGOOD and other agencies who are short of administrative funds to an extent that they are practically barefoot, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The gap between the North and South is becoming more and more pronounced. In these recessionary times political pressures are imposed to combat hunger, poverty and poor accommodation in our own country.  We have the leadership to do that.  Elected representatives and political leaders can provide for our own country by a strong approach to the increased production of food.  Deputy Keegan referred to the fact that we have some of the best agricultural land in the world, much of it under-utilised, unfortunately much of it not being used.  We have a great opportunity of increasing the production of food.  As Deputy Keegan said, it is a shame that the EEC should suggest that we might have to put <Col N="2004" /> levies on increased food production.  The Minister in his speech said that as soon as a favourable opinion has been delivered by the European Parliament, the Council regulation giving effect to this £26 million food aid action will be adopted.  How long must we wait for the European Parliament to decide?  This aid is needed urgently.  Literally hundreds of people around the developing world are falling dead because this aid is being held up in the European Parliament.  These bureaucratic delays should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>A most serious aspect in Africa is the continued existence of the colonial, racist power in the state of South Africa and the difficulties in Namibia where the South Africans continue to draw on the wealth of that land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not have to remind the House, but perhaps it is well that I should mention, that countries such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Latin-America are in enormous need. We in our way have provided a great deal of support through our missionaries, teachers, agriculturists and others who have gone to these countries.  I pay tribute to them and to all the people who have gone on voluntary service overseas, nuns, priests and lay people.  They have given us renewed confidence in ourselves. They have shown that, despite the fact that our history has been one of deprivation and relative poverty, we have the ability to overcome our own difficulties and go abroad to serve in the interests of other nations and peoples who are less well off than we are.</P>
      <P>We have an extraordinary situation in Kampuchea where a great deal of aid is given.  Mr. John O'Shea set up an organisation called GOAL, a remarkable organisation doing a remarkable job in ferrying food to the people of that tortured nation.  We have so much to our credit that it is a tragedy that this Government continue to demoralise people by suggesting that we are on the precipice of doom.  I do not believe that.  Our people are strong enough to overcome any difficulty.  Over the years, the Irish have proved their ability, their pride, their strength and courage.  The Government side should stop making prognostications about the ultimate demise of our nation.  We are not going to collapse.  We will continue through the most difficult of difficult recessions.  We will also continue to provide the necessary support for the Third World and help people to give that support by their expertise.  The Minister must continue to put pressure on his colleagues in Government to provide for an increase, if not the .07 per cent of the gross national product in four years of government, as near as we can to that.  That is what one would expect from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan, when Minister for Foreign Affairs, was very much aware of <Col N="2006" /> the difficulties and problems in these areas and took a deep and abiding interest in them.  I hope the Minister will be generous enough to acknowledge that when replying to this discussion.  Deputy Lenihan rightly mentioned the book <i>North-South: A Programme for Survival</i>, probably one of the most important books ever written on the subject.  It is the report of the Independent Commission on International Development Issues under the chairmanship of Willy Brandt.  This is not a book to be read and absorbed immediately.  It contains so much information that I ask the Minister to recommend it to the Department of Education as part of the curriculum in second level schools, for fourth, fifth and sixth year students.  It is an extremely compassionate and understanding book. It has been said in this House that each nation depends on the other.  We are interdependent on the Third World. Willy Brandt brings this out quite clearly in the book.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for its patience in bearing with me.  I found it very difficult to keep all the time to the subject of the motion and I appreciate very much the latitude given to me.  I wish the Minister and his staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs well and assure him that the Fianna Fáil Party and I have an interest in this area.  We will give the Government all possible encouragement in their endeavours to bring about an increase in support for Third World development. We have certain obligations to our own national morale and we should not forget our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this motion.  I welcome this, as other speakers have.  Let it be noted that when a measure of this sort comes before the Dáil it should not be nodded through.  Not very much Dáil time is given to speaking about the Third World, although every Member of this House feels very strongly about what is happening in that area.  No matter how much we give, or how much we strain our resources, it can never be enough.  It can never come near solving the problems of the hungry and malnutritioned in the <Col N="2007" /> Third World.  We are all, irrespective of our party affiliations, very proud of the young volunteers who leave Ireland. These are people with proper idealism who give vent to their idealistic feelings in a very practical way by giving service to many of these countries overseas. These volunteers are more appreciated than they may be aware.</P>
      <P>We must pay due regard to the report of the Brandt Commission.  The conference which took place earlier this year in Mexico was of vital importance.  One man whom I heard speak at a conference which I attended on this measure, for whom I learned to have a deep respect because of his tremendous commitment to the measures which are needed to get food to the Third World, is Mr. Edward Health, the British MP, former Prime Minister, who is also a member of a commission. He should be listened to by statesmen from all countries, because he has a lot to say.  Many do not realise that our own survival depends on measures such as this.</P>
      <P>If the world population grows at its present rate and the rich part of the world does not share with the poor part, people will pour over the borders of their countries seeking food.  Famine will force people, as it did the Mongol hordes of old, to reach out and grab what food they can get, wherever they can.  It could have a chain reaction, reaching right across Europe.  We will not be excluded from such an invasion of people desperately seeking food.  There is not enough food in the world to feed its growing population. By the year 2000, it has been clearly stated, that if we have not provided enough food to feed the Third World, a real problem will face the so-called &ldquo;civilised world,&rdquo; the wealthy part.  We must make a real commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to recall very briefly that one of the major rows which the Taoiseach had when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs was with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, over the amount of money which he was willing to make available for assistance to the Third World.  The Taoiseach had certainly <Col N="2008" /> impressed a lot of people that he had a genuine commitment to the Third World. Here is another example of where he will have an opportunity &mdash; and many people will be watching him &mdash; to put his money where his mouth is and provide resources from the limited resources that are available. There is an urgency that we give to the maximum extent of our capability, and there will be no complaints from this side of the House about moneys allocated to the Third World for the alleviation of hunger and malnutrition wherever it exists.</P>

      <P>I am very glad of the welcome that has been given by this House to the motion before us.  In many ways I am glad that the discussion strayed far beyond the boundaries of the Food Aid Convention.  I agree with the comment made by Deputy Andrews that it is a pity that there is not more of an opportunity to discuss the whole question of development co-operation in this House.  I would hope and expect in the years ahead during the term of the present Government that there will be many more such opportunities.  I am delighted to see the tone of the reaction of the Deputies and that they wish to discuss these issues on many more occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan, as befits somebody who dealt with this area when he was in Foreign Affairs in the last Government, looked at it in a very broad fashion and rightly paid tribute to the work of the Brandt Commission.  I will not fall out with him on the figures except to say that when I referred to the figure of 420 million people I referred to it as the figure which is generally thought to be reasonably accurate when one speaks of those people who do not have enough food each day as opposed to the people who are in a slightly broader category and considered to be destitute; it was in that context that the figure of 800 million arose.  What is important is that we are talking about human beings, we are talking about hundreds of millions of people. I share the views expressed by Deputy Lenihan as to the duty and obligation on the developed world to try to ensure as <Col N="2009" /> best it can that every effort is made to relieve that appalling situation.</P>
    <P>There was a fair amount of discussion during the debate about the CAP and the whole question of agricultural production within the Community.  Is it not a very odd situation to have over 400 million people hungry in the world and people in Europe talking about the problems of disposing of surpluses?  Deputy Keegan mentioned that the suggestion from some of our Community partners was that there be cutbacks in production.  Anyone standing back and looking at the situation in human terms must find that type of approach utterly and totally ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan referred to the wheat agreement.  As he knows, the Community contributes from its budget to the operating expenses of the International Wheat Council.  We do not make a separate contribution under the Wheat Trade Convention.  Since the question was raised, there are negotiations for a new international grain agreement. These have been stalled for some years past.  One of the suggestions in the negotiations was that there would be a stockpiling arrangement.  However, the new United States administration is not very keen on what is called &ldquo;the magic of the market place&rdquo; and is reluctant to interfere in world markets.  Unfortunately it does seem as if these discussions may not come to fruition in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate it was mentioned that investment was better than food relief.  If we are talking about the whole question of development, of course I accept that development is essential.  But I have to say that food aid is an integral and a central part of the development programme and this was recognised in the Brandt Report, which was accepted by the European Parliament in its comprehensive resolution of October 1980.  It was also accepted at the Paris Conference on the least developed countries in September.  I believe that for the foreseeable future while there are so many people actually hungry, many of them dying of hunger and malnutrition, food aid has to be an important part of the programme of development co-operation. I am glad of the support for the <Col N="2010" /> joint committee, the motion for which I hope to bring before this House very shortly.  As Deputies know, it was debated in the other House last week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley referred to something that I would like to see highlighted more. That was the reference to joint towns, for example Bandon, where a local group involved themselves in a community effort to help a project in Uganda.  He talked of the efforts of the local community. What is important in that context, and perhaps worth mentioning, is that there is a contact at the other end in Kampala, so that there is absolutely no wastage in the effort.  Certainly in the context of the suggestion made by my constituency colleague I would very much like to see the community effort of the town of Bandon emulated by many more towns.  There are a number of such efforts but we should have that extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The question of development education arose.  I am glad to see the expressions of support for the efforts in that area.  I am totally convinced of the need for far more development education so that our people in this country will know the problems of the Third World and will appreciate what is being done, but, more important, will appreciate the need for a greater effort.  In no way do I denigrate the work that has been done over the years, particularly the work of the missionaries who were the trailblazers in this area, the work of the voluntary organisations and, indeed, our own efforts which have grown over the past decade. At the same time we have to bear in mind that, despite the difficulties here, we are still the twenty-fourth richest country in the world and from that point of view there is an obligation on us at international level to improve our performance from the point of view of official development assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said that this country was in difficulty but that we will survive. I want to absolutely reassure him on that.  Under the leadership of the present Government we will certainly lead this country out of its present difficulties.  But the real point is that despite the difficulties there has to be a concentration on <Col N="2011" /> the needs of the Third World.  I would reject any suggestion that the new Government have in any way reneged on their commitment to the Third World.  Consideration of the Estimates is nearly completed and I would hope and expect that everyone will shortly be able to appreciate the strength of the commitment of the new Government to the Third World.</P>
    <P>We are running a bit late and there are many other matters to which I would like to refer, but, as I mentioned earlier, I hope we will have the opportunity to have a broader debate immediately after the recess on the motion to establish the joint committee.</P>
    <P>I thank Members of the House for their contributions.  I am glad the House has given the motion unanimous support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 7th December, 1981.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Housing Act, 1969, was to prevent the unwarranted demolition or change of use of habitable houses which was depleting the housing stock at a time of difficulty in keeping pace with housing demand, particularly in Dublin city.  The Act was intended to be a temporary measure, due to expire on 31 December 1972, but it included provision in section 13 for its continuance in operation after that date if the conditions so warranted.  In fact, it has been continued in force since by the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Orders, 1972, 1974, 1977 and 1979 and will expire on the 31 December 1981 unless continued by an order made by the Minister for the Environment after it has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> The Act requires generally that the permission of the housing authority must be obtained for the demolition or change of use of any habitable house.  In determining an application for permission under the Act a housing authority must have regard to the state of repair of the house to which the application relates and to the adequacy of the supply of dwellings in its functional area.  An authority may either refuse permission or grant it, with or without conditions.</P>
    <P>While the powers made available by the Act have been utilised occasionally by at least 38 housing authorities, in practice the controls have only been exercised to any degree by a few, principally by the Dublin authorities and Cork Corporation. Statistics furnished by these authorities of applications made to them and of their decisions thereon and representations made by them to have the Act continued in force indicated that the Act has helped to preserve a considerable number of houses.</P>
    <P>Up to 30 September 1981 applications for permission in respect of 2,463 buildings had been made to Dublin Corporation. Permission was refused in 1,045 cases and granted subject to conditions in 1,365.  Of the 325 applications received by Cork Corporation in the same period 222 were granted, 87 were refused and 16 were withdrawn.  However, it can be said that these figures may not of themselves provide a true indication of the Act's effectiveness.  It has had a deterrent value and at the same time the application of its provisions has been responsible for a number of replacement dwellings and there has been the assistance to local finances of the contributions made to them where permission for demolition and change of use had been granted subject to such contributions.</P>
    <P>Where a housing authority have refused permission or granted it subject to conditions there is a right of appeal to the Minister.  By the end of September this year, 1,106 appeals had been submitted. Of these, 59 were not received within the statutory period, 116 were withdrawn, 879 were determined and the remainder were under consideration.</P>
    <P>Whether the Act should be continued <Col N="2013" /> in its present form has been the subject of much debate in the House.  I note from the record of the discussion on the resolution on the 1979 Continuance Order Motion that the then Minister was recommending the continuance of the Act because, while satisfied that some form of permanent control for this purpose was necessary, he was not satisfied as to the form the control should take and wished to consult local authorities for their views on the matter before taking a decision.</P>
    <P>When I took office I found that local authorities had been consulted.  The results showed that the vast majority did not avail of their powers under the Act but preferred to use their powers under the Planning Acts to control change of use of residential property.  Only two local authorities made a case for retention of the Act, but although both used their powers extensively neither offered any suggestions as to how the weakness of the Act might be overcome.</P>
    <P>On consideration, I am prepared to accept that there is need for some control of the type provided by the Act, but I am inclined to the view that the control would best be exercised by planning authorities under the planning code and that whatever legislative amendment is necessary for the purpose in that code should be made.</P>
    <P>The considerable pressure of other business since I took office has not enabled me to have developed so far any amendment along these lines.  The position is directly related to the question of reviewing the present provisions governing the withering of planning approvals and permissions, a matter on which important representations have been made and concerning which the Government intend to make an announcement in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I would not wish that the powers available under the 1969 Act to those local authorities who use them should be lost through the lapsing of the Act and I propose to continue them through this order for a period of three years from 31 December 1981.  While I ask the Dáil in the circumstances to approve of the order now before them, <Col N="2014" /> I can assure Deputies that it is my intention to review the situation within the period of extension and, if appropriate safeguards can be provided by planning legislation, it would be my intention to allow the 1969 Act to lapse before the terminal date now proposed.</P>
    <P>On this basis I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I deeply regret that because of the Government's action in the House today in the motion which restricts the time for debate of items such as the motion now before the House, the Courts Bill, 1981, the Merchant Shipping Bill, 1981, the Rent Restrictions Bill, 1981, and the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, we will not have adequate time to debate this important motion.  Neither will we have time properly to consider the other Bills I have mentioned.  It is to be deeply regretted from a democratic point of view.  The order to which the motion refers is as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 13 of the Housing Act, 1969 (No. 16 of 1969) hereby makes the following Order, the draft of which has been approved by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  This Order may be cited as the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981.</P>
      <P>2.  The Housing Act, 1969 (other than section 11 and subsections (1) and (2) of section 13) shall continue in force until 31st December, 1984.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful to the House if I referred to exactly what is in the Housing Act, 1969, and reminded the House of its sections.  In the Title, the Act is referred to as follows:</P>
      <P>An Act to make provision to control the demolition or use otherwise than for human habitation of certain houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially we have the interpretation section. <Col N="2015" /> Section 2 refers to general obligations for obtaining permission.  Section 3 refers to applications for permission.  Section 4 deals with permission for demolition or use otherwise than for human habitation of habitable houses.  Section 5 provides that a housing authority may require a house to be made fit for human habitation.  Section 6 provides for the enforcement of a reinstatement notice. Section 7 refers to the recovery of instalments mentioned in section 4(3) and expenses incurred by a housing authority under section 6(1).</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that appeals relating to reinstatement notices and demands for expenses may be made under section 72 of the Act of 1966.  Section 9 refers to the non-application of the Act in certain cases.  Section 10 deals with provisions applicable where permission is required under this Act to and under the Act of 1963.  Section 11 deals with the amendment of section 66 of the Act of 1966. Section 12 is the transitional section and section 13 concerns the short title, construction, collective citation and duration.</P>
    <P>All of these sections in the original Act were intended to preserve the stock of housing.  In discussing this motion one must ask what action have the Government taken to preserve and increase our housing stock.  If we look at the motion in narrow terms, it is a continuance of the existing situation with a recognition by the Minister of the need to review the situation some time between now and 1984.  If the Minister is seriously considering a review of this legislation, why does he need the period between now and 1984 to do so?  My concern is that he may be putting it on the long finger.  If he were serious, he would have confined himself to a 12-month period.  The Minister referred to pressure of other legislation and other items in the Department. If he were sincere he would have given himself 12 months continuance.  Exactly what are the Minister's proposals and what are the trends of thought in his review?</P>
    <P>Before going on to the general question of the maintenance of the housing <Col N="2016" /> stock and additions to it, and the Government's policy in that area, I would ask the Minister to direct his attention to section 5 of the Act we are being asked to continue in operation.  Section 5 gives to the housing authority the power to require a house to be made fit for human habitation.  From my experience I found that one of the great defects of the Housing Act, 1969, was that, while property owners were waiting for a decision to be made by the local authority or by the Minister on appeal, they quite consciously allowed the condition of their property to deteriorate to such an extent that the local authority or the Minister had little option but to grant permission for a change of use.</P>
    <P>If they did not the house was allowed to deteriorate to the stage where it could no longer be used for human habitation. It was easier in that case for the local authority to grant permission for a change of use rather than to try and impose section 5 which required the house to be returned to a state fit for human habitation.  In my experience in the Department a number of these cases came before me.  How does the Minister intend to tackle the problem of property owners who quite consciously and irresponsibly permit and assist in the deterioriation of their property while awaiting permission for a change of use from a habitable residence to an office block, a shop, or whatever.</P>
    <P>The whole operation of this Act needs to be looked at.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to look at it, but I question his sincerity about his review of the Act when he says that he will take until 1984 to look at it.  The Minister for the Environment is not really sincere about tackling the problem if he is asking for a continuance order up to 1984.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Act refers to the maintenance of the housing stock.  That is really the kernel of the Act.  I question the Government's sincerity about improving the housing stock.  I want to remind the House that, when the previous National Coalition were in office, with the exception of a decision made within a month of taking office to increase <Col N="2017" /> the limits of the local authority housing loans and the income limits, from March-April of 1973 until they were thrown out of office, chased out by the Irish people in June 1977, they did not increase the income limits or the loan limit of the SDA loans.</P>
    <P>We have a number of schemes for encouraging house purchase.  The only scheme run by the State is the SDA loans scheme.  We depend on the building societies, the insurance companies, the banks and other lending agencies for the remainder of the loans.  Between 1973 and 1977 the National Coalition Government showed a total contempt for the State's involvement in the SDA loans scheme.  Since they took office this time through the vagaries of PR, and the kindness of socialist, question mark, inverted commas, Deputies, once again they have shown their contempt for the only agency in the State which is geared to the provision of loans for house purchase.  They came into power on 30 June last.  From 23 July we had three budgets in a week &mdash; we had the budget on Tuesday when we saw the increase in VAT, from 10 per cent up to 15 per cent on most items; we had all of the other savage increases announced on that Tuesday; on the Wednesday we had the increases in electricity, CIE, postal and other charges announced and on the Thursday here at about 12 noon in slipped the Minister for the Environment, Deputy P. Barry and with a stroke of the pen he altered the regulations for the SDA loans scheme.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House of exactly what we had done in power from 1977 to 1981.  When we assumed office there was the ludicrous level of income eligibility of £2,350, and £4,500 was the size of the loan.  Over the years we increased those figures, the last increase constituting one section of the housing package I announced in April last, which increased the loan to £14,000 and the income limit to £7,000.  Part of that package also were the subsidies and so on, to which I will revert later.  At that stage we had demand for the SDA loans scheme running at a record level.  What happened?  With the usual narrow-minded, backward looking administration and decisions that typify <Col N="2018" /> this Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, they removed from eligibility 22 per cent of potential borrowers.  They excluded loans for single people.  We all know &mdash; and the figure of 22 per cent proves it &mdash; there is a tradition of single people, men and women, buying homes.  Within three weeks of coming into power this Government removed such applicants from eligibility for SDA loans.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow we will be asked to consider a Housing Finance Agency Bill which purports to make extra finance available from the private sector for the purpose of providing loans for house purchase. Surely if this administration were serious about the provision of money for house purchase, rather than setting up another layer of bureaucracy with all the expense that that entails, they would remove the conditions that have debarred 22 per cent of potential house buyers from availability to the SDA loans scheme.  They already have a national scheme, the local authority house purchase scheme.  We do not need another layer of bureaucracy; rather they should just provide the finance through the SDA loans scheme.</P>
    <P>On top of that third budget in July last, as I have described it, the Minister for the Environment removed the availability of the mortgage subsidy from single people, again hitting this 22 per cent, admitted by the Government, and I use the Minister's own figure of 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>We are told that this agency which we are to discuss tomorrow and Thursday under this guillotine motion &mdash; and we were told by the Minister of State earlier when moving the guillotine motion &mdash; is urgently required to meet a desperate social need and is a measure which will enable the Government to establish an agency which will ultimately channel private sector funds into housing.  There is a serious shortage of funding for housing in this country at present.  That is the responsibility of the Government and let them tackle it.  It is said that this measure is designed to give the necessary injection of resources to alleviate the problem.  The Bill we will be discussing tomorrow will be an enabling one.</P>
    <P>If the Government are concerned about the construction industry on the <Col N="2019" /> housing side let them make adequate funds available and not be cutting back in the way they have been, in the discriminatory removal of single people from the availability of SDA loans and mortgage subsidies.  We discussed this last week and the Government, with their pet Independents, great Socialists, voted against our Private Members' motion to restore the availability of this subsidy and loan to single people.  Just in case the Minister of State might feel that this has to do with single people only, might I say that the SDA loans scheme is literally on its knees.  To all intents and purposes it has come to a halt in all of the local authorities around the country because of the actions of this administration.  If the Minister of State is serious about maintaining and improving the housing stock, if he is serious about the provision of funds for loans, let him provide the money now, let him give this injection of funds about which the Minister of State spoke earlier to maintain and increase the housing stock which is what this Housing Act of 1969 we are discussing here is all about.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister now to consider the joint income situation of applicants. Again the rules were changed in July last.  There is now in operation a regulation which was defined here by the Minister of State's predecessor, the present Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, in response to questions in this House, when he said that the joint incomes were taken together unless the wife was in a temporary job, but he would not give a definition of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.  I can tell the House and the Minister of State that the SDA loans scheme is no longer operable in most local authorities. Local authorities are not operating the scheme because where will one find a joint income of husband and wife under £7,000?  The situation obtaining in regard to a man about to be married is that his income and that of his fiancee's are taken together.  There are very few couples in permanent jobs whose joint income would be under £7,000.</P>
    <P>We do not need motions of this type, or Bills such as the Housing Finance <Col N="2020" /> Agency one, and the great beating of breast by the Minister of State saying that there is a serious shortage of funding in housing in the country at present and that this measure is designed to give the necessary injection of resources to alleviate the problem.  What we need is reality and some honesty from this administration. What is needed is money, not Bills setting up new bureaucracies.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious about the construction industry and the maintenance of and addition to the housing stock, one would have to look at their record with regard to the building societies. In April or May this year we had to have discussions with the building societies regarding the inflow of funds because they play a major role in the provision of housing finance and are expected this year to provide about £300 million.  They had a difficulty because of competition from the banks and other agencies and their inflow of funds could have been damaged unless there were an increase in their deposit rate.  Conscious of the role of the building societies and the need for funds and recognising at the same time the undue hardship which would be created for mortgage holders without some form of subsidisation, we in Fianna Fáil decided to allow the building societies to increase their deposit rate but to subsidise mortgage holders in their repayments. In his infamous speech on the July budget the Minister for the Environment announced the removal of that mortgage subsidy.</P>
    <P>When we left office on 30 June mortgage holders, because of our subsidisation, were being asked to pay an interest rate of 13.15 per cent; today the mortgage interest rate is 16.25 per cent because of the removal of the subsidy by this administration. This is the Government who talk about the need to tackle inflation and the cost of living generally and who purport to care for people.  They also purport to be concerned about maintaining and increasing the housing stock.</P>
    <P>What has been the role of this Government with regard to encouraging the insurance companies and the banks to involve themselves in the provision of funds for the maintenance and increase <Col N="2021" /> of the housing stock?  All we have had so far is waffle and I look forward to hearing the Minister telling us tomorrow how much money he is getting from the insurance companies and pension funds and how much he will inject into the building industry.</P>
    <P>A very important sector of the housing industry affected by this order is the area of rented accommodation.  Because of the guillotine motion passed earlier today we will not have the opportunity of discussing on Committee Stage the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981 and I very much regret this because Deputy Connolly and I have put down some major amendments on behalf of our party in an effort to improve the Bill and to provide guarantees of security and equity to tenants and landlords.  The Bill, which will be going to the Supreme Court, will not have the benefit of a full and thorough investigation in this House on Committee and Report Stages.  The Supreme Court will be asked to decide on a Bill passed after a Second Stage debate, the other Stages being passed by the Members of Fine Gael and Labour and their pet Independents going through the lobbies.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record exactly what is included in the amendments we envisaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling but would say that the present motion is concerned with the continuance of an order under the Housing Act which is specifically designed for the maintenance of the housing stock. Rented accommodation is very much affected.  The maintenance of the housing stock depends not only on the landlord but also on the tenant who is proud of his flat and is prepared to spend money on its improvement.  The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, makes allowance for the tenant who is prepared to invest in the improvement of his dwelling and to that extent I feel that the discussion on rent is related to the maintenance of the housing stock.  If the <Col N="2022" /> tenant and the landlord are not prepared to maintain and improve a dwelling we get back to the situation where the landlord will let the dwelling deteriorate to the extent that a permission will be needed under the 1969 Housing Act.</P>
      <P>In the encouragement of tenants and landlords to improve their flats a fair rent is very important.  Section 6(2) states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the dwelling, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of dwellings of a similar character to the dwelling and situate in a comparable area.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil feel that is not fair to either the landlord or the tenant, that it will create major social problems and severely damage the housing stock, which is the object of the Housing Act, 1969.</P>
      <P>Our amendment deletes that subsection and replaces it with the following:</P>
      <P>the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the court, would be reasonable and fair, having regard to the respective economic circumstances of the landlord and tenant, and the character and situation of the dwelling.</P>

I brought it to the Deputy's attention that he was digressing, but he explained that what he was saying was relevant to the Act because he was talking about dwellings, the improvement of dwellings, housing stock and incentives given by landlords and tenants.  Therefor, what he was saying was relevant to the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for your ruling.  Without a fair rent, as defined in our amendment, tenants will not be encouraged to take a pride in their property and landlords will not take a pride in their property because there will not be any return for them.  Another Fianna Fáil amendment says that in cases of hardship created by increases in rent State assistance shall be provided.  This package, which unfortunately will not be debated tonight because of the guillotine motion and the disgraceful performance of this administration, will encourage the maintenance and improvement of the housing stock which is central to this motion.</P>
      <P>We are very worried about the delays which will be created by the proposals going before the Supreme Court, because they will not have the benefit of our amendments and discussion in this House.  The District Courts will be clogged with the extra 35,000 tenants in controlled dwellings who will be asking for court decisions on a fair rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our amendments, if accepted, would have set up a fair rents tribunal to mete out justice.  The tribunal would consist of a president, who would be a judge of the Circuit Court, and six other members who were suitably qualified for membership of such a tribunal.  Because of the delays in the District Court as envisaged in the proposed legislation, which will be steamrolled through this House at 10.30 p.m. this evening, the housing stock will be damaged and injustice will be imposed on both tenant and landlord.  I appeal to the Minister of State and his Minister to take an opportunity in the Seanad to accept our amendment and to set up the Fair Rents Tribunal because it will improve the legislation and make it workable.  The Minister of State <Col N="2024" /> and his Minister will not have any difficulty in accepting this amendment because in the election manifestos &mdash; and I am sure if there two pet Independents were asked they would agree also &mdash; the Coalition parties committed themselves to setting up a Fair Rents Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael not only said it in their manifesto but last May they came to this House with a Private Members' motion and proposed setting up a fair rents tribunal and five other items which together would cost £45 million, and that was a conservative estimate.  One proposal made by the then Deputy Keating was to give £35 million in grants to landlords to improve their dwellings and to maintain the housing stock, but we have not heard very much about that since, nor about the fair rents tribunal.</P>
    <P>We have a series of amendments down for discussion which will improve the housing stock, which will help to improve this Bill and which will be fair to both landlord and tenant.  They will also remove from the landlords and tenants the undue hardship and expense created by going to the District Court for assessment of rent.  I know we will not have an opportunity to discuss these amendments tonight because of the guillotine motion, but I ask the Minister of State and his Minister, two reasonable men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that in the Seanad the Government accept the Fianna Fáil proposal to set up a Fair Rents Tribunal.  The formation of the tribunal could be a president, being a Circuit Court judge and six members suitably <Col N="2025" /> qualified for membership because of their knowledge or experience.  In this way the administration will have an opportunity to improve the housing stock, as is envisaged in this motion.  We do not need new levels of bureaucracy in the Bill which is for discussion tomorrow. The motion envisages not only the maintenance of the housing stock but an increase in it.  The former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment said that the Housing Finance Agency Bill is urgently required to meet a desperate social need but the desperate social need is an increase in the housing stock and the maintenance of the existing stock.  I should like to know that happened to the £35 million that Deputy Keating, now Minister of State at the Department of Education, promised would be made available to improve rented housing stock accommodation. That promise was made last May but I do not see it in the Housing Finance Agency Bill, in the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill or in the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1981.  Of course that Minister of State is a marvellous man and he is good at making speeches.  In fact he has been known to make three on the one night in different parts of the country, not only bi-location but tri-location.  He made the commitment in May that as soon as Fine Gael were elected to Government they would make £35 million available to landlords to improve their rented accommodation. That was one of six points he made in relation to this problem.  The Minister of State also said, in relation to the maintenance of housing stock in rented accommodation, that he would provide £1,000 tax credit for tenants of rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that £1,000 was made available it would go a long way to encourage tenants to improve their properties, as is envisaged in the order under discussion up to 1984. That Minister of State made other commitments on behalf of his party, the key one being that the courts were not a suitable vehicle for deciding agreements on rent or other details of tenancies between a landlord and a tenant.  On the <Col N="2026" /> night in question in May that Deputy, backed by other Fine Gael Members and Deputy Barry Desmond, who contributed to the debate on behalf of the Labour Party, committed themselves to the setting up of a fair rents tribunal. We are providing the Government with an opportunity to set up such a tribunal because we realise it is vital and that the district courts will grind to a halt with the weight of work.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House must be judged in the context of decisions made by the Government since they came to power with regard to the maintenance of and the addition to the housing stock. What is their record?  I should like to remind the House of their decisions. They have debarred single people, who represent 22 per cent of all first time house buyers, from access to local authority loans and they removed single people from eligibility to the housing mortgage subsidy of £3,000.  Against that background the Government propose tomorrow setting up another agency increasing the bureaucracy.  This is being done by an administration that has spoken out against the public service, whose Ministers and spokesmen daily tell us about the expense of the public service and the drag it is on the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We do not need a Housing Finance Agency, we need an injection of funds. I accept the statement of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach who said that there was a serious shortage of funding for housing and what was required was an injection of resources to alleviate the problem.  A Housing Finance Agency is not necessary to do that; we need funds from the Government. If the Government want to raise those funds from the private sector they can do so under legislation dealing with the Office of Public Works.  There is no need for a further layer of bureaucracy that will further exacerbate an already difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The SDA loans scheme is a disgrace to this administration.  It has been allowed to grind to a halt and the Government are aware of that.  They are using the setting up of the Housing Finance <Col N="2027" /> Agency as a white-washing operation to give an impression of action even though action is not being taken.  The Minister of State should come clean on this issue and stand by even the odd promise that was made in the election manifesto put to the people earlier this year.  A fair rents tribunal was promised but the Government are going back on that.  A promise of £35 million for the improvement of the housing stock of landlords but there is not hide or hair of it in any of the measures before us.  Tenants in rented accommodation were promised £1,000 tax credit to encourage them to improve their housing stock but there is not sign of it.  A promise was made, even in the Gaiety Theatre document, that the mortgage subsidy scheme would be maintained at its present level but within three weeks of taking office, in the July budget, that subsidy was removed from 22 per cent of those who had benefited from it.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of the speeches by the Taoiseach and his Government against discrimination, against women in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the women who want to buy houses cannot do so because of the discriminatory regulation brought in by the Government. A lady I know bought a house but had not signed for it before going on holidays in the middle of July.  When she returned she learned that the Minister for the Environment on 23 July removed her eligibility to the mortgage subsidy.  Her calculations on whether she could purchase that house were thrown to the wind because of that discriminatory decision. It is a bit sick &mdash; a crude expression but a true one &mdash; for the Taoiseach to put himself forward when addressing public audiences as being the leader of a liberal administration that is against discrimination of all forms.  Last week in the course of Private Members' Business we asked him to reintroduce mortgage subsidies for single people, but he went through the lobby and voted against our <Col N="2028" /> motion.  He was accompanied by his colleagues in the Labour Party and his two pet Independents, the two great socialists of our time and many another time.  It is, I suggest, indecent of the Taoiseach to talk of being against discrimination when at the same time, through his Ministers, he introduces regulations which are discriminatory in their nature.</P>
      <P>These are regulations which remove eligibility for SDA loans and for mortgage subsidies from, according to the figure given by the Minister for the Environment on 23 July, 22 per cent of house purchasers.  How can we have any respect for a Government who are prepared to renege on their promises to this extent and who are prepared to engage in such double talk?  How can the electorate ever be expected to believe election promises from Fine Gael or Labour at any future election time?  One of their promises was a fair rents tribunal.  Instead of bringing before us the Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order and asking for the Act to be continued to 1984 it would have been more credible for the Minister of State to have asked us to agree to a one-year continuation.  He has told us that he intends to review the operation of this Act in its entirety but this promise is as hollow as the promise of a review he gave last week when speaking on the Committee Stage of the Rent Restrictions Bill.  He said then that he was reviewing the whole area of rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Whitegate Oil Refinery, the Minister for Energy, not having the guts to answer the question put to him relied on his Minister of State to answer and he told us that the Government had asked for a consultancy to be set up to inquire into that matter.  The point is that all of these promises of reviews and so on represent the hallmark of this administration.  The attitude is not to make any decision but to go outside the House and make liberal speeches and then to act as I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to housing, the Government have damaged any possibility of the maintenance and improvement of the housing stock.  We have had nothing but waffle about the need for an injection of <Col N="2029" /> resources to alleviate the problem.  The Housing Finance Agency Bill is merely a skeleton in terms of legislation.  All it does is to set up a new layer of bureaucracy. In fairness, Fine Gael in their preelection document referred to the setting up of a housing finance agency and there was reference also to the availability of loans.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling but would make the point that the key to the Housing Act, 1969 is the maintenance of and the increasing of the housing stock.  To add to the housing stock it is necessary to have available an efficient loan structure but to all intents and purposes the Government have scrapped the only national housing finance agency available.  That was the SDA loans scheme operated by the local authorities.  I say this because of the discrimination against single people in this regard and also because of the conditions in respect of income limits.</P>

      <P>The Government have removed the only State agency that was available for the funding of local authority loans and, consequently, for the increasing of the housing stock.  The suggestion that repayments on loans would be by way of a fixed percentage of income for the life time of the loan was put in proper perspective in an excellent review undertaken by an eminent financial journalist of the <i>Irish Independent</i> group.  At from 17 to 20 per cent of income this journalist calculated that for a £20,000 loan for a 25-year period the <Col N="2030" /> repayments would amount to £140,000. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach told us earlier that the measure before us is designed to give the necessary injection of resources to alleviate the problems involved.  How can the figure I have quoted be tied in with that statement?  The Minister was trying to justify the disgraceful guillotine motion that the Government, with the help of their two pet socialist Independents, imposed on us earlier.  I ask the Minister of State to come clean in regard to housing.  The Government should take steps to remove the discrimination against single people with regard to loans.</P>

      <P>The question of reconstruction grants is a very important element in this area because section 5 of the 1969 Act provides that housing authorities may require a house to be made fit for human habitation.  As an encouragement to making finance available for housing the Government promised a £35 million grant for landlords providing rented accommodation.  They also promised a home improvement grant.  There were no ifs, buts, wherefores or anything else.  They promised that a grant of £1,000 would be made available for home improvement and energy conservation purposes.  What did we see?  We did not see the thoroughbred that was promised but some kind of greyhound pup that would not run at a flapper meeting.  We saw a grant of £600 introduced. It was so conditioned that the number of eligible applicants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The district courts which are over-loaded, over-worked and totally inappropriate vehicles to be used for decisions on rents are to do this instead of the fair rents tribunal.  After due consideration we decided to set up such a tribunal and set out what we had in mind as part of our amendments.  This will be rushed through the House.  The feet of Fine Gael, who committed themselves to this, Labour, who also committed themselves to it, and the two pet Independents will carry this through.

The dead hand of the Coalition is on the construction industry to the extent that we have a disgraceful number of construction workers unemployed, people who comprise a large percentage of the overall unemployment rate of 133,000.  We do not need continuance motions with regard to the demolition of houses.  What we need is constructive proposals to inject finance into this starved industry both in the new house sector, in the improvement sector and in the general construction sector.  By that I mean roads, sewerage and water schemes.  The Minister of State should give the same money, allowing for the high rate of inflation, as we gave last year and then we will praise him.</P>

I regret having to raise the matter in this way, but the evasiveness of the Minister in replying to my question in the House on 28 October leaves me with no other choice.  On that occasion I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for all the developments planned and accepted by his Department for the development of telecommunication services at Portlaoise, County Laois, and the timescale for the proposals.  The Minister replied that the main developments proposed are new buildings for exchanging for staff headquarters, the provision of additional exchanges in some circuits, the strengthening of the local cabling network, other developments and projects and that all of these projects will be completed in 1983-84.</P>
      <P>In that reply, the Minister was outlining and confirming the implementation of his predecessor in Government, Deputy Reynolds, in relation to the development of Portlaoise as a major centre for telecommunication development. All the developments referred to by the Minister were under way when the present Government came into power and the present Minister came into office. The Minister's reply is worthy of note, not for what he said but for what he did not say.  Supplementary questions from Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Killilea and myself failed to get an honest and straightforward reply to the question of the proposed new training school, which was an essential part of the new project in Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>I want to bring to the Minister's notice a statement made by the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, when announcing the new development complex for Portlaoise. This statement was made on Friday, 6 March 1980 and I will quote a small extract from it:</P>
      <P>A repair and maintenance garage for the Department's motor vehicles in the Portlaoise area is also planned for this site.  Both of these projects are scheduled for completion during 1982-83.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to imply in the House on the last occasion that no decision was made by the previous Government in relation to a training school for Portlaoise.  Is the Minister questioning the credibility of the anouncement made <Col N="2041" /> by Deputy Reynolds on this project?  If he is, he is, in fact, questioning the credibility of his own civil servants who prepared that aspect of the Minister's speech.  Whatever the contents of the letter and whatever the contents of the Minister's reply, I assure him tonight that the people of Portlaoise, and of Laois in general, are disturbed by rumours emanating, presumably, from the Minister's Department, that this project is to be abandoned.  It was an essential part of the proposed telecommunication development for Portlaoise, an essential part of the last Government's programme to provide employment in Portlaoise, an area which is in urgent need of development and employment.  I trust that the Minister will confirm tonight that this project will go ahead.  If a decision to abandon this project has been made, it is regrettable.  I ask the Minister again if he is going ahead with the decision to provide the telecommunication training school at Portlaoise?</P>

Portlaoise will not be discriminated against but will receive the same, if not more, considered attention than that received from the previous administration.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Deputy's remarks, on 21 October last Deputy Hyland had a question for oral answer.  He elected to take a written reply.  This was on the matter of the training school in Portlaoise. Between 21 October and last week he had ample time to ask a question arising out of the reply received on 21 October but failed to do so.  He showed no interest whatsoever in the training school between 21 October and now.</P>

      <P>All local authorities have been requested to undertake local environment campaigns with emphasis on organising local voluntary effort to remove eyesores and to improve surroundings generally.  I made a special environment award to Wexford on 23 November as the county in which the best response to this request was made in the current year.</P>
      <P>Powers to deal with waste disposal in various forms are available to local authorities under sanitary, planning and water pollution legislation and they are urged to make full use of such powers to protect the environment.  The European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 make further provision for the planning and organisation of waste disposal operations and provide substantial penalties for offences involving the incorrect disposal of waste.</P>
      <P>I intend to proceed as soon as possible with the Litter Bill under which local authorities will be required to take appropriate measures for preventing litter and for dealing with it, and will have greatly strengthened powers to enable them to carry out that responsibility.</P>

      <P>Traffic and parking by-laws for County Laois, which would enable controls to be applied in several towns, including the town of Mountmellick, <Col N="1848" /> were submitted by the Garda Commissioner for my consent on 23 September 1981.  The by-laws have been examined in my Department and clarification has been sought from the commissioner on a number of aspects.  I understand that the Garda Commissioner received the agreement of the town commissioners to the by-laws and I have not received any representations from the town commissioners or from local traders since the submission of the by-laws for my consent. It is open to the town commissioners or any person to make representations to me regarding the by-laws.  The implementation of the by-laws if and when I consent to them would be a matter for the Garda.  Regarding a by-pass for Mountmellick, this is a matter for Laois County Council in the first instance and I have received no proposals from them for the construction of such a facility.</P>

      <P>As the time lag between the receipt of an application under the new scheme of house improvement grants and inspection varies from case to case it is not possible to indicate how long it will take to arrange an inspection in any particular case.  This scheme was introduced on 14 October 1981, and it is too early as yet to give a reliable indication as to the average time lag involved.  However, I do not anticipate any undue delay in arranging inspections under this scheme but the time taken will, of course, be affected by the level of activity under the scheme and the need to arrange inspectors' itineraries on an economic basis.</P>

      <P>For the levels of radiation which might reasonably be expected here, the mere fact of staying indoors, in itself, provides a significant protection and this protection factor can be very substantially increased by carrying out simple protective measures.

      <P>The arrangements for detecting, measuring and predicting radio-activity and for warning and advising the public in relation to it are tested annually by means of the Civil Defence National Fallout Exercise the most recent of which &mdash; Network '81 &mdash; took place on Sunday, 29 November.</P>

The position is that the husband of the person concerned receives a retirement pension which incorporates an adult dependant allowance in respect of her.  The rate of this allowance is slightly higher than the rate of old age pension awarded and has continued in payment as it is more favourable.  Concurrent payment of the two is precluded by the overlapping benefits regulations.</P>

      <P>I understand that title to the original manuscript of <i>The Annals of Innisfallen</i> is vested in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in whose possession it has been for over 200 years.  It would appear therefore that the only way of securing the return of the manuscript to this country would be by purchase.  However, I have no reason to think that the Bodleian Library would be willing to sell it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to be aware that there are some 30 manuscript copies of this work in various libraries.  The National Library of Ireland hold three copies by different scribes, as well as a microfilm of the original.  A facsimile was published by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in 1951.</P>
