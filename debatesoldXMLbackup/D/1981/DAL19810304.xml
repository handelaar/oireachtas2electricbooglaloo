    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on the budget the last day I mentioned that the creation of jobs <Col N="721" /> and the safeguarding of existing jobs was one of the principle strategies of the budget.  I referred to the necessity for an adequate infrastructure so as to reduce the cost and sharpen the competiteveness of our goods on export markets.  I welcomed the £1,732.6 million outlined in the investment plan with particular reference to £220 million for telecommunications and £90 million for transport.  Top class facilities and structures must augment the opportunities presented by world economic activity and recovery.</P>
    <P>In industrial relations areas of dispute must be sorted out promptly and the effects of a breakdown on the community must be solemnly impressed on the protagonists involved in the dispute.  Group, union, association or employer solidarity is laudable but we must recognise that we are an integral part of a greater community in industrial relations matters.  The Irish proverb &mdash; i scáth a gcéile a mhaireann na ndaoine &mdash; is all the more apt now by virtue of our mutual interdependance at national and international level. We all know the impact which industrial disputes have in relation to safeguarding and creating jobs.  I accept the valuable contributions made by the social partners in employment opportunities and social progress, but the time has come when leaders in our community and individual workers must bind together, identify the troublemakers and take steps accordingly.</P>
    <P>The other objectives in the budget are to improve living standards for the less well-off, to provide further relief for PAYE taxpayers and to help the farming community, who have been going through a difficult time.  The package of £35 million for the farming community, by virtue of the suspension of the disease levy, full rates relief being extended to holdings under £50 valuation and the 50 per cent relief for valuations in the £50 to £70 bracket, are worthy of mention and indicate the concern of the Government. There is also a £60 million concession to PAYE taxpayers and a widening of the 35 per cent band.  Now 37,000 people have been taken out of the tax net.  The increases of 25 per cent and 20 per cent in social welfare benefits are welcomed. <Col N="722" /> I am also pleased to note that the free telephone rental scheme has now been extended to holders of UK pensions. Many Deputies including myself have been lobbying for this over the years.</P>
    <P>This budget affords a considerable amount of money to housing, schools and hospitals and it is gratifying to see in Bray the commencement of a £2 million second level school, which is badly needed. Road grants of £1.657 million have come to the county recently, an increase of 42 per cent on the previous year.  Also £1.56 million has been made available to Wicklow Urban Council in loan facilities for the commencement of 58 local authority houses in that town.  I cannot understand why one of the other Wicklow Deputies cribbed last Thursday about the non-availability of this money when the notice had already gone out to the council.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the necessary water filtration system for Arklow is being financed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second level school in Bray, the record shows that when the National Coalition Government were in power they planned this school for 1986 but when the present Minister for Education came to office he took heed of the representations made by community leaders and individuals who knew the acute difficulties that would arise in school places at second level and he took steps accordingly.  The news is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The central and crucial failure of the Government is their inability to devise and implement an incomes policy.  They are unable to get agreement from the social partners to a realistic incomes policy because they have no medium-term plan for the economy. They are not able to indicate to the social partners what could be achieved in the future if restraint is practised at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government ask other people to plan.  For example, they ask farmers to have a plan for their farm in order to qualify for the farm modernisation scheme.  However, the Government have no plan for the economy or for public finances over which they have direct control.  Hence they can offer no genuine <Col N="723" /> confidence of gains in the future in return for restraint at present by the trade union movement and others seeking increases in incomes.  As a result the Government stagger from one expedient to the next in their relations with the trade union movement.  The failure to achieve a policy which would bring the level of wage and salary increases here down to the level obtaining in other EMS countries is at the root of all our economic problems.</P>
    <P>It is not oil which is the main reason for our high inflation rate.  There are many other countries, such as Luxembourg, which import 100 per cent of their energy whereas we import only 80 per cent.  Yet Luxembourg has an inflation rate which is one-third of ours.  We cannot blame increases in oil for our inflation rate.  The cause of our inflation is to be found in our own country, in the Government's failure to exercise the political leadership necessary to set a plan before the people and get agreement from them and particularly the social partners for a realistic incomes policy which would bring income increases in nominal terms down to what is realistic, based on increased production.</P>
    <P>Inflation is responsible for all our major economic problems and I will identify four main economic problems which can be traced to the fact that we have an inflation rate which is twice or three times the average inflation rate obtaining in other EMS countries with whose currencies we are linked.  First of all, despite the best efforts of the IDA, we are losing thousands of jobs each year in older, well-established industries simply because those industries cannot compete with the products of other countries whose rate of increase in costs is less than ours.  In other words, unemployment is caused by our high inflation rate.  Secondly, the drastic 50 per cent drop in income and living standards of farmers is traceable to our high inflation rate because the costs which farmers must pay for what they need to produce the goods is going up at twice or three times the rate of the prices they receive for what they produce from the EEC.  Thirdly, the high interest rates which are crippling <Col N="724" /> business at present and the credit restrictions recently introduced by the Central Bank are due to the high inflation rate and are making investment difficult.  We can only keep parity within the EMS and keep our currency on a par with other currencies in the system by using tight monetary policy as a means of compensating for our failure to exercise any real control in the area of increases in nominal income.  Those seeking funds to invest are being asked to pay the costs of the Government's failure to get a realistic incomes policy.  They are being asked to bear the entire burden of maintaining the parity of our currency against others. Fourthly, the fact that our public finances are completely out of control and that the Government are not able to manage their financial affairs is directly attributable to our high rate of inflation.  These have been due to high increases in public sector pay.  So called special pay increases are to blame for the fact that we have had substantial current budget deficits in the last few years and have had dramatic increased in our foreign debt.  These are attributable to the Government's failure to hold any sane line as far as public sector pay is concerned.  That is an extension of the Government's failure in general to get control of inflation in the economy.</P>
    <P>Our four main economic problems &mdash; growing unemployment, agricultural depression, high interest rates and the chronic weakness of our public finances &mdash; are due to our high inflation rate which, in turn, is chiefly caused by the Government's failure to exercise the leadership necessary to achieve a sensible incomes policy related to our economic position.  The result has been diminished economic independence.  It is ironic that this country, which was founded on a philosophy of sinn féin, of self-reliance, is now more so than practically any other country in Europe economically dependent because of our failure to manage our finances and achieve an incomes policy. We owe more abroad than any other country in Europe.  We are living further beyond our means than any other country and this as a country founded on the philosophy of self-reliance.  It is ironic <Col N="725" /> that the Government, who include economic self-reliance among their aims and which is included on the membership card issued to all members, are the party responsible for doing more to make us economically dependent on foreign bankers than any other party who ever held office.  The more we owe to foreign banks the more we must tailor our policies to the needs and demands of the foreign banks who are lending us money. The more we owe the more interest we must pay and the less will be left over for independent initiatives by the Government, whether job creation or whatever in the future.</P>
    <P>At present almost three-quarters of the amount collected by the Government in PAYE has to go directly towards servicing the national debt.  That means we do not have the economic freedom to take initiatives because so much of the Government's revenue next year and the year after is already committed to paying off the debts of the past.  We have a debt which is equivalent to 106 per cent of everything we produce in an entire year.</P>
    <P>Whether they be public servants or private individuals, farmers, industrialists or workers, the Government owe 106 per cent of everything everyone produces in this country in a year.  One half of that national debt will have to be repaid within the next five years.  That is the extent to which our economic freedom has been circumscribed by the failures of past economic policies.  Failures in past economic policies and, in particular, failure in the area of control of public expenditure, are due to our failure to get an incomes policy and to have a realistic approach to increases in wages and salaries within the public sector and in the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in the next five years one half of our national debt will have to be repaid.  People who are working at the moment should not think that does not matter to them.  The Government's ability to provide pensions in the future for the workers of today, who are enjoying some of these artificial increases in salary which are not related to true increases in production &mdash; as a result of the Government having had budget deficits and substantial <Col N="726" /> increases in debt &mdash; is being diminished by feckless financial policies.</P>
    <P>The Government's ability, by the use of incentives and grants and other means, to provide the conditions in which jobs can be created for the young people in our primary and secondary schools who will be looking for jobs in the next ten to 15 years is being drastically circumscribed by the huge debts which are being incurred at present simply because the Government have no policy on inflation and on incomes and, as a result, are living far beyond their means.  Perhaps I should illustrate what I am saying about the seriousness of the situation with which we are faced by quoting some figures.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to increases in nominal incomes because very often they do not mean much of an increase in actual spending power because inflation goes up to compensate for increases achieved in incomes.  It is like a dog trying to catch his tail.  No matter how fast he goes, he never quite catches it.  In the past two years alone nominal paper incomes went up in Luxembourg by 14 per cent; in the Netherlands by 11 per cent; in France by 27 per cent; in Germany by 12.3 per cent; in Belgium by 13 per cent; and in Ireland by 38 per cent.  There is only one country in the EMS which had a faster increase in nominal incomes in those two years than we had and that is Italy which achieved the dubious distinction of having an increase of 40 per cent.  I stress that I am referring to nominal paper incomes.  With all due respect, I do not think we would wish to emulate Italy in that matter.</P>
    <P>The Government were solemnly warned on this subject by the National Economic and Social Council, who were set up specifically to give warnings on this type of issue.  In their report published in November of last year, I think, on the economic situation between now and 1983, the NESC said that between 1975 and 1979 the increase in Irish unit wage costs in national currency terms was substantially higher than in any of the principal competitive countries which together account for 75 per cent of Irish trade except Italy and the United <Col N="727" /> Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Government failed to achieve an incomes policy and to create a sense of confidence in the future in which workers and others who are now demanding increases in incomes would be prepared to say: &ldquo;No, we will not seek more than we believe the country can afford this year because we know the economy is being sufficiently well-managed that, if we wait until next year or the year after, that money will not be wasted on some one else but will be there to be enjoyed in the future by ourselves and our children whether it be in the form of pensions or jobs for our children.&rdquo;  Because the Government are unable to create this sense of confidence in the future, they are unable to get the restraint necessary. They are unable to create a sense of confidence in the future because they have no confidence in the future themselves.  They have shown repeatedly an inability to make up their minds about any matter and stick to the decision they have made.</P>
    <P>I will give two classic examples of the Government's indecision and inability to give leadership.  First we had the spectacle of the Taoiseach's broadcast in January 1980.  He went on television to tell us that we must tighten our belts.  Most people responded to that broadcast and believed the Government and particularly the Taoiseach meant what they said and intended to exercise restraint on public spending in a constructive way in order to provide a secure future for our people.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Almost within a month that broadcast was followed by a highly inflationary and extravagant budget.  It was followed later in the year by Government intervention in the national understanding discussions, not in the interest of obtaining restraint, but in order to persuade the employers to pay more than they felt they or the economy could afford.  Far from the Government intervening with a view to getting restraint and getting inflation under control, after the Taoiseach's broadcast the two major initiatives by the Government, the budget and their intervention in the national understanding discussions, went <Col N="728" /> precisely in the opposite direction to the oratory of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That undermines public confidence in the meaning of words uttered by politicians.  Some people may say politicians and their words do not really matter to the economy.  I believe they do.  There is no other body to give economic leadership apart from the political leaders.  If the political leaders seem to be unable to stick by their words, the public feel they are not getting the leadership they require.</P>
    <P>Consistently the Government got their sums wrong about increases in the cost of the public sector.  I said already that I believe the failure to achieve an incomes policy is at the root of the problems we are facing in our public finances at the moment.  I shall illustrate this.  Taking the years 1978 to 1980 combined, the total amount by which the Government under-estimated in their budgets the actual increases which occurred in public sector pay was £213 million.  That is a lot of money to get wrong.</P>
    <P>The share of the total amount of Government spending which is now being absorbed, not in services for the public but in paying people who are keeping the Government's machine going, has gone up from just over 30 per cent of total Government expenditure in 1970 to almost 40 per cent in 1980.  On present trends, by 1990 half of total Government spending will be absorbed solely in pay and pensions.</P>
    <P>The most alarming feature of this entire exercise is the fact that (1) it is unplanned &mdash; I have already mentioned the £200 million excess increases which occurred in the past three years over what the Government had planned &mdash; and (2) the extent to which these increases are outside the national understanding.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the total increase in the public sector pay bill amounted to approximately £300 million.  Of that, £151 million was due to the national wage agreement.  No one would object to the Government paying the terms of the national wage agreement, even though beforehand it was agreed it was excessive.  However, a further £150 million of the <Col N="729" /> increase in the cost of public sector pay in 1980 was due to special pay increases over and above the national understanding terms.  As much extra money was due to special or anomaly pay increases as to the basic increases under the national understanding.  This was in a year when practically no other employer competing to sell his goods &mdash; it was different for the oil companies who have a captive market, who can dictate any price they like and consequently can pay any price they like for labour &mdash; was able to meet the basic terms of the national understanding, let alone to give special pay increases.</P>
    <P>Lest it be thought that all these special pay increases went to the civil service, whom everybody likes to give out to from time to time, only 12 per cent went to the civil service.  A figure of £97 million went solely to employees in the health services. It is people in subsidiary bodies not under the direct control of the Government who have been receiving the largest proportion of special pay increases.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that Government finances here are more out of control than in any other country in Europe, and I will illustrate that with some figures.  The budget deficit, the figure by which the Government spent more on current items than they took in in 1980, was 6½ per cent of all money spent.  In Luxembourg they had a budget surplus of 6 per cent.  In France they had a budget deficit of only 1 per cent, in Belgium, 2½ per cent, and in the UK, a country which everybody likes to say is very badly managed, the budget deficit was only half of 1 per cent. This illustrates the extent to which, in comparable international terms, our finances are being mismanaged.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who talk blithely about withdrawing from the EEC, the EEC being a bad deal, do not realise how much the Government rely for their day-to-day expenses on money they get from the EEC.  Ten per cent of every £1 spent by the Government comes from the EEC.  If we were not members of the EEC our budget deficit would be approximately twice its present level.  In 1974 only 4.6 per cent of the amount being spent by the Government here came from the EEC.  This means that the Government <Col N="730" /> are more reliant on the EEC than it is healthy for us to be.</P>
    <P>What is extremely worrying is the extent to which in the last two or three years we have come to rely more and more on borrowing money abroad rather than at home to finance Government deficits.  In 1977, 37 per cent of all public sector borrowing was financed by borrowing abroad.  In 1980, 60 per cent, almost twice as much, of public sector borrowing was in the form of foreign loans.  This has two consequences which should be identified.  If the Government are borrowing at home it does not increase the total money supply in the economy, because it is getting money in the form of loans from one sector and rather than have savers spending the money themselves the Government spend it for them.  Therefore the total amount of money in the economy is not being increased and therefore currency inflation is not being increased.</P>
    <P>However, when the Government borrow abroad they bring in new additional money to the economy, and more cash is chasing the same amount of goods; whereas as a result of domestic Government borrowing the same amount of cash is chasing the same amount of goods, the only difference being that the Government are spending the money rather than somebody else.  By foreign borrowing the Government are helping to fuel the fire of inflation and adding to other failures in inflation control.  Secondly, and particularly important, the Government are creating a situation in which we are not any longer in control of the rate at which our own currency is bought and sold.</P>
    <P>As a result of excessive reliance on foreign borrowing by the present Government, if we were to decide it might be in our interest to devalue our currency &mdash; I do not believe it is, but it is an option that should be open to us &mdash; we are restricting our freedom to do so.  If we borrow abroad on the scale we are now engaged in, we are closing off that option because any attempt to devalue while we owe substantial money abroad will mean we will have to repay more money than we borrowed because those who have lent us money abroad will demand repayment <Col N="731" /> in their currencies rather than in ours; if we owe them £100 and we devalue our currency by 10 per cent we will have to pay our creditors £110.  As a result, a combination of high inflation on the one hand, which is pushing us towards devaluation, and high foreign borrowing, which is making devaluation impossible, is forcing us into a corner and potentially forcing us over the precipice.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government realise how serious is the situation into which they have got the country.  I do not believe the Government realise how much the irresponsible management of our finances is making the achievement of a united Ireland impossible.  Our national debt per head of the population in the Twenty-six Counties is almost six times that of the national debt per head of population in Northern Ireland.  If we are to have a united Ireland are we going to ask them to take over our debts?  Is an economy that owes six times as much as their economy per head of population to foreign and domestic creditors going to be an economically attractive promised land for the people of Northern Ireland who would want to join us and take a share of our debts?  I believe we cannot have a united Ireland until we get our finances under control.  Only then will we have the economic viability to go forward and offer those people an attractive and economic proposition to make up for whatever other sacrifices of a political or constitutional nature they may have to make.  At the moment we have nothing to offer.  The economy of the Twenty-six Counties has not produced sufficient jobs in the past ten years to provide for its young people.  Unless we can do much better in the management of our economy we will not have anything to offer the people whom we want to join us in a common endeavour on this island.</P>
    <P>Inflation is at the root of our problems. We cannot provide jobs for young people unless we get inflation under control.  We should think in terms of tasks not problems: the solving of problems inspires very few people but the fulfilling of a task can inspire the public to do something they would not want to do otherwise. <Col N="732" /> Our greatest task is to provide jobs for our young people but we will not be able to do that unless we get inflation under control on the basis of a sensible incomes policy.</P>
    <P>Our past performance with regard to the creation of jobs is not good enough. For instance, our GNP has grown by 15 per cent in real terms.  In the same period the number of people employed has increased by only 2 per cent.  All the increases in the wealth of the country have gone to a smaller number of people who are employed and the rest have been left outside.  In the meantime the number of people depending on the few employed has almost doubled proportionately.  This is something people may not realise.  The number of children and old people depending on those at work has almost doubled in the past 20 years. Yet, during that period we have not created enough jobs in any one year which all the independent commentators tell us we will have to create every year for the next ten years if we are to provide jobs for our young people.  In this connection we are talking about children now in our schools.  It is not airy-fairy talk about children who may be born in the future. All of the young people for whom we will have to provide jobs in the next 20 years are alive today.  They can be counted, they are in our schools.  Yet we have not in any year created enough jobs.  That is the seriousness of the task facing us.</P>
    <P>I shall illustrate the point I am making by referring to statistics.  Mr. Kieran Kennedy and Mr. Foley carried out a study that was published by the ESRI in 1978 and they showed that to create full employment by 1986 we would have to create jobs in manufacturing at a net rate of increase of 10,000 jobs a year.  In the period 1953-76 we created jobs at the rate of only 1,500 per year.  In 1980 there was an increase of approximately 5,000 in manufacturing but at no time have we come even half-way towards achieving the rate of increase in manufacturing employment which has been independently identified as necessary to provide jobs for our people.  We will not do it until we make our country competitive, by getting our inflation rate down to that <Col N="733" /> of the other EMS countries.  No matter how much the IDA spend, all of their good work is and will be negated by job losses in existing industry.  This is happening because our inflation rate is too high.  We cannot solve our employment problem until we do something about our inflation rate.  We should realise the future consequences for this country of present trends of failure to provide employment for young people.  In this connection I would identify some major consequences of likely trends in unemployment.</P>
    <P>First, there will be a much more severe incidence of family poverty.  It has been identified that there is a close correlation between severe deprivation and long-term unemployment.  Secondly, we will have a much higher level of taxation to support a greater number of people out of work.  This level of taxation will be even higher than what we know we will have to bear as a result of having to pay our existing debts.  Thirdly, innovation which is essential to economic progress will become all the more difficult because trade unions naturally will resist any change in the manufacturing sector that might jeopardise jobs.  They will be totally concerned with protecting existing jobs because they know that if people lose jobs there will be nothing for them. Innovation which requires a buoyant economy, which requires a situation to exist that if a person leaves a job he knows he will get a job elsewhere, will be stifled by a higher rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The fourth major consequence is that there will be political tension between the few in employment and the many unemployed.  This will become more acute and will become something that could destabilise our entire political system.  Prolonged experience of unemployment will destroy self-confidence and the self-discipline of a large portion of the population and will sap our entire national morale.  Finally, quite possibly we will face the prospect of a dramatic increase in emigration.</P>
    <P>These are the prospects that are staring us in the face but the Government do not have a policy to meet them.  They are staggering from one expedient to <Col N="734" /> another.  They have no idea where they are going.  They have abandoned the feeble efforts that were made by the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue.  He did not produce economic plans but rather produced papers that discussed options and discussed what the Government proposed to do in the following year, but even those feeble efforts have been abandoned by this Government. There is no plan for the future in the face of an extremely difficult situation.  If any household saw that it had as severe a problem in its family budgeting as this State has, it would take far more effective measures to tackle the problem than have this elected Government.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the problem we face is basically a political one.  Only politicians have the mandate to get people to look to their future and to see that the present irresponsible trends in our economy are brought to an end.  The only sensible purpose the Government have is their anxiety to win the next election. Does anybody bother to ask what Fianna Fáil would do with power if they got it after the next election?  Do they have an idea what they would do for the next five years if they were re-elected?  They have no idea what they would do if they were re-elected after the next election.  I believe if they are re-elected after the next election they will be even worse than they are at the moment because now they have some sense of purpose, that of winning the next election.  If they were to win the next election that meagre sense of direction would be gone and they would not have a unified aim.</P>
    <P>I would like to say what I believe must be done and what my Party, if given the opportunity to do so, would do to deal with the very serious problems we face. I believe we must have a five year economic plan.  If I were to direct any criticism at the National Coalition Government it would be that they did not have an economic plan.  That is the most serious mistake that was made because the National Coalition were not able to offer a clear direction to the people in regard to where they were going and where the sacrifices which were being made were <Col N="735" /> leading in terms of improvements.</P>
    <P>The next Fine Gael Government will have to have an economic plan setting out over a five year period what can be achieved as a result of measures taken this year.  That plan must have three aims. The first aim must be to reassert our economic independence by reducing our dependence on foreign debt and over a clearly defined period eliminating our current budget deficit.  The NESC have recommended that the Government should set a three year target for the elimination of the budget deficit.  I believe that would be too severe.  I feel the aim should be to eliminate the deficit over a five year period.</P>
    <P>I also believe we must eliminate our net foreign debt, that is the extent to which the amount we owe abroad exceeds our external reserves.  In 1977 our net foreign debt was only £170 million, in 1980 it was £1,600 million and it is estimated that at the end of 1981 our net foreign debt could rise to somewhere in the region of £2,250 million as against £170 million in 1977.</P>
    <P>The second aim of that plan must be to bring our rate of inflation down to below the average rate of inflation in the other EMS countries.  The third aim must be to double the rate of growth in manufacturing employment because only by doing that can we obtain sufficient jobs for the young people we know will be looking for them.</P>
    <P>How does one achieve an incomes policy?  The first requirement is for the Government to set an example in respect of pay within the public service.  There is one clear statement which the Government must make.  I refer to the reservations entered by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the paper, &ldquo;Economic and Social Policy 1980 to 1983, Aims and Recommendations&rdquo;.  That paper said that the Government should say, in certain circumstances, that they are not able to pay any more.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions said that they rejected the suggestion that pay increases in the public sector should be based on the Government's capacity to pay.  One could swear that the Government were paying the <Col N="736" /> money out of their own pockets.  They are collecting that money from the taxpayers.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are in fact saying that there should be no limit to the taxpayers' ability to pay up, notwithstanding the fact that the bulk of congress members are the very taxpayers the congress are saying have no limit to their ability to pay for increases in public sector pay.  Could any proposition be more ludicrous?</P>
    <P>The Government must take a firm line on increases in public sector pay and they must relate those clearly to actual increases in production in our economy. There is a need to set up an independent unit, which would estimate in each year the extent to which we can afford increases in pay.  At the moment estimates of this sort are being made by bodies who can be accused of special pleading.  It is suspected that employers or the Government make unduly pessismistic estimates of what we can afford to pay in terms of increased wages in the following year.  We need an independent body which would identify a year ahead, on the basis of existing trends, what we can afford to pay.  I believe that must be positively stated so that everyone would realise the limits within which our economy must operate.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we must reform the budget procedure in the Dáil.  The experience has been that in the second half of every year we have an avalanche of Supplementary Estimates adding on more expenditure on top of the expenditure which was solemnly agreed as being the limits to which expenditure would move in the Estimates and budget debates which had taken place only a few months previously.  The Dáil after making that solemn decision is faced with an avalanche of Supplementary Estimates saying: &ldquo;It was not enough, we want more.&rdquo; This is an example of total lack of planning of public finances.  The worst aspect of it is that those Supplementary Estimates are predominantly required for increases in the public sector pay and invariably they are paid for by borrowing rather than by taxation.  The first requirement for getting sanity back into Government negotiations is for them to make a <Col N="737" /> clear statement, and to have that written into law, that Supplementary Estimates will have to be paid for by supplementary taxation and that they cannot be paid for by borrowing.  That is the only way we will restore discipline into budgets.  Budgets have ceased to mean anything over the last five to ten years.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we must discuss a budget in a proper fashion when it really matters.  I do not know how many hours we have been debating this but I safely say that we have discussed it for approximately seven days.  In my opinion they were seven totally wasted days because not one single word uttered by any speaker on this side or the Government side will have the slightest effect on a comma or full stop in the budget.  We are being brought in simply to give out a large quota of hot air without the slightest hope of influencing in the least anything the Government are doing.</P>
    <P>The proper way is to introduce the budget in September before the year it applies to and not in January as something which cannot be changed.  The Estimates and Government proposals should be discussed here in the autumn session before any firm and final decisions are taken and before the Government are committed to certain circumstances. In that situation, if a Member suggests that a certain tax is too high or a particular expenditure is too high, it would be possible to make adjustments to reduce both.  That could make some difference because the year would not have begun and there would be scope for the Government to take account of what Deputies were saying.  At present anything we say will not make the slightest difference because the Government have made up their minds and will not change irrespective of what is said.  However, they will introduce Supplementary Estimates because they will find that, without having the slightest control over the matter, expenditure will have gone through the roof.</P>
    <P>If we had such a debate on the budget here, as is held in almost all countries, we could get people to see that there is a direct connection between the high rate of taxation, the high rate of public sector <Col N="738" /> pay and the high demands for various other kinds of expenditure.  People would begin to be responsible and realise that budget deficits have to be paid for in the form of increased taxation.  We as politicians could begin to give the type of lead we should be giving to our people.  The House is so unreformed that it is incapable of giving a lead to anybody.  If we could reform the Dáil, and in particular the way we deal with the budget here, we could give economic leadership in a way we have never done in the past.  It is no accident that, in practically every other country in Europe where their finances are properly managed and where there is no significant budget deficit, the budget is discussed in advance of the year to which it applies.  People are able to see the cost of the Exchequer demands in terms of actual increases in taxation.</P>
    <P>We should consider introducing what is known as the structural budget system which operates in Holland where an independent agency states whether or not the Government's target for public expenditure is realistic.  The Government have introduced Estimates which I believed to be significantly fraudulent in that they simply under-provide for items in a way which is irresponsible.  The Government know that they will be proved to be irresponsible because the money will have to be provided on a scale that it is not provided for at present.  We will have that avalanche of Supplementary Estimates.  Yet we will be asked to go through the charade over the next three or four months, if we are still here, of debating these Estimates, even though we all know in our hearts that they do not mean anything because they will be invalidated by Supplementary Estimates a few months later.  That should not happen.  There should be an independent agency, like the Comptroller and Auditor General which, instead of looking at Estimates after they have been spent to see if the money has been misappropriated, would look at the Estimates when they are published and say that they believe that, given the assumptions upon which Government policy is working, the Estimates are realistic or unrealistic.  We need a Comptroller and Auditor General who <Col N="739" /> will look at Government expenditure before, as well as after, it takes place.  In that way we could have meaningful discussions about Government expenditure because we would know that the figures we are discussing are genuine.  They are not genuine at present.</P>
    <P>There is no proper control of the training of manpower in the economy.  We have the various education institutions producing all sorts of graduates for whom there are no jobs and, at the same time, despite our large unemployment we have substantial shortfalls such as insufficient computer programmers, a shortage of engineers and people with all sorts of skills.  We need a manpower training authority which would, in the manner of the National Science Council, co-ordinate the entire range of Government spending on manpower training, whether it be by the Department of Labour, Agriculture or Education, to see that the money is being spent in a way that meets the perceived and real needs for labour in our economy.  At present there is no unitary control of the expenditure on universities, schools and AnCO.  They are all going willy-nilly.  If they happen to come out right in the end, it is good luck; and, if they do not, it is bad luck.  There should be clear control of Government expenditure on manpower training so that it relates to the jobs that are available in the economy.</P>
    <P>A lot of arguments have been made against my call for a firm approach to incomes policy and a new approach to the national understanding which would relate increases in income to real increases in production in the economy. What about firms doing exceptionally well which should be able to reward their employees by giving them more than the national average increase in wages?  What can be done about that situation?  One of the main reasons why national understandings failed in the past was because employers were unable to reward workers who were making an effort.  As a result, a pile of anomaly claims built up and the whole thing went up in smoke. Across the whole range of industry we need to introduce a scheme of profit-sharing <Col N="740" /> and there should be tax incentive schemes for firms who introduce profit sharing.  Those profit-sharing schemes should be excluded from the national understanding.  If a firm has a real substantial increase in its profits above a certain norm it should be able to pay an increased amount in the form of a profit-share to its employees over and above the national understanding.  Those schemes should be audited and examined centrally and be given a tax incentive to get them started.  If we had a national scheme to encourage profit-sharing in industry we would be able through those to reward firms achieving substantial increases in productivity without breaching the basic terms of the national understanding, because those profit-sharing payments would not be considered as wages and therefore would be outside the terms of the understanding.  We face a very challenging decade and I regret the Government do not seem to have an idea of the extent of the problems or a proposal to meet them.  I hope, therefore, that an early opportunity is given by the Government to our people to make their decision as to who is best fitted to govern the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people do not seem to realise that we are coming through the recession better than most.  When many other economies were stagnant we achieved some positive growth.  We expanded our exports at a rate above the Community and OECD averages. Because of the high sterling rate we are exporting more Irish goods than ever to Britain and import an enormous amount of goods from other EEC countries where our currency parity is very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget ensures the continued expansion of our exports.  The aim of the investment plan is the continuation of a high level of investment, which constitutes 30 per cent of our gross national product, which, in turn, will assure us of a continuation of record levels of new job approvals.  Indeed, speaking of new job approvals, I should say that in the past three-and-a-half years, since Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1977, the numbers of new job approvals in my constituency <Col N="741" /> have been twice the figure achieved by the National Coalition during their four-and-a-half years in office.</P>
    <P>Because we are faring better in the current recession than if our currency was still tied to sterling we must capitalise on this opportunity.  This budget ensures that that opportunity is not missed.  By increasing by 36 per cent expenditure on the Public Capital Programme we are making the confidence of the business world even stronger at home and abroad in regard to our future economic prospects.  This confidence is no longer tied to the neighbouring British industrial power base but is international, since we have attracted so much investment from the United States and Japan and, above all, since our trade with EEC countries has been increased to huge proportions particularly in the past ten years.  We have enormous imports from EEC countries where our currency parity is very good. Therefore it is my belief that immediate measures should be taken to explore the possibilities of importing much more raw materials for our industries from those same EEC countries rather than from Britain.  It should be noted here that the only people who suffer from this disparity between our currency and sterling are those who take holidays in Britain.  If we now increase our intake of raw materials from EEC member countries we will make our growing volume of exports to Britain and the rest of the world more competitive.</P>
    <P>Government policy, as illustrated in this budget and investment plan, demonstrates that we are growth-orientated. This is sound policy.  Economic depression breeds depressed economists who can see nothing but gloom, who cannot see that it is the very nature of a depression to lift ultimately and always rather dramatically.  This has been a very long world economic recession and, because it must lift, it is lifting.  When past economic depressions were lifting the upturn in economies was always swift.  Indeed if I might say so, the upturn in the larger, even huge economies was slowest.  A very good example of this is industrial Britain in the present and indeed past recessions. It is the smaller, compact economies like <Col N="742" /> ours which, though hit hard, lift more quickly.  In economic matters it often pays to be comparatively small because such economies tend to be more buoyant.</P>
    <P>This budget is geared to taking advantage of impending circumstances.  Only last week here in this House a former Coalition Minister for Finance could not find adjectives gloomy enough to describe our economy.  When that same Deputy was in office he condemned any kind of economic planning.  Indeed, I was glad to hear Deputy Bruton proclaim here this morning that the National Coalition Government had no economic plan; he actually admitted that here this morning.  I doubt if we on this side of the House need to reminded of that fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party have not got one either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because we are fully conscious that the National Coalition had no economic plan.  Indeed, the then Minister for Finance, it seems, was content to see our economy blown anywhere by prevailing trade winds.  Look where they left us &mdash; almost stranded on the rocks. In the 1977 election the people took the direction of our economy out of the hands of that same Minister and Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government's financial policy illustrates that deflation is out as a policy suitable to Irish conditions. Investment growth must be higher to avail of the buoyancy in world economies just returning.  This budget will increase our growth potential, hence attracting more and more industries which in turn leads to more and more jobs.  If all this was only seen in this light it would be plainly seen that we will be in the vanguard of the impending upturn.  A good example of this is our spearheading the great technological breakthrough in the microchip revolution, so much so that by 1995 70 per cent of the jobs in which hundreds of thousands of young workers and technicians will be engaged are coming into existence only now.  These jobs in technology are coming into existence because of the efforts of this Government in the present and past budgets to attract more investment, thereby securing a proliferation <Col N="743" /> of jobs in this decade and right into the nineties.</P>
    <P>We have heard much criticism of this Government and their performance in regard to the 1977 election manifesto. The people opposite seem to forget that that manifesto constituted a confident plan for the rescue of our economy from the Coalition doldrums.  The people saw the need for this plan.  Honest people now see what it achieved and what this budget is continuing to achieve in very difficult economic circumstances. Between 1977 and 1980 employment was increased by the creation of 82,000 new jobs.  I should point out that the manifesto target for that period was 75,000.  I should like to point out also to Deputies on the far side of the House that when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1977 there were approximately 115,000 people unemployed.  One of the basic reasons Fianna Fáil were returned to office in that 1977 election was that we hoped, and our policy was, to ensure that that figure would be reduced considerably.</P>
    <P>If one goes back to early 1979 we had a situation where the figure was less than 90,000; it was about 88,000.  That was a significant decrease in a very short space of time.  Unfortunately at that point the world economic recession really got to grips with the world economies and we lost out in some of our traditional industries and employment numbers were decreased.  So let us not forget, when we speak about numbers of people employed here, that we have 30,000 school leavers coming on the job market in each year.  When one takes into account the fact that we have reduced our unemployment figures to that extent in a short space of time and that we have 30,000 coming on the job market in each year, we can honestly say that but for the drastic world economic recession that really set in at that point we would now be in a very sad position.  The figure of 150,000 would be drastically reduced but for the world economic recession.  Let no one try to tell me that the recession that the National Coalition Government went through during their period in office was anything like the recession that this Government, <Col N="744" /> and indeed the world economies, have gone through, particularly in the past 18 months to two years.</P>
    <P>When one talks of unemployment one should not confine oneself to this little country.  One has only to look across the water to see the situation that Britain finds itself in today with 2.5 million unemployed and a forecast of three million unemployed by the end of this year.  One should look at West Germany which had full employment up to a short time ago and now finds itself in the situation of having over one million people unemployed.  But we do not have to go to our EEC neighbours when comparing figures because we can just look north within the confines of our own land and see the situation in the Six Counties where there are over 100,000 people unemployed, and when one takes into consideration the population of the Six Counties and the population of the Twenty-six Counties, we can honestly say we are doing extremely well in holding our unemployment figures at their present level.  Let us not allow the doom and gloom approach by the Opposition Deputies to depress us.  They are not taking into full consideration all aspects of unemployment here.  The Government managed to introduce 82,000 new jobs since they came into office in 1977.  We set out to do two very important and basic things for our people in this budget, to increase the numbers of jobs available and to give the people in jobs and those coming into new jobs the incentive to raise production.</P>
    <P>In the last four years or so Fianna Fáil have been responsible for very significant improvements in the position of recipients of social welfare benefits.  During this Government's term of office there has been a real improvement of between 40 and 50 per cent in social welfare payments compared to the 10 per cent during the term of the previous Coalition Government.  So, in the past three budgets since coming into office in 1977.  Fianna Fáil have proved themselves to be the party with real social concern.  It has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil Governments to ensure that the poorer sections and the under-privileged of our <Col N="745" /> community were adequately dealt with in any budget.  Following the recent budget the media stated that it was not an election budget.  Being a member of Fianna Fáil and supporting them, I would hope that at no time could Fianna Fáil ever be accused of introducing what could be described as an election budget.  I would hope that a budget introduced by Fianna Fáil would be seen as an honest, straightforward budget.  I am convinced that this is what this recent budget is.  The fact that we have increased social welfare benefits by 20 to 25 per cent proves that we have that social concern for the under-privileged and poorer sections.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in all budgets, even budgets framed for a buoyant world economy, there are bound to be some hardships for good economic and social reasons.  The economic reasons are the situation I outlined, to take advantage of our position regarding industrial growth and job creation, and the social reasons are to make those in receipt of social welfare more secure and in a better position to cope. We on this side of the House recognise that there is no charity to be handed out, that young people have a right to jobs and that social welfare beneficiaries have a right to a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>When we speak of industry we tend to forget agriculture.  Naturally this would be fatal for our economy since we are very much an agricultural-oriented economy.  This is something that we on this side of the House have always taken into consideration in all budgets.  Since agriculture is the basis of our overall economy no budget should neglect the injection of moneys for progress in farming. So, in this 1981 budget additional reliefs costing £35 million are introduced.  What I have said regarding the effects of the recession in our industrial economy is even more true of our agricultural economy.  I said recession leads to predictions of gloom and depression from economists and that there is no need for this.  As our economy is comparatively small but vibrant it will rise with the world economic buoyancy which will suddenly come with the upturn.  That this applies to our agricultural economy is borne out by a very recent study.  It has been discovered <Col N="746" /> now that the farming depression of 1975 very swiftly lifted between September and March and it caught the farming community unawares.  The 1974 depression brought gloomy doomsday predictions from agriculturalists and economists and Coalition Ministers, and there was an unwarranted cutback in financial expenditure on farming.  An example was the very harmful drop in investment in land fertilisers.  Farmers should learn from that experience and see that overall it is impossible for a recession to continue, that the upturn is always swift and that the man who maintains a fair level of reinvestment is the one who is going to benefit best from the ending of the recession.</P>
    <P>The Government's plan for farming for the 1980s is evident from the financial statement of the Minister for Finance on 28 January and from the Minister's budget speech.  It is recognised plainly that we have a concern not only for the individual farmer and his family but also for the effect that a weakened agricultural sector would have on the whole economy.  When our 1980 agricultural output represented 17 per cent of national output as against only 4 per cent of all other EEC countries this concern obviously is necessary.</P>
    <P>Over the past eight months this Government have dealt with this problem by very practical measures introduced by the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, who in October of last year produced a package for the farming sector which involved (1) increased allocation for farm modernisation grants; (2) a doubling of the rates of grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme; (3) a supplement to the EEC suckler cow scheme and (4) additional rates relief.  All those cost £39 million in 1980.  That was only last October.  Also at that time the Government arranged for the provision of £100 million in reduced interest loans for agriculture, and now in the recent budget the Government have a number of direct reliefs to help farmers offset their income erosion and to help themselves by investment in further farm development.  These reliefs include the suspension of levies for <Col N="747" /> the disease eradication programme at a cost to the Exchequer again of almost £10 million, the discontinuation of the resource tax, the total derating of lands up to £50 valuation and a 50 per cent relief for farmers with valuations between £50 and £75.  All of this is costing the Exchequer a further £35 million.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the Government can only help the farmers to help themselves.  It is the farmer himself who farms the land.  Lessons can be learned from past experience of sudden decline in farm incomes in short-term or long-term recessions and then a sudden and dramatic upturn.  It has happened in the past, and farming on the basis of only year-to-year planning is not good enough for the individual alone or for the agricultural sector in general or, for that matter, from the point of view of the whole economy.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that all farmers avail themselves here and now of the reliefs that are provided to regain the drive and determination to expand production.  There is work to be done, there is land to be reclaimed and re-enriched, and livestock population to be expanded.  An economic upturn world-wide is about to begin as is always the case when a recession is nearing its end, and there is a market to be met.  Farmers have a unique commodity for sale.  People must buy food, and that is what the farmer produces.  If the farming community in this country gear themselves to the upturn, which is already there as far as the farming community are concerned with increased cattle prices, and if they reinvest in and develop their holdings, particularly at this time, I have every confidence that they can achieve great things.</P>
    <P>Any budget can be described as a national housekeeping plan and it is not a hand-out to any section of the community.  The Government's job is to manage the national finances and help sections of the economy to help themselves. The additional reliefs costing £35 million are designed to help farmers help themselves to the increased financial benefits which inevitably will come quickly in the wake of this diminishing recession.  As I <Col N="748" /> said earlier, there will always have to be a market for food and basically this is what the farmer produces.  This is where I would like to see most effort made in bringing new industries to this country. More attention should be paid, while spending money on attracting new industries, to attracting more industries which would use our own agricultural produce as raw material.</P>
    <P>A lot more can be done in this respect and it is only common sense to ensure that it is done and that every effort is made in this direction.  Nobody can convince me that we are economically correct in exporting so many live cattle and sheep, so much unprocessed meat and foodstuffs.  In doing so we are exporting what we in turn have to import, the most desired commodity of all, and that is jobs. Unfortunately, by exporting live cattle and sheep we are exporting jobs out of this country.  We hear a great deal about under-developed and under-cropped hundreds of thousands of acres here in Ireland, and this is a national scandal and a grave economic sin.  If we are in earnest about jobs for the young workers and land for our young farmers, surely there must be some way to awaken the national farming, industrial and economic will to develop and produce where there is little or no production.  There must be a great incentive for any Government or any section of the farming community to ensure that this task is tackled, that food processing projects are introduced, and that these projects are processed in industry. More effort should be made in this direction.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Necessity is the mother of invention&rdquo; is the old saying and it is true in economic matters.  A great example of this is the world energy crisis forcing people into seeking new ways of energy conservation and new sources of energy.  We have a telling example of this in the financial investment which the Minister for Finance is making in our bogland and in the legislation that is going through the Dáil at present which is of great advantage to small farmers, smallholders and people who hold bog rights and turbary rights in bogs who may not be in farming at all.  This legislation can be of great <Col N="749" /> assistance to those people to ensure that boglands not suitable for Bord na Móna development will be taken in hand and, through the grants made available in the recent Turf Development Bill, the production of turf from those bogs will help to reduce our energy problems.  The price of energy has forced people to look for native, undeveloped energy sources.  The world recession should make our agricultural and industrial sectors do this.  Now is the time for further investment and re-investment.  This should be the national aim throughout the whole spectrum of employers, employees and the self-employed rather than trying to extract from the economy greater incomes than those already provided in the second national understanding.</P>
    <P>The balancing of our regional development is inherent in the Government's investment plan.  The IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta get significant increases and the effects of investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing will be nationwide.  Deficiencies in our road network will be set right under the investment plan, which is necessary if we are to realise our national potential.  The Government are providing £80 million this year for that purpose, £67 million for improvement works and £20 million for maintenance.  This balanced budget which, in the first week got such a barraging from the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Balanced budget?  It is not a balanced budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is now looked at by sensible people and whole sections of the community as a wise and sane budget.  It will also help to ensure that 11,500 workers will be employed on the 1981 road programmes.  In this area it is worth noting that since 1977 local authority expenditure has increased by 69 per cent, from £433 million in 1977 to a total of £744 million in 1980.  When one hears Opposition speakers admit that the Coalition Government had no economic plan, from the figures I have quoted it is clear that Fianna Fáil and the Government have an economic plan, despite having gone through the worst recession <Col N="750" /> in the western world for decades.  We are continuing to hold on to that economic plan.  The figures I quoted for the last year of the Coalition Government prove that, with almost a doubling of the figures spent on roads.  No one need tell me that inflation takes account of 69 per cent of an increase in a period of three-and-a-half years.  Irrespective of how inflationary it was, it does not come near the significant increase of almost 70 per cent which we have made in our road network in the same period of time.</P>
      <P>On the day the budget was announced, 28 January, one of our morning papers predicted that welfare benefits would rise by 15 per cent.  On the following day, after the Government had announced a 25 per cent increase, it was sad to see the same writer in the same paper belittling the Government's efforts to spread the burden more evenly and to share the national wealth in a balanced way.  This is symptomatic of the coverage given almost totally in the media.  We all have an obligation to correct and criticise, but it is important that whatever criticism we make is constructive.  The foretellers of a gloomy future have had their say in the past and we have listened to it from the Opposition benches many times.  Despite this, Fianna Fáil Governments have been proven correct in the confidence which they have in the people, in the potential of the Irish worker and in the bright future of our economy.  Irrespective of what Deputies on the Opposition benches say, the future of our economy is bright.  Smaller economies come out best from world economic recessions.</P>

It is good to see that my confidence is shared by foreign investors and industrialists, in spite of the doomsday and gloomy pictures which Oppositon Deputies paint so regularly.

      <P>The economy, not for the first time under a Fianna Fáil Government, is in the doldrums at present.  It is in a shambles.  If the drift is allowed to continue, there is a great danger that the International Monetary Fund may intervene as they did in Great Britain in 1976. Irishmen fought and died for the democracy and freedom which we have to day. It is ironical that the Fianna Fáil Party, which calls itself the great Republican Party, has plunged us so much into debt that we may now lose our independence and our freedom of action.  Financial juggling by the Government in the budget, in the interest of party expediency, may help to keep Fianna Fáil in office; but the same manoeuvring over the years has contributed largely to growing inflation, the rising cost of living and the growth in our national debt, which now threatens the basis of our whole economy.  This budget has added a further 2 per cent to our cost of living.  It does nothing to curb the escalation in food and fuel prices which have hit the living costs of the poorest groups in the country.</P>
      <P>When we were in office, Deputy Mark Clinton and other Ministers went to EEC meetings.  They had instructions to get the highest possible prices for anything we had to export.  By getting high prices our Minister at that time increased the farmers' income from £250 million to nearly £950 million.  If those increases resulted in hardship for any section of the community, we were prepared to subsidise the weaker sections against those higher prices.  At that time we subsidised butter to the extent of 30p per pound.  We subsidised milk to the extent of 4½p per pint and we subsidised also flour, cheese and other foodstuffs.  Despite the promises that Fianna Fáil had made to the people, they abolished many of these subsidies on their return to office just as they abolished also subsidies on lime and fertilisers.  We had introduced the lime and fertiliser subsidies in an effort to encourage increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PAYE changes in the budget will not compensate for the inflation of 1980. This year workers are facing a higher tax burden in real terms.  Not since the days <Col N="752" /> of the economic war has there been so much poverty among the farmers as there is today but despite this situation the relief for farmers in the budget is less than half that demanded by Fine Gael and less than the one-twentieth which the IFA and some economists claim is necessary to put the farmers back on their feet and restore confidence among them. There is a measly £20 million being provided by way of the budget for the farmers but many economists calculate that the amount needed in order to provide the farmers with the sort of income to which they are entitled is in the region of £250 million to £300 million.</P>
    <P>The doubling of the car registration fee only continues the Fianna Fáil policy of re-introducing car tax by stealth.  The increased duty on petrol hits everybody in the community but especially those workers who must use their cars in order to commute daily to their places of employment.  When the Taoiseach was elected more than 12 months ago he was regarded in some quarters as being the saviour of all mankind.  We were told that he was the man who would ensure that the trains ran on time, for instance, and that he would solve all our economic ills but things seem to have turned sour. Instead of the leadership to which the people are entitled all we have had during the year is public relations gimmickry. The ship of State seems to be heading for the rocks.  It can be said that the captian seems to be lost in the mist.</P>
    <P>During last year the Taoiseach should have been tackling the problems of the increasing cost of living, of increasing unemployment, if increasing foreign borrowing and of increasing inflation. Instead, we had a situation in which Nero was fiddling while Rome was burning. All we had was the kind of gimmickry as when the Taoiseach went to Limerick to open a cowshed and when 25 State cars converged on Castlebar where the Taoiseach was to unveil a plaque in honour of himself.</P>

      <P>That would depend on the type of fiddle.  All of our problems can be traced back to the manifesto of 1977.  At that time everything was up for grabs.  Now the chickens are coming home to roost.  We now have a situation of a record so far as unemployment is concerned.  The figure in that regard, according to the information supplied by the Government, is more than 130,000 but if we use the criteria used by Fianna Fáil when we were in office and include the 40,000 to 50,000 young people who left school last year, we find that the unemployment figure stands at about 180,000.  Many economists and experts claim that if present trends continue we could well have a situation in which 200,000 people will be unemployed by the end of next year.  That is not what Fianna Fáil promised in 1977.</P>
      <P>We may well ask if there is anything in the budget that will provide employment for our people.  According to the Official Report of 29 January this year, the Taoiseach said, as reported at column 583:</P>
      <P>Let us not mistake or misunderstand what is happening with employment. We are proving our capacity through a high investment policy to provide enough new jobs to reduce unemployment but the current recession is temporarily off-setting these gains by losses in older industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have words lost their meaning?  Is the Taoiseach living in a fairyland when he tells us that we are proving our capacity through high investment?  That famous manifesto of 1977 contained a promise of a reduction in unemployment.  The outgoing Government had experienced what was perhaps the worst recession since 1929.  Oil prices had increased by more than 400 per cent whereas the increases since then have been of the order of 100 to 120 per cent.  However, the Fianna Fáil manifesto promise was to reduce unemployment in 1977 by 5,000, in 1978 by 20,000, in 1979 by 25,000 and in 1980 by 30,000.  This represented a total reduction of 80,000 at a time when the unemployment figure was 107,000.  It can be seen, then, that if Fianna Fáil had kept their <Col N="754" /> promise the number of unemployed today would be 27,000.  But let us take the official figures that we have been given and let us exclude those children who left school last year.  According to the figure given to us two weeks ago, the unemployment figure is approximately 127,000.  In other words, the Fianna Fáil promise has fallen short by 100,000 to date.  What faith can the people have in a party who have been found to be so far out in their estimation?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note also that on 4 February, as reported at column 926 of the Official Report, Deputy Briscoe had this to say:</P>
    <P>For the sake of the country I am glad that Fianna Fáil have been in office since 1977.  If we had had a Coalition Government we might have had a revolution or something because the Opposition have opposed everything that we have done in relation to job creation.</P>
    <P>One can only wonder how much worse the situation would be if we had not voiced our opposition to what was happening.  I am talking about a revolution because there is a great danger of a social revolution when we have so many people who cannot get jobs at home, when we have so many who were fooled by Fianna Fáil in 1977 by the promises to reduce unemployment by 100,000 and get it down to 27,000, when we have so many educated young people leaving school able and willing to work, who are promised work by Fianna Fáil but there is no sign of it, or even the opportunity to work, and there is nothing in this budget to provide work for such people.</P>
    <P>When we were in power, we heard a great deal about the increased cost of living.  It did increase at that time but we gave increases in social welfare and wage increases to cover the higher cost of living.  Fianna Fáil were not satisfied with that and in 1977 they promised that if elected they would reduce the cost of living by 1 per cent in the first year, by 2 per cent in 1978 and 2 per cent in 1979. They left 1980 blank.  In the first three <Col N="755" /> years, therefore, they promised to reduce the cost of living by 5 per cent.  Instead, the cost of living in the past four years has increased by about 70 per cent according to figures given recently by the Minister in the House.  Instead of honouring their promise to the people to reduce the cost of living by 5 per cent &mdash;unfortunately people fell for it&mdash;we have an increase of 70 per cent so that the Government were 75 per cent wrong in that promise.</P>
    <P>We depend on our exports to a very large extent.  The standard of living of every citizen depends on what the farmers, labourers and industrialists can produce and export profitably.  When we left office in 1977 we had a 5½ per cent growth rate, the highest I think of any country in the EEC.  Despite that, Fianna Fáil told us that output would increase by 4 per cent in 1978, by 3 per cent in 1979 and in 1980 by a further 3 per cent if they got into office.  On that basis, growth was to increase by 10 per cent but instead we have a reduction of 4½ per cent down to 1 per cent and for part of the time growth has been stagnant.  That is how Fianna Fáil kept their promises to the people in that respect.</P>
    <P>We now come to borrowing, which is so important.  Last January after the present Taoiseach had been elected he went on radio and television and said: &ldquo;We have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate that just cannot continue, in 1979 over £1,000 million, one-seventh of our national output. This is just far too high a rate and cannot possibly continue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the Dáil on 25 May 1976 when the national debt was less than £3,000 million Deputy Haughey, the present Taoiseach, said as reported in volume 291 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It is in the report of the Central Bank.  One would have thought that a former economic commentator would have had that information....</P>
    <P>He then went on to say:</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that, if one takes the Government's foreign <Col N="756" /> indebtedness plus the foreign indebtedness of the State companies and the net foreign liability of the banking system against our foreign external holdings, we are no longer a creditor nation internationally?  In the three short years this Government have been in power they have moved us from the position of being a strong international creditor nation into being an international debtor.  Will the Minister not agree with that?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach realise what has happened since then?  Since the foundation of the State in 1922 we have had different Governments.  We began with the Cosgrave Government, then we had the de Valera Government, the Government led by John A.  Costello, the Government led by Eamon de Valera again, the Government led again by John A.  Costello, the Government led again by Eamon de Valera; after that we had the Government led by Seán Lemass and then we had two or three Governments led by Deputy Jack lynch and a Government led by Liam Cosgrave up to 1977. Does the present Taoiseach realise that in those 55 years the total borrowing, the national debt at the beginning of 1977 when we were leaving office, stood at around £3,500 million?  Does he further realise that despite all he has said in this House and throughout the country at the end of 1980 the national debt stood at £7,900 million?  Does he realise that this Government, in three years, have more than doubled the national debt?  They borrowed more than was borrowed in the previous 55 years, despite all the promises made.  Last year he promised that borrowing in 1980 would not increase by more than 8 per cent of the gross national product.  Instead, the Government ended up by borrowing £1,217 million, which was nearer to 14 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Last year we had to pass Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £464 million. If the Government were doing their duty and not preparing for a general election which makes them afraid to offend any section of the community, there would have been a second budget.  But no, it is <Col N="757" /> easier to borrow and keep on borrowing as long as they get away with it.  However, this money must be paid for sooner or later.  This year, according to the Government's own figures, borrowing by the Exchequer and State bodies will amount to a staggering £1,225 million, or 18.3 per cent of GNP.  This sum will require more massive foreign debt, will raise the cost and reduce the availability of borrowing for Irish farmers, industry and, indeed, for consumers.  Instead of £900 million, as the Taoiseach has promised in January 1981, they borrowed £1,217 million.  This year they say they are going to borrow almost £1,900 million.  If they break that promise, as they did last year, they will end up borrowing £2,500 million.  I believe that is what will happen and then our national debt will stand at around £9,000 million.  In other words, in over four years from 1977 to the present time, this Government will have trebled the national debt.</P>
    <P>Someone asked a question in the House last week which elicited the information that every worker has a tag of £7,000 of national debt around his neck. Every individual in this State, has a tag of something like £2,500 of national debt around his neck.  Some Deputy last week asked what it costs to service the national debt and was told that it will cost roughly £981 million to service the national debt this year.  In other words, every penny which is being collected from the PAYE taxpayer will go to service the national debt.  If Fianna Fáil had not imposed this huge burden of debt on the Irish people, that £981 million could be given to farmers, industry or used towards producing jobs at home, which we are all interested in doing.</P>
    <P>To quote the famous Fianna Fáil manifesto, in 1977 when we were in office they said that the national debt stood at around £3,000 million after 55 years of native Government.  Of course, the present Taoiseach had a hand in this manifesto, although he may have tried to distance himself from some of the things which happened.  The man who was to provide all the jobs for our people, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is an honest, <Col N="758" /> responsible man, made the statement here in this House that he would provide jobs for all our people, even if we were to dig holes and get them filled in.  Unfortunately, we now have the potholes all over the country but the Government have not given the county councils the money to pay the workmen to fill up the holes.  The manifesto states, on page 5:</P>
    <P>The country has been plunged into debt at a phenomenal rate.</P>
    <P>This is only a third of what it will be at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The interest on these extra debts is costing £8 weekly for every household in the country.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil figures at that time were correct, it will cost £24 for every household by the end of 1981.  Is that what Fianna Fáil promised in the past? There is an old saying which begins &ldquo;Fool me once&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We were also told in the famous manifesto that the borrowing percentage of GNP in 1980 would be 8 per cent.  As I have said, it was, in fact, 14 per cent and is heading for 18 per cent this year.  We were also told after the budget last year that taxation would be reduced for all income tax payers.  I asked a question in the Dáil which was answered on Tuesday, 27 January 1981:</P>
    <P>284.  Mr. L'Estrange asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of the financial years 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980 the average amount of income tax collected per head of the population; and the estimated average amount that will be collected in 1981-82.</P>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald): On the basis of estimates of population supplied by the Central Statistics Office, the following is the information requested for the years 1977 to 1980 inclusive:</P>

    <P>Instead of reducing the taxation for those people as Fianna Fáil promised in 1977, they increased taxation from £159 to £295, by over £130 per head.  That is a lovely way to keep their promises.</P>
    <P>I have some figures &mdash; which I will not go into in detail &mdash; about the cost of living obtained in reply to my Question No. 253 of 27 January, 1981:</P>
    <P>253.  Mr. L'Estrange asked the Taoiseach the actual percentage change in each item included in the consumer price index from mid-May 1977 to the latest available date.</P>
    <P>You may remember that during those four years Fianna Fáil were to reduce all prices by 5 per cent.  Mutton and lamb, instead of being reduced by 5 per cent, were increased by 45.4 per cent.  Cooked meat, instead of being reduced by 5 per cent, was increased by 47.8 per cent. Fresh fish was increased by 45.9 per cent, frozen fish by 56.5 per cent.  Fresh milk was increased by 91 per cent, cocoa by 95.8 per cent.  Breakfast cereals were increased by 56.1 per cent, jams and marmalades by 61 per cent, overcoats by 40 per cent, waterproofs by 50 per cent, suits and other wear by 49.3 per cent.  Boys' clothes were increased by 46.6 per cent, boys' underwear 51.1 per cent, coal 72.3 per cent, bottled gas, 84.6 per cent, piped gas, 138.4 per cent, electricity, 77 per cent, fuel oil, 94 per cent, mortgage interest, 73.4 per cent, house insurance, 65.7 per cent, repairs and decorations, 53.5 per cent.  Under household durables the increases range from approximately 45 per cent to 53 per cent, comics 102.5 per cent and magazines and journals 72.4 per cent.  I am only taking some of the figures and, being a politician, I am not taking <Col N="760" /> the lowest.  Under the heading of transport, vehicles were increased by 69.2 per cent; repairs and maintenance, 62.8 per cent; train fares, 65 per cent; and other travel, 65 per cent.  Under services and related expenditure, cinema and theatre increased by 68.4 per cent; other entertainment, 100 per cent; education and training, 84.7 per cent; shoe repairs, 78.2 per cent &mdash; soon we will all be on our feet and have to have our shoes repaired &mdash; and laundry and dry cleaning, 83.4 per cent.  The Government promised to reduce all these items by 5 per cent &mdash; and, if the Minister of State does not believe me, he can read it in the manifesto &mdash; but instead they were increased.</P>

      <P>Question No. 253 addressed by me to the Taoiseach on 27 January 1981.  On the same day I asked about the value of the púnt.  This Taoiseach has created a record.  He gave us the 72p Irish pound and the 72p pint, but we will leave that for the time being.  The 1922 £1 would cost £14.16 in 1980.  In 1977 we were told everything would be stabilised and that there would not be an increase in the cost of living.  On that date the 1922 £1 cost £9.83.  After three years that 1922 £1 would now cost £14.16, an increase of over £5.</P>
      <P>Recently we heard the Taoiseach talk about savings and Government policy. At colume 580 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>Government policy is directed towards the encouragement of savings to the maximum extent to finance this year's huge investment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are nice words, but there is too much woolly talk that our people should save more, work harder and practise more self-denial.  These are commendable sentiments but, unfortunately, under the present Fianna Fáil Government there is neither the opportunity nor the incentive to put them into practice.  How <Col N="761" /> can one save more when each day brings new prices increases?  Where is the example to work harder when those entrusted with government neglect to do the work expected of them?  The majority of our citizens are hardworking.  Are they to deny themselves the ordinary simple things to which they are legitimately entitled when waste and squandermania run riot among an arrogant group of people in the Fianna Fáil Party who now look upon themselves as masters, not servants, of the people?</P>
    <P>On the day of the unveiling of the plaque to &ldquo;mé féin&rdquo; 23 or 24 State cars went down to Castlebar.  As one wit said during the Donegal by-election &ldquo;If you put your foot on the road it would be hit by a ministerial car, or if you lift up your head you would be hit by the Taoiseach's helicopter&rdquo;.  The people who talk about saving should set an example.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that we are living beyond our means.  We are living on borrowed money and on borrowed time.  We have heard numerous pleas for our people to work harder, but there should be a greater incentive to work.  It is not too much to expect that there should be a greater incentive to work than not to do so.  Unfortunately, that is not the case at present.  I know of factories which were working three days.  When the employers were ready to do a full week's work they found it very hard to get their workers back because they were much better off on three days.</P>
    <P>A factory in the midlands recently was not doing very well and they had a chance to get money to keep going.  The employees contacted public representatives and asked them to stay at home from the public meeting called to keep the factory open.  They wanted it closed so that they could draw their redundancy pay.  That is bad.  This did not happen in my constituency, but the public representatives told me they stayed at home.  The factory did not get the money and it closed.  There was a time when Irish people took a pride in their work and in their country.  Are they losing that pride?  I hope not.  What we want is an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  If everybody puts his shoulder to the wheel we will succeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> Far too many people talk about fighting for Ireland, but it would be no harm if we had people who were prepared to work harder.</P>
    <P>We have some professional men, doctors, and if one gave them £5 or £10 they ask for how long one wants the certificate.  That practice should be rooted out. In a newspaper article on 29 September 1980 it was said that many doctors in this country knowingly provided medical certificates to employees who were perfectly fit for work.  An eminent doctor, Galway-based Professor Eamonn O'Dwyer, blamed that trend on a lack of ethics.  He also said that in some cases doctors give certificates to people who are better able to work than the doctors themselves.  An unfortunate fact is that the honest doctor is losing business because people will not approach him.  A person who robs £100 will be sent to jail, but by writing these certificates doctors may be depriving some industrialist to the extent of perhaps £150.  If five or six workers have certificates at the same time the loss could amount to £600 or more. Every effort must be made to eradicate this practice.  I admire the moral courage of Professor O'Dwyer and it is a pity there are not more such people.  Someone else has spoken out, because I saw a newspaper article sometime ago stating that in certain parts of this city medical certificates are being sold.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the crisis in agriculture but very little has been done in this budget to help farmers. The Government claim to have given concessions of £30 million, but that claim is most misleading.  The concessions actually amount to about £19 million.  In 1979 Fianna Fáil imposed the 2 per cent levy and the disease eradication charges and they also imposed the resource tax, although in the latter case they have done a U-turn and agreed to abolish it.</P>
    <P>It must be agreed that Irish agriculture is at present in the doldrums, not for the first time under a Fianna Fáil Government.  Farmer's overheads have increased during the past two or three years by 30 per cent or more.  Inflation is between 18 per cent and 20 per cent <Col N="763" /> despite the fact that when Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1977 the rate was about 9 per cent.  Interest rates this year and last year have been about 20 per cent, although in 1977 they were around 10.5 per cent.  The farmers are the backbone of this country.  They have been in many wars, national, social and economic.  All they ask is a fair deal and they are certainly not getting this from the Government.  Their income has dropped by 50 per cent during the past three years. This is a predominantly agricultural country.  If the people on the land are prosperous the whole nation will prosper and the standard of living of every person will rise irrespective of where he is living. Our farmers must have profitable exports because we need the foreign exchange in order to purchase the raw materials for industry.  The confidence of the farmers must be restored as soon as possible but this will not be achieved by the measures contained in this budget.</P>
    <P>Since the change of Government in 1977 there have not been any worthwhile increases from Brussels.  During the Coalition Government the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, did a first-class job.  He was prepared to go to Brussels to fight for the interests of this country.  Since 1977 none of our Ministers appears to have that kind of commitment.</P>
    <P>Some time ago Fine Gael produced a document on the crisis in agriculture detailing a rescue package costing about £70 million.  Experts have claimed that it would cost between £250 million and £300 million to right all the present wrongs in agriculture.  A motion on our proposed measures was introduced in this House and 66 members of Fianna Fáil, who claim to be the champions of agriculture, went through the lobbies and voted against our proposals.  We proposed the abolition of the resource tax and Fianna Fáil have now agreed to that. We also proposed the abolution of the bovine disease levy, because we believe the eradication of bovine disease should be a national charge.  The Government have given this concession for one year only.  If the farmers are foolish enough to <Col N="764" /> vote them back into office at the next general election, they will re-impose all those taxes, just as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>In 1977 Fianna Fáil accused us of crucifying the farmers by the introduction of income tax.  I believe this to be a fair form of taxation because the amount paid is based on income.  Under the Coalition Government this applied to farmers having a £75 poor law valuation, but Fianna Fáil have now included farmers having a £40 valuation.  They also promised to retain the notional system of assessment but that has now been abolished.</P>
    <P>We proposed to treat breeding stock as capital for income tax purposes and the Government have come a small way towards meeting that proposal.  However, our major proposal was aimed at the kernel of the problem.  In order to relieve the pressure on those who have borrowed, we proposed an interest subsidy scheme on loans up to £25,000 taken out for genuine family farm development.  Those in most financial trouble are the progressive farmers and they deserve our sympathy.  People such as instructors, bank managers and the ACC encouraged farmers to borrow between 1977 and 1979.  They found out the names of the progressive farmers and wrote letters to them saying &ldquo;If you want money come in and get it&rdquo;.  Many of the farmers fell for it and they borrowed at 8 or 9 per cent when inflation was at 9 or 10 per cent. They are now paying the penalty.  They were told to expand but since then the interest rates have gone as high as 20 or 21 per cent and inflation is at 18 or 19 per cent.  Those people are in trouble and I cannot see why the Government have refused to do anything for them as they are the backbone of the country.</P>
    <P>Because farmers incomes have dropped many farmers have had to sell their stock with the result that our factories are in trouble.  Seed potatoes and young heifers which should have been kept for breeding have been sold.  We have less livestock than in previous years which means that farmers will sell less, there will be less to export and there will be less cattle for the meat factories.  This will lead to further unemployment in the meat processing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Farm prices have also seriously hit machine suppliers many of whom have closed down.  These firms survived all crises in the past but they could not survive this crisis under the Fianna Fáil Government.  Because farmers have not got the money, tractor sales are down by 60 per cent, farm machinery by 50 per cent, farm building material by 60 per cent, compound feedstuffs by 15 per cent, cattle feedstuffs by 22 per cent, and fertiliser sales by over 12 per cent.  The Government promised that they would help to increase production and since they came to power they have either reduced or abolished subsidies on lime and fertilisers which were paid by the previous Government to help to increase production.</P>
    <P>It is hard to get it across to city people such as Gay Byrne, who jibes at farmers on some of his programmes, that the farmers are very badly off.  If he were to do a hard day's work on the land he might have a different attitude.  The farmers do not mind being the butt of certain jokes but when they have their backs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government commitment to increasing employment is evidenced by the exceptional measures being taken this year.  The investment plan for 1981 provides for total investment of over £1,700 million in 1981. Higher direct employment of about 10,000 persons will result, mainly in building and construction, and will be for the most part additional to the jobs in manufacturing industry resulting from investment by the industrial promotion agencies.  It is important to note that despite all the criticisms of the budget there is not one Member present from either the Fine Gael or Labour Party.  As well as the 10,000 persons I have mentioned there will be substantial indirect employment in Irish firms supplying materials and services for the various investment projects and for new manufacturing and other industries.  The investment plan will also affect employment in the manufacturing sector.  While the volume of output in this sector declined in the second part of 1980, compared with the same period in 1979, there was an increase in volume of 1½ per cent during the first eight months of 1980. Strong growth occurred in the chemical, metal and printing industries, while output in the textile, clothing and footwear, timber and non-metallic industries declined.  The investment plan's concentration on developing an infrastructural base, combined with the IDA's success in attracting internationally mobile industry and the favourable climate for development resulting from the Government monetary and fiscal policies will <Col N="767" /> provide a sound basis for increased employment in 1981 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the IDA, I confidently expect the authority to keep up their good work in regard to new jobs this year with the creation of an estimated 15,000 to 16,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry.  A record number of job approvals was achieved in recent years, more than 35,000 in 1980, 34,500 in 1979 and 30,200 in 1978.  SFADCo who are responsible for small industries in the mid-west region and in the Shannon industrial estate have also had their share of success with the provision of 1,500 new jobs. They also expect to approve projects with employment potential of 3,000.  Small industrial projects are very important and we must concentrate our minds on the possibilities in small projects for creating jobs.  These small projects employing up to 20 people will become very important in relation to job creation.</P>
      <P>The Government are also taking steps to ensure that the shortages of highly qualified and skilled labour which accompanied the rapid rise in agricultural output in 1978 and 1979 will not be repeated. As a result of the manpower education programme, output of graduate engineers will increase by a third between 1983 and 1984.  There will be a steady increase in output between 1985 and 1987 and a large increase between 1987 and 1988, mainly attributable to the work being done at the National Institutes for Higher Education in Limerick and Dublin.  The resulting output in 1990 will be double the output in 1980.  As regards technicians, full use is being made of facilities in regional technical colleges particularly in respect of engineering technician courses.  A very positive campaign to advertise these courses in the last 12 months has boosted considerably the number enrolling in them.  Whereas last year there was a significant number of courses under-subscribed returns now show that in 37 engineering technician courses surveyed, a total of 1,100 first year students had enrolled by November 1980, even though the capacity of the courses was only about 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Of major importance in determining employment levels in the future will be the impact of micro-processors and products incorporating micro-processors.  As Deputies know, we have been extremely successful in attracting to Ireland industries involved directly and indirectly in the manufacture of micro-processors. Employment in electronics has grown from 5,000 in 1975 to 10,000 last year and the expectations are for a level of employment in the industries of between 25,000 and 30,000 in 1985.  These developments have not happened accidentally but as a result of a deliberate policy by the IDA, supported by the positive action on the manpower and educational fronts to which I have referred, to attract to Ireland major international firms in the electronics industry.  From the point of view of manufacturing of electronic products and other products incorporating micro-processors, the employment effects would be very much on the positive side for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The implication of the new electronic technology for other employment sectors is not, however, so clear.  Past experience of the introduction of new technologies would certainly not support those who argue for large job losses.  We are an extremely open economy depending for our livelihood on exports and, in these circumstances, constrained to follow the most advanced and efficient methods of production.  Furthermore we are no longer a low cost producer country and this makes it more essential than ever for us to be efficient, to produce efficiently and to use the most advanced technology and methods of production to achieve these ends.</P>
    <P>The implications and potential of the new technology are obviously, therefore, of interest to all bodies in Ireland interested in development including Government, employers and the trade unions.  It was with the objective of obtaining an indication of the implications of the new technology for employment in this country that the National Board for Science and Technology undertook a study of the various effects caused by the introduction of micro-electronic technology.  The first phase of the report was published in May <Col N="769" /> 1980 and has attracted a considerable amount of interest and favourable comment, indicating that it is meeting a need for a balanced summary of the issues raised by micro-electronic technology. The second phase of the work now in progress is concerned with a detailed examination of the Irish economy, to determine ways in which micro-electronic technology might affect it over the coming decade.  The final report will be published within the next two months or so.</P>
    <P>Given the small size of our domestic market, we must look to the production of goods for export to provide many of the jobs necessitated by our expanding work force.  The world economic recession has been causing exceptionally high job losses internationally.  High levels of unemployment are being experienced in most western countries, both those in the OECD areas and the EEC.  In fact, Austria seems to have been the only OECD country to escape the rising trend in unemployment.  The growth of employment and productivity in the major industrialised countries, particularly Canada, the UK and USA, slowed down in the first half of 1980.  In the second half of the year employment fell in response to the decline in output.  Despite a slow down in growth in the labour force in the OECD area, the unemployment rate rose to a post war peak of almost 6 per cent of the labour force.  In Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK the unemployment rates increased by 56 per cent, 49 per cent and 66 per cent respectively in 1980 compared with an overall increase of 38 per cent here.  It is important to point that out.  Our experience of the 1974-76 recession is that an improvement in the unemployment situation occurred here much earlier than in some other EEC countries.  With the indications now that the recession is about to bottom out we will be in a favourable position to avail of the opportunities that will open up for us.</P>
    <P>As regards employment trends here, especially for young people, which will arise as a result of the new technology which is developing at a fast pace at present, the manpower consultative committee <Col N="770" /> emphasised that young people should not be regarded as a separate element in the labour market.  The Government accept that the best solution to youth unemployment lies in the creation of permanent jobs and young people will benefit from the many initiatives to which I have referred.  The terms of reference of the National Manpower Committee are to advise on the role of manpower policy in economic and social development. They have essentially been concerned with the better functioning of the labour market and the way in which we can direct young people into the opportunities that will be available for them.</P>
    <P>One area which will develop at a fast rate in the next few years is the metal and engineering side.  It was one of the fastest growing sectors in the seventies and now constitutes 23 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  Increased emphasis on both sectors was important for manpower requirements and it has employed a large proportion of specialised engineering skills.  For example, 90 per cent of tool makers and 60 per cent of fitters were employed in this sector.</P>
    <P>The electronics industry is a rapidly growing sector on the engineeering side and an indication of the importance of it can be seen from the figures that in 1975 5,000 people were employed in the industry while in June 1979 the figure had doubled to 10,000.  In the circumstances and in view of the fact that in many areas in this field we have shortages in these skills it is important to direct young people into them.  Schools, industry, parents and so on, have an important role to play in directing young people to the job opportunities that will be available for them in the new technological industries which will be expanding here in the future.  This is where the jobs will be in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no need for pessimism.  I should like to sound a warning to the Opposition, who have been forecasting gloom, that at this time students are in the run up to their examinations and it is not helpful to sound notes of warning and gloom and put additional pressures on young people leaving schools.  Job opportunities <Col N="771" /> will be there for them and in increasing numbers in the future.</P>

There are certain levels of reserves, for instance, general reserves, which are used as a back-up fund to meet any deterioration in the board's position.

In a question which I answered earlier this afternoon, and both Deputies were in the House, I pointed out quite clearly that the overall increase is 9.3 per cent.  The Deputies are not taking into consideration the non-recurring element, back-pay particularly, in last year's outturn.  The figure is 9.3 per cent globally, and only one-third of the total is in the non-pay area, the area during the current year to which inflation would apply.

    <P>Figures for the percentage of smokers in the population aged 16 and over show that the percentage of both male and <Col N="784" /> female smokers declined more rapidly in recent years in Ireland than in Norway. In 1973 the percentage of such smokers in the population in Norway was male 51 per cent, female 32 per cent, and in Ireland was male 48 per cent, female 38 per cent.  By 1978, the percentage of smokers in Ireland had declined by 8 per cent (males) and 7 per cent (females) compared with a decline in Norway of 6 per cent, males, and 1 per cent, females.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I do not propose at this stage to amend the current provisions.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the purpose of advertising is to sell a product and in the case of tobacco advertising to sell tobacco?

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a variety of regulations have been introduced the effect of which is to restrict the advertising media that may be used, to limit the content of advertisements, to require that certain advertisements and packages of cigarettes shall bear one of the prescribed health warnings, to provide for the curtailment of expenditure on advertising and sponsorship, to limit the form which advertising associated with sponsored events may take and to prohibit the use of coupons, gifts, substantial cut-price offers and so on.  The measures taken have proved particularly effective and, in comparison with the figures in respect of Norway, our figures are better.</P>

      <P>Galway Corporation requested me to make an Order in accordance with section 33 of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935 to prohibit as from 1 April 1981 the sale of milk in the Borough of Galway unless such milk complies with one of the four standards for milk designated by the Minister for Agriculture.  Two of these designations relate to non-pasteurised milk and two to pasteurised milk.</P>
      <P>Prior to submitting their application to me Galway Corporation considered representations from the Galway Milk Suppliers Association but having regard to medical and veterinary advice nevertheless requested me to make the necessary order.

      <P>The person concerned, who will attain age 65 years on 20 May 1981, has applied to my Department for a retirement pension.  As he will not have the required minimum average of 24 contributions paid or credited he will not qualify for pension from that date.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance and if he continues to be unemployed he will, however, qualify for unemployment benefit from 20 May 1981.  On attaining age 66 on 20 May 1982 he will by that time have an average of 21 contributions paid or credited and will accordingly qualify for old age contributory pension from that date.</P>
      <P>A condition requiring an average of contributions is a feature of retirement pension schemes generally and it is not proposed to remove this condition from the existing schemes of old age contributory pension and retirement pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the position concerning the administration of the scheme of maternity benefit in my Department, as stated by the Deputy, is accurate. None of the files relating to claims for maternity benefit is missing.  If for any reason such a file was not available alternative arrangements would be made for payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maternity benefits provided by my Department consist of a weekly maternity allowance payable on a woman's own insurance for a period of 12 weeks, 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after confinement and maternity grants of £8 payable on the insurances of both husband and wife.  Payment of maternity allowance to women who have the necessary qualifying contributions is made promptly in all cases provided the necessary claim form is fully and correctly completed and is received in my Department from one to two weeks in advance of the date of commencement of entitlement.  Since the beginning of January, however, some delays in payment have occurred mainly <Col N="800" /> because claimants have not quoted both their Revenue and Social Welfare Insurance numbers on claim forms submitted to my Department despite an extensive press and television advertisement campaign in December and January requesting them to do so.</P>
    <P>The new maternity allowance scheme for women in employment, for which provision is being made in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, should considerably improve the situation in regard to prompt payment as the claim form will provide for a certificate to be completed in advance by employers in all cases of women on approved maternity leave.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of any cases in which he considers that claimants are experiencing hardship through delay in payment I will arrange to have the cases investigated and payment of benefit issued as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The number of claims for maternity benefit received in my Department between 1 October and 31 December 1980 was 12,311.  Decisions have issued in all these claims with the exception of 390 cases in which further inquiries have been necessary before entitlement can be determined.</P>

      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle wishes, I will answer that.  It is not the question that is here but, if the Ceann Comhairle wishes, I will answer that question.  Since the Deputy has raised that question &mdash; the question of delays generally &mdash; which relate currently mainly to disability benefit and not to other areas if the claims are properly made, I should say that one of the difficulties currently experienced is the change-over which is going on at present. That is also exacerbated by the fact that a considerable number of queries, of the original claims, and of repeat claims, fail to carry the RSI and insurance numbers. I must say, sadly, that in January and <Col N="802" /> February a total of 369 cases brought to me by Deputies did not quote these numbers.  Of the total in the Dáil here today, 25 per cent of the questions do not quote the insurance number.  If these insurance numbers are not quoted it creates tremendous difficulty for the staff of my Department.  We carried out an extensive advertising campaign nationally to let everybody know that this change-over was taking place and that, from the beginning of January, it would be necessary to quote the two numbers in order to ensure immediate payment.  I can understand the problems which have arisen with the public in general.  But I would appeal to Deputies, when they put in queries, to get the RSI and insurance numbers, when we will deal with any queries from them very quickly.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Molloy refers to a case going back to 4 October last.  Is the Minister aware that there are people who have been without benefits since the beginning of the year, since January, who, when they write to the Minister, cannot get replies?  When they try to telephone they cannot get through, the number is engaged because of the huge number of people trying to ring the same number.  Is the Minister further aware that when one of my constituents, did get through he was abruptly told to go&mdash;a very obscene word was used&mdash;followed by a letter from the Minister's Department which was obscene, offensive and abusive and about which I will personally speak to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to give me evidence of both these instances. I do not think it is fair to quote them unless there is very specific and definite evidence about them.  The staff in the Department have been undertaking a very considerable burden of work with this change-over.  Because we discussed this before it started I would have hoped that Deputies would give the staff of the Department their co-operation at this <Col N="803" /> time.  I am afraid, looking at the lack of quotation of numbers alone, that has not been forthcoming.</P>

The reasons they do not get something &mdash; and I also am a TD and have found this quite frequently recently &mdash; is that people have not quoted their RSI numbers, that consequently the Department have no option but to start writing back to them.  That in itself is a long process.  Quite a few of the recipients will not be inclined to write back anyway and the problem develops.  As an ordinary TD, if I get a question like that, I first get the name and address, insurance number and RSI number and have no difficulty subsequently in sorting out the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of utilising my full time here on this concluding part of the debate on the budget. We have had over a month of discussion on the implications of the budget and its consequences and so on and this debate itself takes place at a time when there is a national strike gripping the country, the petrol dispute.  Fuel to industry is being cut off with the possibility of total closedown of the nation's economic life.  That in itself shows the way public affairs are tending here.  Therefore, I will simply confine myself, for the period for which <Col N="828" /> I intend speaking this afternoon, to referring once more to some of the failings in the budget, some of the rather gloomy consequences we can see flowing from it and to reiterating our call that the only decisive action left to this Government now is to clear the decks and permit a mandate to be given for a new Government.</P>
      <P>On every front our economy can be described without exaggeration as being in a state of dire crisis.  Unemployment stands at a record post-war level.  Redundancies outstrip job creation.  Agricultural incomes have been halved in the past two years.  Inflation is running at 15 to 20 per cent.  For the second year in a row the balance of payments deficit has exceeded £700 million.  Our trading resources are dwindling.  That is why it can be said without exaggeration that our economy is in a state of dire crisis.  If the country could be seen as a business trading organisation, the wise advice that would be given at this stage would be that it should be put into receivership.  This country has not yet been put into receivership, but there are many economists who think that, sooner or later, the patience of our creditors abroad will snap. Many observers point out that there are certain circumstances which presently permit us to borrow at our present rate. Such circumstances may change in the future.  If the situation changes in the Middle East, if the instability of certain of these regions disappears, then undoubtedly our borrowing capacity will quickly come to an end.</P>
      <P>Of course, the whole industrial relations situation could be described as being very serious indeed, as is characterised by having in the past two weeks both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour engaged generally in an effort to avert the strike now taking place.  Therefore, on all the characteristics of good government, of the way a country is proceeding, one can talk of chaos, failure, immense difficulties, inflation, unemployment, the adverse agricultural situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the budget our main charge is that it funked the task of dealing with the central problems of the economy.  It contributed <Col N="829" /> nothing to reducing unemployment.  On the inflation front, instead of combating rising inflation, it added to our rate of inflation.  It is reckoned that something like 3½ per cent will be added to price inflation as a result of the indirect taxation of the budget, and there are commentators who think that the rate of inflation this year will go nearer 17 per cent than the 15 or 16 per cent earlier thought.</P>
    <P>Of course any budget which seeks to make a contribution to improving industrial relations should address itself to the problem of inequity which is felt to exist in the PAYE sector.  We know the effect of the budget changes will be that this year the Exchequer will take about £140 million extra back from the PAYE sector, despite changes made in the budget by way of allowances.  The budget, therefore, did not address itself to the question of equity.</P>
    <P>I have held the view for some time now that, if we are to talk about improving industrial relations, while there may be some contribution to be made by setting up committees, by hearing the views of all sides and getting wisdom from all sources, one of the most significant contributions towards improving industrial relations would be the contribution of the Government in providing a fairer tax system.  Many of the disputes we have seen are a reflection of the revolt of the PAYE sector at what they see as their overtaxed position.  The self-employed person can, legally and properly, seek every loophole in the law to lessen his tax burden.  The only avenue of resistance open to the PAYE taxpayer is the strike weapon. That is the only area in which those fortunate enough to be still in employment can exert pressure for higher wages.  As a result we get these disputes, there is a long investigation and the causes of industrial discontent will be laid within the four walls of industry itself.  But the causes lie elsewhere, and a good area of search to lead us in the right direction is the overtaxed condition many PAYE people feel themselves to be in.  The budget did not confront that question. Certainly it has not convinced the organisations <Col N="830" /> representing the PAYE sector that it marked the first instalment of a programme of rectifying the injustices that their members feel exist in that system.  So, we have simmering discontent there and we face a good deal of difficulty of an industrial relations nature over the coming months such as we have been facing this very week and over the last fortnight.  A court is sitting on the matter today, and we have had this very serious dispute.  Unless there can be a resolution of that dispute this very week many businesses will grind to a halt and there may be Members of this House whose activities as Members of parliament will have to cease from tomorrow or the day after because they will have no petrol to enable them to drive about.</P>
    <P>The problem is even more horrific in its implications for industry and jobs. Unemployment is historically high and this is giving rise to a good deal of insecurity.  There are, perhaps, tolerable levels of unemployment with which a community can live, but we are passing that point here in our own community.  Since September the rate of unemployment has intensified to the level of a job loss of 300 almost per day.  Speaking honestly from either side of the House, one cannot claim to see any upturn in the Irish economy or any basis of hope on which one can say to those unemployed that we believe that such is the improvement in the economy that the possibility exists that later this year they will find gainful employment.  All the omens point the other way, to an increase in unemployment throughout the year.</P>
    <P>In so far as the budget did not adopt any long-term strategy to defeat inflation it shirked the central problems facing our economy.  The budget shirked the question of winding down inflation and, in fact, added to the rate of our inflation. This means that hope for our economy should have been based on the premise of attempting to expand our industrial sector on increased exports later this year as the economies of our trading partners revived.  Most commentators agree that this would have been the correct point of recovery for the economy to adopt.  If we were to avail of this revival in export <Col N="831" /> markets later this year our exports would have to be able to compete with those other countries.  We would be up against the problem of our present rate of inflation and we would be competing with products with lower cost increases. Instead of assisting us towards getting ourselves into a position of greater competitiveness, the budget has added to our burden of costs.  It has put pressure on the unions representing employees in the national understanding second phase to look for compensating increases for the increases in indirect taxation that took place in the budget.  The budget repeated the error of the previous years budgets in relying excessively on an increase in indirect taxation.  The increases in petrol and other items will have a very adverse effect on the state of industrial relations. It does not take much foresight to say that.  Every Minister who addresses himself to the necessity of improving industrial relations will have to look at the fact that the Government's own budget has contributed to a worsening of industrial relations because greater pressure, as a result of the budget, will be placed on the negotiators to look for compensating increases in the second phase.  Indeed, whether the second phase of the national understanding will survive is anyone's guess.  It does not take much imagination to come to the conclusion that trade unions will be forced to demand compensation for the taxes on the various items in the budget.</P>
    <P>A good deal of comment has been addressed to the question of the effect of the increase in petrol prices.  It is reckoned that the cost of running a small, average car now with the present increases involved would be something like £55 per week.  That is serious enough for the ordinary citizen and God knows, around the country a small car is a vital necessity to enable many to get to work, such is the bad condition of public transport.  One can imagine the effect the increase in the budget on diesel fuel and so on will have in the increased costs for industry itself.  That high industrial burden of increases in diesel duties again will add its own quota of difficulties to the <Col N="832" /> competitiveness of our industry later this year.</P>
    <P>No sector of industry that I know of from any report I have read, and no meetings I have had with businessmen recently show much confidence of an improvement during this year.  The picture is very gloomy indeed with no improvement visible on the immediate horizon and nothing taking place that can give us any grounds for confidence that there will be an about-turn, improvement or revival.  All we can see in the immediate future is the continuation of the same deterioration that we have been observing over recent months.  We may see the usual seasonal improvement in employment over the summer months. That will evaporate quickly by the autumn and it is anybody's guess as to what the unemployment figure will be next winter.  Certainly it will exceed the figure we see here this winter.</P>
    <P>Presumably, the budget could have addressed itself to these problems.  It did not do so, and the opportunity of sending the message forth to the country that the Government with their mandate running into next year were anxious to face squarely the problems before the country was lost, as it was lost in the previous budget.  Our neighbouring country has had what was referred to as a winter of industrial discontent.  Looking at the number of difficulties and negotiations at present reaching an <i>impasse</i> in various parts of the economy, one can speak without exaggeration of a spring of industrial discontent in Ireland this current year.  We have the present national strike and there are areas known to those who have any interest in these matters and, I am sure, to the Ministers concerned with the economy and so on where similar trouble is in the offing and where one can see further confrontation and further strikes.</P>
    <P>There have been cutbacks in local government spending and obviously we are going to see a deterioration in the quality of service being offered by the various local authorities later this year.  We are going to see many difficulties arising there and, again, little guidance is given <Col N="833" /> to local authorities on how they are to cope with this situation.</P>
    <P>The overall criticism that can be made arising from the budget is the sense of the lack of direction that appears to emanate from this budget.  Its greatest weakness was that it attempted to face in many different directions and did not quite succeed in convincing any one of the sectors it sought to please that this package in the budget was meant as a serious package.  It went a little part of the road with everyone but not quite far enough and, as some people have said, fell between two stools.  The only amendment I would make to that is that it is worse than that.</P>
    <P>All of the interest groups are equally discontented with the budget which itself suffered from indecision about what was being sought in it.  It was thought it would be an election budget.  In a sense, all budgets are election budgets since the House comes into existence as a result of an election.  Most commentators would have given it a better welcome if it was seen as an honest attempt to face up to the numerous problems which we are facing.  It received some legitimate praise because it sought to solve the problems faced by the under-privileged by increasing social welfare payments.  That section is so buffeted in recent years because of inflation that it would take a far greater effort than simply the alms of one budget to improve their lot decisively.  But there was an attempt to keep the standard of the incomes of the poorer sections ahead of inflation.  I do not know if it is possible to do that.</P>
    <P>There have been constant price increases in recent months in items which comprise the major proportion of spending of such groups.  One would have thought in their fourth year in office that the Government could have attempted, at least in one of their years in office, to match the record of the previous Government.  The previous Government attempted to lower the qualifying age for the old age pension.  In what could presumably be the second last year of the present Government, I am disappointed that the qualifying age for the old age pension has not been reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> My main criticism is the budget's failure to attempt the very difficult task&mdash;I concede it is difficult&mdash;of winding down inflation.  If we fail in that task, everything else drops with it.  If we do not remove the pressures on unions to seek compensation in higher wage claims, we will price our products out of foreign markets and it is only on trading with those markets that we can base any recovery of our economy.  Our balance of payments difficulties prevent us continuing the formula of the 1977 manifesto of refuelling on the basis of increasing demand in the home economy.</P>
    <P>The greatest tragedy that afflicted this Government was the presence in their midst of a qualified economist.  Never before had a Fianna Fáil Cabinet been burdened with such knowledge and qualifications.  The advice apparently administered from that source and included in the Manifesto was that it was possible to bring about almost full employment by fuelling domestic demand as though our economy was one of those models spoken of in the comfort and security of university seminars.  It was supposed to be a closed economy when, in fact, it is probably one of the most open in western Europe.  As was pointed out in 1977 by many economists, to the degree we were fuelling demand in the home economy, we were improving employment prospects in those foreign countries with whom we traded, and the foreign cars and goods which we would import would not add to jobs in the home economy.  No one in the present Government would now concede, looking at our balance of payments, which was a direct consequence of that kind of policy in 1977 and 1978, that we could do that.</P>
    <P>It will be a slow recovery.  Nobody pretends we can have a rapid recovery in job creation, if it is based on the only secure base for increasing jobs which is in industry, trading with the outside world.  We can only get an increase there if we are able to compete with foreign market competitors.  If our rate of inflation increases our costs to the point where our goods are not competitive in those markets, there will be no expansion in employment.  This Government have <Col N="835" /> made many protestations on the principal political aims of the national interest.  The principal economic aim, of equal importance, perhaps of more importance, to the political aim of unity, is to maximise the conditions for increasing employment.</P>
    <P>In a previous administration, I regarded my role as pre-eminently contributing to that prime national objective. Every action of the Government must be measured by the effect those actions can have on maximising employment.  How do we make our industry competitive and so efficient that it will be able to sustain more jobs in the future?  If we forget that national economic objective, we commit treason and ignore the reality of the great numbers of young people looking for jobs.  Of course, artificially, from one year to another you can suggest by certain figures, by increasing the numbers in the public service, based on external borrowings, that you have increased employment appreciably.  It is a mirage to think that the expansion of the public service means that we have a productive base on which jobs can be sustained in the future. The only productive base on which jobs can be sustained is industry, exporting to countries abroad.  I do not rule out the question of industry based on export markets.  My political beliefs would incline me to the conclusion that we should also explore very fully the possibility of expanding State industrial employment in partnership with private industry and see if that would produce more jobs.</P>
    <P>Little progress has been made in convincing the PAYE sector that the Government were anxious to meet their demands to make the taxation system fairer.  The budget did not address itself to the problem of inflation.  It added to the rate of inflation.  Ministers may say it was a half per cent less or a half per cent of one per cent less, but most commentators agree that the budget added three per cent to our rate of inflation.  Since the rate of inflation did not loom very large in the minds of the architects of the budget, one wonders what they were basing the revival of the economy on, whether they considered it or what were the factors uppermost in their minds. <Col N="836" /> There was no winding down of unemployment or inflation in the budget.</P>
    <P>We look forward with no great eagerness or joy to the fact that by the end of the year we will have about 140,000 people out of work.  Unemployment has been sharp in the construction industry. Spokesmen for that industry have pointed to increased difficulties in the future.  There has been a very great number of redundancies in the food processing industry and the textile industry is also severely affected.  There have been job losses even in the semi-State sector, an area which up to now was regarded as one of the most secure in terms of employment.  But the chief casualty of this budget has been the area of industrial relations.  Instead of relieving the pressure on the unions to seek higher wage claims to compensate for the increases in the cost of living, the budget has had the effect of intensifying pressure on them.</P>
    <P>Ministers who have spoken during the debate have defended the additional indirect taxation by saying that it applies to discretionary items.  Regardless of what play there may be on words, the unions regard the consumer price index as the reliable index on which to base wage claims and, despite the efforts of anybody to alter that criteria, that index remains the basic measurement for wage increases.  Whatever about increased duty on cigarettes or on alcohol, the increased duty on petrol is not discretionary.  Having regard to the state of public transport in many parts of the country, to the location of work in this city and to the fact that many employees must start work at a very early hour, it is essential, obviously, that workers have their own transport.  Therefore, there is no question of discretion so far as the price of petrol is concerned.  I have referred already to the effects on industrial costs resulting from the increase in the price of diesel oil.  We are not far from the day when a gallon of petrol will cost £2.  We face further increases in the cost of this commodity this year, either from OPEC or by way of the continued deterioration of the púnt against the dollar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Considering our predominantly young work force and the predominantly youthful nature of the population, one would have expected something to have been done by way of reducing housing costs. A very high proportion of a person's income is necessary to meet the cost of housing.  If the Government had taken some action to reduce the initial cost of house purchase, the effect would have been very beneficial and would have relieved some of the pressure on the unions to seek higher wages for their members.  Action on those lines would have played an important part also in improving industrial relations because of the strong pressure that must be applied in wage bargaining as a result of the cost of housing in itself.</P>
    <P>The case for the farmers has been put frequently in the House.  Many Deputies have referred to the halving of farmers' incomes and to the conditions in which that sector are operating.  I understand that part of the reason for our coming out of the previous recession rather well was the buoyant state of agriculture at the time.  We were helped then also by reason for our membership of the EEC because the price structures and the financial assistance that emanated from Brussels were favourable to our farmers. Unfortunately, such a situation does not obtain today.  I heard with interest within the past day or so the statement of one farm leader that the gains of the previous few years as a result of our membership of the EEC had been wiped out in the past two years.  I do not know whether that statement would stand up to scrutiny, but undoubtedly there has been a deterioration in the living standards of farmers in the past two years, and that in itself had an adverse effect on the rest of the community.  Our economy was in reasonably good shape in the early part of 1977, though we had not at that point witnessed the carry-through into an increase in employment of the recovery that had taken place.  That increase in employment was experienced later in 1977.  Everything we did between 1976 and 1977 was designed to exploit the opportunities of the recovery that was evident in the economies around us and <Col N="838" /> to ensure that our economy, which had been through a bad recession and which had suffered very sharp increases in fuel prices, would be in a position to benefit from the recovery.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are many who will agree with me when I say that the action we took in 1976 and 1977 contributed in no small measure to the very significant increase in industrial employment in 1977 and 1978 and to the recovery in those years.  There are Government Ministers who, having fought the election on the basis of the Fianna Fáil manifesto, would claim that the policies of that document were responsible for the recovery.  There are dangers in any Government accepting <i>in toto</i> the advice of any one expert in any one discipline.  That danger manifested itself when the new Fianna Fáil Cabinet listened to the economist in their ranks but found that his advice was the incorrect advice.  I am sure that the majority of economists would agree that the strategy adopted in the years 1977 and 1978, as outlined in the manifesto, was wrong in that it fuels the economy when the recovery was well under way. The borrowings that were undertaken at that time robbed us of the manoeuvrability that was needed badly later.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that he was attempting to cut down the rate of borrowing as a proportion of GNP.  He made the point that, if we cut back too sharply on our rate of borrowing, the effect on the economy would be disastrous especially at the time of such deep recession.  I agree that the reduction had to be gradual, but time is running out in that regard.  There are some who say that our creditors abroad are losing their patience with us.  None of us can put a final date on when that will happen, but it may be sooner than some of our policy makers seem to think.  There is something very seriously wrong with an economy which has a deficit of the magnitude of our deficit.  One need not belong to the monetarist school at all to realise that. There is every need to be alarmed at the extent of our foreign indebtedness.  What is even more serious is the way this borrowed money is being spent.  We have not ensured that in all cases it is being <Col N="839" /> spent on capital infrastructure and, even in terms of the investment there has been in the capital area, this investment has not been of the wisest type possible.</P>
    <P>We end this budget debate in the middle of a national stoppage brought about by the fuel supply situation.  That situation is having its effect on factories throughout the country.  All credit is due to those institutions who are attempting to bring about a resolution of this very serious dispute.  The public might be pardoned for thinking that perhaps the centre of interest today in terms of our problems is not here in this Chamber but is elsewhere.  To some extent we in this Parliament are on-lookers of the real action that is taking place elsewhere.  The country has no clear indication of what is the overall recipe of the Government for economic recovery.  They appear to be an administration who are operating between crises in so far as coping with our problems are concerned.  It must be said that at times they are coping with some imagination but that overall they are lacking in terms of a sense of direction.  In a sense the Government's actions are being dictated by the election, because an election is already underway, though not declared.  No date has been given but in fact we have a Government who are almost at this moment electioneering.</P>
    <P>It is bad for the country that this electioneering hysteria is taking over, It would be much better to have firm announcements of dates and that the Government should go back to the task of governing since they have a mandate until next year or else they should come clean with the country and declare that an election is to be called.  The country cannot much longer afford to stave off real, hard decisions that must be taken. We can no longer pussyfoot with such matters as inflation; we must tackle unemployment.  Action on these matters cannot be postponed while this electioneering hysteria takes over.  Therefore, we need from the Government more leadership.  The leadership I should like to see would be that of deciding to tell the <Col N="840" /> country clearly what the Government's intentions are about the election date.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the budget shirked the task of dealing with the major problems of the economy.  That is our main criticism of the budget.  Valuable time is being lost. We need either a new administration or the present administration returned with a fresh mandate.  We must start afresh. This is something I have mentioned before: I believe that all of this Government's mistakes owe their origin to the mistaken assumptions of the manifesto programme.  That document had the wrong recipes for the Irish situation and those incorrect recipes were followed to the letter for too long by the present administration until it was too late to switch.  Now, late in their administration, they are unclear as to what exactly they should do.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that collectively as a Cabinet they should decide whether to go their full term and by doing so take decisive action in dealing with some of the problems before us.  Otherwise they should call it a day and seek a fresh mandate.  There is, I think, among the electorate a realisation that there are matters seriously wrong with our economy.  There is genuine anxiety among parents of young people who are unemployed.  They will not be codded by a renewal of promises that cannot be implemented.  They want to see real action in regard to unemployment.  They realise that artificial expansion of the public service based on foreign borrowing is no lasting answer to the problem of providing secure jobs.  There is great insecurity even among those in employment as to whether their jobs will be there this year not to speak of next year. One way to banish that insecurity would be for the Government to start governing at this point or else call it a day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I agree with Deputy O'Leary that the Government should call it a day and get out or else start governing.  With all the changes we have had in the Fianna Fáil Party in the past couple of years the people expected that the Government would govern.  One of the indications that they would govern <Col N="841" /> this year would be the budget introduced at the end of January but in the few weeks since since then the budget or, since the pattern of 1979 and 1980 appears to be followed this year again, the most recent instalment of the budget has evoked a storm of criticism around the heads of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and the Government party generally. Given the contents of the package the only surprising thing about it is that the Government themselves are surprised that it is criticised.  The measures proposed by the Government do little or nothing to further the stated aims of Government policy and the figures on which these measures have been based are now generally considered to be totally unrealistic.  That has been pointed out umpteen times in this debate.  For the third year running Fianna Fáil are relying on what amounts to cooking the books in order to avoid choosing between unpalatable measures or credibility.  Deputy FitzGerald on these benches has been hammering home the failures and damages of the various positions adopted by the Government but in not even one case&mdash;and I have read most of the speeches by Ministers, unless the Minister does it here today&mdash;have the charges been refuted which Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy D'Arcy, Deputy Ryan and others on this side made.  Instead, various Ministers have relied on spurious and unfounded optimism, an optimism totally invisible to those outside the Government party. Some of that optimism from the opposite benches is backed by what I can only describe as scurrilous attacks on the good standing of independent economists who are critical of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to waste time repeating what already has been said on the detailed proposals offered by the Minister for Finance.  The reaction of farmers, industrialists, consumers, business people and independent economists who are not open to the charge of being politically biased are far more eloquent testaments to the bankruptcy of what has been put forward as a policy than any criticism of mine could be.  It is very difficult to recall a budget that has so succeeded in uniting every section of society in condemning <Col N="842" /> its contents.  At the same time it manages to do nothing to secure a measure of control over the growth of Government spending.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to several misrepresentations on which the budget has been based and to expose the total absence not only of a policy but of any understanding of what Government economic policy is about. In two major respects the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have sought to conceal the truth about Government finances from Members of the House who are supposed to approve of them.  They also sought to conceal them from the people, the unfortunate taxpayers who eventually will have to foot the bill.  In the first case they produced figures of Government spending for 1981 which even on the most casual examination can be seen as utterly unbelievable.  I refer to the Book of Estimates published before the budget.  In the second case both the Taoiseach and the Minister have tried to confuse the House and the media about the methods of financing the Government's capital programme.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister for Finance stated that current spending other than on servicing the national debt was budgeted to rise by only 9 per cent in 1981 while the non-pay elements of this spending would rise by only 3 per cent. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Never the less, the total of non-capital Estimates for the Supply Services &mdash; generally speaking the ordinary day-to-day expenditures on salaries and services by Departments &mdash; shows an increase of only 9 per cent in cash terms on what was actually spent in 1980.  Non-pay services have been severely pruned.</P>
    <P>Frankly, these figures are simply unbelievable.  The Minister more or less admitted as much later in his speech.  In the passage dealing with public sector pay, he signalled clearly that he regarded the allocation to meet special claims already in the pipeline as being inadequate to meet these claims.  He said &ldquo;I am therefore allocating in the budget a further sum of £80 million to cover any <Col N="843" /> increases in pay and pensions for which provision has not already been made in the Estimates.&rdquo;  Again, in what I can only describe as a display of the Government's weakness in this sensitive area, he explicitly threatened and implicitly promised an increase in the tax burden of the private sector as a means of financing further increases in the public sector.  He says:</P>
    <P>The Government fully appreciate the contribution that public servants are making to national development, but in the present critical situation they would hope that public servants would have regard to the greater degree of security attaching to their employment and be prepared to moderate, or not to press, claims which they otherwise would consider justified.  I would earnestly ask all concerned to consider the matter seriously in the national interest.  Failure to respond to this appeal will regrettably mean the imposition of further taxation and reduction of services.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister for Finance speaking in Dáil Éireann on 28 January 1981. On 27 February 1980, the then Minister for Finance, same Party, same Government, different man again speaking about special increases says:</P>
    <P>If, in the event, this provision has to be increased, I am determined that we will not have a recurrence of last year's experience whereby such excess expenditure added to borrowing.  I shall, if necessary, introduce supplementary proposals whether by way of increasing revenue or decreasing services, to cover any excess costs.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 7 February 1979, same Party, same Government, different Minister again, talking about the White Paper on National Development, said:</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that it will succeed. I must make it clear, however, that if it does not the Government will not abdicate their responsibilities.  We cannot allow a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; to take place which would damage everyone's prospects but especially those of the weakest <Col N="844" /> and poorest people in our community.</P>
    <P>Three Ministers, same Government, same party, one year after the other &mdash; all threatening because they have not done their own job as Minister for the Public Service in charge of keeping the lid on public sector pay.  If they do not do their job, they are going to vent their ire on the general public by raising taxes even further.  We all know that this means absolutely nothing.  These are only words.  The Ministers, Deputy Colley, Deputy O'Kennedy, Deputy Fitzgerald, utter precisely the same words, the same threats and have the same record of not having done their job and of not fulfilling the threats.  This is a sorry trio presiding over the virtual collapse of the Irish economy because they do not have the guts to take the necessary action.  This is at a time when, for all sorts of social and democratic reasons, they should have been turning their attention to governing the country in a practical fashion instead of engaging in in-fighting within their own party.</P>
    <P>As far as the non-pay elements in the Government's spending are concerned the three per cent ceiling in nominal terms, if we are taking it on a 13 per cent rate of inflation, indicates a 10 per cent cut in real terms.  That is completely undermined by the contents of the 1981 Book of Estimates.  In the first place, it is hard to accept as serious pre-budget estimates any figures for Government spending introduced by an administration which, in the previous fiscal year, under-estimated its spending requirements by £460 million.  They were wrong by that amount last year.  Supplementary Estimates for that amount were introduced during 1980 and the increase in actual spending was roughly in line with those Estimates.  How could anyone believe the 1981 figures?  It is obvious that it is going to be wrong by a larger amount this year, especially when the Minister who introduces these figures has this to say about the Government's performance in the previous year.  This is quite funny.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Estimates sanctioned <Col N="845" /> last year represent for the most part deliberate and considered departures from budget and went to meet the needs of the emerging economic situation.</P>
    <P>Deliberate and considered departures from budget &mdash; this was the £460 million by which the Government got their figures wrong for 1980.  It is reassuring to know that their failure to hit the target and their over-spending were not incidental.  This raises an important question about the budget.  We have become accustomed to the strategy of announcing tax changes in instalments so as to avoid serving up all the bad news at once.  The classic and possibly the first example of this, was the stealth with which the food subsidies were removed over a New Year's weekend two years ago.  This was a budgetary measure at the time and the Government hoped to hide this bad news under the general New Year celebrations.  In the last two years one could associate nothing but bad news with this Government and they have become very experienced at releasing bad news at times when they hope it will do least harm to themselves.  A favourite time is Friday morning, when the Dáil members have gone home and perhaps the sports fixtures of Satuday morning will distract attention.</P>
    <P>Now, however, we are being asked to accept overall budget policy in discreet packages, without even being offered a coherent explanation of the overall strategy, if it exists at all.  As estimate after estimate is amended, we are asked to believe that this is part of a thought-out plan.  The reality is that when these estimates were being introduced before Christmas in the House &mdash; and I am sorry that this point did not occur to me earlier or I would have looked it up &mdash; the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech that this was not something that happened by accident, but was a deliberate part of the plan.  I would like to have the opportunity of looking up the debates on the Supplementary Estimates in the autumn of last year.  I would be interested to know how the Minister claimed at that time that they were introducing Supplementary <Col N="846" /> Estimates which were to be regarded as part of a thought-out plan that had been conceived beforehand and was now being brought to fruition.  The reality is that they were introduced, in spite of the high-sounding phrases and the rhetoric of strong Government and no industrial relations problems, during the current Dáil.</P>
    <P>Having engineered a <i>coup</i> among the backbenchers in the party to bring him to power, the Taoiseach is now stealing around in fear somebody else is doing the same thing to him.  For that reason his judgment and assessment would be that the economy is in serious economic difficulties.  Last year it was said a strong Government was needed.  Because he was afraid of a <i>coup</i> the Taoiseach had to give way to the pressures from those sources at the end of last year and blow the budget estimates of February 1980 of the then Minister for Finance, Mr. O'Kennedy.  This year he introduced this spurious volume which will suffer the same fate, unless there is an election in the meantime and there is a change of Government, because the figures on which it is based are false.</P>
    <P>We put forward a Dáil reform policy most of which was put together by Deputy Bruton a few years ago.  There is a case for reviewing the question of the desirability of annual budgeting on current and capital accounts.  A 12-month time span may be too long for current spending in so far as it is designed to fine tune the economy.  Equally, capital budgeting on a one year basis would not be acceptable to private industry, and should be less so to the Government. Budgeting would be better expressed in terms of flows of revenue and expenditure per unit of time rather than in terms of amounts received in an arbitrary time period.  This latter practice enables the Government to get away with the kind of sleight of hand displayed in this budget by bringing forward tax payment dates for corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>This is one of the items in the budget which appears to have been thrown in as the Government scrambled around looking for money to put into the revenue side of the budget.  The tax payment dates <Col N="847" /> for the corporation tax was put in to give £60 million.  Once it is in, it will become part of the Finance Bill which will be passed, much as we oppose it, because the Government have such a majority. One of the greatest weaknesses of this Government is that even with their big majority they are afraid to do the slightest thing that might be considered to be unpopular by one small section of the community.  Contained in that Bill will be a measure to bring forward the payment of £60 million into 1981.  There will be three tax payments where there would normally be two in the financial year April 1981 to April 1982.  This was done by a Minister and sanctioned by a Government who apparently do not have the slightest conception of how many businesses are teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.  The only way these people will get that £60 million is by putting themselves further in debt by borrowing from the banks, interfering with their cash flows and bringing in, on top of already almost non-existent profits, a further charge of the interest on that money. If firms go out of business in that financial year, the Minister and the Government will have to take a large share of the blame for the resultant job losses.  What the Government are doing is increasing the amount of tax to be paid by businesses by 50 per cent in one year.  I am sure every business organisation in the country has been making representations to the Minister in this regard.  I appeal to the Minister between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill to drop this crazy charge before he puts another few thousand people on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>The criticisms I have made of the existing system do not warrant the complete abandonment of any serious attempt at the formulation of a budgetary policy, either with reference to public finances or to the impact of taxation and expenditure on the economy as a whole.  That is precisely what we have seen taking place in 1979 and in 1980 and which I believe will take place in 1981.  I will not go back over the ground which I have already covered.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Book of Estimates <Col N="848" /> contains a set of figures designed to add up to a pre-ordained total rather than an honest presentation of the cost of Government.  As Deputy O'Leary said, every budget is an election budget.  The further we get from the last election date the more hysterical and abandoned the Government become and they throw out the normal disciplines that should apply to a budget.  The approach based on a 10 per cent cut in real Government non-pay spending is blatantly justifiable and, indeed, incredible.  Why should the taxpaying public be asked to pay more of their hard earned money while civil servants receive salary increases for doing less because of the cuts in those Estimates?  The Minister said they will increase by only 3 per cent, which is a cut of 10 per cent in real terms.  Consequently, there will be less for public servants to do while the cost of public service pay increases.  Clearly these figures the Government are using are unconnected with economic reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance admitted in his speech that he knew well his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, intended raising postal and phone charges during 1981.  It is possible, but hardly likely, he had not been informed that the increase would be as much as 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  In this book we find that a startling set of figures for Government requirements in postal and phone services run into the first 30 heads of expenditure.  The post office service ranges from an increase of 300 per cent for the courts to a reduction of 55 per cent for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Gardaí have been allocated a 1.6 per cent increase in postal charges and the Department of the Taoiseach got only 5 per cent.  The Office of Public Works got a 39 per cent increase while the Department of Finance are being asked to manage with only an extra 12 per cent increase.  It might be argued that the Revenue Commissioners did not know there would be an increase in postal charges but that could hardly be said in respect of the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Justice receives 72 per cent and one might wonder why he would make more phone calls than the Minister for <Col N="849" /> Finance since they live approximately the same distance from Dublin.  The Stationery Office lose 40 per cent in spite of the fact that telephone charges are going up by over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are those of us who might reasonably consider that the use of letters and telephones is an index of activity, if not productivity, in Government Departments and agencies of State.  How are we expected to interpret these figures?  If we believed them we could hope to see a dramatic improvement in the work of the courts and a fall in the crime rate and, blessed news, less attention from the Revenue Commissioners and the inspector of taxes since their telephone bill is to go down by 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>During his budget speech the Minister took time off from an account of the Government's mishandling of the economy to deliver a homily on tax evasion and to draw attention to the increased number of staff in the Revenue Commissioners.  I looked in vain for a suggestion that we were to be spared from their attention in 1981 to such a degree that postal and telephone charges would be lower by 55 per cent.  The conclusion is that all these figures are hogwash.</P>
    <P>Under the vote for Secondary Education there is provision for an increase of £100,000 from £13.6 million to £13.7 million in supplemental grants to secondary schools in lieu of tuition fees.  Since school costs would rise parallel with inflation we must come to the conclusion either that school managements will have to dip into their own resources or parents will be required to make &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; contributions.  Many people are aware that school managements are strapped for funds already.  Under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture there has been a 50 per cent cut in aid to agricultural schools and a 60 per cent cut in scholarships and training.  It must be remembered that this is the Department which looks after our principal industry.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates is riddled with such anomalies and there is not a single major heading under which all the items included would pass a credibility test.  If one were credulous enough to accept the Estimates the unavoidable conclusion <Col N="850" /> would be that the taxpayer is to be asked to pay more in order to receive less, while the public service will be doing less, through no fault of their own, because the money will not be provided to continue services at the same level as in 1980. Fortunately we do not live in a world where such a scenario is credible.  Consequently I accept the general conclusion offered by all informed and unbiased commentators that the current expenditure figures contained in the budget are deceptive and based on a conscious attempt to mislead this House and the taxpaying public into the belief that the Government have the current budget deficit under control.</P>
    <P>Let us start from the premise that the level of public sector output remains constant and that all the alleged economies are enforced.  In this situation the non-pay element of public service spending would rise by at least 13 per cent in 1981 and possibly by as much as 15 per cent. Total public expenditure would be higher by between £150 million and £250 million and the current budget deficit in that case would be higher by between £100 million and £180 million, allowing for a tax clawback of about 35 per cent.  The figure of £550 million reached by the Minister was based not only on the unreliable expenditure estimates already described but on absurd figures for unemployment costs. Unemployment is already up by 25 per cent on last year and it must be remembered that from the point of view of the Exchequer the most recent entrants to the unemployment ranks are the most expensive because the amount they receive declines the longer they are unemployed, the pre-budget estimate of the cost of unemployment assistance in 1981 was up by only 3 per cent on the 1980 figures, including supplementaries. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare both gave the impression that there were in this budget very substantial benefits to the unemployed.  The reality is totally different.</P>
    <P>I hear a huge number of complaints that the Government cannot be trusted, that what they say and what it turns out to be is always different.  That is certainly true about the social welfare budget and <Col N="851" /> the impression given in the headlines after the budget that there would be a 25 per cent increase in social welfare.  The Minister for Finance referred to it in his budget speech and the Minister for Social Welfare in his budget contribution did not explain that this figure was not correct and that it did not apply to all the recipients of social welfare.  This only became apparent on the publication of the Social Welfare Bill in the last four or five days. We will have a lot to say about that bill when it comes before the House next week.  These are only some of the falsifications on which the budget is based. There can be no doubt that the true figure for the budget deficit in 1981 will not be £515 million but will be in the region of £700 million.  That is £185 million over what the Minister is forecasting.</P>
    <P>On page 15 of this booklet <i>Budget 1981,</i> the Minister says that, as Minister for Finance, he will have the support of his colleagues in special measures to ensure that the allocation for these services will not be exceeded in 1981.  The Minister will have precisely the same support as Deputy O'Kennedy had and as Deputy Colley had &mdash; that was none, because they were all too busy plotting in the back benches as to how to get rid of one another.  If the Minister gets that support he will be luckier than his two predecessors.  Deputy O'Kennedy found out, not to his cost, and Deputy Colley found out, to his cost, that when it came to looking after their own skins some of their colleagues were more concerned with doing that than with keeping the Government's finances in order.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the second area where the Government have attempted to hide behind an inordinate deception in relation to public spending, the Investment Plan, 1981.  This is an extraordinary document.  It is not a plan in any sense of the word.  It introduces a novel although unexplained idea of private sector financing of Government borrowing and it is the first time that any Government have introduced a combination of do-it-your-self and suggestion box without a statement of their economic intentions.  A plan is a consistent set of objectives or <Col N="852" /> policy targets together with a feasible set of policy instruments designed to achieve them and a clear and qualified co-ordination of targets and instruments.  What the investment plan contains is a set of pious aspirations and a list of pre-publication figures from the capital budget programme, which at that stage had not been published.  It is, in other words, a statement of what money the Government proposes to spend and in what areas.</P>
    <P>Apart from a vague reference, repeated in the Financial Statement, to the need to concentrate on productive investment, the document contained no analysis worth talking about of the country's economic position.  There has been no attempt to tailor means to ends in any consistent fashion.  In so far as any target is specifically referred to, it is the vague concept of increased growth and a rise in employment.  We look in vain for references to capital output ratios, rates of interest, quantified improvements in labour and total factor productivity. Where employment is concerned we are assured that 10,000 new jobs will materialise.  We are not told how they will be financed, when they will come and where they will be.  We are not enlightened as to how this increase in Government capital spending in 1981 will reverse the trend in unemployment which a similar increase failed to reverse during 1980.</P>
    <P>As part of this dubious exercise the idea of private investment in the State's capital programme is introduced.  I have no doubt that the application of competitive efficient standards to public sector programmes is highly desirable and I would not object if the idea was well thought out and presented properly.  The suggestion that some untapped pool of private funds amounting to £200 million is available for investment is simply a fairy tale.  It is another example of the Government scratching around everywhere, taking fictitious figures to present as near as possible a balanced budget. The word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; is hardly the right word in view of the projected £700 million deficit.  In the investment plan we are told that discussions have taken place and <Col N="853" /> in the budget statement we were told that preliminary soundings were encouraging.</P>
    <P>However, the Government have never outlined the source of these funds.  Where will they come from?  Will they come from profits from industry and services, insurance companies, private pension funds, the banks, or an increased flow of personal savings?  We are not told, but we know &mdash; and anyone can check this from the Stock Exchange data &mdash; that if the top 50 listed companies here were to suspend for this year the payment of all dividends, were to undertake no investment out of earnings and were to commit no funds to reserves, the total funds available from these firms would be nowhere like the £200 million mentioned in this investment plan.  It is only a method of appearing not to be borrowing either at home or abroad and of appearing to attempt to keep down the level of borrowing which will have to be undertaken this year.</P>
    <P>We also know that, if pension funds are to re-allocate money of this order to the yet unspecified profitability projects in the public sector, they will be largely at the expense of direct lending to the Government so the Government's sale of gilts would fall by nearly if not as much as the insurance companies took up of the new investment opportunities.  If the Government succeeded in raising £200 million in this manner, which is extremely unlikely, they would be obliged to borrow more or less the same amount from other sources at home or abroad to make up for the drop in the sale of gilts.  Since the Government are already setting up all the available funds from the non-banking public this leaves only monetary financing by borrowing more from overseas or by increasing the money stock by borrowing from the banking system at home.  This implies that the £200 million private investment figure is simply a crude subterfuge to disguise an increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Far from Exchequer borrowing falling from 14½ per cent to 13 per cent of GNP, this year it will rise by at least 15 per cent.  Everybody can see through this subterfuge.</P>
    <P>The Government will hardly admit to <Col N="854" /> that, although everybody else understands what is happening. The public sector borrowing requirement will be over 19 per cent.  If we add the deliberate underestimate in the current deficit, which I referred to, the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be over 16 per cent and the public sector borrowing requirement could well be as high as 21 per cent of GNP.  These figures were quite obvious to the Government when they sat down to their private discussions before Christmas.  They devised this means of taking £200 million out of the public capital programme and devised the other means of fiddling the Book of Estimates to take £180 million out of the current side of it.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to say about all this?  He offered no substantiation for his claim that he can raise £200 million from the private sector, despite statements of outright disbelief in the Dáil and in the financial press.  On the level of the expected borrowing requirement, in his budget speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>On the general issue, borrowing may be high but there is no question of Government complacency about it. Exchequer borrowing will, as a result of this budget, be reduced from last year's figure of 14½ per cent of GNP to 13 per cent this year.  This represents substantial progress.</P>
    <P>The figure of 13 per cent is clearly wrong, but it can be said that the Government are not complacent about the Exchequer borrowing requirement when we see how willing they are to go to unprecedented lengths to disguise the truth from the House and from the public.  In this they have failed.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn from the internal inadequacies of the budget to look at its implications in terms of its general effect on the economy and what it tells us of the Government's ability to regulate economic affairs in the common interest. The structure of the table of contents of the Minister's speech shows that the Government recognise clearly that budgetary policy is only one part, although an important part, of overall economic policy.  The other two major components <Col N="855" /> which are interdependent on the budget are monetary policy and incomes policy. If the contents of the Minister's speech in any way matched up to the headings of the table of contents we could feel confident that we had a Minister for Finance who could command our respect.  Unfortunately, when we move from the Minister's attempts to disguise the mess in which Government finances are floundering and consider his views on economic policies, it is impossible to avoid a profound feeling of pessimism concerning the ability of the Government to handle the problem facing them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's analysis of the problem starting with a rather bland and rambling discourse on the world economy and Ireland's place in it, coupled with unacceptable and contentious clichés about economic life in general, was pleasantly superficial and the reading matter could certainly be recommended to anyone with difficulty getting to sleep.  Apart from such gripping statements as &ldquo;active support for investment remains the centre of Government strategy&rdquo; we are not any surer at the end of the day what the Government propose to do.</P>
    <P>Then we are treated to the thoughts of the Minister on the economy in which he engages in some highly dangerous speculation about the problems which have befallen himself and the Government. Having made misleading use of statistics on exports and employment, he reassures us by announcing that the Government deplore the growth in unemployment which has been forced on us.  I presume this is a reference back to the external factors which have interfered with our balance of payments, increased unemployment, inflation and so on.  Naturally these things would not have been forced on us by an irresponsible manifesto, by the gutless government they engaged in over the last three years, by their own internal wrangling or by a complete lack of confidence by every section of the community in their performance.  We are led to believe it was visited on them from abroad &mdash; and for that we are meant to fill in &ldquo;the Arabs&rdquo;, who are being blamed for everything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> We are told that the rise in oil prices and imported energy is responsible for all our problems.  How responsible are these external factors, which the Minister says were forced on us, for our problems at present?  Deputies Bruton and Kelly put down a question last week to the Minister for Energy asking him the percentage of our gross national product which was expended on imported energy in each year since 1973 and the likely percentage for 1981.  They got an interesting reply. This is a fairly crude measurement and other people will produce other measurements to know what the effects of the oil crisis were on our economy over the last ten years and how much of the current depression was due to the huge import bill we have to meet.  If I read what Ministers had to say about the budget I would be willing to bet that everyone of them referred to the huge increase in the cost of imported oil during the year and the fact that this was one of the things forced on us.  Between 1973 and 1974 the cost of imported energy, expressed as a percentage of GNP, rose by 285 per cent.  These are the Government's own figures and were given by Deputy Colley.  Between 1974 and 1981 the cost of imported energy, expressed as a percentage of GNP, rose by 49 per cent.  This is what has the Government reeling in their corner unable to cope with the balance of payments, taxation, unemployment &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Still they whine and say it is somebody else's fault.  It is never their own mismanagement or incompetence.  If there is the faintest cause for optimism on the economic front it is held to be due to the wisdom of Fianna Fáil, but when things go wrong they are &ldquo;forced on us&rdquo;.  Having got all this off of his chest, the Minister went on to talk about economic strategy.</P>

      <P>That would be my summing up of the speeches I heard this afternoon.  The theme of the Opposition's contribution to this debate was set on the opening day by the leaders of the two Opposition parties.  At greater or lesser length it has been continued and repeated.  The approach has been the usual divided one.  It has not been constructive.  I want to make quite a number of points during the course of my reply, but I want to say first that this is the same type of contradictory theme we have heard in the past, claiming that the Government have not provided adequately for certain sections of the community, such as the PAYE taxpayers who were mentioned earlier this afternoon, the <Col N="859" /> farmers and the business community.  At the same time, they claim that the level of Government borrowing is too high.</P>
      <P>It is time for the Opposition to say clearly and honestly what their intentions are.  They are trying to hide behind different arguments and to appear to be all things to all men.  If they say our borrowing is too high, do they want it cut to such an extent as will damage our employment massively in the short-term?  Are they criticising us for controlling current public expenditure?  When the circus hat went on, they began to talk about cuts in postal services here and telephones there.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have ample opportunity to discuss the details of all the Estimates. Questions were put down to various Ministers by Deputy Barry, Deputy Bruton and others.  Those questions were answered honestly and constructively.  In any set of comprehensive and wide-ranging figures you can take one out of context.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Minister's reference to questions which were put down by Deputies on this side of the House in order to extract supplementary information about his budget statement encourages me to invite him to make sure that, in the course of his reply, he deals with matters which I attempted to raise by the same method and which the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order on the grounds that they pre-empted the budget debate.</P>

      <P>Ample opportunity will be given to Deputies, as was given last year, to discuss the various Estimates in detail.  When those debates take place, my colleagues will be able to explain in detail all the points raised by Deputies. I gave the House that assurance on budget day and I repeat it now.  Deputy Kelly's outburst is a further indication of the confusion and the lack of knowledge of the situation which exist across the floor of the House.  It is a further indication of a not-wanting-to-know attitude. The first duty of the Opposition in a debate on a budget is to read the budget speech and the background papers to the budget.  It became very clear to me this afternoon that that has not been done on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Since budget day, six weeks ago, I have been very satisfied with the reaction to the budget and to the general budget strategy, a strategy of balanced planning and sound judgment.  Among others, the Construction Industry Federation, for example, welcomed the budget, and have said that the substantially increased capital allocation should give the construction industry a badly needed boost.  The federation rightly feel that this will help employment and that the entire community will benefit as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general recognition that the Government have done an excellent job in balancing a vigorous programme of <Col N="861" /> investment with a reduction in borrowing for current purposes.  In the face of a continuing recession and high unemployment it was essential that priority should be given to the generation of employment opportunities.  The investment plan will achieve this along with laying the foundations for a more rapid development of the economy when conditions improve. Prudence demanded that borrowing for day-to-day purposes should be reduced. Borrowing of this kind can only be justified as a short-term expedient.  If continued indefinitely it becomes a burden and disrupts efforts to get the economy moving rapidly.</P>
    <P>I have been very encouraged by the response to the social welfare provisions in the budget.  These provisions are generous and provide for a real improvement in living standards for the less well-off at a time when we are facing difficult economic and financial problems.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to answer all the points raised in the debate so far, but I would like to comment on the overall economic strategy behind my budget.</P>
    <P>A realistic assessment of our present economic position is essential to any effective plan of action, and that is how we have approached the matter in this budget.  The Opposition believe that we are in an economic crisis, this at a time when economic growth continues, jobs are being created, new building works are to be seen throughout the country, business in our shopping areas is lively. Talk of an economic crisis is not only unfounded, but harmful for, if taken seriously, it could cause severe economic damage through its adverse impact on the confidence of potential investors.</P>
    <P>Our partners in the EEC are also experiencing a period of economic difficulty but the Opposition are not suggesting that there is a crisis in the Community.  It should be remembered that in a number of other more developed member states the rise in unemployment has been significantly faster than here. Unemployment here would have reached far greater proportions, in what is acknowledged internationally to be a serious recession, but for the energetic <Col N="862" /> and constructive economic policies of this Government.</P>
    <P>This alone shows how weak and without foundation is the Opposition's statement that we have no coherent economic policy.  Various Deputies have claimed that the country is without leadership or direction in the economic area.  I wonder whether the Deputies studied my budget speech, and the economic documents issued at that time.  If they had taken the time to do so, they would have found that our policy approach is set out quite clearly.  The Government's approach is to provide a major increase in productive capital expenditure.</P>

      <P>After he had fumbled through his papers for some time during his disjointed contribution, Deputy Barry asked what the plan is.  It is the biggest ever investment by an Irish Government in productive development. First of all, in industrial promotion and industrial job creation areas, a substantial figure of about £334 million, to necessary development of infrastructure. My main criticism of the previous Government is that they did not look at this during the recession to which they have been referring &mdash; the development of roads, energy, telecommunications.</P>
      <P>To release the resources for this and to bring the public finances more into balance, we have placed a tight limit on current public expenditure.  But while respecting that limit, we have also made generous provision for social welfare beneficiaries.  If this approach is to have its optimum impact on the economy, and on employment in particular, it must be accompanied by moderation in income developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doubts have been raised by certain Deputies regarding the reference to employment in the <i>Economic Background to the Budget, 1981,</i> referring to <Col N="863" /> forecasts contained in the latest ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary.  Let us, first of all, be clear as to the exact wording of the official document.  Paragraph 4 reads:</P>
    <P>Despite the deepening of the recession, the 1979 level of employment was maintained during 1980.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 19 reads:</P>
    <P>It is estimated that on average during 1980 there was little or no change in the 1979 level of employment, an increase in services employment being offset by a decline in agricultural and industrial employment.</P>
    <P>I reject any suggestion that these statements are incorrect.  The latest official estimates for total employment published by the Central Statistics Office show that in the year to April 1980 total non-agricultural employment increased by 21,000, of which 14,000 was accounted for by the rise in services employment.  It is completely at variance with the trend of the last three years to suggest, as some Deputies did, that services employment actually declined during 1980.  Services employment increased by 52,000 in the three-year period to April 1980.  It is reasonable to assume that it continued to increase during 1980.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the labour force in 1980 increased at a rate significantly higher than the estimated range of 5,000 to 10,000 as contained in the second national understanding.  Subsequent to ratification of the understanding, the CSO issued revised estimates of the labour force which showed that in the year to April 1980 it increased at a rate of 18,000 and at an average annual rate of 23,000 for the two previous years.  The Central Statistics Office are not yet in a position to provide an estimate of the labour force increase for end year 1980 but again there is no reason to suggest that any sharp change in the trend of increase took place over the months from April to December.  I am, therefore, confident that when the Central Statistics Office produce labour force figures for later periods they will support my statement <Col N="864" /> regarding the employment performance during 1980.  The 1981 census of population will give us a comprehensive assessment of the trend in unemployment.  This will be the first time in ten years that such a comprehensive census will have been carried out.  I do not have to spell out to the House the importance of a census from the point of view of planning.  If the Coalition Government during their term of office committed any sin against the community, one of their greatest sins was the fact that in 1976 they postponed the census just to save a very small sum of money.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned with the job loss situation which is counteracting our excellent job creation record to date.  For example, the average monthly rate of increase in the adjusted live register between April and October of about 4,000 decreased to a monthly average of 2,000 for November and December and to 300 for January.  This encouraging trend since November suggests that the level of job losses is decreasing.  The fall in notified redundancies in the final quarter of the year supports that conclusion.</P>
    <P>References to the increase in the external reserves last year, suggesting that we are forced to borrow abroad in order to maintain our external reserves, are totally incorrect.  I would point out that the increase in our external reserves in 1980 resulted from significant inflows of private capital as well as from public sector borrowing.  I would also draw attention to the fact that over £200 million of the Government's external borrowing in 1980 was by way of borrowing from the European Investment Bank and the European Communities.  The borrowing was essential to ensure the full take-up of the capitalised interest subsidies negotiated in the context of our membership. The policies outlined in the budget are designed to improve our external balance of payments over a period of years.  I referred to that earlier.</P>
    <P>With regard to a country's external reserve cover, it should be noted that there are no generally accepted conventions for deciding on what the minimum external reserves cover for a country <Col N="865" /> should be.  Conditions will vary from one country to another depending on the nature and composition of external trade. Our official external reserves fell during the course of 1979, as the effects of oil price increases were felt in a widening balance of payments deficit, from 4.1 months cover at the beginning to about 2.4 months at the end of the year.  However, this reduced later level was still broadly similar to that of many other countries.  By the end of 1980 the reserves showed an increase to three months cover, which is quite favourable compared with the normal international practice.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, Deputy O'Toole made the remark that a Government spokesman's statement in relation to the December trade figures was a blatant cover up.  How untrue, how incorrect and how consistent with the type of comment from the benches of Fine Gael, led by their leader.  That statement had referred to the fact that a significant part of the increase in the December import figure reflected substantial increases of investment goods and materials for further processing which were encouraging signs of an improvement in current and future economic activity.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, in support of his argument, suggested that certain imports be excluded from the investment goods category, although these items clearly belong to that category.  For example, items such as office equipment which includes computers, data processing equipment and so on, which the Deputy suggested should be excluded, are investment goods which support economic activity.  The Deputy did not have regard to the fact that a large part of the increase in oil imports was destined for use in industry.  He also omitted some £80 million increase in imports of materials for further processing, excluding oil.  These imports clearly relate to production and should not be excluded.  In short, out of the increase of £209 million in imports in December, compared with December 1979, about £147 million or approximately 70 per cent is attributable to investment goods or materials for further production.  Therefore, I completely <Col N="866" /> reject the Deputy's allegations that the statement made by the Government spokesman was in any sense a cover up.</P>
    <P>Likewise, let me refute the point made by Deputy Harte which was to the effect that there is no evidence to suggest that the change in our currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling has helped us to win a larger share in the British or Northern Ireland markets. It is difficult to quantify the extent to which the appreciation of sterling has helped to improve our export performance in the UK market, especially as the depressed state of the UK market itself would have had a significant offsetting effect.</P>
    <P>Despite the depressed state of the UK market, Irish manufactured exports to the UK increased by 13 per cent in value in 1980 compared with an increase of approximately 8 per cent in the value of total UK manufactured imports.  This must surely lend support to the argument that the appreciation of sterling did have a positive effect on Irish export performance in the UK.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal now with the EMS because some of the Opposition are misrepresenting the position.  Some of them referred in a critical way to the position of the IR£ in the European Monetary System.  Their comments demonstrate a signal misunderstanding of the true position of the IR£ in the EMS, just as many of their comments indicate a lack of knowledge of the budget and its associated documents.  It is true that sterling, which is not a participant in the EMS exchange rate mechanism, has appreciated very considerably against the IR£ during this period.  However, what the Deputies do not wish to acknowledge is that sterling has appreciated to the same extent against the currencies of our EMS partner countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harte believes that the EMS has gone wrong and lauds &ldquo;Britain's successful policy of keeping sterling high&rdquo;. I wonder does the Deputy really believe that Irish industry or Irish agriculture would somehow be better off if the IR£ <Col N="867" /> were linked to sterling and standing at an appreciation of almost 30 per cent against the German mark and other EMS currencies?  The effective depreciation of our pound has in fact benefited our exporters, at a time when their profit margins have been hit by recession, and should also give a boost to tourism.  Sterling's appreciation has, of course, contributed to inflationary pressures in this country and this is certainly a cause of concern to the Government.  However, this in no way makes the argument, that Deputy Harte seemed to be making, that the IR£ should be linked to sterling, to a highly-valued currency.  I believe, far from having gone wrong, as Deputy Harte suggested, the EMS has made a major contribution to the exchange rates stability of the participating currencies and has shielded them from the great fluctuations which have affected other currencies.  I believe we can be proud of the way that our currency has maintained its position within that EMS band.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies put forward the argument that the level of Government borrowing is not being reduced this year. Deputy Kelly, the strategist of a few moments ago, who has now disappeared from the Chamber having caused his usual disturbance, suggested that the 13 per cent borrowing projected for 1981 should be compared with the 1980 budget estimate rather than with the outturn for that year.  I do not see any sense in this. Borrowing 13 per cent of GNP in 1981 is a reduction from 14½ per cent in 1980 no matter what way you look at it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating accused the Government of hoodwinking the public by implying that the current deficit is being reduced.  Along with his leader, he based this accusation on partial calculations, again a misrepresentation of figures, of the full year effects of the 1981 budget. But the 1981 budget figures deal only with the present calendar year, as is the case with all budgets.  The current budget deficit is projected to fall from 6½ per cent of GNP in 1980 to 5¼ per cent this year, again a clear reduction and in no way designed to hoodwink the public.</P>
    <P>When preparing the 1982 budget, this <Col N="868" /> Government will take all factors into account and will prepare the budget in such a way as to continue the policy of reducing the current deficit, a policy to which, I might point out to Deputy Boland, the Government are firmly committed.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to the Taoiseach's speech in Ennis in August last regarding the 1980 budget targets. He said the Taoiseach's statement was that those targets were being adhered to which was generally correct at that time. The Government subsequently decided to allow additional expenditure in order to support economic activity, a large part of the additional expenditure being directed to the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy in the House this evening talk about economists, their comments and their criticism of the budget and he said he would leave it to those independent people and allow their points of view to be accepted.  Let me put the other points to him.  On a certain television programme I heard an economic reporter say very significantly that the budget was a continuation of the policy being carried on by the Government, particularly in the latter half of last year, recognising that there was a need to generate economic activity.  This budget continues to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I have the reference of who said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was on the budget night on a television programme, I will give the Deputy the name privately if he wishes it.  Deputy FitzGerald also claimed that the 1980 budget left taxpayers with incomes of less than £10,000 worse off.  This claim is wrong.  That man seems to bat out any figure that comes to mind and comment on it.  This is not correct at all because it is based on incorrect measures of the cost of living effect of the budget and on the impact of the indirect tax changes on lower income households.  In fact, the 1980 budget gave substantial income tax gains of greater or lesser magnitude to virtually all groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition also complain that the <Col N="869" /> claims of the PAYE sector to greater equity have been swept aside with contempt.  I would like to make a few points on this.  I am sure in no area is the dishonesty &mdash; one could almost call it deceit &mdash; of the Opposition so evident.  I know the PAYE sector are well aware of how badly they were treated under the Coalition Government and the significant improvements which have been made since this Government came into office. In fact the cost of income tax reliefs provided in the years 1978 to 1981 inclusive amounted to about £500 million.  As I said in my budget speech, I would have liked to do more this year but there were limits to which one could go.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that inflation must be an important factor in determining taxation policy.  This has been acknowledged in recent budgets and in taxation legislation.  However it is not widely recognised that the income tax improvements made in the past years have provided greater relief than indexation in the corresponding period would have achieved.  Indexation would have cost in that period in the region of £325 million, compared with the £500 million of reliefs actually given.</P>
    <P>This is a significant gain in real terms to the general body of taxpayers.  The point can also be illustrated by a comparison of the basic personal allowances available to PAYE taxpayers in 1977-78 and 1981-82.  The allowances for a single person increased from £665 in 1977-78 to £1,715 in 1981-82, an increase of almost 158 per cent.  For married couples the allowances are £1,100 and £2,830 respectively, representing an increase of over 157 per cent.  In contrast the increase in the consumer price index in the four years to mid-November 1980 amounted to 64 per cent.  That speaks of a Government commitment.</P>
    <P>The leader of Fine Gael again attempted to pair off the indirect tax increases in the budget with the income tax concessions which I announced.  It is a further example of the pitfalls of partial assessment of a budget which has to be seen in terms of its overall balance.  The Deputy's comparison has no room for the very generous social welfare increases which I announced nor for the thrust <Col N="870" /> towards restoring balance to the current finances in order to allow for a major programme of investment which will make available 10,000 extra jobs.  That does not take account of the industrial promotion and creation I referred to earlier when we were talking about several times the number of jobs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the overall balance of the budget was correct and that the indirect tax and other revenue changes I announced will not have the harmful effects on industrial peace which some Deputies suggested.</P>
    <P>Much attention has focused on the possible effects of indirect tax increases on the national understanding.  The agreement on pay policy provides for a meeting of the Employer-Labour Conference to discuss the position if the consumer price index rises by more than 10 per cent in the period from mid-May last to mid-February 1981.  These discussions would consider an adjustment to the amount of the second phase, having regard to economic circumstances but without imposing an obligation on employers to negotiate a particular level of increase.  I would reiterate what I said in my budget speech that the terms of the agreement are both generous and high by international standards.  Consequently, I would hope that in any discussions the social partners would bear this in mind and also recognise the self-defeating nature of even higher pay increases.</P>
    <P>The claim has again been made that the price of drink has passed the point of diminishing returns and that the projected revenue will not materialise.  The reality is of course that this year's increases on drink did little more than maintain the real level of the duties concerned and that present duties are not exceptional by reference to previous levels.  That being the case, I have no reason to be apprehensive about my projections of revenue in this connection.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of our decision to bring forward by three months the date of payment of the second instalment of corporation tax.  This was raised again this evening by the Deputies opposite.  As I indicated in my budget speech, the background to this decision <Col N="871" /> was the exceptionally generous payment arrangements for companies compared to those applying to individual taxpayers. Does the Deputy not appreciate that the PAYE taxpayer pays tax before the wages reach his or her hand?  There was a long recognised case on grounds of equity for bringing the treatment of companies more into line with that of individuals, particularly those carrying on a trade or a business of the same kind as companies, the small concerns, but with simply a different legal form.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that, as with the acceleration of payment dates for individuals in recent years, the change in companies' payment dates does not alter either the amount of tax payable or the rate of tax.  What is involved is merely the bringing forward, to a modest extent I might add, of the date for payment of half the tax due.  Those companies which by reason of export sales relief or other allowances and reliefs have a nil or very small tax bill will not be affected at all or only to a minimal extent.  Many companies in the manufacturing sector, particularly those established in more recent years, are likely to be in this position.</P>
    <P>Other companies will require to make some changes in planning their liquidity, cash-flow and borrowings.  The effect for most companies however will be a bringing-forward of the payment date from early 1982 to late 1981.  I am confident that this proposal will not impose any undue strain on company liquidity in 1981 and is fully justified in terms of achieving greater equity in the tax system.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that Deputy FitzGerald, the leader of Fine Gael, agrees in principle with the proposal to provide an incentive for the construction of moderate-cost rented accommodation of which there is a serious shortage particularly in our major towns and cities. While there was criticism of the extent of the incentive proposed a substantial allowance was called for in order to provide the necessary boost to meet this pressing need.  That is why we propose a rate of allowance of 100 per cent which can be offset against rental income generally <Col N="872" /> rather than rental income from qualifying properties alone.  At the same time the fact that the allowance will be offset against rental income only will ensure that it directly benefits expenditure on construction activity and the legislative provisions for the allowance will of course be drafted in such a way as to minimise the scope for exploitation of the allowance for avoidance or evasion purposes.  I feel, therefore, that the new allowance represents a balanced incentive providing an inducement to greater private sector investment at reasonable cost to the State and fulfilling a two-fold need.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies suggested that the extention of the 50 per cent initial allowance to lessors leasing industrial buildings to State-sponsored industrial promotion agencies for sub-leasing to industrialists goes beyond what is necessary.  I should like to explain to the House why a party such as ours, perhaps with a greater national interest or a wider interest where the nation is concerned than any of the parties opposite, did this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of arrogance we could do without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal places lessors of industrial buildings to the IDA on a par from a tax point of view with lessors who lease direct to the industrialist.  Experience has indicated, however, that such direct leasing is inhibited from taking place outside of Dublin and Cork because, due to the absence of an active market in industrial property, such investment tends to be unattractive to the private investor.  This proposal is therefore necessary in order to facilitate private sector investment in factory provision in these areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concern felt regarding the taxation contribution of the major financial institutions, particularly as to whether their contribution can be regarded as fair and equitable compared to that made by individuals under income tax.  The matter is however a complex one involving the question of industrial financing and the attraction of international investment to this country.  These <Col N="873" /> circumstances require that a detailed and objective examination be given to the matter by the Commission on Taxation before any changes can be proposed.  It is for this reason that, as I indicated in my budget speech, I do not propose any changes this year.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred briefly to the allegations made by several Opposition Deputies and the leader of Fine Gael.  I drew attention to the fact that Deputies this afternoon followed that line by wearing a circus hat for a while.  The leader of Fine Gael spoke about the absurdities of the Book of Estimates, such as Departments stopping posting letters or making phone calls.  Some of those allegations have been dealt with in detail by Deputy Seán Calleary, Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service.  Deputies will also have an opportunity of referring to these matters in the course of the debate on the various Estimates.</P>
    <P>By way of general comment on the level of expenditure projected for 1981, I should like to say that &mdash; I made it clear in my budget speech &mdash; in line with the Government's determination to curtail the level of the current budget deficit, the strong upward trend in current spending, which has been evident for more than a decade, must be halted.  This necessitated a very severe pruning of the departmental Estimates.  Given the committed nature of the pay and pension elements of these Estimates, the non-pay services had to bear the brunt of this pruning.  Nonetheless, I was able to provide in the budget for an increase of almost 14 per cent on these non-pay services.  With careful management&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be careful after the recklessness of the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am satisfied that this level of increase will be adequate to meet the cost of these services in 1981 without any serious disruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim was made that the financial arrangements inherent in the Government's privatisation programme will be more costly than conventional sources of <Col N="874" /> Exchequer borrowing.  I want to assure the Deputies who made that suggestion that a prime consideration to be applied to any privatisation proposal is value for money.  We will negotiate the best possible terms appropriate to the asset for which finance is arranged.  We are aiming at an outcome that will benefit the taxpayer and, at the same time, will be a worthwhile investment opportunity.</P>
    <P>The allegation has been made that the investment plan provides funding for capital projects for one year only, to quote one Deputy: as though all of us were going to fall off the end of the world at the end of 1981.  Major infrastructural projects cannot be carried through in a given 12 month period.  This is recognised quite clearly in the investment plan. Paragraph 2.27 states that many of the projects are part of longer-term development programmes, that a great part of their cost will be incurred in 1981, but financial provision for completing them will also have to be made in subsequent years.  Similarly, only part of their effects will be felt this year and their full benefits will accrue in 1982 and beyond later in the decade.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been given to the agricultural sector during the course of this debate.  Opposition speakers sought to contend that little attention has been paid by the Government to the plight of the farmers.  Again, homework has not been done.  It is hard to see how such statements can be justified in the light of the extra measures for agriculture included in the budget which follow an earlier series of measures introduced since last June.  Including the ewe subsidy announced recently extra aid to agriculture since last June amounts to £74.5 million, a considerable sum by any standard.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should list the measures involved as Deputies do not seem to be fully aware of them or deliberately want to ignore them.  The 1980 additional measures, which amounted to £39 million, comprised an additional £23 million for the farm modernisation scheme, £8.4 million for increased grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme, £6 million <Col N="875" /> on agricultural rates reliefs, almost £500,000 on warble fly eradication, £320,000 on sheep grants and £75,000 on aid to the agricultural exports co-ordinating group.  In addition to this £39 million, the understanding attitude of local authorities on rates collection meant that £4.25 million of 1980 rates was carried over to 1981.  In addition there were budgetary measures totalling £35 million comprised £19.6 million extra for relief of agricultural rates, £9.65 million resulting from the suspension of the disease eradication levies, £5 million from the maintenance of two dates for farm income tax payments, £0.5 million from the abolition of the 10 per cent threshold for stock relief and £250,000 for the seed potato industry.  In addition, a special extra subsidy of £0.7 million has been provided for the pigmeat industry.  It is clear from these statistics that the Government have been doing everything possible, even in difficult times for State finances, to help Irish agriculture recover from its present difficulties.  I also expressed our concern in a Government statement.  I think what I have given is some indication of a caring Government concerned with that problem.</P>
    <P>Apart from the national measures to which I have been referring the Government have also launched a major campaign in the European Community seeking the kinds of aids our farmers require involving not only the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; who, of course, is spearheading the drive &mdash; but the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his visits and indeed I used my visits to the ECOFIN Council as well to support their problems and emphasise to the people there how important it is that our agriculture initiative be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another bit of fantasy &mdash; spearheading the drive, my eye, when all it takes is a few words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategist has returned.  It has been suggested in this House and elsewhere that we should just <Col N="876" /> go ahead and introduce further domestic aids regardless of whether or not they are contrary to the EEC Treaty.  In my view that suggestion does not constitute a sensible approach.  The Government have introduced a wide-ranging series of measures carefully tailored to meet the most pressing needs of the farming community while remaining consistent with Government monetary and budgetary policy. Indeed I heard a figure thrown out on a television programme, not by the Deputy opposite but by his successor, their spokesman on Finance, who talked about £400 million and, when I asked where that money might be raised there was the usual silence.  It is typical of what that party are saying at present.  One point I might make is that I have not heard or read of any Member of any of the parties over there, at any stage of the budget debate, suggesting where any further income could be raised.  Do they want us to borrow more?  Do they want us to increase personal taxation?  Do they want more severe cuts, because nobody suggested where the additional finance might be found.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern for social welfare recipients, for the vulnerable section of our society, has been demonstrated in a very positive way by the substantial improvements effected in welfare payments in recent years.  The generous increases in welfare payments announced in this budget have been welcomed by the community at large, by most Deputies in the House and indeed are deserved by their recipients.  I am proud that the increases announced in this budget appear to be the highest in real terms in any budget in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Labour Party accused the Government of neglecting the whole area of social welfare over the last three years.  Surely any objective examination of this Government's record since taking office would demonstrate the absurdity of that statement.  At times one would think that it is just whatever a particular spokesman pulls from his own head, of what be thinks the position might be, rather than what it actually is, that appears to be put across the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in welfare payments <Col N="877" /> granted by the Government have afforded significant real increases in the levels of benefits.  For example, as regards pensions, the real increases granted are more than three times those given by the last Coalition Government during their entire period in office.  On top of these increases there have been many other improvements effected, one of the most important being the introduction of the national fuel voucher scheme under which payments of £3 per week are paid now, over the heating season, to over 100,000 persons.  This Government have been getting on with the job of alleviating poverty, doing it in a much more efficient and effective way than our predecessors, by putting effective purchasing power into the pockets of those who need it.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note that the leader of the main Opposition party shared my concern with regard to the cost of public service pay.  His concern echoed many of the sentiments expressed in my budget statement on the subject.  I must however draw the Deputy's attention to the pitfalls of crude comparisons of incomes in the public and private sectors.  Closer analysis, as indicated by me in reply to parliamentary questions, shows that of the 35 per cent increase which occurred last year, over 6 per cent is accounted for by very special factors such as non-recurring savings in 1979, and a further 10 per cent arose from special increases in the health area which were backdated to January 1979 and that involved a considerable amount of restrospection.  If those two elements were eliminated the increase for the rest of the public service more or less matches that in the private sector.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my budget statement, the level of general and special pay increases in the public service is a cause of deep concern to the Government, particularly in present circumstances.  They must give rise to the serious question of any review of the arrangements.  Having said that.  I also <Col N="879" /> want to say that the Government are committed to observing the rules and procedures of the agreement on pay policy in the second national understanding. These procedures permit negotiations of claims for special increases and I make no apology therefore for making a prudent provision in the budget of £80 million to meet the cost of any further awards this year.  There was reference by some of the Deputies opposite to the public sector pay.  Again, because they speak in a contrary way, one is never sure what they are trying to say.  We had it here this afternoon.  They went on in a most vague and rambling way when earlier on in the debate it was suggested that they, if here, would impose limits on salaries and wages in the public sector.

I can assure that Deputy, and I can assure the other Deputies on the opposite side, that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism is extremely concerned about any threat to industry and his Department are closely involved with the IDA and Fóir Teóranta to ensure that as many jobs as possible are saved.  I believe that a lot of progress has been made despite the concern I expressed earlier about job losses.  But much has been done by the State agencies with the co-operation of both sides, and quite a measure of success has been achieved there too.  It should be recalled that the employment maintenance scheme and its successor, the temporary subvention scheme, made a major contribution towards securing employment in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors.  However, that had to be terminated following objections from Brussels, where it was suggested that there was a distortion of competition.  In view of these objections it must be recognised that the difficulties involved are very great.  However, the Government are continuing to examine the problem to see that firms with a prospect of long-term viability are helped through temporary difficulty.  Fóir Teóranta, which is under the aegis of my Department, are acutely aware of the problems of industry and are always prepared to consider approaches from firms in temporary or cyclical difficulties but which are potentially viable in the long run.  As I said in the budget, Fóir Teóranta have adequate funds to enable them to ensure that any industrial undertaking with reasonable prospects of profitability will not go under for want of financial assistance to see it through a difficult period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an allegation this morning by the new spokesman on Finance on the other side that the Government had no <Col N="881" /> plan for the economy.  Not only is this allegation incorrect but it is dangerous and harmful to the whole economy.  What that Deputy is doing basically is peddling discontent and preaching gloom and doom.</P>

      <P>The investment plan which the Government published in January provides for an unprecedented level of industrial, infrastructural and social investment.  I have gone into that in some detail and I do not want to repeat it.  But the Government are determined that the benefits to the economy offered by the plan in fact do accrue.  Meetings were held with both sides of industry in recent days to discuss in detail how the benefit of that plan can be maximised for the benefit of the Irish worker, for the benefit of Irish industry.  This Government have been committed and will be committed to continuing to work in co-operation with, and having the co-operation of, both sides of industry.  Attention will be directed to ensuring that progress of the individual projects is in accordance with the plan and that the opportunities provided by the plan for increasing employment and expanding the demand for domestic goods are fully exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a committee was established under the chairmanship of one of the Ministers of State to specifically monitor the employment situation.  The increase in the number of economically self-sustaining jobs, which of course is the central object of the Government's planning, is clearly seen here in the contents of this investment plan.  Deputy O'Leary from the other side supported this approach and I agree with his comments.  Expansion and development is the only sure means available for securing this object. It entails a further development of each of the economic sectors &mdash; industry, agriculture and services.  This development would be the primary source of the Government's investment and planning strategy.  At the same time the scale of investment planned for social infrastructure, such as hospitals and education, is <Col N="882" /> substantial and is consistent with the obligations of a caring and equitable Government and society.  A strategy of economic growth has also to take account of the need to restore external balance and to stabilise the public finances.  As I said earlier, the need in 1981 is recognised in the budget and in the plan.  An important aspect here is that other planning work at present under way in my Department includes preparation of the statement on full employment as envisaged in paragraph 5 of the second national understanding.</P>

      <P>Other planning work at present under way in my Department includes preparation of the statement on full employment as envisaged in paragraph 5 of the second national understanding.  This paper sets out the measures and the necessary requirements for achieving full employment and will be discussed with the social partners.  Work is already under way on a planning document dealing with economic development over the medium term.  This will focus on the growth potential of the economy and on identifying realisable increases in output and employment which are possible, provided that there is a positive response from the community in creating the conditions necessary for seeking this potential and to the initiatives being taken by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I must stress how vital it is for the future progress of the economy that the competitiveness of Irish production be increased.  While external circumstances largely determine the underlying rate of Irish inflation, the aim must be to influence domestic costs so as to promote this competitiveness and to minimise the adverse social consequences of rapidly rising prices.  Securing the required control of domestic costs will also contribute to increasing productive capacity and securing a better external balance and an improved balance in the public finances.  Progress towards better balance in the public finances begun in the 1981 budget must also be continued simultaneously with reducing the current budget deficit.  The Government will continue to support and encourage the expansion of productive infrastructural <Col N="884" /> facilities.  Resources released by restraining current public expenditures will be used to finance viable projects that will yield a better return to the community.</P>
    <P>I think I should reply to one point raised by Deputy Barry.  He used the material of a reply to a parliamentary question about increases in the percentage of energy to GNP.  He used a series of percentages in relation to the years 1973-74 and the current ones.  Of course, one can use and compare percentages in a very unequal way because the starting base is so important.  To put the record straight, let me put the actual figures of the cost of oil imports on the record of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister also put them on the record of the House expressed as a proportion of total imports?  He will find that they are exactly the same this year as they were last year.</P>

      <P>The general in the House, the man who is taking up the soldiering all afternoon, does not like to hear the true and factual figures that I am giving now.  I want to put it on the record of the House because Deputy Barry used percentages and, as I said, it depends on the base you are working from or moving from as to what percentages may or may not mean.  I will quote the actual figures of the cost of oil imports for this country of ours.  In 1973 oil imports cost £67 million; in 1974, £208 million; in 1975, £225 million; in 1976, £291 million; in 1977, £352 million; in 1978, £338 million; in <Col N="885" /> 1979, £521 million, and in 1980, £725 million.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was dealing with the question of the remedial action proposed and pointing out that, while insurance is a valuable part of an arrangement to prevent any hardship occurring to people as a result of failure by a travel company, of itself it <Col N="891" /> was unlikely to provide a fully satisfactory set of arrangements.  In particular I said it would also be necessary to look at the ways in which one could prevent, or if not prevent entirely at least minimise, the risk of any recurrence in the future of this type of situation.  It is that aspect of the matter that I should like to take up now.</P>
      <P>We know from the Minister that legislation is being prepared and from his remarks yesterday it appears that it will set out to deal with this aspect of prevention as well as cure.  I am not sure what measures will be proposed under that heading.  There has been reference to a bonding arrangement for firms in the travel trade and certainly that would be one very desirable feature.  I take it that for reputable companies an insurance bond should be available at a not-too-prohibitive premium so that any additional cost to the customers would be very small by the time the premium was spread over the total number of clients of a travel agency.  While the bonding element is a necessary and valuable ingredient, I think we should look for more than that.  If we have limited companies who, as I said last night, enjoy very real and substantial benefits from the privilege of being allowed to incorporate in limited companies, I think we should ensure that they honour their obligations under the various Companies Acts and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also desirable that prospective clients of travel agencies should be able to get information without too much difficulty.  At present if a prospective holidaymaker is choosing to make some arrangement I doubt if the choice is significantly influenced by the particular travel agency concerned, because there is virtually no way in which an ordinary member of the public is in a position to decide whether company A or company B is in the stronger financial position or has better facilities or opportunities available.  I suspect that in the majority of cases the choice of holiday, and therefore the choice of travel company, is very much influenced by the information in the various brochures handed out.  While <Col N="892" /> promotional literature is all very well &mdash; promotional material, advertising and so on is to be expected as part of the normal day-to-day stock of business &mdash; I think we should have more information as well as more publicity.  I know there could be debate as to exactly how much information should be available but it would not be unreasonable to have available, whether within each company's brochure or perhaps in some form of composite brochure from the Travel Agents' Association, some information on the financial standing of the various travel agency firms &mdash; perhaps some information on their turnover or their profits or even a statement that they have complied with the requirements of the Companies Act under each of these headings.  Any interested members of the public could then satisfy themselves that they were dealing with a firm which was complying with its legal obligations and which appeared to be behaving reasonably.</P>
    <P>While that would go some way towards sorting out the more reputable and more substantial firms from, shall we say, the more fly-by-night operators, I recognise that historical information on past performance would not, of itself, fully deal with the problem.  A firm might have traded quite successfully in earlier years and then find itself, for whatever reason, running into a bad patch.  Perhaps there has been a change of management, or somebody has made some wrong decisions about the likely scale of the business for the coming year or so on.  This is the type of developing problem which is more likely to give rise to a sudden dramatic collapse of the kind which we are discussing and which underlies the Bill before the House.  This will obviously be a more difficult and more controversial area in which to get satisfactory information.  It deals with the situation as it occurs, and we all know that in the day-to-day changing business situation one may hear different versions.  There could be rumours and counter-rumours and various statements made.  A number of firms may see one member in trouble and may perhaps press their own claims to have business transferred to them.</P>
    <P>In that environment it is unrealistic to <Col N="893" /> expect the travel companies themselves to be in a position to provide adequate or fully satisfactory information to the general public.  This is where we should look to the consumer bodies to develop their services in this area.  Happily, there has been substantial progress in recent years under the general heading of consumer protection and consumer information.  However, there is a lot more which could be done in this area.  This whole area of holiday travel is an obvious candidate for better involvement by the consumers themselves.  The very nature of the business, as we know, lends itself to a kind of organisation where, in effect, most travel firms are middlemen.  They do not themselves have any tangible product.  They simply act as a go-between, organising, on the one hand, travel facilities &mdash; airplane flights, hotels, other recreational activities &mdash; and, on the other hand, offering these holiday attractions to the prospective customers. If the firm has little in the way of tangible assets to back its activities, there is always the potential for a collapse and for disappointed clients.  This is very much a type of activity where the clients, the customers, should be given every facility.</P>
    <P>One possibility worth exploring would be to see whether this part of the general consumer information and protection services could not support a private enterprise grouping, a voluntary association or the like.  They could then be in a position to process up-to-date information on all relevant aspects of the travel trade and make it freely available to members of the public.  This will not guarantee perfection, but I do not see how we can arrive at perfection in this world.  Certainly, we should aim to improve the situation of the client.  To my mind one possible way in which we could bring about substantial improvements would be by encouraging the customers to form their own travellers' protection association and to support it in whatever way possible, either by making some services available from the relevant Government Departments or agencies or, if necessary, with some very modest financial support to help the collection and dissemination of up-to-date information <Col N="894" /> on activities in the travel area.  This is where we should explore possibilities for improvement, in addition to the basic proposals that have already been discussed as to adequate bonding or insurance arrangements, so that funds will be available in the event of any future collapse of a travel firm.</P>
    <P>One other question which has arisen is whether or not there should be compensation paid to the victims of the collapse of Bray Travel.  Obviously, this is a very touchy subject and, understandably, the people who have been disappointed and who have been placed at substantial financial loss by this collapse will feel a legitimate grievance, particularly if there is any substance in some of the suggestions made as to the way in which trading took place right up to the date of the collapse.  Certainly, those aspects should be investigated fully so that the House and the public at large can be satisfied as to the way in which the eventual failure came about and, in particular, whether members of the public were placed at unnecessary risk through the manner of the trading.  Until those aspects are fully investigated, I take it that there is unlikely to be any final resolution of this question of financial compensation.</P>
    <P>I can see difficulty in the State itself coming forward with any proposals for financial support because, while there is loss involved here, there are many other areas where financial hardship to innocent victims arises and where for one reason or another there may not be adequate financial safeguards.  I am thinking of cases which I myself have come across, where people have decrees made in their favour in court against the guilty party and when an attempt was made to collect the compensation the bird had flown, so to speak.  A perfectly innocent person who has suffered hardship or loss then finds himself or herself with no way of obtaining the financial redress to which the courts have said they were entitled. There are also other areas in which hardship can arise, so I can see the difficulty in any suggestion of compensation in this particular instance.  Every effort should be made to ensure that, if there were any funds available through the activities of <Col N="895" /> the firm in the period leading up to the closure, they will be made available and used to at least partly reimburse the sufferers.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether a fund should be created now, to which presumably all future travellers would subscribe and which could be used to reimburse retrospectively the victims of the Bray Travel collapse, I recognise that there is always a problem about any form of retrospective legislation and I have no doubt the lawyers on both sides of the House want to explore the implications of that aspect.  If it were possible to launch any form of fund, in conjunction with bonding arrangements and so on, so that the overall financial burden in any one year could be kept to a reasonable level, I would like to see the possibility explored.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the basic point, which is whether this Bill is sufficient to deal adequately with the situation, I hope I have made clear from my remarks that I do not feel it is adequate because it deals only with the setting up of a fund and arrangements for compensation in the event of failure.  It is even more important to deal with the question of effective arrangements for avoiding the risk of further collapse in the future.  Whether the suggestions made come from me or from other speakers I would like to feel that between us this House can bring forward a more comprehensive set of measures which would avoid any recurrence of the unfortunate loss which was suffered by so many innocent people in recent weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this Bill. Deputy Hegarty is to be congratulated for showing such initiative and concern for the people affected by the collapse of Bray Travel.  I want to record my gratitude for his concern for future holidaymakers who may suffer the same fate.  I congratulate him on his endeavours to ensure that they will not suffer a loss.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be made retrospective to 1 December 1980 in order that compensation may be paid to the people who suffered heavy financial losses.  Having read the speech of the Minister for Transport I am appalled at his indifference and the pettiness of his arguments.  He has shown little sympathy for these people. Rather than proposing amendments to improve the Bill he has merely run it down and he has done a great disservice by his attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what the Minister said about opening the floodgates for claims from any commercial company which collapses, there is a precedent.  This is a specific case.  It has nothing to do with regular bankruptcy cases which come before the courts.  There has been a major human element in this case and people who can ill afford to lose money have been affected.  There is the blatant precedent of the Irish Trust Bank.  In that case there was a far greater amount of money involved, probably ten times as much.  Speculators were involved there, many of whom came from abroad.  This Government saw fit to compensate those people 100 per cent.  For the life of me I cannot see how a Minister can now say there is no comparison.  There is a very distinct comparison.  The people who suffered in this case are far more deserving than the people involved in the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank.  As I said, many of those people were very wealthy non-nationals.  At that time the National Coalition were blamed for not compensating them.  We promised to compensate the small holders &mdash; the genuine Irish investors and some small foreign investors. <Col N="897" />  We did not think it proper to compensate financiers from other countries.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport told us in his reply that he would not compensate the people who had suffered loss.  In the final paragraph of his reply the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Bray Travel collapse has highlighted the need for effective protection of the travelling public and I am satisfied that this requires the establishment of a scheme on the basis of law.  For some time past my Department have been looking at what can be done by way of legislation and, as I indicated to the House on 18 December last, it is my intention to seek Government approval as soon as possible for a package of legislative measures to deal with the matter.  I hope to introduce this legislation in the current session.</P>
      <P>This reply is from volume 326 of the Official Report at column 1271.  The same promise was made by a former Minister for Transport in this Government on 19 November 1977 at a dinner of the Irish Travel Agents' Association in Killarney.  Of course, 1977 will be remembered as the year of false promises.  Without making any pun, I would point out to the Minister present that 1981 is the Year of the Disabled.</P>

How can the payment of £3 million, mainly to foreigners, be justified <Col N="899" /> while money cannot be paid to Irish people?  It is completely dishonest.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking that this payment be made we are merely asking for what has been done in other countries.  I refer to the collapse of the Courtline company in Britain some years ago when the British Government raised a loan of £15 million to compensate those who suffered. We are asking for a sum in the region of £300,000 or £400,000, a mere pittance in comparison.  There are precedents not only in this country but in other countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have done something constructive and suggested amendments rather than pick holes in the arguments made by Deputy Hegarty in introducing the Bill.  The Minister said it was merely a copy of British legislation, but I would point out that a large proportion of our legislation is identical with British legislation.  We took it over in 1922 and the vast bulk of it has never been changed.</P>

      <P>We, as an Opposition party, do not have the facilities to hire parliamentary draftsmen to draw up a super Bill.  We have made an attempt and I am not saying it is perfect.  We have tried, which is more than the Government <Col N="900" /> have done despite the promise of 1977.  It ill behoves the Minister to criticise us for doing our best and making a constructive suggestion in formulating this Bill.  We are pressuring the Government by bringing in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There have been numerous promises of legislation but nothing has materialised.  We have been promised a Bill dealing with independent broadcasting and another on citizen band radio.  We are dubious as to whether this promised legislation will appear before the forthcoming general election.  We wish to pressure the Minister into doing something and it is a sad state of affairs when the Opposition have to bring in Bills during Private Members' Time in order to get action from the Government.  The Minister told us last night that the introduction of this Bill was an abuse of Private Members' Time.  In fact we are doing what he himself should have done.  He also said it was dishonest.  In my opinion a much greater degree of dishonesty is involved in giving back £3 million to people. many of whom did not need it.</P>
      <P>Bray Travel collapsed on 18 December last and a very significant point has been made concerning the accounts of this company.  Apparently they had not been publicly audited for five years and this was admitted by the Minister in reply to a Dáil question.  If an annual audit had taken place it is most likely that this collapse could have been diverted and there was great dereliction of duty by the Minister for Industry.  Commerce and Tourism and his Department.  The irregularities in the accounts did not come to light and they had probably been in deficit for several years.  On 10 February Deputy Barry Desmond asked the following supplementary question:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has there not been any recommendation from the Minister's Department to the Minister for Industry. Commerce and Tourism that proceedings be initiated against this company for alleged failure to lodge registered company accounts over a period. which resulted in a deficiency of £1 million?  Surely there is a departmental <Col N="901" /> and ministerial responsibility in this matter?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport replied:</P>
    <P>When we saw the notice in the newspaper the Deputy has referred to we immediately brought it to the attention of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I am quite certain they will take the necessary action as a result of it.</P>
    <P>That was a bit late in the day.  That should have been done over the past five years but it was not; it was neglected.</P>
    <P>Since November 1977, when the then Minister for Transport was aware, if one is to judge by his speech in Killarney, that there was a problem in this area, that there was a danger of companies collapsing and people losing their money, two more companies went to the wall, Sun Jet and Star Travel.  That should have been sufficient warning to the Minister that he was facing a calamity such as we witnessed with the collapse of Bray Travel.  We had more than three years of inertia, of neglect in this area.  Our Bill attempts to redress that situation and compensate those who lost money.  It is not much good for the Minister to say that he has sympathy for those who lost money.  Those people want their money back.  It should be remembered that some travel agents acted responsibly in this regard and compensated those who lost money in the collapse of Bray Travel.  It is unfortunate they all did not do this, because had they done so we would not be at loggerheads in this debate.  However, it is possible that some of them are operating on a shoe-string and do not have great financial means.</P>
    <P>The Irish Travel Agents Association should have attempted some fire brigade action to compensate those who did not get their money back.  Great credit is due to the travel agents who compensated some people even though they were under tremendous pressure from clients who lost money.  It made me smile to think of the Minister mentioning last night that we were copying British legislation.  In the House on 5 February, as <Col N="902" /> reported at column 1219 of the official Report, the Minister was asked by Deputy Horgan when the position of nautical surveyor and examiner in his Department would be filled, to which the Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made with the appropriate British authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Jolly good stuff.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to provide and mark examination papers for certificates of competency for deck and engineer officer examinations as from 1 February 1981. This system will enable us to maintain the issue of Irish certificates of competency while maintaining reciprocity with British certificates.</P>

      <P>We are anxious that an agency be set up consisting of seven people, three of whom should be nominees of the Irish Travel Agents Association and four appointees of the Minister.  The person appointed chairman would not have any association with the travel business or anybody engaged in the provision of travel facilities.  If the fund we suggest had been set up three years ago, as promised, we would not be faced with this difficulty now.  The House should agree to the Bill.  There should be a full display in all offices of tour operators and travel agents and in advertising literature of the details, financial and otherwise, of their <Col N="904" /> bonding schemes.  Included in that information should be a photostat of the certificate from the insurance company bonding them.  The present schemes are grossly inadequate.  Tour operators should also be licensed separately.</P>
      <P>A bonding system is highly desirable because it will give people a sense of security.  The travel business is one of the most likely to collapse.  The number of such collapses over the years has been abnormal.  Collapses have occurred in Britain and on the Continent.  There must be some protection for consumers and in the Bill we are providing that and also the means for compensation for those who suffered loss.  The Government should support this legislation and not make a frivolous and childish attack on it. If the Government do not agree with certain provisions they should suggest amendments, be constructive and not destructive.  Deputy O'Donoghue made valid points in his contribution and agreed that compensation should be paid.  I should like to see that magnanimity around the House.  We should not be bickering about this but should agree that all those who suffered be fully compensated.</P>

      <P>I hoped to be able to deal with this matter quickly and without interruption.  Today I received a letter from the Bray Travel victims action group.  I found it a rather sad and pathetic letter and, to me, discourteous and unacceptable. <Col N="906" />  It displayed plain insensitivity to the functions of public representatives who are public representatives and not public servants.  There is a very fine distinction there and I should remind Members of the House what we are.  We should not accept the type of letter we received today.  I raise it in the House because it is important.  The letter reads:</P>
      <P>Dear T.D.</P>
      <P>We represent the victims of the Bray Travel action group.</P>
      <P>We are extremely concerned that this Bill becomes law in order that every traveller travelling this season will be protected because at this moment not all tour operators travel agents are bonded....</P>
      <P>Please confirm by return that you propose supporting the Bill in order that we may advise those members of our group who may be in your constituency and who may wish to attend the debate.  We will deem a failure to reply to this letter as a refusal on your part to support the Bill and, consequently, the victims we represent.</P>
      <P>I find that insulting.  When the crash of Bray Travel occurred a number of people in my constituency came to me.  I contacted the agents on their behalf and they appeared to have been satisfied that the agents were prepared to compensate them for their losses.  When I get this kind of letter in the middle of a debate in this House I find it unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Having said that I extend my sympathy to the victims of Bray Travel.  They were caught in a very unfortunate situation. Deputy Deasy said that for the past five years there was no audit of the company's accounts.  Of those five years the Coalition were in power for two, so if Fianna Fáil are indicated on this score so are the Opposition.  I do not wish to further aggravate the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt comprehensively and fully with his intentions and proposals yesterday.  I understand the frustrations and losses which people involved feel but I suggest to them that they do not threaten me by any precipitate sanctions <Col N="907" /> or by publication of support or non-support for any Bill that comes before the House.  I want to explain to them my function as a Member of the House.  It is as public representative and not public servant.  I know that is repetition but it needs to be said.</P>
    <P>As has been said on all sides of the House, some of the cases involved are very tragic.  For example, there is the case of the individual who borrowed money from the bank, paid it to Bray Travel and now has huge repayments to make.  There is another case where illness fell upon a household and on the advice of a doctor the family decided that a holiday in the sun would be a good remedy.  Money was paid which they could ill afford and that money was lost.  If there are special cases to be made I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he might look at them and when he is introducing his Bill he should see if there is any way in which provision could be made to compensate for the horrific hardship which has befallen some families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty mentioned that he would be selective about the Irish Trust Bank and seek out the genuine cases.  He says they are all genuine in Bray Travel's case.  I accept that but there are some which are more tragic and unfortunate than others.  The Minister should consider compensating the victims to some extent, perhaps in conjunction with the travel agents' association.  Perhaps they could receive 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent compensation, but something should be done to help.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with retrospection fully and sensibly and indicated that retrospective application for benefit provided for in legislation can lead to serious complications, and the most obvious problem is where to draw the line.  He went on to indicate the different ways in which people find themselves in trouble where this happens.</P>
    <P>I accuse Bray Travel of irresponsible operation in that they were known to frequently overbook and by doing so clients who arrived at departure lounges of airports had to be put up for a day or two in hotels.  I know this to be a fact and <Col N="908" /> it was at the cost of Bray Travel.  Not only did they not make a profit on those clients but they made a considerable loss.  It is time now, even after the horse has bolted, to introduce this legislation.  A grave injustice has been done and I suggest to the Minister that when he is drawing up the necessary legislation he should deal with future possible occurrences of this kind.  He should introduce a licensing system.  I know he referred to this in his speech but it is important that we should emphasise it from the backbenches.  He should make it compulsory and binding on every travel agent.  He should insist that each traveller pays £1 into a contingency fund under statutory control to be backed by a similar amount from the trading agent.  This fund would soon prove to be sufficient to deal with any future emergencies which, hopefully, may never arise.  It would prevent this type of thing happening in the future and this type of debate, acrimonious at times, occurring in this House.</P>
    <P>I further suggest that when the Minister gets the approval of this House for his Bill regulating travel agencies, the agents themselves might consider setting up their own regulatory body, on the same lines as lawyers and doctors, to regulate the licensing and operations, and to monitor the activities of their members.  This should be done on a voluntary basis among themselves.  There is no point in enacting it as part of a law which might be difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot agree to reverse his and the Government's decision to some extent.  I will support him.  I understand his reasons.  I am just suggesting that he might consider going some small way to provide compensation.  If not, perhaps as a gesture of good will, and in an effort to renew the confidence which the public rightly have in the vast majority of our 200-odd travel agencies, the travel agencies association might consider contributing, through a levy a certain amount by way of compensation for the victims of the Bray Travel collapse.</P>
    <P>There are 200 travel agencies involved in selling holidays abroad.  The amount of money which each agent would be <Col N="909" /> asked to contribute towards providing compensation for the Bray Travel victims would not be any great loss to them, and would not cause them any hardship.  It would renew the confidence we have in the vast majority of the legitimate travel agencies.  They have done an enormously good job over the years in serving thousands of holidaymakers going abroad. Certain circumstances developed because they over-extended themselves and rushed into building up a bigger business which they could not sustain. Because of that we now have this terribly unfortunate business.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious not to undermine the bulk of those operators.  I admire them for their efficiency, their courtesy and their reliability.  They have proved themselves over the years.  Everybody has said as much as can be said.  I suppose we will have repetition about the Irish Trust Bank and all the other angles which the Coalition can raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who has had such a difficult time, with Fianna Fáil backbenchers standing up to discuss a Bill which is not before the House.  Deputy Andrews proceeded to discuss a Fianna Fáil Bill which I do not think will ever see the light of day, not under Fianna Fáil anyway, because they will not be there long enough.  Even if they were, <Col N="913" /> I doubt if they would introduce a Bill which would be capable of doing what is needed.  This situation has been brought about because Bray Travel went broke. The first question is did they go broke, how did they go broke, are they indeed insolvent?</P>
      <P>There is a certain school of thought that only rich people go abroad on holidays.  In fact a large number of working people, their wives and families, do so, and they do so at off peak periods, if they can, in order to get cheap fares.  The people who were caught by this are in the main people who could ill afford to lose the money they had paid to Bray Travel. The extraordinary thing about it is that under the law as it stands, Bray Travel, up to the day before the crash came &mdash; I should have said, up to the day before they were caught out &mdash; collected hard earned money to be used for purposes other than providing holidays for the people who had paid for them.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in this because a few years ago I took members of my family abroad through Bray Travel.  I made it clear to Bray Travel afterwards that I would never do it again because even then they were not playing the game.  I agree with Deputy Andrews that most of the travel agents here are doing an excellent job in trying to give value for money, but there are a few dark horses out to get the quick buck and they do not care whom they hurt in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see this Bill being accepted, passed even with Government amendments.  At least it is before the House, but the Bill Deputy Andrews spoke about is not likely to come before the House this year, certainly not before the peak travel period.  Therefore, though a number of travel agents have agreed voluntarily to give certain guarantees, there must be early legislation to tie them down.  If this had happened only now for the first time, if it had been unknown for travel agents to go broke, we could understand the delay from the time the present Ceann Comhairle attempted to right matters in 1972 to the present time when a company were <Col N="914" /> allowed to go broke, a company who were allowed to go without an audit of their accounts since the last Government left office in 1977: the last time their audit was carried out was 1976.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience of the Equitable Insurance Company doing something similar under a Fianna Fáil Government and being allowed to get away with it.  Why would people like Bray Travel not try to get away with this too? I know people who had paid money to them for holidays and whose health has suffered; some of them had nervous breakdowns, having scrimped and saved the whole year to get the money to pay for their holidays.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to draw attention to is that Bray Travel insisted on getting the money long before the holidays.  In my case I had to pay the money six weeks before, having paid a deposit earlier.  They charged an amount which I considered to be exorbitant but they did not give the services the people had paid for even when Bray Travel were at the height of their career as travel agents.  If many people had not had receipts from sub-agents here they would have been left without hotels or even meals when they were abroad.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, or any amending legislation, will have to include regulations to tie down organisations who make contracts so that when the holiday period is over they cannot get away with it by saying: &ldquo;This happened in France or Spain or Italy and it is not our responsibility&rdquo;.  There are efforts to give what are called cheap holidays which is only codding people out of their money.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle knows that some of those companies have arrangements whereby the parents pay the full fare and certain children are allowed to travel at reduced fares.  Bray Travel refused to do that.  What one might call the after sales service, the courier service, was non-existent.</P>
    <P>They are the people now looking for sympathy, having robbed a considerable number of people of their savings.  One of their spokesmen had the audacity to say they had no responsibility.  All right, form a limited company and you do not <Col N="915" /> have responsibility.  That is a nice way to get out of things.  The big point is that if something like this Bill proposes is not done now we will have a continuation of this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how deeply has this been investigated, how far will the investigation into the affairs of Bray Travel go?  Will it be possible to find out who got money and is holding it, money which did not go either to Bray Travel or to the people who had paid it for their holidays?  How much of this money is still being used?  What about the people in control of Bray Travel who up to the day before the crash were accepting cheques which they made sure they cashed very quickly &mdash; they did not take any chance that the cheques would be cancelled.  Is it not outrageous that a company such as Bray Travel should be able to collect hard earned money and say it is not their responsibility.  There is one way to deal with it.  One amendment I should like to see to this Bill is provision for a prison sentence for a person who takes money in that way and who disclaims accountability for it.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing had not happened before in this country in a big way, but we have had instances of many such companies going broke in Britain, and legislation such as this Bill had to be introduced.  Here, following the action of the present Ceann Comhairle in 1972, why did Fianna Fáil not follow up the lead they had been given, why has it been left to the Opposition today?  Why should we wait until people are robbed of their savings before we do something about the matter?  If a gipsy breaks into a house and steals money, even a small amount, he is taken before the court and is likely to be sent to jail.  Some time ago an itinerant woman who had a family was given six months' imprisonment for taking a pound of rashers from a shop.  Yet the élite, the so-called respectable people, the wealthy people, were able to get large amounts of money right up to the last minute and then sit back and say it was not their responsibility.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said we should not talk about the Irish Trust Bank. <Col N="916" /> While I disagreed with the idea that the State should have been responsible in that instance, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The people who got money in the case of the Irish Trust Bank were, in the main, people who could afford to spend large amounts of money and they might not have missed the money if it had not been paid back to them.  In this case we are talking about ordinary, working-class people, small businessmen and farmers.  They have not very much of this world's goods.  They could not afford to lose the money that was taken out of their pockets and used for purposes other than what was intended.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that we should have to listen to sneering opposition from people on the Government side.  There has been carping criticism about the way the Bill is drafted, about what is in it and what should be in it.  I give credit to Fine Gael for producing the Bill.  If they were able in a relatively short time to put before this House a Bill, imperfect though it may be, surely it is not too much to ask the Government to produce the necessary Bill?  They have all the necessary resources, civil servants who are experts at their job and, in addition, they have a report that was started in 1972.  Instead of that they have told us this Bill is no good and have said they will produce legislation.  I am satisfied they will not do that.  I am satisfied that the best we may expect from them is that a week before the general election they will put something out that is supposed to be an effort to right a wrong.  It might be good politics to do it that way but that is not the correct approach.  The Government are making a serious error.</P>
    <P>Holidays are big business.  I have heard people, including Ministers, in the past few weeks advising everybody to holiday at home.  That is fair enough but I would be far more inclined to listen to them if I found them in the holiday resorts of this country.  I do not think many of them will holiday at home.  The person who has one foot on a plane to Spain or some other place and who says to people at home that it is better for Ireland that they should holiday in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not drink or smoke and neither does my wife.  Therefore, we can afford to go places where people who drink too much cannot afford to go.  I have no apology to make to anybody about where I travel.  I am talking about the man who wants everybody to holiday in Ireland and often this person is giving this advice when he has one foot on the plane, travelling to far-off places.  Irish holidays are very good.  I have spent as many holidays in this country as any other person here and I have enjoyed them, but I do not object to people who want to go abroad.  Neither will I object to Ministers going abroad if they wish but I do object to their telling others to stay at home.  There is also the aspect that we are looking for visitors to come to Ireland and if the concept of visiting other countries did not exist we would not have any visitors.  However, in order to make it work properly there must be reputable travel agents and here we come back to the kernel of the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Bray Travel collapsed there was an immediate hullabaloo: people in this House were shouting about the whole business and saying that of course the Government were going to do something about it.  The trouble with this Government is that they are always going to do something but they are finding it extremely difficult to do anything.  They <Col N="918" /> will play around with ideas but will not take action.  In this case there was no reason why the necessary legislation was not introduced almost immediately.  That is the only way we can deal with the people concerned in this case.  Not alone should legislation be prepared to ensure that people who pay for their holidays can get those holidays, but we should take steps to deal with the travel companies who make arrangements to hive off part of their operations from the central body and who switch money to prevent it coming back to the centre.  People who make arrangements like this cannot claim to be honest.</P>
    <P>If the Government consider that this Bill before the House is not adequate it is a simple matter for them to bring in amendments or to produce their own Bill.  We are told they are considering bringing in a Bill this session.  The child in the street knows that this is the last session of the present Dáil.  The Government might as well say that it is their intention just to publish a Bill before the dissolution of the Dáil and pretend they are dealing with the matter in the correct way.  Unless the Government are prepared to put forward a better Bill than the one we are dealing with now, they have no option but to accept the present Bill.  There is no use in people parading around this House 40 or 50 members of the Bray Travel Protection Association or the people who invested money and got no holidays unless they are prepared to vote in favour of what those people want and are entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for your permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 154 on today's Order Paper which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> To ask the Minister for the Environment if relatives of the persons who died and of those who were injured in the Stardust fire will have access at public expense to independent legal representation before the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>This question goes back to the Taoiseach, who clearly indicated on television shortly after the tragedy, that it was his intention that adequate legal representation would be provided at public expense during the course of the tribunal's hearings for the relatives of those who died and for those who had been injured in any way in this terrible tragedy.</P>
    <P>The matter came up again on 18 February when the Minister for the Environment was proposing the establishment of the tribunal to the House.  At column 1987, Volume 326 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>The State will provide an independent solicitor and counsel who will be available to act for the next-of-kin of any victim and for any injured party before the tribunal.  Any such party who wishes to be represented by this legal service should apply to the solicitor.  Every party is of course at liberty to make his own arrangements independently of this State aid.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say at the time that sufficient public attention was not focused on this aspect of the proceedings because, as you are aware, there was a very lengthy argument about the terms of reference of the tribunal.  Since then, however, problems have arisen in relation to this particular undertaking.  They have been given adequate relevance by certain decisions which have been taken by the tribunal and which have created certain anomalies.  The tribunal, for example, have ruled &mdash; it is not my purpose to question the tribunal's rulings or to challenge them in any way &mdash; that one particular group of families are entitled to independent legal representation at their own expense but other claimants shall not be entitled to independent legal representation at their own expense.</P>
    <P>I believe this issue is, effectively, a matter for the tribunal because anybody <Col N="920" /> who knows the area concerned will know that the vast majority of the people who might want to be legally represented before this tribunal are not in a position to pay the very large amount of money which has to be paid for the best legal advice nowadays.  There is no shame in that.  I could not pay it myself and I do not believe that many Members of the House could pay it.  The matter that is at issue here is whether the people who have been affected by this fire, some very tragically, are to have, as I said in my question, independent legal representation before the tribunal and, it goes without saying, adequate legal representation.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the commitment which was outlined in broad terms by the Minister in his speech on 18 February, and which has now become known in greater detail to the people in the area, is so far short of adequate that it raises very serious questions about whether the original indication given by the Taoiseach is being adequately implemented.  As I understand the situation, two firms of solicitors, Messrs.  Hanahoe and Messrs. Bates have been allocated by the Government to represent, at public expense, the next-of-kin of any victims and any injured parties who wish to apply to them.  We must remember that almost 50 died in this tragedy, that three times as many were injured, some of them very seriously and, for all I know, many of those who did not suffer physical injury may wish to be represented before the tribunal because of psychological and other damage they may have suffered during the course of what happened.</P>
    <P>Only two firms of lawyers are being engaged at public expense to cope with hundreds of people who desire representation.  My argument is that the pressure on the time of those two firms will effectively rule out the possibility of independent legal representation, that is representation for each person who wants to be independently represented.  I have no doubt that the two firms concerned are of the highest calibre.  In connection with Ms. Maura Bates, who was associated with the Coolock Law Centre, local people have the highest respect for her services.  It is an ironic comment on the situation <Col N="921" /> that over the last few months the services offered by the Coolock Law Centre have been restricted severely owing to the squeeze on the resources from central funds.  On the face of it what the local people are concerned about &mdash; I am speaking on the basis of having had consultations with some of them at their request &mdash; is the disproportion they see between the legal advice available to them and the legal advice which is available to the other parties in the tribunal.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where the legal representation available to several hundred people who have been not just materially but physically affected in the most grievous way by this tragedy is no more than that which is available &mdash; not at public expense I accept but at their own expense &mdash; to the Butterly family and the Scotts Food Company who are also interested parties before the tribunal.  It is their right to hire their own legal teams but the disproportion between what is available to them in terms of their right to representation before the tribunal and in the terms of teams of lawyers they can hire and what is being made available by the Government to the families of those who died and those who have been injured is now very great.</P>
    <P>If one divides the number of residents, the number of people who have been physically injured and the families of those who died into the approximate amount of working time available between now and the time the tribunal opens its full hearings it works out at about one hour apiece, certainly not more than one hour-and-a-half.  How can any family or individual in that area seriously accept that their right to adequate independent legal representation at public expense before the tribunal can adequately be met even by the most efficient solicitor working under that kind of pressure in that kind of timescale?  There is pressure involved and for very good reasons.  The Taoiseach and the Government have indicated that they want to have this Tribunal under way within the shortest possible space of time and, indeed, Mr. Justice Keane has indicated <Col N="922" /> that he shares the sense of urgency.  That increases the pressure on whatever legal services are available and the more inadequate those legal services the more the pressure will tell on them.</P>
    <P>The relatives of those who died and those who have been injured want certain questions asked at the tribunal and, if possible, answered.  They do not believe that the structure of the legal advice they have been offered is adequate to ensure that those questions are asked and, if possible, answered.  They have made it clear to the Labour Party that nothing short of a very substantial expansion of the legal services which have been made available to them at public expense will quell the unease which they feel about their rights being vindicated before the tribunal.  It is not, of course, a tribunal that will assess damages and, to that extent, they are not to the best of my knowledge each looking for his or her own solicitor or his or her own senior counsel.  They are practical people and they realise that that kind of arrangement will bog the tribunal down and make it grind slowly to a halt but they are emphatically not satisfied with the vestigial representation that has been accorded to them at present.</P>
    <P>Those people are anxious to see a substantial improvement.  If the commitment given by the Taoiseach is to be honoured such substantial improvement will have to take place because most of the work will have to be done between now and the time the tribunal opens its full sessions in about one month's time.  The next three weeks are crucial for the extensive period of consultation assessment and so on that must be carried out.  One of the fundamental reasons why adequate independent legal representation should be made available to those families is that, of course, the findings of the tribunal will have the effect of foreshortening many subsequent court actions that may be brought in relation to damages and liability.  Legal representation for those families cannot be independent if it is not independent of the time factor. For that legal representation to be independent of the time factor it must be extended and enlarged to the degree to <Col N="923" /> which each of the families who believe they have a right to have their voice heard by legal proxy before the tribunal will feel they have not been cheated and will feel that any questions they want to put, and which the tribunal is prepared to allow, will be put by a legal team which has heard their side of the case.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is an impossible request or a difficult one to answer.  Even a comparatively modest outlay of resources by the Government in this direction would suffice.  For example, if the Government were to treble the slight allocation they have made and provided six firms of solicitors, with appropriate senior counsel at the tribunal stage, that would probably meet the reasonable demands of the people concerned.  They are pragmatic people and they do not look for the moon.  They do not want to turn the tribunal into a bear garden but they want as much justice as the tribunal can provide.  They believe that adequate and full legal representation with adequate time for consultation is essential if the tribunal is to have their complete confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the question Deputy Horgan put down to me on 26 February was whether or not the next-of-kin of persons who lost their lives or were injured would be given free legal services in relation to hearings of the tribunal. The Government decided that because of the tragic circumstances of the fire and the large number of persons from one area who were affected it was right and proper that free legal service should be provided for the next-of-kin of any victim or of any person injured.  The Government feel that the basic need is to ensure that the full facts of what happened on that tragic night at the Stardust Club should be made known and that the families concerned should see that the full facts emerged.  It was for this reason that the Government decided to provide a free legal service for the next-of-kin and those injured.  Details of this service were made public in a statement issued by the Government Information Services on 27 <Col N="924" /> February.  In that statement the Government indicated that it was making available the services of two different sets of legal representatives, solicitors and counsel, and advised persons wishing to avail of those services to contact them.</P>
      <P>The decision to make available two sets of legal representatives was taken so as to give persons a choice as to representation.  The solicitors nominated by the Government are Messrs.  Michael E. Hanahoe and Company of 21 Parliament Street, Dublin 2, and Ms. Maura Bates, Coolock Community Law Centre, North-side Shopping Centre, Dublin 5.  The decision to provide a solicitor from the Coolock Community Law Centre has particular significance because of the special place that centre has in the local community who suffered so grieviously from the consequences of the fire.  Deputy Horgan in his contribution stressed the importance of the independence of the legal advice available.  I feel that the Deputy and members of the community generally will be aware of the special place in the heart of the community that the Coolock Community Law Centre has and the trust and acceptance of its independence in the minds and hearts of the people in that area.</P>
      <P>Senior and junior counsel have also been provided.  Messrs. P. Carney, Senior Counsel and Mr. Haugh, B. L., will be instructed by Messrs.  Hanahoe and Co. and Mr. Geraghty, Senior Counsel and Ms. Clissman, B. L. will be instructed by Ms. Bates of the Coolock Community Law Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government statement also advised that any person who did not wish to avail of the services of the legal representatives provided by the Government was, of course, entitled to consult his or her own legal advisers but that such representations would not be covered by the aid being provided by the Government.  I am satisfied that the arrangements made by the Government are adequate and appropriate.  Two sets of legal representatives, solicitors and counsel, have been made available and at no cost to the next-of-kin of the deceased and of the injured.  I might add that facilities of this kind were not made available, <Col N="925" /> for example, to the next-of-kin in the case of the Whiddy Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan mentioned the question of what parties were to be afforded representation before the tribunal.  I am glad that he would appear to agree with my assessment of the situation, that the question as to who is represented or not is a matter solely for the tribunal and I have no function in the matter.  I accept that the Deputy confirmed this situation earlier.  However, for the record and because the question was raised by the Deputy, I should mention that three applications for representation were made to the tribunal on behalf of the next-of-kin who did not wish to avail of the services provided by the solicitors provided by the Government.  As I understand it, the tribunal granted permission to one of these applications, which represented the next-of-kin of twenty-one of the dead and 61 of the injured.  The tribunal refused the other two applications, which represented one person who died and one person who was injured.  The tribunal explained that this was because their work would be unduly protracted if separate representations for the next-of-kin of each individual was allowed.  But the tribunal indicated that this ruling would not preclude any person from furnishing them with details of evidence relevant to the inquiry.  If, in the light of new circumstances, certain parties felt that they should be represented, these applications would be considered. The fact that persons are not represented at the tribunal does not preclude them from placing any evidence they may have in relation to the fire before the tribunal. It should also be noted that the fact that persons may not be given the right to appear before the tribunal does not in any way infringe on any right they may have to compensation or damages arising out of the fire.</P>
    <P>I would add also that, in the case of parties afforded representation before the tribunal, who do not come within the <Col N="926" /> terms of the provision for free legal services made by the Government, section 6 of the Tribunal of Inquiry Evidence (Amendment) Act 1979 makes certain provision regarding costs.  It is important that I should put on the record of the House exactly what are those provisions. They are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  where a Tribunal or, if the Tribunal consists of more than one member, the Chairman of the Tribunal, is of opinion that having regard to the findings of the Tribunal and all other relevant matters there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so, the Tribunal, or the Chairman, may as the case may be, by order direct that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before the Tribunal, by counsel or solicitor, as taxed by a taxing master of the High Court, shall be paid to the person by any other person named in the Order;</P>
    <P>(2)  any sum payable pursuant to an order under this section shall be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction, and</P>
    <P>any sum payable by the Minister for Finance pursuant to an Order under this section shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important to clarify that.  I wish to reiterate that the Government's concern is that the full facts should be established as to what happened on that tragic night. The House may be assured that any recommendations made by the tribunal will be acted on immediately.  I want to assure the House further, and the country generally, that my Department will co-operate fully with the tribunal and will make available any files or documents which the tribunal may feel would be of assistance in their task of getting to the full truth and the full facts of this tragic incident in the Stardust Club.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 13 June 1980 but as inquiries were necessary to establish whether his incapacity arose out of an accident at work he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis pending completion of these inquiries.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 17 February 1981, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been paid.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment which occurred in recent weeks was due mainly to the change-over from insurance numbers to RSI numbers for the purpose of the payment of benefit.</P>

      <P>Following extensive informal consultations between my Department and the EEC Commission, the special Border programme was formally submitted to the Commission on 24 October last.  At that stage it was firmly believed that the programme would be examined at the meeting of the regional fund committee in early December and approved by the Commission immediately afterwards. However, because other member states had not been so prompt in submitting their programmes, the non-quota section was not placed on the agenda for that meeting.  It is now hoped that the programme will be examined at the next meeting of the fund committee, which is scheduled for next May; this would allow the Commission to give its formal approval to the programme in May or June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme includes outline provision for the categories of expenditure mentioned by the Deputy, with the exception of rural electrification, and <Col N="812" /> identifies certain individual items such as the Glenveigh national park.  However, until the programme has been formally adopted by the Commission, it will not be possible to make any firm commitments about allocations of money.  For the same reason, it is not possible at this stage to make any detailed announcement about what the various measures and items will entail.</P>

She appealed against the decision to disallow payment and, in this connection, arrangements have been made to have her examined by a different medical referee on 12 March 1981.  When the result of the examination is available her claim will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Payment of benefit could not be authorised in this case as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the required statutory minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in 1979-80, the contribution year governing his claim.  As he had indicated that he was employed in the United Kingdom prior to May 1980, his British insurance record was requested.  This record, which has only recently been received in my Department, shows that he had sufficient contributions in that year to qualify him for payment of benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who had been in receipt of disability benefit continuously since 1975 claimed maternity allowance in respect of a confinement certified as due in January 1980.  She was paid maternity allowance from 10 December 1979 to 26 January 1980.  Further payment was held pending receipt of certificate of confinement or the child's birth certificate.  When the certificate was received the date of birth shown thereon was in May 1980.  In view of the discrepancy in dates the matter was investigated and it was established that the child had in fact been born on 6 May 1980.  Payment of disability benefit was resumed from 28 January 1980 and an adjusting payment was made to her in respect of the balance of the maternity allowance due.  She has thus received all disability benefit and maternity allowance to which she is entitled.</P>
