      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £37,227,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture for 1981 amounted to £158,275,000 and an additional sum of £35,362,000 was provided in a first Supplementary Estimate in July. This second Supplementary Estimate brings the total net provision for the year <Col N="434" /> to £230,864,000, which is almost 46 per cent above what the previous Government allocated to agriculture at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a copy of what the Minister is reading out, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the second Supplementary Estimate is mainly twofold &mdash; firstly, to fill the gap our predecessors created by underestimation in some key areas and, secondly, to provide funds for certain new measures contained in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>The largest increase is £13.3 million under Subhead M.1.  This covers the farm modernisation scheme including western measures and the interest subsidy for development farmers.  The original allocation in respect of capital grant payments under the farm modernisation scheme and western measures this year was £42.2 million.  This was an unrealistic allocation, as the 1980 provisions totalled as much as £59.5 million.  Grant payments this year are likely to be £50.5 million and so an additional sum of £8.3 million is now required under Subhead M.1, together with £5 million for the interest subsidy.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes claimed that farm development is grinding to a standstill. This is far from being the case.  Approvals for new investments in land improvement, new buildings, etc., have been running at a high level, showing that, despite their difficulties, farmers have confidence in the long-term future of agriculture.</P>
      <P>On 1 September, an interest subsidy scheme was introduced, to give relief on the interest payable on capital borrowed by development farmers under the farm modernisation scheme.  The scheme, which is partly financed by the EEC, provides for a 5 per cent subsidy for two years and applies both to existing loans and to loans contracted for future development. To date about 5,000 applications have been received.  These are being processed at the moment, and payments will be issuing, it is hoped, inside the next few weeks.  A sum of £5 million is provided for the scheme for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> In addition to this subsidy scheme for development farmers, a similar subsidy scheme for other farmers participating in the farm modernisation scheme was announced in the House two days ago. The Supplementary Estimate includes a provision of £3 million under Subhead F.3 for this scheme.  In addition, discussions are in progress with the lending institutions, with a view to introducing a special measure to help the hard core of farmers with very serious repayment problems.  These discussions are well advanced, but the working out of a detailed scheme is a rather complex matter.</P>
    <P>Another large element in the Supplementary Estimate is an additional £8 million under subhead M.3 for livestock headage grants to farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  Half of this extra amount is to cover the underprovision made by the previous Government, while much of the balance required is for the increase in the sheep headage grants announced in the House on 22 July.  These increased sheep headage rates are £9.50 per ewe on the first 150 ewes and £6.50 on the next 50 ewes in a flock, compared with the flat rate of £6.50 announced by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>An additional £5.138 million is being made available under subhead E.1 for the consumer subsidy on liquid milk, bringing the total expenditure on this subsidy in the current year to almost £22½ million.  The National Prices Commission approved an increase in the retail price of milk with effect from 18 August and, in keeping with the commitment in the Government's programme that prices for certain basic foodstuffs would not increase further in the current year, the entire increase is offset by a higher subsidy. Under Subhead A.1 provision is made for a further £2.998 million to meet the cost of special pay increases granted to various grades of Department staff during the year.  The increases under subheads B.1, B.3 and B.15, amounting to almost £2.5 million, are also due to special pay increases by the University Colleges, An Foras Talúntais and An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  By <Col N="436" /> far the biggest item here is a sum of almost £2 million for technicians in An Foras Talúntais, who received a back-dated increase in line with comparable staff in the hospital services.</P>
    <P>An additional provision of £923,200 is made under subhead A.4 for Post Office services.  The cost of these services (telephone, telegram, telex and postage) has increased substantially in the current year.  In addition, the sum allocated originally for postage was based on an estimate made by the Post Office, which proved to be on the very low side.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C.2 a sum of £11,040,000 was provided in the main Estimate, but it is now necessary to provide an additional £1,620,000 to meet the cost of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  The increased expenditure is attributable to higher fees payable to veterinary practitioners for TB testing and, to a smaller extent, some increase in the number of reactors removed for slaughter.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that progress on TB eradication has been disappointing. Admittedly there is a steady, if unspectacular, decrease in reactor incidence figures, but more than 5,000 herds are restricted because of TB and there has been a disquieting increase in incidence in the midland counties and some major breakdowns elsewhere.  Clearly, existing measures for eradicating this disease are not achieving the required results.  After more than 25 years of effort and the expenditure of massive sums from the Exchequer, some changes are now called for.  I do not propose to say more at this stage, but I can assure the House that the effectiveness of existing procedures is currently being reassessed and whatever modifications are needed will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to brucellosis is much more encouraging.  The excess arising on TB is, in fact, more than offset by a saving of £1,720,000 on brucellosis under subhead C.3 and a saving of £300,000 on the hardship fund under subhead C.5.  The reduction in the expenditure on brucellosis arises mainly because the number of reactors removed for slaughter is lower than anticipated.  This <Col N="437" /> is a measure of the success of the brucellosis eradication scheme.  I am confident that, with full farmer co-operation, the present rate of progress can be maintained with full eradication achieved in the not too distant future.  Expenditure from the hardship fund in this year will be around the same level as in 1980 but, because of carry-over from last year, not all of the grant-in-aid voted for 1981 will be needed.</P>
    <P>A sum of £800,000 is required under subhead F.2 for payments to lending institutions against the exchange risk on Euro-loans made available by them for agricultural productive investment. These loans totalled £100 million and have been most useful in encouraging farm investment in present circumstances. The provision of £800,000 takes account of the recent realignment within the EMS of the German and Dutch currencies, in which most of the Euro-loans were borrowed.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead M.5, provision is made for an additional £416,400, which is required to cover adjustments to Ireland's FEOGA accounts for 1974 and 1975.  The closing of these accounts which total some £175 million in all, has only recently reached finality in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There are savings on a number of subheads. A saving of £569,000 arises under subhead B.16, because some expenditure by ACOT on western package projects will not arise in 1981, because the programme was not approved by Brussels until April.  There is a saving of £3.58 million under subhead D.9, which relates to schemes for the production of additional winter fodder.  Due to industrial action by ACOT staff, there has been considerable delay in having completed application forms furnished to my Department.  This will have the effect of reducing the number of grants likely to be paid this year under the schemes.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E.4, provision was made for a payment of £200,000 to the Pigs and Bacon Commission for the promotion of pigmeat consumption and exports.  The saving of £100,000 arises because the Commission have not come forward with promotion projects on which the funds provided could be spent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> Waning support for the Pigs and Bacon Commission as a result of decisions by the European Court in Luxembourg and the Supreme Court in this country has affected their role as the centralised exporter of pigmeat.  Discussions have been taking place with the various interests involved in the industry about the future role and functions of the commission. I am hopeful that these discussions can be brought to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    <P>The saving of £6.047 million on subhead M.4 arises mainly from a lower intake of beef into intervention than had been anticipated.  Receipts from the EEC under subhead N.18 are also down by £7.817 million for the same reason.  There is a net overall increase of £1.77 million on intervention operations for the year. This arises because the deboning rate paid to meat factories was increased earlier in the year and because of higher interest rates on capital borrowed to fund purchases into intervention.  My Department have now to pay 17¼ per cent interest on money borrowed for this purpose, while we receive a standard recoupment rate of only 9 per cent from the EEC.</P>
    <P>A saving of £3.555 million arises on subhead M.10, which relates to the EEC Programme of Special Measures for Ireland.  These include a silage subsidy for first-time silage makers, a subsidy on ground limestone and an AI subsidy scheme.  The saving arises mainly because processing of applications under the silage scheme has been delayed by the industrial dispute at ACOT, to which I referred earlier, and because limestone usage since May when the special measures were approved in Brussels has been less than anticipated.</P>
    <P>There is a net deficiency of £14,443,700 in receipts.  Over half of this is attributable to the reduced recoupment from the EEC for intervention operations, which I have already mentioned.  There is also a reduction of almost £4½ million in receipts from the EEC in respect of the T.B. and brucellosis eradication programmes. This arises because of a delay in the consideration of my Department's claims in Brussels, which makes it unlikely that the funds provided for will be received by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Another sizeable shortfall &mdash; £1.94 million &mdash; relates to the receipts from the UK Government in respect of the beef variable premium on exports of beef to the UK.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, this Supplementary Estimate will result in total State expenditure of almost £231 million for agriculture in 1981, which is some £72½ million more than originally provided. The extra provision for agriculture is being made by the Government notwithstanding the cut-back in public expenditure generally.  This shows the Government's commitment to helping farmers to meet their current financial difficulties and to bring about an improvement in farm incomes as well as the expansion in agricultural output which is of such importance to the entire national economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme envisages a range of measures to assist the agricultural industry and boost production. In our short period in office we have already put many of our proposals into effect.  Others are being considered for implementation in the months ahead. Our whole objective is to stimulate renewed agricultural expansion and growth, and the additional funds which we are now seeking will contribute to the achievement of that objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to take up something that has been said by the Minister of State &mdash; in fact, it has gone up now a bit as compared with what he said last night &mdash; that there is around £70 million additional expenditure for agriculture this year.  The Minister himself said this on numerous occasions. Today in the Minister's speech it is £72½ million extra for agriculture this year. The fact of the matter is that the gross estimate &mdash; gross estimate &mdash; for agriculture in the budget was £239½ million.  The gross estimate under these two Supplementary Estimates is £291 million.  That is a difference of £51½ million, not £72½ million.  All Ministers, as the Minister of State has done here when introducing a Supplementary Estimate, say that it is to fill the gap their predecessors created by under-estimation in some key areas and, secondly, to provide funds for certain new measures contained in the Government's programme.</P>
      <P>I should like to go through the main increases.  The first one that the Minister of State has referred to is the increase in the farm modernisation scheme of £13 million.  Above all expenditure, I am delighted to see that the expenditure on the farm modernisation scheme is continuing at a high level although it will not be as high, even with this Supplementary Estimate, as it was in 1980 when around £60 million was spent under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> It is heartening to see that there is still some little confidence left in the agricultural community.  Money spent under this heading is money that provides added production capacity for the agricultural sector and creates quite a lot of employment. At the beginning of the year I do not think anybody felt that there would be continued activity under this heading as compared with 1980.  Therefore, I welcome the increase under this heading. Nobody from this side of the House when we are here or from the other side of the House when we were over there claimed that farm modernisation was grinding to a halt or to a standstill, as the Minister of State said.  The man who claimed that most consistently in the House and throughout the country is the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  No other person said that as much as he did over the last 18 months.  It is galling to find it in a statement read out by the Minister of State here today.  Nobody ever said that. Quite the contrary, always the opposite was said.  It was the one hopeful sign in the agricultural sector over the last year and I am glad that that is still the position this year.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the £52 million &mdash; not £72½ million as mentioned in the Minister's speech &mdash; of additional gross expenditure this year.  Of what is it made up?  Let us see how it helps the individual farmer.  It is all right to say that there is £72½ million more for agriculture and to create the impression in somebody's mind &mdash; definitely not the farmer's, because he knows the position &mdash; that there are millions and millions being spent and given to farmers.  Maybe the reason is to try to halt many of them from joining the cavalcade that is on its way here for tomorrow.  The farmers, above all, know that this additional expenditure by the Department of Agriculture and its agencies is not going into the farmer's pocket.  Let us look at the main increases. Farm modernisation, granted, that is development work.  The farmers themselves are providing three times more expenditure than is provided here for grant purposes.  We should welcome very sincerely that type of development.  The other major item of increased expenditure <Col N="442" /> is something that happened since the budget, namely, food subsidies, which are to help the consumer, not just the farmer as a consumer, but all consumers, in relation to the price of milk, butter and bread.  There is £15½ million being provided there for something that arose months after the budget.  After the huge price increase we succeeded in negotiating in Brussels as compared with previous years and to cushion the impact on the consumer and the CPI, we introduced the food subsidies costing at that time roughly £10.5 million.  Since then, because of actions by the Government which have increased inflation further they have had to add some more to the food subsidies.  It cannot be said that the £15.5 million is going to the farming community or the agricultural sector.  I always argued during my time in the Department that this should not be a subhead under the Agriculture Vote.  We can now see the reason.  I am not against food subsidies, and introduced them in the first instance, but this £15.5 million will benefit us all, not just the farming community.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the other items of expenditure.  An additional £4 million is being provided for salaries, wages and post office charges under a scheme which the Minister has announced will benefit farmers.  I am not in any way critical of this expenditure because it is just entitlement of the staff within the Department of Agriculture, but I am pointing out that this £4 million will not find its way into the pockets of the farmers. The increases in post office charges occurred since our last budget and it is ridiculous for Ministers to say in introducing Supplementary Estimates that we underestimated the amounts of money required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The other increase is under the EEC special measures.  This amounts to about £6 million, having been reduced from £9 million.  We in government were proud to introduce these measures.  When we hear Government <Col N="443" /> spokesmen claiming to have provided an additional £70 million for the farming community we must examine exactly what has been provided.  Prior to the election Fine Gael stated that they accepted that the farming income gap must be closed and should be restored as soon as possible to not less than 1978 levels in real terms.  They have provided a total of £11 million in new measures which are as follows: £3 million interest subsidy for 70,000 farmers, amounting to 25p per day; £5 million for the EEC interest subsidy which I negotiated; £2.5 million to increase the sheep subsidy from £6.50 to £9.50.  These are measures provided by a Government who said that farm incomes must be restored to 1978 levels.  The Minister for Agriculture has bandied the figure of £600 million as the amount required to achieve that objective. He will rue the day he ever gave that figure because he will be hung on it forever, especially in view of the fact that they have provided only £11 million.</P>
      <P>I could speak on this subject all day but I know there are a number of people behind me and on the other side who wish to speak, some of whom have tried on several occasions to contribute to discussions on agriculture and have been unable to do so because of time limits. We are again subject to a limit today and I will not take up too much time.</P>
      <P>I referred previously in this House to a speech made here last July by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy D'Arcy, during which he stated:</P>
      <P>The reason why some of our programme was not announced yesterday is that the Minister and I are currently engaged in consultations with the banks and the ACC.  This is the valve from which can be released the expansion as far as agriculture is concerned in the coming year.  There is no use in releasing that valve next March or April as the previous Minister did.</P>
      <P>I presume that reference is to myself.  The Minister of State continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action has to be taken now.  I hope <Col N="444" /> this announcement can be made around the first week in September although I hope it will be a little sooner.</P>
    <P>The same Minister in his speech this morning stated:</P>
    <P>In addition, discussions are in progress with the lending institutions with a view to introducing a special measure to help the hard core of farmers with very serious repayment problems. These discussions are well advanced but the working out of a detailed scheme is a rather complex matter.</P>
    <P>If the farmers have an opportunity to read what we have been saying here today they will realise the effects of the Government's actions in the past five months.</P>
    <P>I would refer particularly to the statement of the Minister of State in which he said &ldquo;action has to be taken now&rdquo;.  He also said they would not do the stupid thing the previous Minister had done when he announced something in April or May.  Of course their action was to increase duties and today we have before us the second Supplementary Estimate to provide funds for additional measures introduced by us when we were in Government, plus additional costs which normally arise in various Departments because of staff, telephone charges and so on.  There has been a £20 million reduction in appropriations-in-aid but unfortunately the Minister wants to count that £20 million twice.  One must look at the gross expenditure of the Department, £291 million as against the figure in January last, and one gets a reduction of £52 million.  After five months in office, the Government are giving a total sum of £11 million for new measures.</P>
    <P>I should hate to think that somebody is trying to pull a trick and later to try to blame the officials, who are blameless in this.  There seems to be some sort of con job or trick going on.  At the beginning of the statement the Minister attacked Fianna Fáil for not providing sufficient money and later he spoke about a deficiency. He said:</P>
    <P>There is a net deficiency of £14,443,700 <Col N="445" /> in receipts.  Over half of this is attributable to the reduced recoupment from the EEC for intervention operations, which I have already mentioned.  There is also a reduction of almost £4½ million in receipts from the EEC in respect of the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes. This arises because of a delay in the consideration of my Department's claims in Brussels, which makes it unlikely that the funds provided for will be received by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say these moneys will be received.  They will come in next year and they will represent roughly the sum looked for in the Supplementary Estimate.  It is a sizeable sum of money in any language, but we must put it in perspective if we are to be honest with the community and not create the impression that farmers will get every penny of this money.  They will get very little of it. The entire amount provided since July is less than £11 million and we must contrast that with the full picture for agricultural expenditure this year and with the actions the Government have taken and how they affect the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The July budget added 5 per cent to inflation.  The Government can argue until the cows come home but that is the figure.  When I was Minister for Agriculture I had to listen daily to criticism from Opposition benches and from outside commentators, including farmer's leaders, that every 1 per cent increase in inflation took £15 million out of farmer's incomes.  I do not know if that figure is correct but it is one we had to listen to and I have not seen it contradicted.  Five times 15 are 75 &mdash; £75 million is now being taken out of farmers' pockets because of the 5 per cent inflation increase caused by the July budget, yet the Government are handing out a measly £11 million.  In other words, the farmers are £64 million worse off.  I will compare that with the situation when we were in office.  There was a serious problem in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what they have done.  We experienced an inflation rate of 16 per cent to 18 per cent but the improvement in farmers' incomes matched that because of better commodity prices and because we worked very hard to provide special measures at home and in the EEC.  There was a substantial increase in agricultural prices of 14 per cent in March and April this year.  The measures we succeeded in achieving in Brussels and at home brought up the additional money for farmers by more than 17 per cent, relatively the rate of inflation.  This led independent economists to admit last April that we had halted the very serious decline in agricultural incomes and that indeed we created the atmosphere for a 5 per cent to 7 per cent real increase in agricultural incomes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is living in the past.  I am talking about April of this year when, according to independent economists, we had halted the decline in agriculture and were on the road to progress. In their first five months the Government have taken £75 million out of agriculture and put £11 million in.  That is a shortfall of £64 million.  That is taking roughly 5 per cent of the 17 per cent increase we had provided for in farming prices away from the farming community. It is no wonder they are so frustrated and so angry, especially having regard to the statements made by Ministers.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy is putting a brave face on it.  He announced a few things a few times.  He announced the same things a few times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which have not come into operation yet.  He does not sit at the Cabinet table.  Last week in Cork the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, announced the introduction of another subsidy.  In every corner of the country Ministers are announcing the introduction of subsidies of one kind or another, but the reality is that no more is being provided than we had negotiated in the EEC and committed the Government to do in May of last year.</P>
      <P>I could delay the House further in listing the items, in addition to the actions which have increased inflation and taken tens of millions of pounds from farmers' incomes, which the Government have not introduced, and which were announced by us and put into operation by us before June of this year.  While I welcome the increase of £13 million for farm modernisation, I am shocked and dismayed to find that the allocation for western drainage is cut back by £1 million, notwithstanding the fact that we got additional money from the EEC.  The new EEC measures for the west are cut back by £5 million.  We have a Minister of State who is responsible for western development.</P>
      <P>When I saw the Supplementary Estimate last night I was saddened to find that the two major operations for agricultural structural development in the west, which we all know is badly needed &mdash; and the money provided was not anything like adequate&mdash;show a saving of £6 million.  That figure can be doubled because all of these schemes get a contribution of at least 50 per cent from the EEC.  To me that is tragic.  It is another example of how much the Government care about the west.  They want to wipe it out.  It does not matter whether it is Tuam, or the briquette factory, or Knock airport, they just want to kill the west. They want political vengeance against the west.  They will rue the day, because many people living in the east are from the west and they will remember the west.  The Government will learn that very fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other speakers want to <Col N="448" /> get in, and I hope they will.  When I put down a motion last week about the very serious position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the common agricultural policy of the EEC and the very serious position regarding the decline in farmers' incomes, the Government put down an amendment to that motion.  I will read the amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Supports the efforts being made by the Government to ensure that the fundamental principles of the Common Agricultural Policy are fully protected in the discussions on the Report of the EEC Commission on the Mandate of the 30 May 1980...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Largely that was the same as what was in the first part of our motion.  The second part is different:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... and endorses the steps being taken by the Government to improve farm incomes and reverse the downward trend in agricultural output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On Tuesday night something happened. The Government withdrew their amendment and accepted that they had to take steps from national and EEC resources to halt the decline in farmers' incomes and to restore confidence in the agricultural sector.  It is no wonder they withdrew it.  In all honesty, how could anybody ask this House to endorse the steps being taken by the Government to improve farm incomes when all they have done so far is to bring about a minus situation of £64 million at least in farmers' incomes.  They were right to withdraw their amendment.</P>
    <P>This House has now called on the Government to take whatever steps are necessary from national and EEC resources to halt the decline in farmers' incomes and to restore confidence in the agricultural sector.  The words used by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on 23 July were not to do it in March or April but to do it now.  They should do something apart from robbing the farmers further. I want to refer to the confusion which has been created.  Talk about the propaganda <Col N="449" /> put out by the Government since they took office about our management of the Government's finances.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance replied to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald on 18 November.  He gave details of how savings announced in the July budget would be made.  The first heading is Agriculture and the saving is £7.96 million. The main heads under which savings in column 2 of the reply are to be achieved are staff costs, intervention expenses and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We have now seen in a Supplementary Estimate before the Dáil that staff costs are going up by £2.9 million. Yesterday week there was somebody in the Department of Finance who thought there was to be a saving on staff costs in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>There is a saving on intervention expenses.  Somebody in the Department of Finance thought there was to be a saving on the disadvantaged areas scheme, but we now find that the disadvantaged areas scheme needs £8 million more.  We now find that an extra £11 million is needed under those headings in the Supplementary Estimate.  Who is trying to fool whom, or does anybody know what is happening?  This will have to be taken further.  It is a very serious matter that this House should be misled by a statement made by the Minister for Finance in reply to a Parliamentary Question and referring to savings in the Department of Agriculture of £7.96 million under the headings of staff costs and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Eight days later in the Supplemenary Estimate we see that staff costs have increased by £3 million and the cost of the disadvantaged areas scheme has increased by £8 million.  That is a very serious matter which we will pursue at another time because I do not want to delay the House much further.</P>
      <P>I do not believe people on the Government side of the House care about disadvantaged areas because we have seen what they have done about them.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will put pressure on the Minister because we would welcome that.  The major additional benefit to the agricultural sector and the farmer announced by the Government was the increase in the sheep headage payment.  A grant of £2½ million was announced but, like everything else they have been doing, there is a trick in that also.  Those of us who know a little about disadvantaged and mountain areas know that the only type of exercise which can be undertaken on most of those farms is the rearing of sheep and beef cattle.  There were limits on the numbers who would qualify but the most serious development, as far as disadvantaged areas are concerned, is that they are now going to combine sheep and cattle headage payments.  Many farmers who are depending on headage payments, which are income supplements, not incentives&mdash;the EEC introduced this scheme because of the serious income situation of farmers in those areas &mdash; will suffer great hardship in disadvantaged areas because the income supplement they would have got in addition to the sheep headage payment, under the cattle headage payments has now been curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House must be honest and sincere about the serious situation confronting the farming community and with which they have had to live over the past couple of years.  When I held the honourable office of Minister for Agriculture we recognised the very serious difficulties and we set about using every means at our disposal to resolve those problems. Between national and EEC measures, over an eight to ten month period, we provided additional hundreds of millions of pounds.  We were very careful about the rate and level of inflation because we knew how it affected not only the economy but, above all, the agricultural sector.  The agricultural community, having gone through a difficult couple of years, are now sentenced to another period &mdash; I hope it is short &mdash; of gloom because of the actions of the Government. <Col N="451" /> An additional sum of £72 million has been provided for agriculture according to the Minister's statement which, with a drop of £20 million for Appropriations-in-Aid ends up as £52 million.  When one takes into account the various items to which I have already referred, food subsidies and farm modernisation grants to which farmers are entitled, one can see that the sum total provided by the Government is £11 million. The Government have taken £75 million out of farmers' incomes because of their actions in increasing inflation.  It is no wonder farmers are frustrated and angry.  Arising from the motion accepted by the Government this week, this House has asked the Government to do something now from national and EEC resources.  We will be looking forward to solid action.  Money is urgently needed to solve the plight of the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Supplementary Estimate, I should like to refer to the last speaker's reference to our criticism of their management of finance.  It was a rather arrogant statement and not in keeping with the facts. Since the Supplementary Estimates were individually introduced I have seen what the exact position is and was <i>vis-à-vis</i> the January budget.  The Defence Estimate was £15 million short, the Environment Estimate was £30 million short, causing a shortfall in housing.  Social Welfare was £37 million short and, because of an underfinancing of agriculture in the January 1981 budget we had in July to include a Supplementary Estimate of £35 million and now we have to include a Supplementary Estimate of £37 million. This is a condemnation of the former Government who completely mismanaged finances in the different Departments. If the money is not there it is not possible to do the job.  The January 1981 budget is the main cause of our problems. Irrespective of what Deputy MacSharry said, the different Supplementary Estimates clearly indicate that there was bad management and indifference to what was needed to continue running Departments for 12 months, which necessitated <Col N="452" /> a supplementary budget in July.  They did not include it in the January budget because of the impending general election.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate. It is urgently needed for agriculture which is suffering so badly at present. While there may be a shortfall in some of the Estimates, we must appreciate we are doing the best we can in a serious financial situation.  As a rural Deputy I know from the many applications I have had in connection with farm modernisation grants, that people have been told that their grant cannot be paid because the Department were waiting for the Supplementary Estimate to enable them to pay grants to farmers.</P>
      <P>That situation was created by the shortfall in the January budget.  There was not enough money to ensure that the developments carried out by these farmers would be covered.  Thus we created further problems for these people.  The people I represent, small farmers who have courageously taken on these jobs, need every assistance.  It rings very hollow when I hear what Deputy MacSharry, former Minister for Agriculture, said about the way finance was handled by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>I have travelled my constituency and I have seen the problem.  This is one area where the money was needed, but the farmers could not get it because it was not there.  We pleaded with farmers to improve their farming methods.  They courageously took the steps that were needed, but when they needed money to help them it was not there.  This Government have the money and I hope it will be available before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I attended a meeting in my area last Saturday in connection with a disadvantaged area covering North Tipperary, South Tipperary and part of East Limerick.  Neither the last Government nor the previous Coalition Government can take any credit for the handling of this scheme.  The scheme was submitted in 1974 and finally adopted in 1978. In my constituency the better-off farmer is included because he is in a certain electoral division while poorer farmers <Col N="453" /> are not included.  A further submission must be made to Brussels to ensure that these unfortunate people are included.  I can assure Deputy MacSharry that we in North Tipperary are concerned about the disadvantaged areas and hope that through the efforts of the agricultural committees, Deputies and the Department of Agriculture, this submission will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks there has been a great deal of unease and concern throughout the country because of a statement which said that, despite the very large sums of money which have been spent on eradicating bovine tuberculosis, it has been unsuccessful.  This is an unfortunate and sad ending to an attempt to resolve this problem and deserves a special inquiry. Eight or nine years ago an inquiry was made into an aspect of that scheme when information was received that money had been spent in the wrong direction.  In view of the recent statement about the abject failure to resolve this problem the Department should deal with this as a matter of urgency.  We talk about farming problems, but if this disease is not eradicated it can do a lot of damage despite all the taxpayers' money that has been spent.</P>
    <P>We have a particular problem in my constituency with regard to bovine tuberculosis. We urgently need a second TB office in North Tipperary.  It has been sanctioned and discussions are going on between the Office of Public Works, the Department and the ACC, who can provide the office in Nenagh.  I plead with the Minister to have this matter resolved as soon as possible because we are coming to the peak period in livestock movement. Hundreds of farmers have to travel many miles to Tipperary town to an office which is already overworked.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the threatened closure of the Tuam factory.  We were all concerned that money should be given to that factory rather than invested in a scheme which was not as viable, because we were concerned about employment.  I extend that concern to the overall picture of Comhlacht Siúcre Éireann Teoranta because we have a factroy in Thurles which at the moment <Col N="454" /> seems to be going well, but the agencies involved must ensure that substantial capital investment will be made available to that industry in order to avoid a Tuam-like situation.  There is no point in waiting until Saturday to find out the factory will be closed on Monday.  I am concerned about the jobs in that factory and about the commercial life of the area. We have one natural resource industry which is very near exhaustion and 600 jobs are involved.</P>
    <P>We must ensure through the Department of Agriculture that money is made available to CSET so that the Thurles factory is made as viable and as modern as Mallow and Carlow.  We owe it to the farmers, the workers and the commercial life of the area.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Agriculture that we are very concerned about this factory at Thurles.  We may not have reached the same serious stage as Tuam, but the wise man looks after his business before it gets into difficulties.  I urge the Minister to deal with this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions to ask the Minister.  I ask him to ensure that the various grants overdue to the people of the west and especially County Donegal are paid as soon as possible. There are areas in County Donegal where inspections have not yet been carried out.  These are delaying tactics to ensure that the grants will not have to be paid until next year.  I am making a special appeal on behalf of those people that the headage and silage grants be paid, that inspections be carried out immediately and that the payments be made soon after.  I appeal to the Minister to have those payments out before Christmas.  I am sure he appreciates that, with the rate of inflation and other economic difficulties, it is becoming more difficult for families to survive there.  The amount of the grants may not seem a lot to some members but to those who are waiting for them and those who are deprived they represent a lot of money.  They are due those grants but at this stage I believe they would look upon them as a bonus if they were paid before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> I was disappointed to learn that £6 million will be deducted from the original allocation for the west of Ireland.  However, the people of the west will not forget that.  They have long memories.  It should be remembered that many people who were born in the west now live and vote in the east of the country.  In the not too distant future they will remind the Government of the deduction of £6 million from a deprived area.  It is because the west is a deprived area that Ireland has been declared an underdeveloped region in the Community like southern Italy, and it is because of the conditions that prevail in these areas that those living in the midlands and south get special EEC benefits.  Instead of deducting £6 million the Government should be adding at least that amount to help develop the west.  In reality a deduction of £6 million means a loss of £12 million, because the Government money would be covered pound for pound by the EEC. The people of the west will not forget this move and the Minister would be wise to ensure that in the next budget they are given their just reward.  It is because of the people of the west that Ireland gets a reasonable allocation from Brussels. Finally, I hope the Minister can give me an assurance that the cheques I have referred to will be issued to the people in my constituency before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that in this Supplementary Estimate the Minister is providing sufficient money to satisfy all the needs of the west, or any part of it, but I recognise that the Government took over in the middle of the year and that they found that requirements were underestimated for the year ahead.  The Minister did not have much option but to raise the necessary finance to fill the gaps that existed in the policies already in operation.  He succeeded in adding a little for the most urgent needs of the agricultural community.  I hope that in the forthcoming budget an effort will be made to relate spending to a policy which will help to encourage production and restore farm incomes to a decent relationship with the incomes of other people.  I hope <Col N="456" /> that by the same means more jobs will be created and our balance of payments improved.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by the last speaker about the western drainage scheme and a reduction of £6 million, it is important that we understand what all this is about.  Under the farm modernisation scheme grants were made available for drainage which was part of a farm plan prepared by a farmer.  The grant amounted to 50 per cent of the actual cost without any limit on the amount of money a farmer might invest in the reclaiming of an acre.  The western drainage scheme grant, amounting to 50 per cent of the cost, was subsidised by 10 per cent from Brussels.  That grant was increased to 75 per cent and the Fianna Fáil Government reduced their commitment and investment in drainage in the west.  They attached to this a limit and a fixed costing which were not updated or upgraded.  We were supposed, on paper, to have been getting a 70 per cent grant towards the improvement of land under the western drainage scheme but, in fact, we are getting considerably less than 50 per cent.  That is the sort of dishonesty we have become accustomed to when people do not understand what this is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that the grant under that scheme was reduced and that since the Government took office no reduction has taken place.  There was not a reduction, as a result of the Supplementary Estimate, in the amount of the grant available to individual farmers.  For eight months before the former Minister left office his officials had left on his desk more realistic costings on drainage in the west but he went through his budget and prepared his Estimate ignoring those realistic costings. If we could see those costings I believe we would learn that they are not nearly as generous as the money provided to people involved in industrial development with the IDA and other sections.  I would love to see them compared with the costings county councils or the Office of Public Works would prepare if they were to carry out similar work.  However, they represent improved costings, but the Minister ignored them and continued to <Col N="457" /> give farmers something like 50 per cent of the amount the scheme states farmers are entitled to.  That Government ignored completely the cost increases and the difficulties experienced in the agricultural sector in the west.</P>
    <P>I admit that the last Minister, like any other Minister, had problems and we should face up to that situation.  We should try to relate our remarks to reality and put forward honest appraisals of the problems and who created them.  I am not trying to blame the former Minister for all the problems of farmers.  But, having failed to solve them, having presided over them getting steadily worse, he should have come to the House in humility about his failure and tried to be honest and constructive with the person who has responsibility for doing the job at present. It was an extraordinary performance for a person who should know all the red herrings, the references to unimportant things and trying to make £5 million or £6 million into something of major significance to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>One thing that intrigues me when I look at this Supplementary Estimate, and the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, is with all the schemes we have why the situation is as bad as it is?  At one time I used to understand most of them but in recent years it would take a computer to store all the details relating to all the little schemes that have been created mainly in response to political situations and in an effort to shut somebody's mouth for the time being.  They were introduced in the full knowledge that the problem would not be solved.  I believe we could compress the activities of the Department into a narrower field and that that would have a greater effect.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this proliferation of mickey mouse schemes for the west and for the various sectors is solving the problem.  In fact those schemes are leading to a wasteful use in administration of important resources.  I can see that happening annually.  I see more agricultural officers, more cars on the road and more people visiting farmers, but I see incomes steadily dropping.  I do not say that those people visiting farmers are the cause of <Col N="458" /> a drop in income but they are not improving the situation.  We should re-appraise our attitude to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the original Estimate that development farmers will get something in the region of 15 per cent of the total Estimate of the Department in direct aids towards increasing production.  I have not the exact figure but I am sure that if one examined it one would find that those are the farmers, together with the small number of commercial farmers we have, who produce a considerable proportion of our total agricultural output, far in excess of their percentage as a proportion of the total number of farmers.  Yet only 15 per cent of the total budget finds its way into their hands to encourage them to develop further.  I agree that the classification of development farmers is incorrect and that that category should be considerably wider than it is at present in the entire farming sector.  Nevertheless we must recognise that until such time as a higher percentage of the total money spent reaches their pockets for development we will not achieve the sort of increase in the rate of agricultural growth we should.</P>
    <P>I have discovered also that more than 30 per cent of the total money is being spent on the payment of wages in the Department of Agriculture.  Most of that is incurred on administration.  It does not include the advisory services whose work we must recognise to be considerably more productive and related to increased production than that of the average agricultural officer.  I do not propose that we could get rid of all of them overnight.  All of us to whom the Minister will listen should be telling him to reduce those excessive administrative costs, thereby ensuring that the money provided finds its way in the form of some type of incentive to farmers.  I agree that a distinction should be drawn between the supplementary income and the incentive, but the one should be more the concern of the Department of Agriculture and the other more a social cost which we should be prepared to bear and must bear in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things one <Col N="459" /> would like to say about the grants, not only those for western drainage but also those paid for farm development.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider an urgent review of their costings.  If those costings were to be calculated by the people who undertake costings for the Industrial Development Authority or some of the other semi-State bodies, they would discover that what the farmers are receiving constitutes a mere 7 per cent or 8 per cent of their total development costs.</P>
    <P>There is provision also in this Supplementary Estimate for the protection of borrowing institutions against Euro-loans. The Minister and all concerned should examine this situation very carefully. It amounts to a small amount of money &mdash; I think, £800,000.  The Minister should examine that carefully and ask those financial institutions what they did with their profits on the loans they borrowed at 7 per cent and 8 per cent and passed on to farmers at 16 per cent and 17 per cent.  That situation need never have arisen.  I recall three years ago speaking in the Seanad on this subject when I pointed out to the then Minister that, having joined the European Monetary System, we had tied ourselves to the staple currencies of the EEC.  We had committed ourselves to not having any serious divergence in the value of our currencies.</P>
    <P>What we forgot is that we must exercise a sort of discipline in our economy to ensure that our currency would maintain a realistic value within those bands. Indeed, whether or not our currency has a realistic value is very much open to question as a result of the different performance of our economy from those of the currencies with which we were supposed to retain parity.  In the 18 months following our joining the European Monetary System we found that average interest rates being paid by farmers on the Continent were of the order of 6 per cent to 7 per cent.  Those are not subsidised incomes because they represent mostly the interest subsidy rather than the direct grant payment.  But farmers were borrowing at 2 per cent and 3 per cent interest <Col N="460" /> when they availed of the subsidies that were going.  Banks were lending money freely in large amounts at 6 per cent to 7 per cent.  Even though we joined the European Monetary System we followed British interest rates.  While we had to sell on the same market as our European partners Irish farmers were paying 18 per cent, and some in excess of that figure.</P>
    <P>I could never understand why an Irish Government accepted a situation in which, while we were part of the European Monetary System, our farmers were forced to pay those interest rates &mdash; and indeed industry as well &mdash; while our partners in Europe had money available to them so much cheaper.  I raised this with the Minister from the Government side of the Seanad at that time.  I received full support.  I was told by Senators, who are now no longer Members, that they agreed absolutely and that they could not understand why our Government would not encourage our financial institutions to lend.  Because of the common agricultural policy, even had we had a devaluation of the pound we would certainly not have lost the equivalent amount of money because agricultural prices, since they are fixed in units of account, would not have dropped automatically.  In fact they would have increased and we would have had an absolute, in-built, automatic protection against devaluation.</P>
    <P>The Government at that time were directly responsible.  I recognise that nothing can be done about it now because European interest rates have been forced upwards by the dollar.  But over a long period the banks quietly borrowed money in Europe at the right rate and openly passed it on to farmers and other investors at a very high profit.  Therefore I wonder about the wisdom of the Minister including that type of protection.  I recognise that at the time perhaps he was forced into it by powerful institutions who do not always make it known to the public what is their real position or how they transact their deals while producing accounts giving what they want people to believe is their actual position.  The full implications of the things they do are difficult to understand on the part of the <Col N="461" /> public generally.  It is very difficult to understand why Irish farmers were forced to borrow money in those years at 18 per cent when it was freely available at 6½ per cent and 7 per cent and when devaluation constituted absolutely no risk.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to hear ex-Ministers on the other side of the House weep about the situation, to hear Deputy Mac Sharry, who was the Minister responsible at the time, cry about the situation for the past six months, the damage done by the 3 per cent inflation which he magnified to 5 per cent, and which he contended was probably brought about by the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate.  This was not something done at the will of the Government but rather because they had no choice.  Nevertheless one would find it difficult to understand that he was Minister for Agriculture in a period when the inflation rate was allowed to diverge from the average European rate by as much as 10 per cent. If Deputy MacSharry believes the figures he gave &mdash; that every 1 per cent takes £15 million out of the pockets of farmers &mdash; then let him calculate what it cost Irish farmers to have a Fianna Fáil Government in office for the past four years.  His figure is probably exaggerated.  If it were not, we would be building workhouses and hospitals for farmers who would have no income at all in the present year.  The situation is bad enough, but Deputy MacSharry must expect the people on this side of the House and the public generally to have an extraordinarily short memory.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry weeps also about the situation in the west.  I am not saying I have all the answers, but again the former Minister presided over a situation in which the number of sheep on the land in the west, on which he says the farmers of the west depend so much, the number of cattle &mdash; the number of suckling cows has dropped by 10 per cent &mdash; the number of dry stock, every single item of stock on which the western farmer depends for a living was reduced in number in the two years Deputy MacSharry was in office and in the four years the Fianna Fáil Government were in office.  I would like them to recall that this is the situation <Col N="462" /> that they have brought about.  Farmers' incomes have dropped by 50 per cent in two years.  I am not saying they could have solved the problem, but let them be honest enough to say that the policies that were in existence have been a failure. All their mickey mouse solutions were designed to blind people for the time being with a few pounds for the making of silage and a couple of pounds for crushed limestone.  They are only mickey mouse solutions to a problem which is so big that to solve it will require the full co-operation of everybody in this House, the full co-operation of the farming organisations and the Government and a sensible and constructive approach by whoever happens to be in opposition at the time.</P>
    <P>Let us not tell the farmers of the west that they are entitled to this, that and the other and that because they are entitled to it they will have to get it, because we know that the taxpayers have no intention of providing the sort of money that we need at this moment to give the farmers in the west the standard of living they need if they are to live in any sort of peace and dignity.  We know that the taxpayers are not prepared to do it.  That is the sad situation.  So let us take the Estimate that is provided and let us ask ourselves how we can take that money and convert it into some sort of vehicle which will lead the farmer to increased production and improvement so that they can bring our young people into employment and improve our balance of payments and all the other things that increased production can do.  We have to take a basic look at the whole question of how we are spending this money.  What we have got is patch upon patch, introduced one after another in response to the political need of the moment and the need to pacify people before the next election.  That will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>We cannot force these people off the land because there are no jobs for them and no prospect of emigration open to them.  So we have to design our budget properly.  When we joined the EEC the total amount of our budget spent on agriculture was about 14 per cent of our public spending.  Today it has gone down <Col N="463" /> to 4 per cent.  What did we do?  We joined the EEC.  We were relieved of the necessity to spend so much money.  Our food subsidies were paid for.  Incidentally, I do not agree with food subsidies being part of an agricultural Estimate; they are a social consideration and we should redesign this.  We complained about it in Europe and we also complained about the situation with regard to food aid. Before I became a Member of this House I noticed that this aid was included in the agricultural Estimates of this House, and it should not be.  But we saved an amount of money on food subsidies and on export subsidies.  We were able to give our farmers an improved standard of living.  But what we did was to transfer a proportion of our budget and our spending into other areas.  If we had not joined the EEC and if we had not been relieved of the need to subsidise our agriculture, we would have found that we could not spend as much money today on education as we do.  We would not have as advanced a system of social welfare as we have, and it is not very advanced.  We would have had serious cutbacks in other areas.  We must recognise that through our involvement in the EEC we have been enabled to transfer this spending from agriculture to other areas.  But my belief is that we should not have transferred it.  If at that time we had taken the money that was saved, the £300 or £400 million that we got when we joined the EEC and had devoted that money to the development of agriculture, to the training of young people in agriculture, which is so important and so neglected, we would not be importing £700 million worth of food this year and we would not have so many young people seeking jobs.  We would not have the cost squeeze on our co-operatives and we could have expected to have an increase in agricultural production and developed and borrowed and spent accordingly.  But we did not do that and have now found that we have a decrease in agricultural production.  We could have avoided that situation.</P>
    <P>But at this stage let us ask ourselves what we should do.  Let us cease to blame each other for what has happened in the <Col N="464" /> past five to ten years.  Let us prepare a plan, in so far as we can, through the use of the budgetary facilities of this House. Let us, for a year or two until agriculture gets out of this mess, raise as much money as we can and invest it to encourage the maximum possible production.</P>
    <P>In the area of agriculture, let us divide the social needs of individuals who happen to be in a difficult position from our desire to increase agricultural production. Let us recognise that of this 130,000 people living on the land quite a number of them are not actually farmers.  Quite a number of them can never be made viable.  But if they can get some part of their living from the land, let us introduce some sort of income supplements which will solve their problem.  Let us take our agricultural budget and invest and spend that money so that we will encourage an increase in production from the farmers we know can do it, the ones with the training, the skills and sufficient acreage of land.  I do not accept that the budget is being used to do that.  In the years ahead we should all realistically reappraise the manner in which we are spending this money.</P>
    <P>We have a difficult situation in the west.  They have disastrously low incomes.  If cattle prices improve by £2 or £3 a hundredweight farmers quickly forget what happened last year.  That is the nature of farmers.  It is not really their weakness; it is their strength.  That is what has kept them there through the generations. The resilience is in the farmers of Ireland.  That is a good thing.  I recognise that if there is a good morning and a good mart they forget what happened.  But the truth is that they have been living below subsistence level for the last two or three years.  The headage scheme was not well conceived in the first place.  But in this year, by increasing our payments to the maximum allowable by the EEC, we can give the farmers in the west, in the severely handicapped areas, a further £30 million.  We can do that and we will only have to raise £15 million from our own resources here.  If I were asking the Minister or the Government to raise £15 million to give to those people I might not do it.  But because I am asking him to <Col N="465" /> raise £15 million to spend £30 million, because I know he will get £15 million from the Community which we will not have to bargain for, it would be the wise thing to do at this time.  In this year it should be done.</P>
    <P>I know where some of this money will go.  Perhaps about one-third of it will go into the hands of elderly people who may have a little savings and who might put it in the bank; one-third will go towards giving farmers and their families the minimum standard of living they can expect and are entitled to; at least one-third of it will be spent in the purchase of livestock in the development of the farm and farm yard.  Almost all the money put up by the State will be re-invested and will justify this action in the years to come.  I know it is a difficult situation.  I recognise and sympathise with the difficulties of the Minister who came into office to discover that his predecessor either failed to estimate or had not the courage to face up to the cost of administering his Department in the years ahead.  I know that in those circumstances it is difficult for a Minister to do all the things he would like to do because he must finance the things to which he was already committed before he came into office.  I have considerable sympathy for him.  If it were the start of a new year with the introduction of a new budget I might perhaps be a bit more critical.</P>
    <P>On the question of disease eradication, the performance of the Department of Agriculture and the veterinary surgeons and everybody involved has been most disappointing.  On the situation of serious unjustified breakdowns the actual testing being carried out requires thorough investigation by the Department of Agriculture. I do not wish to blame anyone for what has happened, but the agricultural industry has been paying the price of getting rid of reactors because the Government have not been paying it. Farmers get only a small subsidy towards the cost of eliminating reactors from their herds.  Anyone who suffered a serious breakdown in the past year was forced to sell reactor livestock, particularly if it was a dairy herd.  That farmer, if he had borrowed, would be in dire straits, regardless <Col N="466" /> of his experience, skill and efforts.  If everyone had been doing the job as it should have been done, we would not have the present situation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I have observed his contributions in this House and in public before he took up this responsible post.  I am absolutely confident that he will ensure that the money is spent in the best way possible and that there is no shilling in this Supplementary Estimate that could have been avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and I regret that he was not appointed Minister for Agriculture.  As a practising and full-time farmer he would have the interest of farmers more at heart than would his Minister.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister's speech this morning that the need for a second Supplementary Estimate is mainly twofold. He comes on the heels of his predecessor, Deputy MacSharry, who, from October 1980 until he went out of office in June 1981, had brought in no less than 20- odd schemes which were of benefit to farmers. If the Minister wishes, I can list them, starting with subsidies on first-time silage makers, on manures, removal of rates and local authorities being asked to adopt an understanding attitude towards farmers. It is sad to see, in these last few weeks, that prominent members of farming organisations have been threatened with legal action because they are not in a position to pay their rates.  I appeal to the Minister present to ask the Minister for the Environment to instruct the local authorities to ask managers and rate collectors to take a lenient view towards farmers who find themselves in difficulties in regard to the payment of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantial increases in cattle and sheep headage payments which took place under the previous Minister for Agriculture were of great benefit to the country and brought back confidence into the livestock industry.  This year, under the present Minister, there has been no increase in the rate of payment of headage grants to farmers in the disadvantaged area.  The beef suckler scheme was <Col N="467" /> a major initiative of the previous Minister to improve cattle numbers.  He stated on a number of occasions that the beef industry was one of our greatest agricultural assets.  Being an agricultural country with a reputation as producers of quality livestock, we should be concentrating on increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>To find when the confidence fell out of the livestock industry, we have only to look back to 1974, to the present Minister's predecessor, Mr. Mark Clinton. who did not bring in any initiative to help farmers who were being forced to take anything from £2.50 to £10 per cwt. for livestock.  That was when the farmers in the west took a scourging from which they have not yet recovered.  That was when the bottom fell out of livestock production.  Farmers, on entry into the EEC, felt that they were into a major market, but within 18 months of joining that market, they found themselves let down totally by a Minister for Agriculture who took no steps to help them in 1974, with the exception of the implementation of a scheme of food vouchers. That proved a major fiddle in itself, as the country well knows.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce a scheme of grants sufficient to encourage farmers to return to the rearing of livestock.  No doubt, the Minister is aware that on return to schemes of that nature it will be approximately four years before the benefits are to be seen.</P>
    <P>The factories benoan the low cattle numbers being received for slaughter.  I doubt if they want to remember the beating which they gave the farmers in 1974. I know it as a farmer and all my friends and neighbours and every other farmer, that at that stage the farmer had to go to a middleman if he wanted his cattle slaughtered.  If he did not do that, he had to wait in the queue for anything up to six weeks.  That is why farmers today prefer to sell their cattle on the hoof, rather than on the hook.  Our meat industry has nobody to blame but itself for the way in which farmers now regard it.  It saddens me to hear, from some of my friends in Europe, that members of the Government had placed a motion in <Col N="468" /> the European Parliament stating that the refunds on live exports from Ireland should be cut.  Having an involvement in the lifestock trade, I make no bones about saying that had it not been for the live exporters and the demand created for Irish cattle in the Middle East and Africa, the situation would now be as grave as in 1974.  When the factories get the ball at their own foot, they bring the farmer to the cleaners.</P>
    <P>In the 1981 budget, we had further subsidies for farmers, with the removal of rates on farmers of £50 valuation.  No doubt, the Minister will agree that no farmer on £50 valuation would, in the present economic circumstances, be earning as much as the average industrial worker.  Very few would get within a couple of thousand pounds of it.  This is mainly due to the cost of inputs in farming. I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of bringing in subsidies to cut the cost of these inputs.  The Minister, as a farmer, is well aware that we are approaching a situation where the cost of our farm products will be out of the reach of the average consumer here and in Europe.  Meat, for instance, is practically beyond the buying power of the average industrial worker and the Minister is, no doubt, aware of the fall in the purchase of meat by our housewives.</P>
    <P>In my area, the resource tax has not been a problem and neither has income tax for many farmers.  However, farmers in bigger farming areas in the south, the midlands and the east, have benefited from the removal of the resource tax and from the allowance of full stock relief for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the previous Minister, at the EEC negotiations in Brussels in the spring of this year a record 14 per cent price increase for farmers was the largest single increase ever obtained by our farmers.  I wonder if the Minister has decided what increase he will be looking for for farmers in the next round of price negotiations which is about to start.  Will he be looking for the 25 per cent that it will take to cover the rate of inflation as created by his Government?  How does he intend to explain to farmers the increases in the cost of their inputs caused <Col N="469" /> by the July budget?  The increases in VAT and in other indirect costs for farmers are a retrograde step.  Only yesterday the Minister for Labour told the House that, without making any request for a derogation, he had allowed the introduction into this country of the tachograph for commercial vehicles.  That will add 50 per cent to the cost of transport of agricultural products.  Would the Minister consider making an allowance, and at this late stage will he ask his colleague the Minister for Labour to seek a further derogation in Europe in that regard, because it will have unbelievable repercussions on farmers.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the replies which I and other Deputies receive in this House to Parliamentary Questions.  Even the Deputies on his own side of the House and on the Labour benches this morning were admitting that the Department were not now paying farm modernisation grants.  It is sad that I as a public representative should have to put down questions with regard to farmers' grants.  I would prefer not to have to do it.  It is twice as sad when the reply is that they will be paid shortly. &ldquo;Shortly&rdquo; is over two months now.  I know farmers who were promised two months ago that grants would be paid shortly.</P>
    <P>When the Minister gets the Supplementary Estimate through the House today I hope he will instruct his Department tomorrow to pay the grants due to the hard-pressed farmers.  The lending institutions would be well advised to contact the Minister, because they are looking for those grants.  I would say that 99 per cent of the grants are due by farmers to lending institutions in respect of bridging and other loans which are repayable at this time of the year.  The Minister should be honest and state that he has not been in a position to pay grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  He should not con the people, with the result that every public representative is writing about grants.  He should state that he has not had the money and that he will now set about putting those things in order.</P>
    <P>I would refer to one Parliamentary Question which was answered approximately <Col N="470" /> a fortnight ago and which shows that the Minister's office is not aware of the up to date position with regard to individual queries.  The Minister stated in reply to me that legal documents were being awaited by his Department.  That was the reply given on 10 November.  In fact, those legal documents had been submitted by the solicitor in the case on 23 September, six weeks before that.  That sort of thing is a reflection on the Minister and the way he runs his Department. Having regard to the fact that 33? per cent of the funds spent by his Department are spent on wages I would hope that the Minister could at least give Members of the House true and accurate information in reply to Parliamentary Questions.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the Western package has been mentioned.  I am grieved to see that my constituency colleague, Deputy Nealon, Minister of State for Agriculture, has not stayed in the House since the commencement of the debate.  I would appeal to him to come in and at least listen to what his fellow Deputies have to say.  If he had been here to listen to his Party colleague, Deputy McCartin, he might not have savoured some of the things he would have heard.  The implementation of the western package and western development has been badly set back.  I would appeal to the Minister here today to have it implemented and to ask his colleague who has responsibility for that to state what he intends to do.  Does he intend to occupy the Department as long as the people of Ireland may decide that he should stay there or as long as the Taoiseach decides that he can afford to keep that sort of Department going?  Would he say what he intends to implement with regard to western development?  That would be of major interest to the farmers in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> There are a number of things in the Minister's speech which amused me.  He said that:</P>
    <P>These increased sheep headage rates are £9.50 per ewe on the first 150 ewes and £6.50 on the next 50 ewes in a flock compared with the flat rate of £6.50 announced by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that I am sick and tired of farmers coming to me complaining for the past month when they discovered that another contract had been placed and that they will not receive any live cattle headage payments this year due to the fact that they will have been paid the maximum payable under the ewe scheme.  Would the Minister at this late stage reconsider the position and allow payment of the livestock headage grants to those farmers? These are farmers who are prepared to increase numbers.  They have considerable numbers of sheep and of livestock. The sheep are kept mainly in mountain areas and the livestock are kept on low-land farms.  I would appeal again to the Minister to rescind the decision that was taken, which is one of the small print manoeuvres carried out by the Government in their proposals with regard to agriculture prior to the general election. They pulled the wool over the farmers' eyes.  The farmers have not forgotten. The Minister of State is not directly involved because his part of the country does not qualify for livestock headage payments, but he should press within his Department and the Government for the restoration of livestock headage payments to farmers who exceed the maximum, as introduced by the Minister under the sheep headage payments scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that should be brought to the attention of the Minister, that is, the possibility of carrying out headage inspections in spring and early summer.  This would alleviate the problem of glut supplies of cattle in the fall of the year in the disadvantaged areas.  This would not cause greater problems for the Department or necessitate the employment <Col N="472" /> of extra personnel within his Department.</P>
    <P>The disease eradication scheme has been referred to.  It is suggested that this country has still to seek derogations from Europe with regard to this scheme.  I would ask the Minister to carry out a full investigation within the Department as to where the scheme has gone wrong.  For the past 25 years money has been spent. Now we have the position where farmers who had clean herds a few months ago and who have not bought in livestock find their herds are being wiped out by tuberculosis. I do not know what has gone wrong.  The Minister should examine the position as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>It is sad to note that there is a saving under the hardship payments with regard to brucellosis grants.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of helping farmers who find themselves with serious problems regarding the slaughter of young store cattle under the TB eradication scheme.  This can cause a considerable loss of income because such farmers are also restricted from repurchasing livestock and the slaughter value of the store cattle is very much less than the market value, often as little as 25 per cent of the value of healthy animals.  The Minister might consider allowing farmers whose cattle have been slaughtered under the scheme to see the veterinary reports from the livestock factory in order to ascertain whether their cattle had lesions.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce in western areas the maximum headage payment allowed by the EEC.  We are entitled to recoup 50 per cent of that expenditure from Europe.  We should introduce throughout the country the payment of headage at a rate equivalent to that now being paid in the disadvantaged areas.  That type of scheme could be much more beneficial to the livestock industry than the schemes which the Government propose to initiate.  The Minister might also introduce an annual subsidy for the calf-to-beef scheme in the region of £100 for the first year, £75 for the second and a £25 payment on slaughter.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about problems in the grain industry.  At harvest time this <Col N="473" /> year merchants were anxious to buy dried grain but it now appears that those merchants will soon be in grave trouble due to the import to the EEC of cheaper products for the compounding of food rations.  I would ask the Minister to examine the position to see if something could be done to allow our grain merchants to compete with those imports.  Possibly a subsidy could be introduced.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for western development and hope he will be in a position when speaking on this Supplementary Estimate to state the schemes he proposes to introduce and when he hopes to introduce them.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the matter of the con trick played on farmers in the middle of August by the Minister for Agriculture when he totally changed the farm modernisation scheme and excluded farmers who had been told they would receive grants for machinery, tractors and various farm developments.  It is sad that farmers who were working to a plan were conned in this way, and I appeal to the Minister to re-introduce the scheme as it operated prior to 15 August.  He admitted earlier this week that payments under the farm modernisation scheme were totally irrelevant but he did not promise to increase them to a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>Farmers are totally disillusioned by the western drainage scheme, and during the past few months some of them have been told that it will be two years before some of their schemes will be examined.  I would ask the Minister responsible for western development to request the Department to make the necessary staff available so that people who apply for grants under this scheme will be enabled to have works carried out within a reasonable time.  The Minister for Agriculture might also withdraw the restriction he placed last August on the western drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>There is much I could say on this topic but a number of Deputies wish to speak. The Minister must be realistic and ensure that farmers are given the necessary help to overcome present difficulties.  It is sad that we are debating this subject as farmers are marching to Dublin to protest at <Col N="474" /> the inaction of the Minister.  The farmers who were conned by Fine Gael propaganda prior to the election will have long and sad memories of that programme, and they will remember it at the next election, just as in 1977 they remembered what happened in 1974 and told the Coalition where to go.  I wonder what would happen if the Taoiseach decided to go to the country now.  He is so much afraid of the farmers of Cavan-Monaghan that he decided not to allow a by-election. I challenge the Government to ask the farming community of that constituency for their verdict on the stewardship of the Minister and his two assistants.  They will receive that verdict in due course. Deputy Farrelly, who is so vocal on the other side, knows that it would be in the best interests of the Government to stay away from Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Once again I appeal to the Minister to give the necessary subsidies and assistance to farmers to enable them to overcome their difficulties.  If he considers a 5 per cent interest subsidy of any help to farmers in their present predicament, will he go away and examine his conscience? Earlier this week a leading member of ACOT said at the General Council of Committees of Agriculture that for farming to succeed farmers could not afford to pay any more interest than at a rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent.  Therefore, this 5 per cent subsidy will not be much help to farmers who are paying interest at rates as high as 24 per cent.  Even after the subsidy they will be paying double the interest rate that farming can stand. I hope the Minister of State and his colleagues on that side will inform their boss when he comes back about some of the recommendations I have made so that he might be encouraged to follow realistic policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate, which is of great importance as far as Irish farming is concerned. I wish to place on record the tremendous hope and confidence the Government expect farmers to have in the proposals we have for the betterment of agriculture at a time when money is a very scarce commodity.  It is a fine and <Col N="475" /> noble thing for the Government to come into the House with this type of Supplementary Estimate to try to ensure that the programme on agriculture which we have embarked on will be maintained.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy MacSharry but I have no intention of speaking for long because a number of Deputies from both sides have been offering. I will comment that it is amazing how times change as Governments change. Earlier this year, during a debate in the Seanad on the price fixing arrangements negotiated in Brussels, we were told that Deputy MacSharry, the then Minister for Agriculture, had come back with a good deal.  I count him as a good negotiator, but he presented that deal to us as one that would mean the end of Irish farmers' problems.  Today the same Deputy told us that our big problems began four or five months ago.  If he was trying to score political points, he did not get very far. He said Deputy Dukes would rue the day when he said Irish farmers were £600 million worse off than in 1977-78.</P>
      <P>Can anyone believe that we could have such a massive downturn in four years? Irish agriculture ran into severe problems and even four or five months ago it appeared to me there were many things we should have done but did not do.  I do not know how this Government can promote schemes which will be of best help to farmers, we must wait to see, but if we are not more successful than the last Government many farmers will be in much worse trouble.</P>
      <P>There is not any doubt that the biggest single problem in regard to farmers' incomes is inflation.  I am not an expert on the factors that cause inflation, but when Fianna Fáil came into power in 1977 the inflation rate was 9 per cent or 10 per cent and everybody knows what it was when they left.  We all admit inflation is too high now, but I believe that after the next couple of years the situation will have changed because of our efforts to counter inflation.  I understand from the experts that by mid-1982 our policies will begin to show proof that we are in the process of getting a downturn in inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a single farmer, big or <Col N="476" /> small, who does not understand the reason for the position he is in.  At best he will get a 10 per cent or 14 per cent increase in the price of the commodities he will have to sell.  The position is that farmers' input costs are soaring by up to 25 per cent and any business, whether here or in Europe, could not make a living in that situation.  I should like to place on the record that this phenomenon did not start in the last four or five months.  We have had it throughout the last three or four years and I sincerely hope, on behalf of the farmers I represent, that inflation will be controlled.  I have the utmost confidence that the policies the Taoiseach will pursue, particularly in the next budget, will bring about a downturn in inflation.  I would be prepared to say that if we do not get that downturn in the next 12 to 18 months, no matter what our negotiators do in Brussels we will not be able to get for farmers the price increases necessary to combat inflation.</P>
    <P>Our negotiators in Europe have been doing a good job but they have been in unfair competition because most of the other EEC partners have an inflation rate far less than ours.  The problem we have, and Deputy MacSharry had in his term, is that we have been among a group of other Ministers for Agriculture who are looking for price increases on different terms, and it will be difficult for any Irish Minister for Agriculture to get across to the EEC that Ireland is a special case. The Minister for Agriculture will be in Brussels trying to make that point clear in the next few months, telling them that Irish farmers are entitled to a different agreement from other countries.</P>
    <P>Ninety-five per cent of Irish farmers voted for entry to the EEC for a number of specific reasons.  All states who decided to join did so for different reasons. We voted to join because we believed we would be opening up a huge potential market for our agricultural produce. We believed we would be cutting off our connection with the cheap food policy of the British market, and that position is as true of today as then.  That is why we should ensure that no matter which Minister is in Brussels he will stress <Col N="477" /> the special reasons why we should be helped in a particular way.  I have great confidence that when the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister of State negotiate on our behalf in the coming months they will get a worthwhile package. During the debate on the motion yesterday and on the Supplementary Estimate today there were comparisons about who did what&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Who did not get what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be fair.  If farmers today are £600 million short on 1978 values, that did not happen in three or four months.  If that decline continues we will be in serious trouble.  The fact that 75,000 or 80,000 farmers are coming to this city tomorrow is a good thing. They will not pick out the Coalition Government for special attention.  They will talk about what Fianna Fáil did not do when they had the chance to do it.  They will say that whatever was done in the past was not successful and that, if the present arrangements are not right, their problems will be worse than ever before. The Government will do everything in their power to put farming incomes on the right course but I am not naive enough to believe that, if we are short of £600 million, it can be provided in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with a number of items in this Supplementary Estimate. The farm modernisation scheme is very important.  It must not be allowed to grind to a halt.  In the past number of years millions of pounds were pumped into it. It is a very important aspect of Irish agriculture. If it is slowed down, we will really have a problem.  It is very important to ensure that farmers get their grants on time.  Over the past couple of years there were occasions when it was particularly difficult for farmers to get a grant.  I cannot be too sure of the exact time-lag.  I sincerely hope that, when a job has been completed and approved by the development services and sent to the Department, the grant will be forthcoming in a month or six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anything happens to the farm modernisation <Col N="478" /> scheme it affects a great number of people.  Many small builders are involved in farm buildings.  Many agricultural contractors are involved in western drainage, and so on.  I am absolutely delighted that the Minister has seen fit to provide the necessary money to enable that type of progress to continue.</P>
    <P>During the good times, if they were good times, in 1977-78 I remember that the Government decided to put a levy of one kind or another on farmers.  It was said that it was an expanding industry, an industry which would attract a good deal of money, and farmers would have surplus money.  That is on the record of the House for anyone to see.  We had disease levies, and 2 per cent levies, and other levies.  Either the Government were as sure about the future as the farmers seemed to be at the time, or the Government believed that farmers could contribute, in the famous words, &ldquo;their fair share of tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The strategy behind that would appear to have gone very sour.  In 1977-78 there was a new awakening in Irish agriculture. It appeared to many people that then was the time to borrow at the then borrowing rates.  In the fifties and sixties, farmers borrowed at a rate of 8 or 10 per cent and, by and large, there was no extraordinary increase in their interest rates. Things worked out differently in 1977-78. I have the height of respect for the type of farmer who decided to borrow money on the advice of his agricultural adviser and of the Government.  Whoever were in Government at that time would have said that, from the point of view of extra production, that was the thing to do. Unfortunately, what happened is history.</P>
    <P>I represent a west of Ireland constituency where the problems of over-borrowing might not be as great as they are in some of the better farming areas.  I have come across a number of farmers who would be regarded in their areas as very good and careful farmers who work seven days a week.  At the moment their wives and families are existing on almost nothing. Sometimes we can be regarded as showing the béal bocht when we talk about problems relating to farmers' incomes.  Two or three years ago I <Col N="479" /> pointed out in the Seanad that farmers had many problems, despite the fact that everybody thought they were on the gravy train.  It is a pity people did not take notice of what many rural Deputies and Senators from all parties were saying at the time.  At the time farmers were just getting a chance to increase production and thereby increase their incomes. Nobody foresaw that interest rates would go mad.  That is exactly what happened.</P>
    <P>I met a man the other day whose repayment on his borrowing in 1977 was just over £4,000.  For one reason or another, a couple of months ago that bill was over £7,000.  There is no way in which that man can repay his loan and provide a reasonable living for his wife and family. I am sure the Minister for Agriculture will do what is humanly possible to alleviate the problems of those people.  I sincerely hope this tax-based lending plan will come into operation very quickly. My understanding is that it will mean that farmers in that category &mdash; and there should be about 6,000 to 10,000 of them &mdash; will get an interest rate of about 10 per cent or 11 per cent.  I am not sure whether that will get them out of trouble, but it is much better than the 19 per cent or 20 per cent some of them have to pay.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the tremendous efforts the Minister and the Ministers of State are putting into it.  I hope no insurmountable barriers will be put in their way by anybody, including the banks, and that in the next week or two we will have a water-tight agreement which will be made known to every farmer who has a problem. There are tremendous mental strains on farming families at the moment.  They want to know exactly where they stand.  The 5 per cent EEC scheme and the 5 per cent national subsidy will be a great help, but for many people they are not enough.  I hope the negotiations with the banks will be wound up very quickly and that the expected benefits will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the outcome will be but the banks have a very big responsibility in this matter.  If the agricultural community are unable to repay agricultural loans, the banks have not been <Col N="480" /> blameless in this regard.  You could argue a farmer did not have to borrow but that would be naive and would show a lack of understanding as to why farmers borrowed to such an extent.  It is in the interest of the banks to ensure that a beneficial rescue package is organised quickly because nobody wants to see farmers being sold out.  Much of the frustration which has been gathering in agriculture over the last 12 months, and which will manifest itself on the streets of Dublin tomorrow, is because many people who were badly caught by borrowing firmly believed that the previous Government, this Government and the banks were not <i>au fait</i> with what was happening.  An early announcement of what interest rates will be for hard pressed farmers would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is important at this stage to inject and instil new confidence into the agricultural arena.  We have been bedevilled over the years by the great cycle in agriculture. Every four, five or six years there is a slump in prices.  It happened in 1974, last year and this year and, if one takes note of history, it will happen again. There are a number of items which I welcome and which will be implemented by the Government.  I look forward to the announcement and the details of the £100 calf-heifer scheme.  Because of our low agricultural output a problem has arisen.  We must have more dairy cows, beef cows and sheep on our farms.  This will prove to be a springboard for many farmers.</P>
    <P>The recent announcement of the new loan, through the ACC, at 14 per cent will also have a great effect.  Because of the buffeting Irish agriculture has received over the last couple of years, many people will be cynical about borrowing. We now come to the beginning of another farming year.  I understand, from official figures, that there has been a decrease in the last year or two in the usage of artificial fertiliser.  I do not have to go into details of how important it is that this decrease is arrested because it is from that that the entire production on farms springs.  I hope that, in the next month or two, through the efforts of the Government, farmers will see that it is in <Col N="481" /> their own interest that every effort is made to increase production in 1982. Every chance should be given, either through loans or subsidies, to our farmers to ensure that they use enough fertiliser. Coupled with the £100 calf-heifer scheme we should get a new breeding programme which, in turn, will spark off many more items which will be beneficial, not only to farmers but to business generally.</P>
    <P>I was informed this morning that the number of cattle at our meat factories has decreased substantially in the last seven days.  This will cause great problems for meat factory workers.  Together with our attitude to the exportation of cattle it will mean that many people will face a worrying winter, especially workers in meat factories.  If the cattle are not there they cannot be killed, so it is in everybody's interest to instil confidence in the farming community.</P>
    <P>The national wage agreement, which was negotiated last year, caused our rate of inflation to rise.  As the House is fully aware, present wage agreement talks have broken down.  It is important for the farming community and everybody connected with it that there is a reasonable wage agreement negotiated within the terms of what the State can bear.  If we are being paid for production which does not come up to par and price ourselves out of the market, that will cause problems. I appreciate that if inflation rises to 18 per cent or 20 per cent and there is a wage increase of 13 or 14 per cent, the workers will not be too happy.  Unless we have a reasonable wage agreement which will take note of all the factors involved, we will find ourselves with many more problems at the end of the year.  A wage agreement will have an important bearing on how well farmers get on in 1982.</P>
    <P>Whether we have free collective or independent bargaining or a national wage agreement, I hope it will mean that our inflation rate will be held within reason. From all forecasts, it appears that 1982 might not be a bad year for the farmer who had not borrowed too much. If that turns out to be the case, all farmers should see that for every £100 they decide to spend on fertiliser and livestock in the spring of 1982, they are well compensated <Col N="482" /> for their investment.  From the point of view of agriculture, 1982 will be a big year.  Many farmers may be wavering as to whether they will buy extra stock, grow extra crops or buy extra fertiliser.  I believe there is room for optimism and that farmers have a new confidence.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to come back from the price fixing session in Europe with the exact package we want. I have asked the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that our farmers know early in 1982 exactly what they are getting. I look forward to a very serious round of negotiations in Brussels because on this occasion we have a very special case and I have no doubt that when the package is wrapped up a tremendous amount of confidence will be generated in the farmers and we will see a new level of production which will mean a great deal of prosperity for everybody, even people far removed from the land.</P>
    <P>In this Supplementary Estimate we are providing more than £1½ million for the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme. It is a sad reflection on everybody involved that we have not yet eradicated that disease.  For some unknown reason during the last 12 months we have had wildcat outbreaks of tuberculosis in my county.  This seems to have the veterinary people baffled.  Should we make a co-ordinated effort with European countries which seem to have got rid of this disease? We seem to have made better progress in the eradication of brucellosis but we seem unable to stamp out bovine TB. It is bad enough that this disease is a great cost on the Exchequer and a black mark on our exports, but it is making poor men of many of our farmers.  If we could pin-point the reasons for these outbreaks we could do something about stamping it out.  It appears that everything we tried in the last 20 years has come to nought. The Minister should draw on all the expertise available not alone in this country but in Europe because if we have the same incidence of this disease in the coming years, not alone will it be costly for the taxpayers but it will put many farmers out of business.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that this affects not only the farmers whose herds <Col N="483" /> have contacted this disease but every person in the country, and collectively we must accept responsibility.  It has often been said that when a farmer's herd had this disease it was his hard luck, but that is not the case.  This problem has far-reaching implications for everybody, whether living in the city, town or country. It also affects our exports and our balance of payments.  We must all work to eradicate this disease.  It is a team effort but there seems to be a breakdown somewhere in the team.</P>
    <P>The millions of pounds we have spent on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis have been wasted.  It is reasonable to assume that if we were to continue the same eradication policy it would not work because if it did not work during the last 20 years it is unlikely to work in the next 20 years.  I am not an expert in this field but I know this is one of the big problems facing farmers.  What makes the problem even greater is when a parish which is completely clear of tuberculosis discovers two years later that a herd has contacted this disease.  It is very difficult to understand how that can happen and we must find the answer to this problem very quickly.</P>
    <P>Farmers are as committed to farming now as they ever were.  With the new incentives this Government have announced, or are about to announce, there will be a new awareness among the farming community.  Within the next few weeks and months farmers will see there is a decent and honourable living to be made on the land and allied industries will benefit.  We talk about 130,000 people unemployed, but if we get agricultural production on the right track there will be permanent jobs available for many more people.  This means everybody will be doing well.  There is no other industry that will repay money invested like farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. L. Allen Mr. L. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy D'Arcy on his appointment as Minister of State and would like to remind him of a few remarks he made when he was Opposition spokesman for agriculture. During the last general election he made <Col N="484" /> misleading promises.  I would like to comment on a headline in last night's <i>Evening Herald:</i>&ldquo;Bruton's £37 million aid to farmers.&rdquo; That is the most misleading heading I have ever read.  One would think the Minister for Finance was making £37 million available to farmers when this money is being provided as on-going expenditure in the Department.  In this article the Minister for Finance said there were no free lunches for anyone &mdash; he was referring to the farming community.  He said the real problem facing Irish farmers was inflation.  He said that the Government were committed to doing everything possible to overcome this problem and help farmers develop.  That is the most outrageous statement I have ever heard from a Minister for Finance who only a few short months ago introduced a damaging budget.  We must face the fact that an increase of 5 per cent to 6 per cent in inflation is conservative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with promises made by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in the course of an article in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> of 25 April 1981 under the heading &ldquo;Curbing inflation will be Fine Gael's priority&rdquo;.  That is so far from the truth, bearing in mind what happened in the last six months, that it is unbelievable. It is important that I put the promises made by Deputy D'Arcy in the course of that article on the record so that people will be able to judge in the future whether they were implemented or not.  He listed the following new State aids he would introduce for agriculture: an introduction of interest rate subsidies from the national Exchequer and the bailing out of farmers in financial difficulties, including the exemption from repayments for the first year of a three year recovery programme.  The recovery programme now has been reduced to two years but there is not anything about no repayments in the first year.  Deputy D'Arcy also promised the stabilisation of interest rates at 11 per cent.  I hope we reach that day but Deputy D'Arcy did not explain how that would be done.  He promised financial assistance to increase cow herd numbers, a programmed calf-to-the-beef plan, increased suckler cow grants by 30 per cent, a lamb subsidy, a <Col N="485" /> follow-up programme for first time silage makers, huge investment from national funds to increase production standards, better breeding through AI supported from national funds and financial assistance for the sugar company.  I wonder where Deputy Connaughton has gone. He is not around to hear that promise but the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, should take note.  Deputy D'Arcy also promised a more attractive farm retirement policy, to stop pressure on some farmers to sell off assets to make loan repayments and a price increase for liquid milk of at least 15 per cent on top of EEC price increases.  In that event he was talking about a possible 30 per cent increase this year for our dairy farmers.  Deputy D'Arcy also said he would place emphasis on the importance of growing sufficient acreage of cereals and vegetables so as to at least offset the increasing threat of imports, strict control of imports of cereals and vegetables, a central marketing authority to eliminate uncertainty of cereal prices and maintain our sugar beet industry.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister of State's attention to that last promise and ask him to bear in mind that his Government are proposing to close one beet factory.  Deputy D'Arcy also proposed rigid enforcement of quality controls on vegetables, the introduction of a long-term leasing system and pointed out that the operation of any land policy using the PLV system was inequitable and unacceptable.  I have asked some people to give me an estimate of the cost of those promises.  They found it difficult to put a figure on them but it appears that it would cost at least £250 million over and above current Government expenditure on agriculture.  I am pleased that Deputy D'Arcy has committed himself to that policy.  In the Supplementary Estimate £3 million is set aside for the national interest subsidy scheme, £13.3 million for the farm modernisation scheme and £8 million for aids to farmers in less favoured areas.  The figure for the farm modernisation scheme is misleading because it is an ongoing scheme.  I do not know how long more it will be &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;, because a circular issued by the Department points to modifications <Col N="486" /> introduced in the scheme for western development.  I thought Deputy D'Arcy, who comes from a progressive county like Wexford, would be more concerned to try to ensure that farmers proceed with drainage and land reclamation.  However, the level of grants for land improvement, farm buildings and fixed equipment has been reduced by 5 percentage points.  In the case of land improvement in disadvantaged areas outside the western region the grants will be reduced from 70 per cent to 65 per cent.  There will be a cost limit of £740 per hectare on all land improvement schemes and the maximum acreage that will be approved in any scheme will not exceed 40 hectares.  I have made inquiries in Wexford about the average cost of such work and I have been informed that it would run in the region of £1,000 to £1,200 per hectare.  It has been stated that the costings that are now referred to are 1978 costings, three years out of date.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has reduced them.  There has been a reduction in the Estimate and rather than having it revised upwards it is being reduced. Not alone that but grants have also been reduced from 50 per cent to 45 per cent for land drainage all over the country. Deputy D'Arcy may not be aware of the number of people affected by this massive reduction.  It will mean that farmers will be about £200 per acre out of pocket over and above the situation that existed when we were in power.  Many areas will be affected by that change.  The Department's circular also stated that grants for mobile equipment were being discontinued, grants under the group fodder scheme would be confined to basic silage making equipment and, under the western drainage development programme, the level of grants for buildings and fixed equipment were being reduced by 5 per cent.  The circular stated that there would be no change in the cost or scheme size limit for land improvement that had already been communicated.  Under the western drainage scheme the circular <Col N="487" /> stated that the maximum figure had been fixed at £800 per hectare and the maximum size of the scheme that may be approved was 40 hectares.  That means that anybody who has drained 100 acres since the farm modernisation scheme was introduced and wants to drain another acre is out.  Deputy D'Arcy well knows that in the constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State well knows that there are many areas in Wexford in need of reclamation.  The area from which I come &mdash; the Macamore &mdash; was one in respect of which the present Minister of State made a commitment during the election campaign.  According to him it was one of the first things to which he would attend, that it would be a matter of weeks only if they were returned to power before the Macamore area would be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Indeed there is another area of Wexford that might well be included in that scheme, the Rathangan area.  We have been waiting five months already and yet nothing has been done in respect of either of those areas.</P>
      <P>Reverting to the reduction in the grants under the farm modernisation scheme, the people who will be most affected are the drainage contractors who are already laying off employees.  The same applies to farm buildings and contractors who heretofore built silage pits, slurry tanks and so on.  I understand now that if a farmer builds a shed and wants to put down a cement yard the following year he will not even be eligible for a grant under the farm modernisation scheme. The suppliers of building materials, those who supplied ready-mix cement, and others will all be severely affected by this reduction in grants under the scheme; mind you, this from a party who said what they would do to restore the confidence of Irish farming.  Yet there is this reduction right across the board in respect of all aid to farmers under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> The Minister of State should be well aware that in Wexford we have the highest percentage, per head of farm population, participating in the farm modernisation scheme, over 50 per cent of those farmers being categorised as development farmers.  It is well known again that per head of farm population we have the highest borrowings in the country, forming 10 per cent of total borrowings in Irish agriculture and, on the other side, we constitute 10 per cent of total agricultural production.  Yet this is what is meted out to them by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of State also of his commitment given in the Irish <i>Farmers Journal</i> of 25 April, 1981 &mdash;&ldquo;Curbing inflation will be Fine Gael's priority&rdquo;.  Yet we discover that within a month of assuming office inflation had risen by a massive 6 per cent; it is at least of that order.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister of State about one of his commitments and perhaps he would reply later &mdash; he was not present when I was speaking earlier &mdash; that is, in regard to the baling out of farmers, including an exemption from repayments for the first two years of a three-year recovery programme.  What will happen the remaining year?  There has been nothing included in this respect in the announcement this week.  If I am not mistaken I remember the Minister of State talking about the proposals of the former Minister at that time in so far as his 5 per cent interest subsidy was concerned. The present Minister of State said it was too restrictive.  Am I to believe that there is to be no change in regard to eligibility?  In fact the 5 per cent subsidy has been eroded since the present Government assumed office.  Then there was the present Minister of State's recommendation regarding the stabilisation of interest rates at 11 per cent, another commitment made.  Perhaps the Minister of State would answer that one as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his remarks said:</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate includes a provision of £3 million under Subhead F.3 for this scheme.  In addition, discussions are in progress with <Col N="489" /> the lending institutions with a view to introducing a special measure to help the hard core of farmers with very serious repayment problems.  These discussions are well advanced but the working out of a detailed scheme is a rather complex matter.</P>
    <P>During the week I came across the magazine <i>Business and Finance</i> of 19 November 1981 in which there appeared an article entitled &ldquo;Allied Irish Banks&mdash;the farmers' apologist&rdquo; written by Frank Fitzgibbon &mdash; he was quoting the chairman of AIB, Paddy O'Keeffe &mdash; part of which read:</P>
    <P>The present protest by the farmers, which is being taken as arrogance by much of the population, is in fact a deliberate move by that hard-pressed sector to highlight the seriousness of its predicament.  While the AIB recognises this plight, it does not plan to do anything to alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>In the final paragraph of this article it is said:</P>
    <P>Ireland, though, is still unique in having an interest rate that is lower than inflation.  It looks as if things could get worse.  O'Keeffe puts it simply: &ldquo;I don't see the recession ending.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That speaks for itself.  At this stage the Minister of State must have something to say concerning the scheme he is negotiating with the banks.  He has been working on it now for five months.  Granted the spade work had been done by my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, when he was in the Department.  It is true that money is being made available under subheads B.1, B.3 and B.15, amounting to almost £2.5 million for pay increases to agricultural colleges, An Foras Talúntais and Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta. The largest item amounts to almost £2 million for technicians of An Foras Talúntais, something which is welcomed. It represents a wage increase granted and the question remained merely of finding the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>Concerning the bovine TB eradication scheme I should like to ask the Minister of State when he proposes to implement <Col N="490" /> the commitment he gave also during the general election campaign in regard to the introducing of a 60-day test.  We heard a lot about this during the election campaign.  Five months have passed and nothing has yet been done concerning this 60-day test.  Perhaps the Minister could do something about that.</P>
    <P>The hardship fund will be around the same level this year.  A number of people I know have been badly hit because of the way it is implemented.  Certain recommendations were made by the Animal Health Committee which the Department were looking at when I was there. I would like to know when they will be implemented.  There are many anomalies in it and it is time some progress was made.</P>
    <P>The plight of farmers at the moment is very bad.  The present Taoiseach said at a Macra na Feirme rally in Wexford last Sunday that he welcomed the farmers' march to Dublin.  It is a terrible reflection on him that he welcomes this march.  The farmers would be better employed working on their farms rather than wasting time marching to Dublin.  The present Government have done nothing to alleviate the hardship of the farmers who now find that they have to march to Dublin to draw attention to their plight.</P>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy MacSharry, negotiated a price package last year.  This speaks for itself.  The price increases granted to them are as follows: milk, 13.3 per cent; beef, 14.3 per cent; cereals, 10.2 per cent; sugar beet, 12.7 per cent; pigs, 15.4 per cent; sheep, 14.8 per cent.  I hope the present Minister can achieve price increases such as these.  If he does he will be going some way to alleviating the hardship farmers have to face at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House any longer.  Once again I want to remind Deputy D'Arcy of his promises during the election and to condemn the out-of-hand reductions made by the present Government in the farm modernisation scheme.  It is a disgrace.  It is a step in the wrong direction if we are trying to restore confidence in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be speaking <Col N="491" /> on the Suplementary Estimate for agriculture on my first opportunity of speaking in the House.  I listened with great care to what has been said.  I wondered if I was hearing right as I listened to the speakers on the opposite benches talking about what they had done for agriculture in the last three or four years. When they got in with their 20 seat majority in 1977 inflation was at about 9 per cent.  When they left office it was at 18 per cent.  In that time their contribution to agriculture was the introduction of a 2 per cent levy on all goods sold off farms.  They took millions of pounds out of agriculture and out of the pockets of the farmers.  They also introduced a resource tax.  We heard a lot of talk this morning about the farmers in the west. But the farmers in the midlands and in Wexford and Meath are in deep trouble because of measures such as these.  The farmers who, with their families, worked on their farms were not allowed to keep in their pockets the money that they earned by the sweat of their brow. Deputy MacSharry told me this morning that I was not in this House to hear what was going on over those four years.  But I knew what was going on because I was on one of those farms; I am one of those farmers that Deputy MacSharry was supposed to be representing.  He may be the white-haired boy of the farmers in the west, but the farmers that I represent were delighted to read in the papers that there was an open door to the Minister for Agriculture and disappointed that nothing came out of the talks that took place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen said that the march of the farmers to Dublin was welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not like to see anyone having to march to get their rights.  They marched last year, and I marched with them myself to try to improve my income.  I am sure that any of the Deputies opposite, seeing their farm income dwindling over the last three years, would march &mdash; and who could blame them?  Deputy Ellis referred, this <Col N="492" /> morning, to 1974.  That was a bad year. Mark Clinton might not have produced all the goods at once when the problems hit the small farmers, but he certainly left the foundation in 1977 on which we reaped the reward in 1978, when farm incomes were at their highest level.  The people of the Leinster constituency thanked him by giving him 80,000 votes in the European elections.  Nobody can complain about the way in which he held that office.  It will not be long before the farmers' representatives will be thanking the present Minister for the work that he and his Minister of State are doing for agriculture.  They realise just as we as Members of this House do, that farmers' incomes have dropped in three consecutive years by a total of 60 per cent and the Opposition Party were in Government for two years and seven months of that time.  Let us be honest with ourselves and with the community.  A second Supplementary Estimate had to be brought in because the former Government did not provide enough money in the budget of last January for this year's requirements of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate. We all know that it is not enough, the reason being that every Department have had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for even larger amounts of money which had not been provided for last January.  Who is to blame for that? The former Ministers for Agriculture and for Finance may shrug that off.  A lot of people are still wondering who was the Minister for Finance.  One man was trying to fill all the posts and was not so successful, as the electorate pointed out in June.</P>
      <P>The interest subsidy which has been announced and what has to come will benefit the 70,000 farmers who are in financial difficulties and other farmers who have problems with their income. No member of any section of the community should have to live on £50 or £60 a week in this year of 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned that the Coalition Government contributed five or six per cent to inflation by the July budget.  To be fair, three per cent would be about the <Col N="493" /> answer.  If the January budget had been as it should have been, a July budget would not have been necessary.  It is not our fault that there are crises and a decline.  In the five months in which we have been working at the problems facing agriculture, we have reached a situation where, in another five months, all our policies will be, more or less, implemented, which will be of worthwhile benefit to all our farmers.  It will put them on the same footing as in 1976, 1977 and 1978.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate must be controlled, and we all know that it must get worse before it gets better.  A farmer in my part of the country, when asked why he did not develop his farm, said: &ldquo;When I would have all that done, on the day when there would be no money I could not eat this concrete.&rdquo;  He was fairly right in making that point then.  Our Ministers have been restoring confidence over the last number of months.  What is being done today should have been done last January, not now, in November of the third year of the decline in farmers' income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis said that it was the twenty-odd schemes implemented by the previous Government which helped agriculture. He used the word &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, and odd those schemes were.  Not many in the middle seventies were helped by those odd schemes.  Certainly, they did nothing for me.  The schemes which are now being negotiated and announced, and will be over the next couple of months, will counteract the decline in agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we all realise, as the previous Government did not, that if agriculture was not restored to the level of 1977 and 1978 we would all feel the pinch.  We are now feeling the pinch because of a decline in agriculture. Instead of spending £10 million or £15 million on an airport at Knock, the £10 million or £12 million reduction in the farm development services would have been a lot better spent on the farmers in the west of Ireland.  Many farmers in the west would have preferred the money to help them develop their holdings and <Col N="494" /> improve their lands to a white elephant of an airport.</P>
    <P>It should be taken into consideration in future by all public representatives that scandals such as that should not be allowed to take place and that money should be provided for worthwhile exercises such as the farming community have been looking for in the last three years. It was a pity that Deputy MacSharry was not aware of the problems.  However, he was only a year and half in the job.  His predecessor was not aware of the problem or could not see the problem that was coming or the measures that could then be taken.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate.  I hope that for the community that it is for, it is only the beginning of what should have been given to farmers, not today, not six months ago, but 18 months and two years ago.</P>

      <P>My time is so short that it is practically impossible to make the points I want to make.  I want to refer to one specific matter because cunningly and quietly Deputy Paul Connaughton slipped away from it, that is, concerning the proposals that should now be forthcoming from the Department of Agriculture concerning aid towards the growing of sugar beet in the west of Ireland, taking due account of the situation in which the Tuam factory finds itself at this time. I could elaborate on this matter but have to curtail my remarks.  I want the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to remember this: last year through negotiation with the Department of Agriculture and the then Minister, Deputy Ray MacSharry, there was an allocation to encourage beet growing.  The Tuam factory area in particular had tremendous problems because of the return per acre from sugar beet.  There was an indirect subsidy through the Sugar Company of approximate £35 or £36 per acre.  I would ask the Minister if he would review that this year, having regard to increased costs, to a figure of approximately £100 per acre.  I am not saying that that is the true figure because the appropriate figure would be a matter for the Beet and Vegetable Growers Association in association with the Sugar Company.  The Tuam sugar factory has become such a hot political question that the matter cannot be avoided simply by saying that that is outside the terms of reference of the Government. I would appeal to the Minister, Deputy D'Arcy, at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Farrell said, it is amazing that we have a Minister and two Ministers of State for Agriculture and yet a Deputy on the Government side only acknowledges that we have a <Col N="497" /> Minister and one Minister of State.  I do not know where the second Minister of State has vanished to.  It is alleged that he was responsible for the £300 million package negotiated for the west of Ireland by the former Minister, Deputy MacSharry.  His name is Deputy Nealon. I have not seen him or heard him make one contribution in this House as to his proposals to help such industries as the sugar industry in Tuam, the Halal factory in Ballyhaunis, the airport in Mayo and the new problems that have come to light concerning the disbandment of the briquette factory by Bord no Móna at Ballyforan and a whole range of others I shall not go into.  The £300 million was laughed at when we negotiated it.  Yet, this Government saw fit to appoint a Minister to administer it.  Where on earth is that £300 million going?  Is there any hope of the Minister coming to the rescue of, in particular, the Tuam sugar factory?  Or would the Minister of State take himself from wherever he is and come in with some positive proposals to help the people in the west for whom he is allegedly responsible?  I am sorry I cannot continue but I did promise Deputy Wilson a few moments.  I reserve the right to speak again, should the Whips agree to the introduction of a token estimate for £10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to a very specific area and to a very specific request.  I have had over the recent past lengthy consultation and arguments with farmers both in their private capacities and in their representative capacities in the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association in my own area and I want to address myself in particular to what I regard as a very serious injustice that was done to the Cavan-Monaghan area in deciding on the severely handicapped areas within the disadvantaged areas.  I think the mistake was made during the time that the previous Coalition Government were in office when large areas of the two counties of Cavan-Monaghan were excluded from the severely disadvantaged areas scheme.  I know that other counties were included and I do not want to say that <Col N="498" /> they should not have been.  I want to approach it positively and to say that the Cavan-Monaghan areas <i>in toto</i> should have been included in the severely handicapped area.  By any of the criteria laid down by the European Economic Community these two areas should have been included.  This House knows and, in particular, the agricultural scientists know that the soil in that area is a cold soil, it is a difficult soil, it is a soil that requires warming with lime and stimulation from fertiliser to an extent which is not true of other areas.  While we have made a reasonably good job of the very poor material there is no reason why we should be punished for having done so.  The grass-growing season in the area is very short and if cows are left out in the late autumn the grass is trampled and killed and the spring revival is very tardy, if it is possible at all.</P>
      <P>There are rumours of trouble in agriindustry in that area and if these rumours are true then we are in a very serious plight due to this exclusion.  Scientists have indicated that the Cavan and Monaghan areas have been very high on the production list, although I presume that this productivity does not take into account the very expensive inputs.  It is a tribute to people who work on such poor material that they are so high in the productivity stakes and it is wrong that they should be mulcted because of that.  We know that officials, either here or in Brussels, are responsible but this injustice is no longer tolerable.</P>
      <P>ACOT replacements are very slow and in an area which needs such care there is no excuse for a long delay.  Farmers there feel that the 12 western counties should be excluded altogether from the milk levy because of their problems.  Deputy Killilea mentioned the £300 million western scheme but the farmers I represent are puzzled as to what has happened to it and it is time the Minister got the scheme going so that the effects may be seen.  For various reasons there are also delays in the western drainage scheme and these should be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference to updating the cost of the farm modernisation scheme.  Deputy Farrelly spoke about <Col N="499" /> inflation, but if this scheme does not take account of inflation its whole purpose is frustrated.</P>
    <P>Time is not available for me to speak at length about the failure of the TB eradication scheme, but it is true that TB has again become a serious problem in my constituency.  Wherever the blame lies no attempt should be made to exculpate those responsible, whether they be veterinary surgeons, officials of the Department or farmers themselves.  It is criminal and unpatriotic not to push ahead with the total elimination of TB. Farmers are not satisfied that the compensation payable for reactors is a proper incentive for the bringing of this scheme to a fruitful conclusion.</P>

It is impossible for me to answer all the points raised but I hope to deal with the <Col N="500" /> more important points.  Deputy MacSharry referred to the revised Estimate and tried to maintain that we are not providing as much as the £72 million mentioned earlier by me.  He referred to reductions in the appropriations-in-aid but did not point out that £8 million of that reduction represents the removal of the disease levy which was imposed by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>He purposely avoided mentioning that.  On the subject of intervention, he did not mention that £6 million of the £8 million will be recoupment. The figure of £72 million is accurate but he tried to dissect it to suit himself.  The Opposition also seek to misrepresent what we have done in regard to headage payments.  Sixteen thousand sheep farmers will get substantially higher payments this year and the total number affected by any reduction in sheep headage is 2,500.  These are not only in the 12 western counties but also in Wicklow, portions of Wexford and Tipperary.  Only 2,500 of 95,000 will be affected.  A farmer with 100 ewes and 15 adult cattle will receive £1,402 as compared with £952 under the previous Government.  Deputy MacSharry avoided mentioning this.  We took into consideration the smaller farmers and this is the proper approach.</P>

      <P>The same newspaper report stated that the then Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson, increased the Education Estimate by 25 per cent, while there was a 14 per cent reduction in the Agriculture Estimate.  The then Taoiseach told them that the money would have to be taken out to make the budget look good, but Deputy Wilson refused. I had great respect for him as Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies mentioned the payment of grants and I assure them that when this Estimate is passed the grants will be paid immediately.  It is hoped that at least 75 per cent of the grants owed, amounting to about £9 million, will be paid before Christmas.  The truth is that there has been no money to pay those grants, but that is not our fault.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and I fully appreciate the problems facing the agricultural community, but these problems have not arisen within the past five months.  They have been growing during the past three years.  Farming incomes have reduced by 50 per cent over that period and action is required on several fronts.</P>
      <P>As far as the Government are concerned the most disturbing feature of the entire problem is that during 1981 agricultural production dropped by 2 per cent and incomes by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.  Another disturbing feature is that borrowing increased from £250 million to £1,200 million.  There is a difficult problem but the Government's policies will be followed through.</P>

      <P>I assume that the rescue plan referred to by Deputy O'Malley is in fact the comprehensive approach being pursued jointly by Aer Rianta and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company&mdash; SFADCo &mdash; with a view to formulating proposals for the promotion of additional passenger traffic through Shannon Airport. Consultations on these proposals, which involve a number of other agencies, are proceeding, and Aer Rianta have assured me that when this work has been completed details of the joint Aer Rianta/SFADCo proposals will be submitted to me for consideration.  It will be necessary, of course, for the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism to consider the proposals also from the point of view of SFADCo's area of responsibility.</P>

However, the Department concerned, at very short notice, decided to cancel the conference.  Why?  Is the Minister saying now that the studies, regarded as adequate and detailed, were not adequate?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Scheduled air services between Ireland and Belgium are operated by Aer Lingus and Sabena under the provisions of the Ireland Belgium Bilateral Air Transport Agreement.  Details of the level of service are normally discussed and agreed between the airlines and are submitted for Governmental approval.  For summer <Col N="514" /> 1981 the two airlines were unable to agree on frequencies and referred the matter to their respective authorities for resolution. Negotiations failed to produce a solution and recourse was had, as provided for in the bilateral agreement, to arbitration.  The arbitrator's finding, which is binding on both authorities, was that a reduction in capacity by both airlines was required and this has resulted in the reduction in frequencies which will be in operation on services between Brussels and Dublin this winter.</P>
    <P>I might add that, subject to some timing adjustments, services will continue to be provided each evening, excluding Saturdays, to facilitate passengers travelling to and from Brussels on EEC business.</P>

The pattern of spending from 1978 to 1981 has been increased by 123 per cent.  CIE should be responsible for the provision of materials necessary at Rosslare Strand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The proposal to instal road traffic lights at Wexford Bridge was submitted to my Department because these lights would, in addition to regulating the normal flow of road traffic, also control the railway level crossing adjacent to the bridge.  This is a unique situation insofar as conventional road traffic lights, to be installed by a contractor for the county council, are proposed to be used for the protection of a level crossing.  Agreement to the proposal was given by my Department to CIE in June 1981, subject to certain conditions. CIE are, however, experiencing practical difficulties in complying fully with the conditions specified, but they are endeavouring, in conjunction with the county council and their contractor, to resolve these problems as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This is a matter for Wexford County Council and CIE.  The condition immediately before that mentioned by the Deputy says that the light shall be monitored in such a way that an indication will be given when they are working, and particularly when they are not working. If that arrangement can be put into operation it will not be necessary to have a man walking in front of the train.  That is the arrangement CIE are trying to work out at the moment.  They want to get a monitoring system where an alarm will be given when the lights are out of order. This may sound funny, but although I know the area I do not know it as well as <Col N="518" /> Deputy Allen.  We all agree this is a serious matter and lights should not be erected which will at the same time control traffic on the roads and trains on a railway unless they are foolproof.  That is the idea.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the maximum number of trains using that line is three or four a day and that the train travels at about three miles an hour?  The present situation is chaotic. For CIE, or whoever is responsible, to suggest that Wexford County Council should provide a man to walk down the track ahead of the train when the lights are not working is ridiculous.  The sooner this problem is solved the better.</P>

      <P>The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, which came into full operation on 21 September 1981, gives legislative effect to the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972 (the Oslo Convention) and the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Matter (the London Convention). These conventions prohibit the dumping at sea of certain specified highly toxic substances and strictly control the dumping at sea of any other substance or material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>On 9 November 1981 I had preliminary discussions with the chairmen and other representatives of Limerick Harbour Commissioners, Foynes Harbour Trustees and Kilrush Harbour Authority, the three main harbour authorities directly concerned, about the question of establishing a Shannon estuarial authority. Representatives of the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation were also present.</P>
      <P>In the course of those discussions I expressed my belief that the general development of the Shannon Estuary could most effectively be achieved by the establishment of a single ports authority with control over the entire waters of the estuary.  To proceed in this way would facilitate future planning and development and would be of considerable help to local interests in promoting the estuary as a suitable location for large scale industrial projects.  It would also effectively deal with the question of jurisdiction which could become a very difficult problem in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to say that the outcome of the meeting was that the three harbour authorities agreed to resume their discussions, under the chairmanship of Mr. R.B. Haslam, chairman of the executive committee of the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation, with a view to submitting to me within three months agreed proposals, if possible, for the establishment of a Shannon estuarial authority or, failing agreement, an indication of any area of disagreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be my intention to introduce as soon as possible the necessary legislation for the establishment of a single ports authority for the Shannon Estuary and I am hopeful that it will be possible to <Col N="526" /> proceed on the basis of an agreed approach by the harbour authorities concerned.</P>

I do not think there is any great difference between the Deputy and the Minister on this.  I hope agreement will be found.  If not I hope they tell the Minister where they disagree.  An effort will be made then to reach agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Deputy is hard to satisfy.  It appears to me that Deputy O'Malley is reasonably satisfied with this and he is directly concerned with it.  The Deputy may not know that a Bill was introduced in 1977 to deal with this matter and broadly to give implementation to the creation of a single harbour authority there, but it fell with the general election of 1977.  It was not reactivated by the last Government and the Minister has now taken steps to get the thing going again.  I do not think the Deputy should complain.</P>

      <P>The pre-clearance concept raises a number of complex issues from an Irish perspective.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Report of the Transport Consultative Commission on road freight haulage was presented to me by the commission on 22 July 1981.  After presentation of the report to the Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas, I arranged for <Col N="533" /> the publication of the report on the 30 July 1981, when I announced that decisions on the specific recommendations in the report would be taken as soon as possible after all the interests concerned had an opportunity of studying and commenting on the report.  This announcement was followed by advertisements in the daily press and trade magazines indicating the 31 October 1981 as the latest date for receiving views on the report.</P>
      <P>In September, I met representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Irish Overseas Transport Association and the Independent Hauliers' Association to hear their preliminary views on the report and more recently I received a number of written submissions.

Obviously this Government have made no assessment of the implications of that.  The Minister in charge of transport and the Minister for Labour should have done something about it.

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1981. - Vote 43: Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly) Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,018,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>There is a point I should mention here as an introductory note.  As Deputies are aware and as indicated in footnotes to this Supplementary Estimate, the amount provided for in the original Vote was for the services administered by the former Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  It is the practice when a change of departmental functions occurs during a financial year, as happened this year in my Department, the original Vote, having had Dáil approval, continues the disbursement of the funds provided for that financial year in respect of all the services covered in the Vote.  A part of the increase now being sought in respect of what may be referred to as &ldquo;shared services&rdquo;&mdash; for example, salaries, travel, post office services &mdash; is related to the transferred functions, but in the circumstances mentioned they are included in this Supplementary.  Likewise, savings from whatever service within the original Vote are utilised to reduce the amount required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal factors giving rise to this Supplementary Estimate are the extra <Col N="545" /> provision needed for the bread and flour and wheatenmeal subsidies arising mainly from the increase in the level of both subsidies from 10 May 1981 and the further provision for bread subsidy increase from 5 July 1981 as well as for the introduction of a margarine subsidy, also from July 1981.</P>
    <P>Adjustments are necessary also in respect of a number of other subheads of expenditure arising from circumstances which could not have been foreseen when the Estimates were prepared originally. The additional costs are being met in part by savings on some other subheads and partly by increased appropriations-in-aid. The details are as follows:</P>
    <P>Under subhead A. 1 &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances &mdash; the additional amount required, £230,000, arises from the cost of special claims for certain grades the awards for which have been approved by the Department of the Public Service. There was no provision in the original Estimate for such awards as they could not have been foreseen then.</P>
    <P>The extra £50,000 sought under this subhead B. 1 &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses &mdash; reflects the additional costs which arose during the year from increased air fares and higher rates approved by the Department of the Public Service for subsistence and mileage allowances.</P>
    <P>The extra provision of £13,000 under subhead B. 2. &mdash; Office Machinery &mdash; is needed to meet the cost of essential storage equipment for the Companies Registration Office and waste paper disposal equipment at headquarters.</P>
    <P>The additional £54,000 sought under subhead C. 1 &mdash; Post Office Services &mdash; is mainly to defray the increase in telephone charges arising during the year which had not been foreseen and provision had not therefore been made originally for them.  Also, extra telephone facilities, which were required due to relocation of some offices, were installed during the year.</P>
    <P>On subhead E. 1 &mdash; Bord Fáilte Éireann: Grants under section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961 &mdash; the continuing economic recession and the Northern troubles had a damaging effect on tourism <Col N="546" /> during 1981.  To counteract this Bord Fáilte were authorised to spend an additional £400,000 on promotion.  The deviations in exchange rates during the earlier part of the year led to extra costs being incurred by Bord Fáilte in their marketing activities abroad and a further £350,000 is needed to meet those rate fluctuations.  An additional £330,000 was required to meet the cost of applying some grade claims awarded in the public sector to comparable grades in the board. Bord Fáilte have been able to effect some internal savings amounting to £150,000 and the additional amount required is therefore, £930,000.</P>
    <P>This year's Estimate provided £9,730,000 towards the grant-in-aid for Córas, Tráchtála, who now require an additional £1,964,000.  Of this sum, £83,000 is needed to meet increased pay costs following certain approved grade pay awards.  The balance is to fund the cost of the necessarily high level of promotional activities undertaken by the organisation during the latter part of 1980, and continued throughout the present year, leading to substantial over-expenditure on the original provision for 1981 and contributing to a deficit in 1980 which was carried into 1981.  The deficit situation is now being eliminated.</P>
    <P>Given the depressed world trading conditions which characterised 1980 and which became more difficult still during 1981, it was imperative that every possible step should be taken to build on the many past export successes of Irish firms so as to improve our export performance. Our balance of payment situation demanded that we earn abroad as much hard currency as possible, to pay for the rising cost of our essential imports.</P>
    <P>There is little need to stress how vital it is that we maintain a successful export effort if we are to combat unemployment and protect our living standards.  For the five years up to 1979, Ireland had the highest export value and volume growth in the European Economic Community. Total export value rose by 18.1 per cent in 1980.  In the first nine months of 1981, the total value was up 15.0 per cent and the prospects are that the outturn for <Col N="547" /> 1981 will measure up to Córas Tráchtala's target for the year.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the over-expenditure by CTT, to which I have referred earlier, must be considered. Because of the difficult trading climate being experienced in 1980, CTT decided, in the latter part of that year, to increase their activities and to boost their incentive grant schemes.  CTT introduced the new measures in the mistaken belief that they had adequate resources to meet the costs.  This was not so and by the end of 1980 CTT had seriously overspent.  It also appears that their accounting system failed to monitor adequately the ensuing overdraft, which reached proportions far exceeding anything incurred in earlier years.  Part of the Supplementary Estimate is required to wipe out this overdraft.</P>
    <P>There have been detailed discussions with CTT on these matters and I am now satisfied that steps have been taken not only to introduce a modern dependable accounting system in Córas Tráchtála but also measures are being taken to ensure that similar problems do not arise again in the future.  I believe that the overspending by CTT, while unfortunate, is understandable, given all the circumstances, and I am confident that Deputies will agree with this view and that the additional finance now required to fund the essential services provided by Córas Tráchtála in especially difficult times should be made available.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead J. 1. &mdash; Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited &mdash; Shannon Airport in 1980 had one of its worst ever years in terms of passenger traffic.  There was an overall decline from the 1979 level of 1,168,317 movements to 917,374, representing a drop of 21 per cent.  This decline in traffic can be attributed to many factors.  The worldwide economic recession obviously had a dampening effect on traffic.  In addition, Shannon, being a transatlantic airport, was particularly affected by the reluctance of North Americans to travel during 1980, it being the year of the American Presidential Election.  The <Col N="548" /> build-up of the crisis in Iran was also a restricting factor at that time.</P>
    <P>It is expected that 1981 should show a slight improvement in the traffic figures but if Shannon is to prosper a healthy growth in traffic is essential.  The only way to achieve this is by aggressive marketing which the company is implementing. This intensified marketing drive was initiated early in 1981, but the allocations for the year had been decided previously. £100,000 additional to the original 1981 allocation is, consequently, required.</P>
    <P>The downturn in business had also led to unexpected losses by Castle Tours whose operations include, for example, the Bunratty Banquets.  Both Aer Rianta and SFADCo are involved in this venture. The sum of £130,000 is required to meet SFADCo's share of losses for 1980 and 1981.  The future of Castle Tours and the restoring of the operation to profitability are under discussion between Aer Rianta and SFADCo.</P>
    <P>An additional £60,000 is required by the company to cover the cost of extending the recent grade pay awards made to some civil service categories to comparable grades in the company.  The total amount needed is, therefore, £290,000.</P>
    <P>Under subhead K.2. &mdash; Credit Financing of Certain Capital Goods Exports &mdash; provision was made for the expenditure of £825,000 in 1981 for the financing of certain capital goods exports.  This was the best forecast which could be made at the time of the preparation of the Estimates having regard to: (a) the likely take-up of the scheme by exporters, measured against previous experience; (b) the unknown future fluctuations in interest rates; and (c) the unknown degree of exposure that would arise in the case of foreign currency financing for contracts.</P>
    <P>The export credit finance scheme is designed to enable Irish exporters of capital goods to compete successfully overseas. I am happy to say that since the preparation of the 1981 Estimate, Irish exporters of such goods have been remarkably successful in obtaining export orders against severe competition. This is reflected in the increased use of the scheme.  In fact, unprecedented use <Col N="549" /> was made of the scheme in the 12 months ended June 1981, clearly indicating the success of our exporters in obtaining an increasing volume of export contracts.  I would remind the House that our capital goods sector has a very high &ldquo;value added&rdquo; and employment content.</P>
    <P>Almost all of our capital goods exports are sold in foreign currencies, mainly sterling or US dollars, and due to the weakness last year of the Irish pound relative to these currencies an increased amount, by way of interest support, has had to be paid.</P>
    <P>The above two factors, when taken together, have resulted in the increased expenditure under this subhead.  Accordingly, a further amount of £657,000 is required to meet the additional and very worthwhile expenditure necessarily incurred in connection with the support of our capital goods exports.</P>
    <P>Several circumstances have given rise to the need for extra funds for subheads R.1.R.2., bread, flour and wheatenmeal subsidies.  As other colleagues of mine have had to do when presenting their Estimates I must emphasise that, in the first place, there was an under-provision to the extent of £1 million in the original allocation made for them.  That is evident from the estimate of their cost, based on known factors, as compared with the provision finally decided upon for them by the then Government.  Then in May, 1981, the previous Government decided to increase the rate of subsidy on standard bread by 5p per 800gm loaf and the rate of subsidy on flour and wheatenmeal sold for domestic use by 4p per kilo, with effect from 10 May.  Provision had not, however, been made for these unforeseen subsidy level increases in the original allocations under the relevant subheads.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, an application was received from the bakery industry for an increase in the price of bread, with effect from the beginning of July.  Following a detailed examination of the application, the National Prices Commission recommended an increase of 5p per 800gm loaf. However, in line with the commitment to stabilise the price of certain basic food items, the Government decided that the <Col N="550" /> recommended increase in the price of bread would not be implemented but would be met by way of an increase in the subsidy on standard bread from 5 July.</P>
    <P>As a result of all these factors, it is necessary to increase the allocations for the current year to provide for the shortfalls which are expected to arise, of £14,475,000 on the bread subsidy and £1,150,000 on the flour and wheatenmeal subsidy.</P>
    <P>On subhead R.3. &mdash; margarine subsidy &mdash; following a detailed examination of an application from the margarine manufacturers, the National Prices Commission recommended price increases of ½p to 1½p per ½ lb. on margarine, with effect from the beginning of July, 1981, and ½p to 1p per ½ lb. with effect from the beginning of October, 1981.  However, in line with its commitment to which I have just referred, to stabilise the price of certain basic food items, the Government decided that the recommended increases would not be implemented, but would be met by way of subsidy.  Accordingly, an amount of £250,000 is required to defray the cost involved in stabilising the retail price of margarine to the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £20,063,000 but there is an offset of £9,511,000 in savings mainly made up of £930,000 on the Bord Fáilte provision for Development of Holiday Accommodation &mdash; Capital subhead E.2. &mdash; due to grants not being taken up to the extent anticipated; £2,221,000 saving on the Industrial Development Authority &mdash; Administration subhead I.1. &mdash; provision because that subhead has benefited from additional income deriving from internal resources of the Authority related to factory rents; £5,750,000 saving on the Industrial Development Authority &mdash; Capital subhead I.2. &mdash; due to the Authority's success in securing a higher level of investment by the private sector in building of factories and to some claims for payments of moieties of approved grants coming through more slowly than might have been expected; £390,000 on the capital provision for the Irish Film Board &mdash; T.2. capital &mdash;<Col N="551" /> because aid to new projects this year will not reach the level originally anticipated due to the limited period of the board's operations since appointment.</P>
    <P>There will also be a surplus of £534,000 in appropriations-in-aid mainly attributable to increased receipts under the Patents and Trade Mark Acts &mdash; £300,000 &mdash; because of higher fees having been introduced.  There is also £170,000 by way of extra receipts from premiums under the Export Guarantee Scheme due to increased volume of business.  The net amount needed is, therefore, £10,018,000.</P>
    <P>I have explained the reasons for the increased expenditure and I now recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate but I would like to say a few words about some aspects of it.  I understand that it has been the practice on the part of several members of the Government, and it was to a limited extent resorted to today by the Minister for Trade, Tourism, and Commerce, to allege that in the preparation of the Estimates for 1981 there was deliberate underestimation of the figures that were required.  In view of that allegation which was made, when I heard that this Supplementary Estimate was being put on this afternoon at the very urgent request of the Government I went to the trouble of doing some sums in the light of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one excludes from the Supplementary Estimate the increase in bread, flour and margarine subsidies, all of which were introduced long after the preparation of these Estimates and could not, therefore, possibly have been taken into account when the Estimates were prepared in November 1980 and December 1980 &mdash; if you exclude those, the net effect of this Supplementary Estimate is to reduce the original Estimate by £6,364,000 and I, therefore, would challenge the Minister or the House or anyone else to say that the Estimate for the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism for 1981 was deliberately underestimated. <Col N="552" /> The proof is in the figures here today, that it was, in fact, overestimated and I feel somewhat guilty that I allowed it to be over estimated by £6,364,000.</P>
    <P>I wonder why that error was made.  I want to show how I arrived at the figure. The total of the new subsidies introduced in May and July of 1981, and therefore beyond the ken of anyone last November when this was being introduced, comes to £15,875,000.  You deduct from that the savings on numerous subheads overestimations of £9,511,000 and it gives you a net figure of £6,364,000 over-estimation in the original estimate as prepared last November and December in the 1981 Estimates.  Therefore, it is not and demonstrably cannot be true to allege that there was any under-estimation in the services for this Department.</P>
    <P>In looking at a Supplementary Estimate of this kind people tend to look for the most part at the subheads or areas where additional money is being spent, but what is often much more significant is where less money is being spent.  That is put in smallprint where you will hardly notice it, but it is there on page two of this document and there are very substantial and interesting savings, as they are described.</P>
    <P>I want to say that it seems to me that some are rather ominous.  The total saving or estimation is £9,511,000, as I quoted earlier, but of that just a few thousand short of £8 million is a cutback in the IDA.  I have had some four years experience of dealing with the IDA and their estimates.  I have never experienced a saving.  My greatest problem with them always was to try to keep them even remotely near the figure they were supposed to budget for.  There was always such enormous vitality and eagerness to get on with the job in that organisation that it was generally difficult to keep them down to the allocated figure.  I think in every one of the four years that I was in that Department I had to come in here with a Supplementary Estimate looking for more.  We have here what are called in the sort of terminology that is used in the whole estimates game, savings.  The more accurate description of them really is, I think, enforced cutbacks.  To see <Col N="553" /> enforced cutbacks of £8 million less a few thousand pounds in industrial development in 1981 to my mind is a little ominous when we have the Minister for Industry and Energy talking about the inevitability of unemployment reaching 145,000 people shortly and when we hear at the same time or in the same interview talk about the lack of likelihood that at any time in the next five years the number of unemployed will drop below 121,000. At the same time we have a saving or cutback of £8 million in the budget of the principal industrial development body in this country.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, painted with the usual sort of phrases that are used here that a high level of investment by the private sector in the building of factories was secured by the IDA.  But, that was going on right through 1980 when it was probably possible to estimate that and, in fact, the outturn in terms of investment by private interests in factory building has been somewhat disappointing in 1981 and rather less than one would have anticipated. Part of that, at least, has been due to the present change in policy after the change of Government, whereby the view of the Department of Finance has again been allowed to prevail that there is no real saving for the Exchequer by having public buildings funded by private funds &mdash; an argument that I cannot follow. Indeed, the provisions that were made in the Finance Act, 1981, in regard to industrial buildings, which the House may recall, would have led and I am sure probably did lead to greater use of private funds because it was more attractive from a tax point of view to use them in the provision of factories.  Therefore, I find it difficult to accept that the level of investment by the private sector in the building of factories is lower than might have been expected.  If it was, it was because it was discouraged and that is what makes this saving or cutback all the more ominous and worrying.</P>
    <P>If at a time like this large cuts are being enforced on the IDA budget, what will the cuts be like next year?  What account is being taken of the possibility of 145,000 people being unemployed, a situation <Col N="554" /> which is apparently expected fatalistically by the Tánaiste?  I hear stories about efforts being made to cut the 1982 Estimates below the 1981 figures which we were told in respect of some Departments were far too low.  Cuts of as much as one-third are being sought in the Estimates for some bodies in 1982 and the stories one hears are probably borne out by the fact that £8 million has already been cut from the IDA at a time when their services are more sorely needed than ever.</P>
    <P>The other sector of commercial activity covered by this Department as at present constituted is tourism.  In the light of the campaign by the Provisional IRA under the guise of H-Block from April onwards and the enormous damage caused to tourism from Britain and all other markets, I would have expected more money to have been spent in the second half of the year to repair some of the damage. That was the intention of the Government which left office in June.  We see at the beginning of this Supplementary Estimate that an additional sum of £930,000 is required for Bord Fáilte but further on in the small print there is a reference to &ldquo;less savings on subhead E.2&rdquo;.  When one looks back to the original Estimate one sees that subhead E.2. also refers to Bord Fáilte and the saving there is £930,000.  The additional amount given to Bord Fáilte in a year of unprecedented difficulty and horrible losses for our tourist industry is, therefore, zero. By printing the figure of £930,000 in large type and describing it as an extra amount for Bord Fáilte the impression is sought to be created that this is a net gain, but when one sees &ldquo;less savings on subhead E.2.&rdquo; one realises that the additional amount is zero.</P>
    <P>We must be careful of public funds and times are difficult but has any industry being subjected to a greater onslaught this year than tourism?  This is all the more tragic because up to April the prospects were excellent.  There was substantial worthwhile growth of 4 per cent in real terms in each of the first four months of this year and if this pattern had continued throughout the whole year we would have gained perhaps £100 million <Col N="555" /> extra in foreign tourism receipts.  The Bord Fáilte estimate is that we are down 2 per cent, although this it not as much as had at one time been expected.  That is, of course, a 2 per cent drop on a disappointing year in 1980.  I do not think that much could have been done while the H-Block Campaign was going on, one of the objectives of which was to damage the economy and particularly the more vulnerable areas such as tourism.  However, when that campaign ended great efforts should have been made and money should have been spent to retrieve some of our losses on the British market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte felt it was too recent and that it would have been throwing good money after bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but if they did not want to spend it on a British market they could have expended it on other markets.  In any case I query somewhat any decision not to spend money on the British market because we have an enormous advantage due to our currency relationship with sterling.  Unhappily for us the period during which we have had this disadvantage has coincided with times of unusual violence, even by Northern Ireland standards, and unusual provocation for British people here.  The fact remains that we have this tremendous commercial advantage which makes us in financial terms very attractive to the British tourist.  Notwithstanding the other difficulties, it is foolish not to try to cash in during the short term on the glorious opportunity which we may not have in the future.  If for example, Britain joins the EMS where will we stand?  Our pound may reach parity with sterling either by moving up itself or by sterling coming down and we would lose our advantage.</P>
      <P>Subhead R.3. involves a margarine subsidy and this was introduced in the July budget.  I am somewhat surprised that the Government have felt it necessary to bring in such a subsidy.  About three-quarters of the margarine we consume is manufactured here and the rest is imported but the raw materials for itsmanufacture are entirely imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Margarine is in direct competition with only one commodity, butter, which is manufactured as to 100 per cent from an Irish natural resource.  I query the wisdom of a subsidy on this commodity, although the amount is small.  As a matter of principle I would suggest that in the preparation of the 1982 Estimates this item should be excluded as being of little or no value to the consumer and tending to reduce the consumption of a product entirely manufactured from Irish raw materials.</P>
    <P>The bread and flour subsidies have been enormous.  They were introduced in May by one Government and were continued in July by the next Government. What does not appear to be covered in the Supplementary Estimate, as far as I can see, is an item referred to in the budget speech of the Minister for Finance in July.  He was talking about the increased subsidies provided for in the budget on bread, flour, milk, butter and margarine.  He said that the 1981 cost of that decision would be £6 million, and he continued:</P>
    <P>Further price increase applications in the present year could require up to about £5 more in subsidies on foot of the undertaking in the programme.  I am making the necessary provision for this.  This is very important for the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I do not see provision in the Supplementary Estimate for that additional sum which the Minister for Finance allowed for.  Will it be implemented?  If that is the case will the Minister make that clear, or is it the case that there are not likely to br any more increases in the price of these items?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister taken into account that the prices of some of these items will be reduced in any event as a result of the increased value of the Irish pound?  This would apply particularly to margarine, most of the ingredients of which are imported and probably paid for in sterling. Is it necessary to provide any subsidy for that commodity now that it should be going down in price anyway?</P>
    <P>Last month the Minister referred to a small number of price decreases consequential <Col N="557" /> on the increased value of the Irish pound.  I have been waiting with some impatience for further announcements of that kind.  A whole range of commodities should be subject to price decreases for that reason and the Minister should inform the House what the position is about a great many of them. I include oil products particularly because the improvement in our relations with the US dollar has been even more marked than our relationship with the pound sterling.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to £657,000 needed for capital financing in regard to certain capital goods exports.  I am delighted to learn that the scheme was so successful in 1981.  I recall introducing early this year, in conjunction with the banks and possibly the ICC, a scheme for the credit financing and promotion of non-capital goods of certain types which previously had not been aided by any export credits or by a credit-financing scheme of any kind.  It was not ready at the time of the preparation in 1980 of the 1981 Estimates and therefore it could not be included in them.  Is the scheme now operating and, if so, what is the cost to the Exchequer?  It was designed to cover goods often sold on credit, relatively short-term of 180 days.  Up to then the scheme had been in respect of capital goods, where the credit varies between two years and five years and sometimes two years and seven years.  In our present circumstances of balance of payments difficulties, the scheme I introduced for non-capital goods is vitally important and I should like to know how it is getting on, what use is being made of it and whether the banks and others are co-operating fully in its implementation, and what is the cost to the Exchequer likely to be?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the situation in regard to the Irish Film Board.  It has become topical again.  I had quite an argument a year ago to try to get a sum of £500,000.  I thought it was a rather derisory sum and I debated whether I should take it out of the Estimate entirely because it was so small.  I failed to get any more capital and I decided to leave it in, inadequate as I thought it to be.  Now I find it has been reduced by £390,000, that <Col N="558" /> the £500,000 which I considered to be derisory has been reduced to £110,000. This may account in part for the considerable dissatisfaction that exists in a certain area of the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>It is worth stressing that the figure relates to the Irish Film Board only and not to the National Film Studios where, by all accounts the situation has become even worse than in recent years, and that is saying a lot.  In view of the big reduction in the amount I proposed to make available, I think the Minister should give us full information on the present situation in the studios and in the Irish Film Board. That would be particularly desirable in view of the controversy between members of these boards who have been attacking one another in the public press. This is an opportunity now to have an authorative statement on the entire matter as the Minister sees it.  I do not think the situation is helped by this huge cut-back in the Supplementary Estimate, a decrease of almost 80 per cent in the allocation which I thought was derisory and useless.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the grant-in-aid to Córas Tráchtála.  I approve thoroughly of it because from the point of view of export promotion it is about the best value a country in our difficulties at the moment can get from the expenditure of public money.</P>
    <P>The argument is sometimes heard that many manufactured exports seem to be happening in any event because many of the bigger IDA supported foreign industries recently established here start within a short time of production to export anything from 95 per cent to 100 per cent of their output, often of valuable products, and appear to do that without any assistance from CTT or anyone else in Ireland and cause great benefit to accrue to our balance of payments and our exports, and that it appears to be happening almost inevitably.  I want to make it clear that that argument which comes, from among other places, from the Department of Finance now and again is fallacious.</P>
    <P>The very success of those companies as major exporters from here is attributable to the enormous expenditure they have <Col N="559" /> already incurred in marketing programmes from their head offices in their own countries.  If that tremendous kind of promotion, development, research and marketing which is so very heavily financed by their parent companies in the United States, or wherever, were not undertaken, these factories would not establish at all or, if they did, they would not have the markets ready made for them by that considerable expenditure on marketing.</P>
    <P>Rather than disproving the need for export promotion, marketing promotion and assistance here for Irish companies, the facts of the situation in regard to the large foreign companies prove and support that contention.  The tragedy for many of our Irish companies is that they have never spent the proportion of their turnover or of their profits on marketing, on sales promotion and on developing products which the market place demands, which these big American and other foreign corporations have spent. These other companies are reaping the benefit of the investment and the work. Irish companies have not made that kind of investment, even proportionately. Unhappily, they are very heavily dependent on an export development organisation or a promotional organisation such as CTT.  I know of nowhere in which additional moneys might more usefully be spent.</P>
    <P>The figure of £1,964,000 referred to in subhead G. as the additional figure, in the light of what the Minister said, does not really represent additional spending. It represents the clearing of some sort of accumulated deficits they had, and it represents the cost of the rather accelerated programme they began early in 1981.  It does not represent anything new which developed in recent months for example. I would have thought that CTT need very badly to continue to develop new programmes and new strategies, and to spend further moneys in support of Irish export promotion.</P>
    <P>I hope they will get that encouragement. It is fair to say that in the past number of years they got it from me.  I recognised the need for what they were <Col N="560" /> doing.  It is true to say in relation to an organisation such as this that the greater the recession or the greater the general economic difficulties, the greater the need for more rather than less spending on organisations of this kind.</P>
    <P>Much of the additional allocation for the Shannon Development Company seems to relate to losses which have developed in a company which is a subsidiary of Shannon and Aer Rianta jointly, called Castle Tours.  It is very unsatisfactory that a company like that is losing significant amounts of money.  I suggest to the Minister, and I have some local knowledge of the situation, that part of the problem is that it is a joint venture between two rather different State agencies. It should be the responsibility of one of them only.  I venture to suggest that the more appropriate one in all the circumstances to have sole or exclusive responsibility for this Castle Tours subsidiary would be the Shannon Development Company.  If that happened, we might have a more satisfactory outcome than appears to have been the trading outcome of that subsidiary in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main items involved in the Supplementary Estimate. I have raised a number of queries in relation to quite a number of them.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in connection with these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better clear out of the way quickly the question of the 1981 Estimates so that we can get on to less contentious material.  In taking exception to what I said, Deputy O'Malley dealt with the matter by looking at the Estimates situation globally, and by saying that the net result, when all the sums had been done, was that he had actually made excessive provision at the beginning of the year when he was in charge of the former Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  He asked how can he now be accused of having been responsible for a bogus Estimate when it now turns out that overall apparently money would be saved rather than required when the savings <Col N="561" /> were taken into account, if one were to exclude the subsidy element.</P>
      <P>That argument misses the point.  I did not allege that my predecessor's Estimate was made up of wholesale bogus sums.  I distinctly recall speaking in the budget debate at the beginning of this year and saying that, at least to the superficial observer, several Departments &mdash; and it seemed to be politically significant which ones they were &mdash; had Estimates which did not look fishy.  Deputy O'Malley's was one of them.  It had a sizeable increase over the preceding year.  So had the Department led by Deputy Colley, and so had the Department led by Deputy Wilson.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that the Estimates for other Departments &mdash; and from memory I can remember Agriculture and Posts and Telegraphs, although I am not absolutely certain about the latter &mdash; seemed to me to be grossly underestimated on any assessment of what would happen.  I did not make that point at the time about the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, and I am not making it now either.  I am making the point that, in regard to one specific subhead, a decision must have been taken &mdash; it is not visible to me any longer how it happened &mdash; presumably at joint Government level, to slice money arbitrarily off a figure, when they must have known the remaining figure was not consistent with the survival of that service.</P>
      <P>What happened in regard to the heads I am talking about was as follows.  If Deputy O'Malley wants to contradict this &mdash; and he may have his own reasons for not wishing to contradict it &mdash; I will not go to the fair over that.  I will give way to him and withdraw what I said if he can explain this cut of £1 million which, admittedly, is only a drop in the bucket of the financial scandal in which last year's Estimates and budget operations were presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is niggling of me to complain about £1 million here or there, but this is the position in regard to the bread subsidy as I understand it.  The outturn of the bread subsidy in 1980 was £14.325 million.  That is what it cost the State to operate the subsidy in 1980.  The estimate <Col N="562" /> made by the Department of what was meant to be needed for 1981 was marginally greater than that.  I do not know why I presume it was marginally greater because the population had grown marginally. The Department had estimated that at £14.5 million but the figure which we ended up with in the Estimate was £13.375 million, which was a difference of £1,125,000.  It is a small thing in a big Department and very small compared with the mountain of fraud which the financial operations of the last Government represented 12 months ago.  If Deputy O'Malley, when Minister, had some rational reason for agreeing to a cut of this sort I will give way to him if he wishes to explain it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>In respect of a debate like this the Minister must recognise that the Chair is the arbiter. There is no provision on a discussion on Supplementary Estimates which allows a Minister or anybody else to give way. When the Minister makes his reply anybody may ask a question but the Chair will decide on the order and I would ask the Minister to continue.  When the Minister has concluded there may be question and answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take an unfair advantage of him.  If his position is that this did not happen, very well, but I would like to make my own feeling about it clear.  It was not reasonable or possible to expect to operate in 1981 when the population was a little larger than in 1980 and one would expect that bread consumption would be marginally greater.  It was not reasonable to estimate a figure which was more than a million pounds less than the outturn for 1980.  That could only be done by reducing the bread subsidy or by suspending it towards the end of the year.  It is the only item in connection with which I have made this allegation and it pales into insignificance compared with what some of my colleagues have had to complain about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if I will be able to deal <Col N="563" /> with all the points made by Deputy O'Malley, but I will do my best.  He spoke about what he called the ominous feature represented by the savings which have been made under various subheads in this Department.  I do not quarrel with the general trend of what he is saying to the extent that it may be that some items of savings unhappily represent a drawing in of horns by some sectors of the economy. That has to be admitted in connection with the saving on the Bord Fáilte side, where money had been originally provided in the last Government's time for developments in hotels for grants for additional bedrooms and so on but which were not proceeded with by the unfortunate hotel owners due to the terrible year they have been having.  This Deputy O'Malley fairly described.  Of course there is a saving there, but it is one which we would rather not have made.  On the IDA side, although I am not responsible for it now, I understand savings there on the capital side have arisen because claims for grants have come in more slowly than was anticipated.  I understand it is not because projects have been cancelled or have fallen through.  The position there is not as ominous or black as one might have feared on finding that savings were being made of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also wondered why Bord Fáilte had not reacted to the bad situation of the tourist trade which emerged in the course of the summer by spending even more on promotion.  They have been intensifying their promotional efforts in other markets and they have had very considerable success in the United States, which has been showing this year what is expected to end up as a 7 per cent increase in traffic; but it is not enough to counterbalance the very steep fall on the British market.  I think Bord Fáilte were right when they said that the time was not propitious for extending expenditure on the British market, that a little grass must be allowed to grow over the memory of the graffiti and isolated but well-publicised incidents in which tourists were molested and their stay made disagreeable. I do not quarrel with their judgment and they certainly have <Col N="564" /> increased promotion in other markets to some effect.  We are in a long-term difficulty of course because we are competing with countries which have natural assets, particularly in terms of climate, which we cannot match.  I think this could be turned to good advantage by developing a tourist market which is based on special interests and attracts people who are devoted to these interests rather than on assuming we are going to get plane loads of the vast tourist market of the kind that, happily for them, Spain, Greece and other countries with climatic advantages are able to enjoy.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry here will always be fighting.  If it drops its guard for a single season it will be paying the penalty for three or four seasons after that.  I must pay tribute to the resilience which the hotel industry and others have shown in difficult times.  It must have been very painful for them to do what Bord Fáilte exported them to do, to hold, as very many of them have done, their charges in 1981 to 1980 levels in money terms.  That is a drop in real costs and in many cases they have held their terms down to 1979 charges.  That must be painful for them. That, unfortunately, is the kind of resilience the world demands from them if they are to survive and flourish.  I wish to remind the House in connection with the tourist industry, which is getting such a black press these days, that it has had bad years before and has bounced back.  The year 1972 was the beginning of a very bad period in the tourist industry.  The House will recall that in February of that year the shootings in Derry took place when 13 unarmed civilians were killed.  That was followed by very turbulent demonstrations in Dublin in the course of which the British Embassy was burned.  That had a high television visibility and was instantly reflected in the virtual collapse of the tourist trade that year and, to some extent, the following year; but it climbed back very well in 1975, 1976, 1977 and right up to last year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is perfectly right in what he said about the effect of the H-Block demonstrations.  Their effect and the riot outside the British Embassy at the end of July was that hotel inquiries fielded by <Col N="565" /> Bord Fáilte, which had been running at an average rate of 300 a day, dropped overnight to about six a day.  They have come back since then, but that was a very severe blow and we do not want to minimise it.  The private hotel sector are still feeling the ill results of it and it will have to show the kind of resilience which it has been trained to show in order to recover from these reverses for which it is not responsible but for which unfortunately it has to pay the penalty.  That is something we are all paying the penalty for in a sense and is just one more result of our &ldquo;patriots' &rdquo; activities.  I have said enough about them in another context and I will not say any more about them here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke critically of the margarine subsidy because it was in direct competition with butter which is a native product whereas margarine is made from imported materials.  I admit the rationality up to a point, but butter is also the subject of a subsidy not falling under this Vote but under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  On balance the Government are right to subsidise margarine because it is a food used particularly by the lower income groups and these are the people we are aiming at in the application of a subsidy system.</P>
    <P>He spoke also about price decreases. I thought that ungenerous of him because I do not remember him announcing too many price decreases.  I went out of my way not to claim anything unreasonable or to exaggerate the price decreases I was able to announce over the last month.  I have a few more up my sleeve and the House can be assured that the Department are pursuing them with great vigour.  I have nothing to lose by hastening their introduction and, although I am not responsible for the decreases, simple people who might be inclined to blame me for price increases would be inclined to thank me for price reductions.  I have every motive to hurry them on and the Deputy can be assured that, if a change of political fortune takes place, whatever else he might find waiting for him in Kildare Street it will not be further price reduction applications.  I will clear them whatever else may remain to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> The Deputy spoke about the Irish Film Board and about his efforts to get a significant allocation for them.  He said that even the £500,000 he had succeeded in extracting from his own Government was derisory.  I agree they will not go very far with £500,000 and they will not go even that far with £110,000.  I accept that, measured against the sort of thing we hope to see here eventually, £110,000 is a very small sum.  The reason this survived the cuts being made by this Government is that in the six weeks or two months I was in charge of the industry side of the Department I was anxious to set up the Irish Film Board, which Deputy O'Malley &mdash; for reasons I do not understand &mdash; had not done when he had a chance.  I think his reluctance had something to do with the strong views he held on the necessity to associate the Irish Film Board with the National Film Studios. I may be misrepresenting him, but I think that was his reason.  His point was that, unless he could get a commitment that they would do something sensible with the studios, there was no point in setting up the board.  I differed with that view because I felt that the Irish Film Board should be an enterprise which could stand on their own feet irrespective of what may happen to Bray Studios.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to set up the board, even with only a token budget, as a gesture towards the professional interests who had been campaigning so long for the establishment of such an agency.  It was set up on this shoestring budget.  I appointed only three of the seven board members because I thought it only fair to let my successor in charge of Industry make his own appointments.  I appointed the minimum number of members to get the board off the ground.  There was nothing more sinister than that.  I told the new board I was very anxious that of this £110,000 not a halfpenny would be spent on administration.  In other words, I was very anxious that it should not develop an administrative machine at the expense of doing what they were supposed to do, namely, subsidise and encourage the making of films in Ireland, if possible by Irish film-makers.  I hoped that by establishing the board, even with a token <Col N="567" /> budget this year, there would be something there which would be difficult to remove and which would have a claim in future years for improved allocations.  I hope they will succeed in doing the work which we all envisaged and which will justify their existence.  I am sure I carry the House with me in wishing the board well.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also spoke about export promotion.  I was glad he spoke so encouragingly about it and emphasised its importance.  I agree with everything he said in that area but he was critical of what he saw as the failure of CTT &mdash; or perhaps what he meant was that the Government would not finance them &mdash; to think up new ideas or to put new efforts into the marketing strategy on which we depend.  He is not being fair either to the Government or to CTT in this regard.  I agree with him about the necessity of foreign marketing and that the country's prosperity depends on it.  It is for that reason that the special Employment Guarantee Fund was set up.</P>
    <P>I pressed the Government to make a substantial allocation for grants for the recruitment of overseas-based marketing executives.  The number of such executives employed by Irish companies is laughably small.  I do not remember the exact figure, but it is in the small number of dozens.  That seems to be a deplorable situation and I persuaded the Government, without any difficulty because they were all of the same mind about this, to allocate in these difficult times £1 million for this undertaking.  That scheme will be administered by CTT in such a way that the money will go towards salaries for a year.  Thereafter we will have to look again at this and perhaps the firms will be so convinced of the usefulness of these people that they will take up the pay bill of executives who would be entirely or largely over-seas based.  That scheme is now under way in the sense that recruitment procedures are going ahead and I hope it will be a success.</P>
    <P>The last thing the Deputy mentioned was the question of Castle Tours, who, unhappily, have lost so much money on the programme they operate, banquets <Col N="568" /> and so forth, that they require £130,000 to take up their losses.  I note his point that they should be the responsibility of one rather than two State-bodies and I will have that considered.  I could not judge it now but I will certainly have it looked at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the alleged cost of £1 million on the original estimate for bread subsidy, the situation is that for many years past, perhaps 30, bread consumption declined annually here, as in all of the more advanced countries, and one could foresee at least one, and perhaps two, price increases of some significance in the price of bread this year.  It seems to me not unreasonable to conclude that there would be a drop of about 7 per cent in those circumstances in the consumption of bread here in 1981. I provided accordingly.  I could not foresee, nor could anybody, in November of 1980, when this was being decided, that two successive Governments in 1981, in May and July, would both introduce very large subsidies in the price of bread which had the effect not alone of preventing any increases that would have otherwise taken place but of substantially decreasing the price of bread.  Accordingly, the consumption of bread in 1981 had at least maintained its 1980 level which it would otherwise not have done.</P>

      <P>Speaking for myself I should like to point out that the Attorney General is the chairman of the committee that has been set up to look at our Constitution. I assume that in the normal way, therefore, on an Estimate relating to the Attorney General's office one could discuss various aspects of his work and his activities.  Certainly, I feel that the constitutional review aspect of his activities is something several Members on all sides might well wish to comment on at present because it is of some public interest.  It is the subject of discussion and debate from time to time and it is a pity if we are not allowed an opportunity now to voice our opinions.  The time is virtually up and, even if I wanted to, I could not engage in any discussion on this Vote; but in those circumstances would the Minister agree to adjourn this Vote for a week?  The Attorney General's office is not going to collapse over the next seven days.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is satisfied that the present post-primary school curriculum is leading young people into areas of poor career prospects; if he is concerned about the small percentage of leaving certificate students who took honours mathematics and physics in 1981; and the efforts he is making to change the situation.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that it could fairly be stated that the post-primary curriculum is responsible for leading young people into areas of poor career prospects.  I consider, however, that the curriculum should be subjected to a thorough examination and that the situation should continue to be kept under review from time to time to take account of all relevant developments.  It is for this reason that it is proposed to establish an independent curriculum and examinations board the terms of reference of which will include school assessment to supplement the examination system.</P>
      <P>I would anticipate that the board will give early attention to the matter of the balance of the curriculum as represented by the number of candidates taking various approved subjects of the course leading to the leaving certificate examination. The percentage of candidates taking honours mathematics and honours physics would, of course, be an important consideration in connection with any such review.</P>
