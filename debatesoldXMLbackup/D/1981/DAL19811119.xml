      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I tabled questions for written answer which dealt with the interrelationship behind the decision to run down the Whitegate Oil Refinery, the amenity order on Dublin Bay and the fact that I, as a public representative, cannot examine the files relating to the Dublin Bay Oil Refinery. I am legally entitled to do that.  One question was thrown out altogether.  I know you have the right to do this, Sir, but where can I get the truth?  I am trying to get at the truth.</P>

    </table>
    <P>I now propose to explain in greater detail the provisions of the Supplementary Estimate in the order in which I have mentioned them above.</P>
    <P>When my Government assumed office we found that there was a serious discrepancy between the levels of non-capital allocation approved for 1981 for health boards, voluntary and joint board hospitals and homes for mentally handicapped persons and the corresponding grant provisions in the Book of Estimates.  I should explain in this connection that in the case of health boards it is customary to make provision in the Health Estimate for 95 per cent of the non-capital allocations approved for the health boards for a particular year.  Most of the balance is recouped in the following year and the grants are finalised when audited accounts are available.  The total of the non-capital allocations approved <Col N="2478" /> for health boards direct expenditure in services in 1981 amounted to £477.1 million.  Thus the provision in the Health Estimate for 1981 for grants in that year towards that level of expenditure should have been £453.25 million, representing the customary 95 per cent of the approved level of spending.  In fact, the combined grant provisions in the relevant subheads, that is, subheads, G.1. and G.2. amounted to £427.755 million which was about £25.5 million short of what should have been provided in relation to the non-capital expenditure levels actually approved.</P>
    <P>The provision for grants to voluntary and joint board hospitals and homes for mentally handicapped was also deficient in relation to the levels of non-capital allocations approved for 1981.  The grant provision for all those agencies is contained in subhead G.4.  The actual provision in that subhead in the 1981 Health Estimate was £188.723 million.  It should have been £200.723 million if the customary percentage rates of recoupment within the year had been applied.  The under-provision was thus £12 million.</P>
    <P>The total grant under-provision for health boards and the other health agencies referred to was accordingly £37.5 million.</P>
    <P>It must have been clear from the outset that the provision of £53.7 million in subhead G.3. for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board would be significantly deficient.  It represented an increase of only about 8 per cent on the provision for 1980.  The amount which it is now estimated will be required to meet cash requirements in the present year is £63 million &mdash; an increase of £9.3 million on the original provision.</P>
    <P>The provision for the board has two main elements &mdash; provision for paying doctors' and pharmacists' fees and provision for the ingredient cost of prescriptions.  The cost of doctors' and pharmacists' fees is influenced by adjustments in the level of fees and variations in the scale of visiting and prescribing.  The adjustments in fees in 1981 were limited to increases based on the second phase of the second national understanding.  The level of visiting by doctors is expected to <Col N="2479" /> show an increase from an average of 5.77 visits per person covered by medical cards, on which the Estimate was based, to about 6.  The number of items prescribed per visit is also expected to increase marginally in 1981 as compared with the level provided for in the Estimate.  These two factors combined are estimated to cost an extra £2.9 million over the provision in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The ingredient cost of prescriptions is estimated to increase by about 21 per cent above the inadequate level of costs provided for in the original Estimate. This is due largely to increases in the price of drugs and medicines.  An extra £6.4 million is needed to meet the extra cost of prescriptions.  I am somewhat concerned about the difficulty in controlling expenditure on drugs under the General Medical Services Scheme and in other sectors of the health services.  There is no dispute about the value of the service to disadvantaged sections of the community.  However, in the present difficult financial climate it is essential that all aspects of health services should be closely examined to see where savings could be achieved without detrimental effect to the sections of the community which benefit from them.  In the case of the General Medical Service there has been criticism of the increasing cost of prescriptions under the scheme.  The Trident Report on approaches to drug purchase and usage contained a number of recommendations as to how expenditure on drugs might be reduced.  The necessary consultations with the various bodies concerned have now been carried out and the recommendations made in the Trident Report will be actively pursued with the bodies concerned during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The provision made in the Supplementary Estimate for special pay awards for health agency staffs relates to awards already approved and to further awards which are expected to be approved within 1981.  The total provision made in the Supplementary Estimate is £31.207 million, of which about £21.5 million relates to awards already approved.  The more <Col N="2480" /> costly awards approved for which extra funds are needed were as follows: Award for para-medical staff, £5.4 million; Award for laboratory technicians, £3.6 million; Award for clerical and administrative grades, £5.2 million; Awards for non-nursing personnel, £2.3 million; Provision for consultants' common contract, £3.3 million.  With regard to the provision made for further awards which are expected to emerge in the current year I will, of course, arrange for the surrender of the provision made in respect of any awards which it may not be possible to implement before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The extra provision of £6.673 million for cash allowances is needed to meet the cost of the original and the July budget increases in rates of cash allowances, £5.543 million, the introduction as from 1 October 1981 of a scheme of allowances for dependents of disabled persons, £0.400 million, and the cost of an extra week's allowances in December, 1981, £0.730 million.</P>
    <P>In the case of certain services difficulties arose for health agencies in containing expenditure within budgetary levels. I should explain in this connection that the original 1981 approved allocation levels for health agencies, although they exceeded levels based on the grant provision available, were fairly tight and required significant economies to be achieved by health boards, hospitals and homes.  Consequently when situations arose which gave rise to extra costs such as increased demands under the drugs refund scheme and in the cost of certain elements such as postal and telephone charges it was not possible to achieve in full the further economies needed to fully offset the extra costs.  The net extra grant being sought towards the net additional expenditure which is expected to arise is £4.92 million.</P>
    <P>When the allocations to health agencies were notified in March 1981 the agencies were informed that the funds allocated made no provision for the commissioning of new units of accommodation which would be completed during 1981.  In the month of May last, however, my predecessor in office approved of the commissioning of a limited <Col N="2481" /> number of new units of accommodation and of a small number of extra consultant posts.  The grant provision needed in the current year in respect of the extra costs arising is estimated at £0.683 million.</P>
    <P>The pay-related social insurance contribution rate &mdash; employers' share &mdash; for fully insured workers was increased from 9.8 per cent to 10.25 per cent from 6 April, 1981.  It is estimated that extra grant amounting to £½ million will be needed in respect of the extra expenditure arising for health agencies as employers as a result of the increase in the rate of contribution.</P>
    <P>The residential children's homes provide care and maintenance for children placed by health boards in the homes or referred to the homes on court orders. The homes are financed by means of a capitation rate which is currently £54 a week.  Because of increases in costs resulting from essential improvements in staffing strengths and rates of pay and price inflation the rate has tended to fall behind actual costs and substantial revenue losses have been incurred.  This has given rise to financial problems.  The provision in the Supplementary Estimate will help to ease the financial position of the homes.</P>
    <P>A provision of £100,000 is needed in respect of the commitment of the previous Government to provide grant assistance from the Health Vote towards the cost of events and activities associated with the International Year of Disabled Persons.  A national committee was established to co-ordinate activities and to undertake a public information campaign.  Special grants have been provided on the basis of the recommendations of the national committee.</P>
    <P>The extra appropriations-in-aid comprise £6.4 million by way of extra receipts from Health Contributions and £1.9 million extra receipts under EEC regulations.  About £2 million of the extra income from health contributions represents payments of arrears due from earlier years and the balance arises from buoyancy of income over and above what had been anticipated when the original estimate was made in July, 1980 and <Col N="2482" /> before the terms of the National Understanding, 1980, were finalised.</P>
    <P>The additional receipts under EEC regulations arise largely from a reassessment of the liability to be discharged by the British Department of Health and Social Security in 1981 in respect of health services provided under EEC Regulations.  Under the regulations each EEC country is liable for the cost of health services for persons insured in that country and their dependants provided in any of the other EEC countries.  The effect of the regulations in the case of this country is that there is a net transfer of funds to the Health Vote from the British Department of Health and Social Security representing the British authorities' liability to this country under the regulations as partially offset by this country's lesser liability to the British authorities.</P>
    <P>Savings amounting to £2.5 million arise on subhead K. &mdash; Hospitals Trust Fund &mdash; Capital Expenditure (Grant-in-Aid). The capital allocation for health services in the current year was increased from the original level of £40 million, of which £39.5 million was provided by way of grant-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund and £0.5 million came from the proceeds of sweepstakes, to £47 million.  The extra £7 million was raised by a specially negotiated bank loan.</P>
    <P>Following the Government review of the capital programme in July last in the light of the serious economic situation certain capital projects which were at the stage at which contracts could have been entered into were stopped and as a result there is a saving of £2.5 million in the grant-in-aid.  The other item of saving &mdash; £50,000, arises on subhead A.2. &mdash; Consultancy Services.  The savings arise from a slowing down of progress on certain assignments.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have explained the reasons why the Supplementary Estimate of £80.568 million is required.  I ask the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  As Chief Whip I had the experience of serving opposite him.  He is a man of very considerable experience <Col N="2483" /> in the House and is noted for his humanity.  We had many difficult situations to resolve during that period and I always found him to be a gentleman and a man of his word, although he was not always allowed to keep his word.  I wish him every success in the new Department.  I thank him for a very clear statement here this morning on the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will forgive me if I have to change to a different mood because I find that at last the suspicions we have had of the behaviour of the Government in relation to the health services are now unfolding very clearly before us.  I believe this is a tight fisted Scrooge-like, heartless Coalition who will stop at nothing to meet the requirements of the economists who are quite disinterested in the realities on the ground.  The best place to face realities and the problems which arise in relation to health is the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The figures are particularly revealing because the Minister of State with what is almost a statutory conclusion now for all Departments had a swipe at the former Government about what is referred to here as a serious discrepancy &mdash; this is a very serious word which looks as if it needs an investigation &mdash; between the levels of non-capital allocation approved for 1981 for health boards, voluntary and joint board hospitals and homes for mentally handicapped persons.  We go on in the same vein.</P>
      <P>I know my figures very well in this respect.  I did my homework well at the time with the assistance of very competent and capable officials in the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, the officials there have the reputation of being among the most competent officials in the public service and I make no exceptions in that respect.  Earlier in the year they did very detailed homework for me.  I said in the House before that we had to review the situation and decide if a Supplementary Estimate would be necessary at the end of the year.  Given the economies the Government then required and taking <Col N="2484" /> account of all the circumstances, we decided we would need a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year.  We considered it wiser to put the cards on the table at that time, having had thorough consultation with the health boards.  The Minister may check with the chairmen and chief executives of the health boards with whom I had regular meetings and with whom we worked out the requirements in considerable detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to Question No.  563 of 11 November, which I put down.  The Minister will see that for each year up to 1980 a Supplementary Estimate was required for the Department of Health.  Indeed, it would be very hard to operate any kind of economic control and tightness in budgeting if one did not have the flexibility of a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year. It is very difficult to budget to such an accurate degree at the beginning of the year and finish up exactly on target.  It is an impossibility in real terms.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister the following facts.  In 1980 there were two Supplementary Estimates, one for £93 million and the other for £33 million.  In 1979 there was a Supplementary Estimate for £72 million based on the original Estimate of £440 million and, as can be seen, percentagewise that is quite considerable.  In 1978 there was a Supplementary Estimate for £35 million while the figure for 1977 was £24.9 million.  The Supplementary Estimates go back to the period of office of the National Coalition as well as for periods of office of Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>What is revealed in the figures is that since this Government took office there has been an additional very deep cut in the provision for the health services. When the Minister for Finance presented the figures as they were known to be at the time, there was a requirement for a Supplementary Estimate of £43.8 million at the end of this year.  I should like to ask the Minister what he would do with regard to the special pay increases. Would he give them or would he not give them?  Is he committed under the national understanding, the general agreements and the conciliation and <Col N="2485" /> arbitration agreements to the granting of these special awards which, in effect, are the tailend of the awards in the health services, the more major awards having taken place earlier?  The awards I have mentioned represent the finishing up of the rounds which leaves the Minister in a very satisfactory position at this stage.</P>
    <P>If we deduct from the Estimate of £80.5 million the amount required for special pay awards, we have a figure of £49.3 million.  There are also the increases the Minister mentioned of £5.5 million, which arose from the direct budget of the Minister for Finance, and this brings the figure down to £44 million.  If we take account of the post and telephone charges, which amount to £5 million and the PRSI extra charges for the health boards, the figure comes to £38.5 million. We must also deduct the sum in respect of the double week at Christmas which, in any event, had to be provided for in a Supplementary Estimate &mdash; as I pointed out here, that was a commitment we made &mdash; and we are left with a figure of £37.7 million.  Quite apart from the direct inflationary impact on the health boards of the measures adopted by the Minister for Finance, there was a further knock-on effect of inflation and we can deduct several million for that effect.  Taking account of all the deductions we have a figure of approximately £33 million. Where has the other £10 million gone? Have there been other serious cuts?</P>
    <P>As the Minister said at the outset, the health boards are working in a very tight economic situation.  Yesterday the Minister for Finance circulated an answer to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and in that he said that the cuts, excluding the £19.9 million in which health was involved also, came to £148 million.  He referred to a sum of £2.4 million for the drug refund scheme and hospital charges.  We know now that he made further cuts in this area.  The reality is that since this Government took over there has been a further cutback on what was regarded as prudent budgeting.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated there was a saving of £59 million in energy.  I am sure he realises that the health boards and the <Col N="2486" /> hospitals are large energy consumers. The increased ESB charge of 25 per cent has had a dramatic effect in reducing the cash available to health boards for their operations.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks it appeared to me the Minister was actually taking back capital sums that were allocated to the health services for this year, and especially for the provision of services for the adult mentally handicapped.  In the Minister's statement today there is the following comment:</P>
    <P>Following the Government review of the capital programme in July last in the light of the serious economic situation certain capital projects which were at the stage at which contracts could have been entered into were stopped and as a result there is a saving of £2.5 million in the grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This saving of £2.5 million, so hard fought for by the Minister's predecessor, has been to easily given up by the Minister now holding that portfolio.  I realise that the Minister of State has only recently come to that office and he can be absolved of any blame.  However, I wish to make it quite clear to the public that this £2.5 million, which was allocated capital for which a Supplementary Estimate was not required, has been clawed back and this will have a devastating effect on the health services in general because many valuable projects will be stopped.</P>
    <P>Perhaps today we are witnessing a very important Supplementary Estimate in the sense that it represents the end of an era of growth and improvement in the health services.  I say that having given reasonable thought to the subject.  We now see the end of this period of very necessary growth.  Those who take a facile view of the health services may say we have to control our finances and that health is one of the big consumers.  We heard the Minister for Finance say ominously that the big spenders must be got at.  We have never denied that there is a lot of work to be done in a management sense and in relation to savings and redistribution of resources within the services.</P>
    <P>Many facilities, especially those in the <Col N="2487" /> mental handicap and psychiatric services, date back to the mid-19th century.  Even some general hospitals, such as Jervis Street, the Richmond and St. Brendans, date back to that time.  To the public servants who operate the health services I say &ldquo;Congratulations and well done&rdquo;. They have been castigated by the Government and wrongly so because they did a difficult job this year in difficult circumstances.  They had to face an increasing population situation for which no credit is given when financial considerations are discussed.  The health boards, voluntary hospitals and people working throughout the services have done an excellent job at economic management and control this year and that is illustrated in this Supplementary Estimate.  I am sorry they had to bear further economies to those introduced of necessity at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the services that they are being run down.  Most dental services are grinding to a halt or have stopped. The choice of doctor scheme in many health boards has been dropped since September.  The choice of dentist private practitioner scheme has been stopped and the funds cut off entirely.  Shortly before I took office my predecessor had been working hard to get a new scheme going which invited private practitioners to become involved in the dental services. It is scandalous to treat them on a stop-go basis as the Government are doing at present.  This has been clearly illustrated at Question Time over the last few weeks. I say to hospital staff, health board staff and public servants in the Department of Health, those who have had the headache of managing such an enormous operation this year, congratulations and well done. Keep up the good work and do not be put off by people castigating the public service in the House and at various functions.  You are doing an excellent job.  I have every confidence that the service will make further adjustments which they know are necessary.</P>
    <P>If we take out the special pay increases in the Supplementary Estimate, we are talking about a 5 or 6 per cent increase. In real terms it is considerably less.  The <Col N="2488" /> health boards and voluntary hospitals have no option in relation to special pay awards which come from those valued institutions, arbitration and national understandings, but to pay them.  They should not be castigated for doing so. The Department had only a 4 per cent increase in salaries, wages and allowances.  Postal services had a 26 per cent increase and in fairness to the Minister he pointed out this was something the Coalition brought in themselves.  Where one has 60,000 people employed in looking after the health of the country naturally with the goods, materials, energy used, any supplementary budget such as the one in July will have a devastating effect.  The grants to health boards, taking the overall increase, is 11.8 per cent. If we take into account the special pay allowances, that is nothing like what people have been suggesting.</P>
    <P>I am very sensitive about this because I spent much time with chairmen and chief executive officers of health boards and officials of the Department introducing economies and trying to manage services at a lower real cost.  There is a limit to which one can go on this.  When we prepared the Supplementary Estimate the Minister referred to we did so on the grounds that we did not want to stop services or let staff go.  We were prepared to switch staff within the services but not to let them go.  That is the option which faces the Government and which will be brought home to them by their own backbenchers and the health boards.  The health boards have had to take a lot of action because of the financial cutbacks. The simplest thing to do when making a financial cutback is to write a figure on a page, stand back and tell someone else to do something about it.  That is what the Government have done to the Minister for Health.  They have taken money back and told the Minister to manage.  She has to pass that on to the health boards and tell them to get on with it.  The most manly way to go about it is to sit down with the health boards and see what can be done.  If it will lead to serious disruption, the Minister should say to the Government that it is not possible to do it in the time suggested. <Col N="2489" /> As regards the standards of the services, we are working to make economies in a situation in which the population is expanding, and that has great implications for the health services because of the lack of availability of maternity facilities generally and of specialists in that area.  There are many other related areas. It was necessary while we were in office and it is necessary now to update the health services fairly vigorously and dramatically.  That process has been going on for some time.  The signs are not good now and the Government are anxious to cut back severely here, but a great deal still needs to be done in the maternity services particularly.  Fortunately we got in a few contracts before the Coalition came into office.  It is quite obvious from the capital allocation here that anything that was not signed, sealed and legally bound at that time was set aside.  In regard to maternity services generally in order to see that all one has to do is to go to some of our major Dublin hospitals without going to the country at all.  The Rotunda and Holles Street are working under great pressure and are in great need of capital facilities for which we had a programme under way.  We will be watching the Government to see what they will do with that and the general hospital programme.  There is a need to update and modernise our general hospitals in a way in which the people can participate.  When I was Minister for Health the view was put to me that we could have more private hospitals, more people could go into voluntary health and look after themselves in that way.  We have always gone for a mix of private and public and we will be watching this Government to see how they tamper with or adjust that mix.  If they attempt to do that in any adverse way we will come to this House and make our views on that clear.</P>
    <P>An area of greatest need at the moment is that of psychiatric services and the mentally handicapped.  Our record over the four-year period, my own period as Minister and that of my predecessor, shows clearly that we put a great deal of attention into that area in general.  In that respect I refer to the general capital programme.  In 1976 the capital programme <Col N="2490" /> was £11.2 million for the health services; in 1977, £16 million; 1978, £21 million; 1979, £27.5 million and in addition to that £.5 million from the Hospitals Trust, making a round figure of £28 million; in 1980, £35 million and, as the Minister has said, in 1981, £47 million.  That makes clear what we were doing in the health services.  If the Minister looks at the situation he will recognise the difficulty in 1980, when the budget limit was £40 million and we spent £35 million in developing new health services with special emphasis on mental handicap and, of course, on our general hospital services. We were already committed contractually to £35 million.  With additional costs and making some allowance for contingencies and inflation, we could not make a new start in developing, but one might say that we were not doing too badly.  We had some major projects under way.  The big one was Beaumont Hospital, the biggest development since the building of the Richmond and Jervis Street Hospitals in the middle of the nineteenth century which are now outdated. Letterkenny and Tralee were other major projects, but there could be no new starts.  This was the stark reality of the financial position facing the Minister at the time and is likely to face the Minister again coming into next year.</P>
    <P>If we had accepted that situation then in 1981 we would have been spending £40 million but in 1982 we would have been spending only £22 million and in 1983 about £11 million.  Everybody forgets that on these major capital projects we have periods of heavy expenditure and periods when the expenditure is declining.  The amount spent on Beaumont Hospital this year would be of the order of £10 million and next year that would be down to a very small amount.  Likewise with Tralee and Letterkenny the expenditure next year would be small against that of this year.  You have a tailing off of these major projects which has an effect on the general hospital programme.  We set out to get a commitment from the Government that at least we could continue with the £40 million for some years ahead.  The Government agreed to that which meant that we were <Col N="2491" /> coming back next year to a demand of £40 million and we had hoped to get an allowance for inflation.  In view of that we entered into a special arrangement for a further £7 million which the Minister has mentioned in his speech.  The purpose of this was that there would be no repayment during the present year and repayment would be spread between 1983 and 1986.  It meant in effect that if the £40 million could be available this year we could continue serving a fairly even investment plan for the next four or five years, but it meant also that we could get a substantial number of projects, both medium and major, under way, and that was what we set about doing.  This series of projects has been referred to in the House.</P>
    <P>I had some difficulty as Minister in explaining to some of the Members on that side how this worked.  The Minister is now in a position to see for himself from the records that in terms of the future of the health services this was a very important plan which meant that we could get on with some of the projects, especially that for the adult mentally handicapped which is so urgent now.</P>
    <P>I refer Deputies to the Official Report for Wednesday, 13 May 1981, volume 328, columns 2743 to 2748, inclusive, where one can see listed a very substantial number of projects which were given in reply to a question by Deputy Fitzpatrick, now a Minister.  The list includes projects like a certain amount of upgrading at St.  Brendan's and St.  Ita's, a new health centre at Ballybrack, a new mentally handicapped centre at St.  Columcille's, Loughlinstown, a very major development costing £6.8 million.  That project could go ahead.  Redevelopment phase 1A at the Mater Hospital cost £18 million, and that project could go ahead. The redevelopment phase 1B costing £5.8 million and phase C costing £16 million at St. James's Hospital could go ahead.  The extension to the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin, could go ahead.  A sum of £2.5 million was sanctioned for the residential home at St. Mary's School for the Blind, Merrion, and that project could go ahead.  The sum <Col N="2492" /> of £1.3 million to provide residential accommodation for 100 boys at St. Joseph's School for Deaf Boys, Cabra, could also go ahead.  In the Year of the Disabled these were worth-while projects which this House could support.  It also meant that the extension to the County Hospital, Mullingar could go ahead.</P>
    <P>At that time, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Fitzpatrick, was interested in the New General Hospital, Cavan, and wanted to find out what we were doing about that hospital.  It was estimated this hospital would cost £15 million.  It meant that the replacement of the County Home, Dundalk, could go ahead.  The media have caught up with this hospital because it seems to be in trouble.  We provided this money &mdash; the Minister is clawing back some of it &mdash; from capital resources earlier this year.</P>
    <P>There was a major development at St. Mary's Drumcar (Mental Handicap), costing £1 million.  This hospital provides for severely handicapped adults. Another major development at Sligo General Hospital was able to go ahead. The General Hospital, Ardkeen, County Waterford, was in the news recently.  We allowed the planning phase, costing £28 million, to go ahead.  When planning was finished the hospital board were to seek tenders and give out contracts.  I heard on the RTE News that the planning phase is complete.  I do not know who brought this to our attention, whether it was the Minister taking credit for what was done there or if it was the hospital authorities who were trying to ensure that this proposal would continue.  The money for that project was provided in this year's Estimate.  If the Government stay at the level of investment we introduced, they will have no problem in completing this new and much needed facility at Ardkeen.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of emphasis on mental handicap.  There is a mental handicap centre at Upton and the Brothers of Charity, Lota, are putting in a therapeutic pool.  We sanctioned the extension of the maternity unit at Galway Regional Hospital.  If the Minister does not think that is necessary, he should visit that unit and see the pressure under <Col N="2493" /> which people are working.  There is a major development at Castlebar General Hospital.  Four new operating theatres for orthophaedic departments are being provided at Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Galway.  Hip operations carried out at this hospital have been very successful and there is a backlog for operations. There were other developments for which the Government gave approval, among them one at Swinford, and we will see what happens to them under this Government.</P>
    <P>We heard today that this money is being clawed back.  That is a scandalous situation.  The officials in the Department, the chief executive officer of the health boards and people in the health services generally must be very disappointed, after all their efforts, to find that the Minister for Finance is taking back money which had been allocated to them. I am sorry some of our so-called socialist Deputies are not here because I would like them to recognise this fact.</P>
    <P>The Allied Irish Banks expressed an interest in mental handicap and psychiatric illness.  I had discussions with them about the situation.  We said we could not do anything about this terrible situation because of our financial position and if we had additional funds available from outside sources we could get quite a few schemes under way.  They were very interested in this and were prepared to make available a special loan at the best Government borrowing rates on terms designed to meet our requirements, in other words, no payment would be involved this year and we would be paying back over the next number of years. We found a very satisfactory way of doing this.  Here again I must congratulate the officials on their involvement in this area. This move was sanctioned by the Minister for Finance and went into operation.  I am sorry that after all this work the Minister for Finance is clawing back some of this money.  I want to place on the record my appreciation for the banks' participation in this area.</P>
    <P>Adult mental handicap was one of our priorities.  We were spending £6.55 million in this area.  I had to ask myself if we were prepared to set aside the money <Col N="2494" /> necessary to care for the mentally ill, whether we, as a society, recognised the potential of our mentally ill and their needs, and if we were prepared to commit ourselves and our financial resources, both voluntary and statutory, to caring for them.  As a community our record in this area is not good.  I suppose it is largely through fear based on ignorance that we tended to put our mentally ill people into homes and institutions which were often very secluded and awesome.  According to a recent report we did not visit these people very often.</P>
    <P>Very little real and sustained interest has been shown by the community in mental illness, but we are entering a new era.  I would like everyone to take a positive view of this illness.  I believe that the end of the closed institution mentality is in sight.  There is a new awareness about mental illness and a growing appreciation of the role of the community.  The ground work for this new development has been done by those in the health services, in the professions and by parents and friends who have been increasingly playing a leading role in this area.  Although these new beginnings are important and valuable, momentum must be maintained and developed and they will not be maintained unless the capital resources are committed to such developments.  I will always give my support to any developments for those who are mentally ill.</P>
    <P>During my period of office I introduced a Bill designed specifically to deal with the 10 per cent who must be confined in institutions for long periods.  It was designed to update the legislation in relation to registration, supervision and discharge and the safeguarding of patients while detained in such institutions.  It is time that the review body established under that legislation should be appointed.  There has been no indication that they will be established and the Minister should tell the House the current policy in relation to them.  The needs of the vast majority of that 10 per cent were to be catered for under that legislation and a Green Paper to be published later was to include the mentally handicapped as well as the physically <Col N="2495" /> handicapped.  What has happened that the Green Paper has not been published? I did not see any action following the passing of the legislation.  We had hoped to publish the Green Paper last summer but the advice at that time was that if we pushed too hard to have it released in June or July it might not be as well developed as it would be if it was left to September or October.  However, we are almost at the end of the year and there is still no sign of that important document.</P>
    <P>We are approaching the end of the International Year of the Disabled and I was pleased to see the second report published by the committee, as they were asked to do at the beginning of the year. The report is comprehensive and useful and I should like to congratulate the committee on its publication.  It will prove useful to those concerned with the handicapped.  It was disappointing, however, that the Green Paper was not published at the same time.  We were so ambitious about this matter that we had considered publishing a White Paper.  The report I mentioned deals with the importance of training, employment and the responsibility of the State in the employment field.  It recommended that the Minister for Labour should vigorously pursue the quota of 3 per cent of public service jobs for the disabled.  The report welcomed the recent special competition for entry into the civil service confined to disabled persons and suggested that local authorities, health boards and semi-State agencies adopt the same kind of positive action.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a point in relation to the question of employment because I got very disturbing news recently in relation to competitions which were held by the Civil Service Commissioners for clerical assistants and were confined specifically to disabled persons.  I received documentation in relation to one of those candidates but it is the principle of the matter I am anxious to highlight rather than the individual case.  I ask the House to imagine the feeling of a partially sighted candidate who had gone through all the study to get a leaving certificate with honours found a new <Col N="2496" /> arrangement set up by the predecessor of the present Minister for Labour, a commitment carried on by the new Minister. That individual ultimately received a letter from the Commissioners stating that the Civil Service Commissioners can recommend a person for appointment if, and only if, they are satisfied that he is in good health and free from any physical defect or disease which would be likely to interfere with the proper discharge of his duties in that position.  The letter went on to state that the commissioners, after considering the case at length, were of the opinion that the applicant's eyesight was not such as to enable him to discharge the duties of the position efficiently. What are we talking about here?  What was all this machinery set up for in this instance if partially-sighted people are not to be included among the acceptable disabled within the public service?  Why do we bother coming here if that is the case?  We understood that places would be made available in the civil service for those who are definitely and clearly disabled.  The Minister should have words with his colleagues in the Department of Labour to get him to alter the terms of reference so that they comply with the wishes of Members.</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate his views on this matter.  I assume he agrees with the general intention that disabled people who are partially sighted should be included in these positions.  Indeed, there are some very effective, totally vision-impaired people working in a number of organisations.  It is very impressive to see how those whose sight is totally impaired can work so effectively.  It brings one to recognise the potential of the disabled and how myopic we have been about their potential.  The problem is not one in relation to one individual but in relation to those who are studying to try to improve themselves and cope with the disadvantages of disablement, especially those with an impairment of vision.  It should not be beyond the wit of the civil service to involve partially-sighted people within the system.  It may be found that having done so those people have a lot more to contribute than was thought initially.  I hope the Minister will look <Col N="2497" /> into that case, details of which I will give him afterwards.  If I might repeat a comment of one of the other young students on hearing of this development, it was: &ldquo;What does it mean?  Does it mean that we are committed to making baskets for life?  Is that society's view of our potential?&rdquo;  I do not think that was the view of this House and I hope it is not that of the Minister.  I do not believe it is.</P>
    <P>There remains a tremendous amount of work to be done on the geriatric services.  It is one area greatly deficient at present.  When one remembers that there are in excess of 500,000 people over 65 years of age, one can see that that constitutes a large group to be provided for. In the negotiations at present taking place I would urge the Minister to ensure that further provision is made for these services.</P>
    <P>We all know that the development of community services is vital to the longer term economic viability of our health services generally.  The development of out-patient departments in hospitals and of community related services has met with great success in recent years; but unless they are developed further the pressure on our major hospitals &mdash; so great because of the facilities they provide and their level of staffing &mdash; will become impossible.  We had a major programme under way in regard to general hospital development.  A good deal of that is contractually under way now, a situation with which I am very happy and one which I am sure will be appreciated by all in due course.</P>
    <P>The developments about which we have spoken here ultimately will lead to a budget allocation annually of approximately the order we had this year.  If further much-needed resources become available they will be very welcome in the health services area.</P>
    <P>Orthopaedic services are in acute demand throughout the country.  The Minister mentioned in his figures the common contract introduced.  It is a very important contract and will afford hospitals, health boards and their staffs generally considerable flexibility.  Indeed, it does effect a saving on the other side not shown in the Minister's figures in that the <Col N="2498" /> bed fee pool system runs in conjunction with the contract, a particularly useful but nonetheless expensive development.</P>
    <P>During our period of office I was very glad that at long last the nurses had been upgraded.  The Minister has shown here the final phases of that general upgrading.  I believe they carry out very valuable work and this whole development was long awaited.  Their position has now been greatly improved and I hope this will lead to a happy relationship between the Minister and those working within the services generally.</P>
    <P>Having had the family planning legislation under way for a year, I might mention that a review was to be undertaken. I understand from some statements of the Minister recently that this review is taking place, something which will be much welcomed.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the operations of the Department, the Health Education Bureau have made a valuable contribution to the development of positive health and education in regard to the whole question of drugs and their abuse.  In the Estimates at present being prepared I hope provision will be made for the continuance of this work because it forms a very important, positive side of the whole health area.  From the early days, when there was a great deal of advertising and promotion, this work has progressed in more recent times into tuition in schools and of juniors generally.  This has been a very useful part of the development of the Health Education Bureau.  It may not be as visible as heretofore but is certainly getting to the core of problems particularly in the area of prevention which is so crucial.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of medical cards.  I note that the Government did not review the terms of eligibility for medical cards in relation to the changes which took place in the July budget.  I should have thought there would have been at least a 5 per cent revision, as a minimum, at that time if only for the sake of consistency.  Of course a major review is due in January next.  We will give the Minister every support in that review because we are aware he will be facing difficulties in <Col N="2499" /> achieving an adequate review of that scheme.  We are hearing alarming reports around the country of medical cards being withdrawn and of considerable cutbacks in that area.  We are all aware that there can be wastage in terms of their usage.  There remains a great deal of work to be done in this respect.  The cutbacks being effected are demonstrated in the figures before us this morning.  It all emerges after some little time.  We had suspected what the Government were at, but one cannot really prove it for some time and we have today seen some of this proof emerge very clearly.  I hope that will be recognised by those who follow developments in an intelligent way.</P>
    <P>My main fear would be the damage occasioned by further delay, especially in regard to capital projects already under way.  For instance we discovered from questions in this House that the centre for Mentally Handicapped at Kilcornan in County Galway, for which a contract had been approved and work on which was to go ahead, has been stopped.  That was to have provided a major facility for adult mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the drugs scheme is one worthy of a great deal of attention.  It is an area in which he will experience great difficulty because of the escalating cost of drugs when viewed against the economies he will be required to effect.  I appreciate also the need for improvement in the general administration of the drugs scheme.  Even meeting budget requirements after the estimates have been fixed will constitute a problem in itself.  We have seen that drugs have become more expensive without any improvement.  We know that the limit for the refund scheme has been increased from £8 to £12 without there being any improvement in the scheme or arrangements under it.</P>
    <P>There remain some areas worthy of particular attention.  I hope the Minister will see his way to do so early next year. I am thinking of special illnesses like arthritis, bronchitis, those continuing illnesses which lead to a very heavy demand on the scheme generally.  Indeed, we had a new scheme drawn up for implementation <Col N="2500" /> had we remained in office, having planned to change the scheme dramatically to meet these requirements.  I await with interest what the present Government will do in this respect.</P>
    <P>We know the Government have promised to introduce dental care for the wives of those who are at work and who are not covered by existing schemes, plus the 12 to 16 year olds.  These were objectives we had.  So far we have seen nothing emanating from the Government in this respect.  There has been no development. Since it was a priority of the Government one would have thought that some indication would have been given by this as to what it is intended to do.  There have been cutbacks in dental services.  This is a very important service and it is one to which attention should be given in order to resolve some of the problems that exist.  There will be some improvement when the dental hospital in Cork becomes operative.  It should result in an increase in the number of dentists.  They are in short supply at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the Green Paper in relation to the handicapped.  We heard nothing about it this morning.  It was well under way and should have been ready by mid-summer.  At the latest it should have come out in September or October.  Nothing has been said about it and that makes me very concerned indeed.</P>
    <P>With regard to review boards for psychiatric institutions, I would like to see some development in that area fairly soon.  The Minister mentioned some of the steps we took in regard to the International Year for the Disabled.  So far as we were concerned it was decided we would have an initial package.  That was introduced at a cost of some £6 million. Part of the figure appears under this Supplementary Estimate and part under the Estimate for Social Welfare.  We asked the committee to make their report available at the end of the year following on which we would have had a further package.  I trust the Minister will bear this in mind.  It may become part of the budgetary arrangements.  He should remember particularly that the steps taken were <Col N="2501" /> merely a start.  Considerably more remains to be done.  I would hope to see some benefit from the new structure set up in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I understand the home council for the aged is well under way.  This is very important because it will keep us reminded of our responsibilities in regard to the aged and the contribution they can make to society generally, together with the facilities and resources necessary to enable them to make that contribution.</P>
    <P>The National Social Services Board was reorganised and strengthened.  I wish it every success.  There will be a question of how it will relate to the Government's new proposals anent the poverty committee.  One of the weaknesses of the National Social Services Board was the fact that it covered neither research nor development.  It was mainly information, communication and co-ordination.  I wanted to give it more teeth to enable it to do some of this work and that process was taking place.  Various steps had been taken.  I appreciate there will be some question of working out the relationship between it and the new body and I trust the Minister will bear in mind the very valuable work the board has done and is capable of doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Council for Children, had we remained in office that council would now be in existence.  Of course the Government have their own priorities, but I hope the Minister will get down to doing something concrete about this council in the very near future.  We would like to know what the Government's reaction is to the implementation of the task force report which was published earlier this year.  I appreciate that we could not see a great deal of action because of the change of Government and the intervention of the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Home helps can play a major part in local services at very reasonable cost.  I trust the Minister will strengthen these bodies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ten year review of the health boards, I trust the Minister will build on the experience gained by the boards over the decade.</P>
    <P>With regard to the leukaemia bone <Col N="2502" /> marrow trust I gave a personal undertaking that we would support that development.  Technical difficulties had to be overcome.  These have been sorted out and the trust has collected a considerable amount of money.  We gave the trust some £50,000 initially and intended to continue that development.  I understand there is now a question mark over the development and I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the proposals made by the trust.  All the home work has been done and every Member would support this development since it would offer an opportunity of life to such a high percentage of children.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the new units for the mentally handicapped in Ballymun and Carriglea in Waterford are not being commissioned.  I trust the Minister will prevail on the Scrooges in the Coalition Government to go ahead with the Christmas bonus.  I refer to pocket money for the mentally handicapped and those in long term institutions, I appeal to the Minister to double the pocket money. We increased it to £4.  While some may think that is very small there are practical difficulties because one has to get the money from the Minister for Finance.  I hope it will be included in the Christmas double week.  When we made this arrangement last year we included the domiciliary care allowance.  This is a residential pocket money allowance and I ask the Minister to include it in this Estimate.  It would only mean shifting around a few pence.  I thank the Minister for his clear, forthright statement which indicates what is happening in the health services.  They are being run down but how much remains to be seen.  I wonder how much it is intended to run down the health services next year.  We will be watching that situation very closely.  I am disappointed and horrified that our worst suspicions have been confirmed and that the Minister has clawed back some of the moneys which were voted here for capital developments in our health services and which are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success in what will be a full-time occupation. <Col N="2503" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Supplementary Estimate of £80 million we have to look at the total bill for 1981 which is a round figure of £800 million. Having regard to our population, this is a formidable sum and it is, therefore, incumbent on us to ensure that the best possible value is secured for that substantial amount of money.</P>
      <P>We have now had 10 years' experienced in the operation of the regionalised health service when, under the 1970 Health Act, eight regional boards were set up.  There is still much thought among local authority elected representatives that a more efficient and more economical health service could still be operated on the basis of the old county council and corporation regions. Having regard to the experience over 10 years, an opportunity might now be afforded to reviewing the manner in which the regionalised health boards have operated the services and whether an over-emphasis has been put on expenditure in administration rather than a direct input of moneys into the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Woods has already spoken about the mentally hanidcapped.  It is a problem which has been with us since the foundation of the State.  No Government has effectively or positively tackled this question.  Were it not for religious orders and the voluntary bodies that have played such a part in the establishment of institutions to care for this section of the community, our policies and our record would have been deplorable.  In my own area the Franciscan Order established an excellent centre for the residential and educational treatment of the mentally handicapped.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank the present Minister for Education for giving not only immediate clearance but very generous funds for the development of a special school for the handicapped in that centre. Despite the excellence of this unit, there are still many young children who cannot get into that centre because no provision has been made for the adolescent handicapped who have to be retained in that unit or transferred to a psychiatric hospital, which is most undesirable.  Proposals <Col N="2504" /> have been shelved for two years because of financial constrictions but in this field, as far as possible, financial constrictions should be ignored for units such as these.  They do so much for the adolescent handicapped and also for children who are waiting to gain admission to the centre.  The Minister should endeavour to meet the situation in regard to all units of that nature.</P>
    <P>People who are not used to psychiatric hospitals are frequently shocked when they visit them and see mentally handicapped children and adults confined to these institutions.  The conscience of the nation was shocked in a TV programme in 1980 when people saw the standard of accommodation provided for the psychiatrically ill.  That programme did not shock the conscience of the medical and nursing staff who had, down the years, made strong representations for an improvement in the appalling conditions which existed in some of these institutions.  Those representations fell on deaf ears, because the necessary expenditure, reconstruction and refurbishing and provision of new buildings has not been proceeded with.  I am well aware of the difficulties involved, because of the age and structure of buildings which were aimed at purely custodial care.  There are problems facing architects and those desirous of reconstructing these buildings to meet modern needs.  Nevertheless, substantially more will have to be done if we are to remove this serious insult to the dignity of our psychiatrically ill.  In this field constrictions and economies should be reduced to the minimum.  Within this service certain stigmas have been attached which have not yet been finally removed, despite the excellent work done by the hospitals staffs and others concerned.</P>
    <P>There is fortunately greater emphasis now on community-based treatment for these illnesses.  This sort of treatment can be much more beneficial than hospitalising people, a practice which for so many years imposed a heavy burden on the various institutions who dealt with these long-stay patients.  Every effort should be made to treat people at home or at health centres and, consequently, to keep them <Col N="2505" /> out of hospital, thereby reducing substantially bed usage in the hospitals.  For a long number of years we had the highest percentage per head of the population in Europe in terms of long-stay patients. Apart from the provision of additional community centres more development in the day-treatment centres should be considered as a basis for reducing bed requirements.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Woods raised the matter of orthopaedic surgery.  There is tremendous development in the area of hip replacement but because of a colossal backlog of patients waiting for the operation, a large number of people continue to suffer intensely while waiting for this surgery.  Mainly these are people in the older age groups and in many cases they are living in rural and, very often, isolated areas where they are far removed from the domiciliary medical and nursing services that they need.  I urge the Minister to take whatever steps are possible to ensure an extension of the facilities that are required urgently to meet the needs of those waiting to avail of the new development in orthopaedic surgery.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with the operation of our district hospitals.  The district hospital is a major and very important health centre for the local community.  I understand that in many of these hospitals the position is that one medical officer is in charge of patients once they are admitted.  Surely this is totally against the concept of the choice of general practitioner within the scope of the free medical service.  What I am advocating is that all GPs serving a catchment area should be given the opportunity to follow through with the treatment of their patients who are admitted to hospital.  In this way the patient has the benefit of the confidence that he placed in his GP in the first place. Though this may happen in a number of cases, there are many instances in which it does not apply.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision of general health services there are excellent maternity units attached to various district hospitals.  In this respect a woman should be in a position within the health services to have at the time of confinement the services <Col N="2506" /> of the doctor whom she consulted in the first place.  Because this is not the practice many women chose voluntary hospitals in order to ensure that they continue to have the services of the doctor that they have been attending during their pregnancy.  Perhaps the Minister would take action immediately in this matter and arrange discussions with the health boards and perhaps with the medical officers concerned so as to ensure that every doctor has the right to continue to treat his patient in any health board hospital.  This is fundamental to a proper and free health service.  Otherwise the choice of doctor concept is negatived.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the absence of a proper school medical and dental service.  I do not know what the situation is in urban areas but in many schools in rural areas there have not been medical or dental examinations of many children during the school-going years.  This is a very serious situation having regard to the importance of detection at an early stage.  Such early detection must lead in many cases to the prevention of long-term illnesses and to the saving of much expenditure.  We must have a proper primary school medical and dental scheme if our health services programme is to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A further factor is the question of health regulations information for the community.  As public representatives we find that many people are ignorant of their rights within the health services. Very often we find people coming to us after they have been in private or semiprivate accommodation in health board hospitals or in voluntary hospitals and telling us that because they have a medical card they consider that their hospital treatment should be free.  I suggest that all places of public communication such as libraries, health centres and so on be well furnished with informative literature indicating a person's rights in respect of either free or subvention treatment.  This would prevent the sort of situation I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The cost of drugs has been mentioned. This is a very big factor.  Many people especially those with children are often astonished on taking prescriptions to <Col N="2507" /> pharmacists to find how much the drugs cost.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the public are protected in this regard.  It is a field in which they can be very vulnerable.  Consequently, drug prices should be monitored regularly.</P>
    <P>There has been reference also to the question of medical card abuse.  Deputy Woods has asked for a mid-term review of the situation but I would remind him that when he was Minister a decision was taken to discontinue the mid-term review, a concept that was introduced by the last Coalition.  However, it is the intention of this Government to have a bi-annual review of the system.  This is very important in the interests of the lower-income groups in particular.  I would ask that within the terms of any such review, consideration be given to those people who, though outside the medical card level of income, are having difficulty in meeting medical expenses because of large families.  The cost of drugs and visits to doctors in respect of children up to 16 is usually considerable and that is why I am suggesting that the larger families be given special consideration.  I trust that the Minister will take note of the points I have made and I look forward to hearing him refer to them in his reply.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to find a neighbour and friend in the Office of Minister of State at the Department of Health.  The Minister and I have known each other for a long time.  He will probably recall that the first time I saw him he was running a mile race in Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>He won the mile race but we trounced the County Westmeath champions in the football match.  I am very glad he is there because I have certain fears that arise from the known attitude of the Minister for Finance to health expenditure and also education expenditure.  There is an old Irish proverb which says: Is fearr cara sa chúirt ná punt sa sparán.  I will have to change that around and say: Is fearr cara sa chúirt agus punt <Col N="2508" /> sa sparán.  In this particular case, I have a friend in court and I hope we will have a pound in our purse.</P>
      <P>I may as well declare my interest straightaway.  It is with regard especially to the Cavan general hospital.  There have been red lights flashing because of the Government cutbacks with regard to that hospital.  The previous Minister, Deputy Woods, came down to Cavan and outlined the programme.  I want an assurance from the Minister that that programme, with which we were all very pleased, is not interfered with.  There is a grave medical need for the general hospital in Cavan.  I regret to read the Minister's statement that following the Government review of the capital programme in July last and in the light of the serious economic situation and all the flummery in between, there will be a cutback of £2.5 million in the capital budget.  I want to say that not merely is this a concern for the Cavan-Monaghan constituency but, as it was put to me by an officer of the board, it is the pinnacle priority of the North Eastern Health Board, and, consequently, the local area and the North Eastern Health Board in general will be very disappointed if the Minister decides to cut back on that development.</P>
      <P>There is, as the Department and the Minister know, a very fine site at Lisdarn.  There was some trouble with the contractor on the site preparation works which we got over.  Deputy Woods had his programme all lined up on that.  I ask for an assurance from the Minister that that time schedule will not be interfered with.  The site is a very beautiful one.  It is landscaped with beautiful shrubberies and flowers.  It wins prizes quite regularly for this particular feature.  Consequently the planning is important and it is very important that when the building is taking place it will not interfere with this environmental bonus which we have in that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old surgical hospital in Cavan is a dangerous slum.  For many years, a dedicated matron, dedicated nurses and surgeons have provided a surgical service there.  If there were strong trade unions there those people would have refused to work there long ago.  That is an indication <Col N="2509" /> of the urgency of having this processed. It is well known that it is dangerous as a hospital building.  We have had highly qualified specialists coming to our provincial towns over the years.  Those people have had experience in other countries. The many surgical skills which those people bring to that area is a great amenity for the social and cultural enrichment of the life of the provincial town and also, being sophisticated members of the community, they are anxious for the development of the town they come to.  It is difficult to keep them if there is a very poor building for them to work in.  They can be kept there with good equipment but we must have something better than what we have in Cavan town at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the figure of £2.5 million mentioned in the Minister's speech.  I would like an assurance from him that the neighbour's child will not be neglected when it comes to capital expenditure in the area.</P>
    <P>I know there is some concern with regard to the Monaghan hospital.  I praised Deputy Woods, when he was Minister, for the development at Drumcar.  Deputy Moynihan in a very good speech devoted a good deal of time to the older child who is mentally handicapped. Children from my constituency go to Drumcar and this development is very important as far as we are concerned.  I want to draw attention to that as well. Hip operations are performed very well in Cavan but the same problem is there as there is in the south west.  There is very high pressure on the surgeons there and a very long waiting list.  This should also get attention.</P>
    <P>The present reckoning with regard to the cost of the Cavan hospital would be about £20 million up to the final year. There have been various estimates at different times but it is an ongoing situation and, taking inflation into account, this is a substantial sum of money.  I would like the Minister to tell me when he thinks tenders will be invited and when he thinks a contractor can be on the site.  I know that a very famous firm of architects with considerable resources have been <Col N="2510" /> appointed.  If the Minister wants to apply a little pressure with regard to time on that particular firm they have the resources to cope with that kind of pressure and speed up the planning process.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of the review of entitlement to medical cards.  Deputy Moynihan said that when Deputy Woods was Minister he did not have the mid-year review.  I would like to call the attention of the House to the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government reduced the rate of inflation in their early years in office to such an extent that a review was not as necessary as it became later on in our period in office and now in the period of office of the Coalition Government. Nobody will forget the budget last July and the consequences of it.  It is agreed that over the range of goods the increase in the cost of living was 5 per cent, which is a substantial increase and indicates to me that there was a necessity this year for a mid-year review for eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    <P>I know we are restricted on time.  Earlier on I declared that my interest was in regard to the Cavan general hospital, which is a large undertaking and is very important for the area.  I want an assurance from the Minister that the schedule laid down by his predecessor will not be interfered with.  If I get that assurance it will allow me to sleep more comfortably at night.  I know there is a commitment to retain the Monaghan hospital and improve the services there.  The mentally handicapped provision at Drumcar is essential for the whole area because people are taken in from the whole health board area into that unit.  Parents are very anxious about such developments when their children reach a certain age level.  It is my view that we should give more attention to this sector.  Up to now most of the attention has been concentrated on the younger age group but there is the situation that some children become difficult or even impossible to handle in the family context.</P>
    <P>This year has been proclaimed a special time for the handicapped.  I know the Irish Wheelchair Association have been holding celebratory functions throughout the country.  I should like to call the Minister's <Col N="2511" /> attention to the good work of that association, of the voluntary workers, of the wheelchair occupants themselves &mdash; this is a very encouraging aspect &mdash; and of course to the good work of the professional staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>When a review of the income limit for medical cards is being undertaken by the chief executive officers of the health boards, there must be a substantial increase in the income limit. The present limit of £56 for a man and wife and £6 for each child is not adequate. The result is that mothers of young children who go to a doctor are not going to the chemist for the necessary drugs and medicine because they cannot afford them.  It is estimated that some 40 per cent of the people have full eligibility. The Minister should look at the possibility of a one per cent charge on PRSI contributors in order to grant full eligibility for medical services.  This is the only way to provide a proper health service. If people get medical treatment at an early date very often they do not need hospitalisation.  Many people are in hospital because they could not afford to get the medical attention that was necessary at an early stage.</P>
      <P>The time has come for the Minister to look again at the GMS scheme to find out if the State is getting full value for the vast sums being spent on the scheme.  In my opinion it is not, and evidence is available to prove that.  There should be a capitation grant or allowance to doctors rather than the fee per item system presently in operation for doctors and pharmacists.  This scheme is being abused wholesale and the people are not getting a proper service.</P>
      <P>A serious situation has arisen at the Regional Hospital, Cork, where equipment for radium treatment has been sought for more than two years but has not been provided yet.  A very good service is being provided there under bad circumstances, and attention should be given to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the upgrading of the Mallow Hospital to a full-scale general hospital.  However, there is now a greater <Col N="2512" /> volume of out-patient work but provision was not made for the development of this service.  There is an absolute need for an improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>The provision of geriatric services in the North Cork area is not adequate.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the number of times the health board and other bodies have asked for capital to build a geriatric hospital at Fermoy and have also asked that the services in Nazareth Home, Mallow, be developed.  This is for the entire county.  I ask the Minister to take account of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  I hope he will give attention to projects in the west of Ireland to which Deputy Woods referred.  We have not much ministerial muscle in the west but I regard the Minister of State as a neighbour.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that £2.5 million has been removed from capital expenditure as this may affect the Kilcornan centre for the handicapped, the orthopaedic section at Merlin Park and any other developments.  I ask the Minister to consider especially services for the aged.  The Western Health Board have been looking for a welfare home in Ballinasloe.  If the money is not available for this, will the Minister consider some of the applications from private nursing homes for status under the Health Acts so that the subsidy that can be given by the health board will be paid to relatives of the aged who are in such nursing homes?  There may be some criticism of these homes but I know the Department will investigate the services available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the other speakers who referred to the twice yearly review of the medical card system.  The income limit for a married couple is too low.  The health boards have to be very lenient if they wish to grant a medical card to a married couple.  Obviously the best hope for such a couple is to have a large family. I am afraid there is discrimination in the provision of hospital services so far as large families are concerned.  The limit of £8,500 is the same for a single person as for a man with many dependants.  Deputy Sherlock mentioned levies.  There is <Col N="2513" /> much talk about, for example, the youth employment levy, but unfortunately that is across the board.  In my view it does not help people with dependants.</P>
    <P>With regard to medical cards, there is much documentation involved for people in rural areas who apply for such cards. It reminds one of a character in one of the novels of Dickens who proudly boasted he had solved a problem and said &ldquo;You never saw so much paper in all your life&rdquo;.  I am glad to say that the officials in the health boards are not proud of the fact that so much paperwork is necessary. I hope a more simplified method will be introduced in the operation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will study the dental services as they operate in the Western Health Board area.  We are much concerned about the gap that exists for children between primary school and 16 years of age.  Children in that age group are not getting a proper service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. L'Estrange)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Woods for his kind words.  I assure him I appreciate them.  As Chief Whip I found him an honourable man and a person who always kept his word. Also, I wish to thank Deputy Wilson and Deputy Kitt for their good wishes.  I have been very friendly with Deputy Wilson for many years and I hope that friendship will continue.  I can assure Deputy Kitt that I will keep a close eye on the west of Ireland and the neighbouring county of Cavan.  I shall bring Deputy Sherlock's points about the GMS, medical cards and hospital space to the attention of the Minister.  Deputy Wilson mentioned the Drumcar community.  We are committed to this and it will be finished.  Planning at the Cavan hospital is going on at present and has not been stopped.  As regards 1982 it would be inappropriate for me to say what will happen then.  Deputy Moynihan raised the question of the mentally and physically handicapped.  It will be a priority of the Government's to improve facilities for the care of such people. Mention was made about a Green Paper on the disabled.  Work on the draft of this <Col N="2514" /> is well advanced and I hope to publish it early in the new year.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the double payment and different people have claimed credit for it.  It does not matter who gets the credit provided that the people get the double payment.  It was introduced in 1955 by a Coalition Government.  The Minister is making arrangements to pay it to long-stay patients.  Deputy Woods mentioned new units which were to be opened.  When he was in office many of these were ready. He did not open them.  I cannot understand, listening to Fianna Fáil speakers say what they would have done as regards building hospitals and so on, why they did not stay in office until 1982 and accomplish all these great things.  Surely if they had done so they would have had no trouble in winning a 1982 election. They knew the recession was upon us and knew they had borrowed too much.  They knew it could not continue.  They had set the house on fire around them and were anxious to get out as quickly as they could.  They had not got the money and ran away from their obligations and promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods made much play about agencies being left short of money in 1981.  That is not so.  The fact that I introduced this Supplementary Estimate is a clear indication that I am concerned to make good the deficit which he and his Government calculatedly left in the provisions for the health services.  When the House passes this Supplementary Estimate the health agencies will be notified of their additional allocations and my Department will discuss with them in detail any problems they may have.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Woods mention shortfalls, because if he had provided properly for the health services there would be no need for this Supplementary Estimate of £80 million.  The shortfalls allowed for in the 1981 Book of Estimates was £652 million including £60 million for the cost of meeting the terms of the national understanding.  This means that the grant available for meeting the cost of the 1980 level of services was £592 million, about £44 million short of what the Department had indicated was <Col N="2515" /> required.  It was clear from the outset that the Book of Estimates provision was inadequate, and that was pointed out by our spokesmen last February.  The Book of Estimates provision for the general medical service payments board was £53.7 million whereas the 1981 Departmental estimate was £60 million.  The actual requirement is £63 million.  Deputy Woods contended today that provision would have been made later in 1981 to make good the shortfall by way of Supplementary Estimate.  This is not good enough. he should tell us where he would have got the money.  Would he borrow it?  There have been under-estimations in all headings, social welfare, Garda pay, army pay, agriculture, CIE and so on.</P>
    <P>Last year there were Supplementary Estimates amounting to £474 million. This was borrowed and that is why we are in the trouble we are in today.  These shortfalls began with the 1981 Book of Estimates. after the last Government decided on the provisions to be made for the health services in 1981, it was quite clear that if the expenditure allocations of the main health agencies were to be computed by reference to the amount of grant available, as is normal practice, there would be a significant shortfall in the expenditure of allocations and reductions in levels of health services.  The dismissal of thousands of staff would also be necessary.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the situation with the chairman and CEOs of the health boards the then Minister decided to approve expenditure allocations in excess of those which would be justified by reference to the grant provision in the Book of Estimates for 1981.  His intention was that the under-provision by way of grant Estimate of £43.8 million would be met by making further provision by grant or Supplementary Estimate.  It is reported in <i>The Medical Times</i> of 30 October 1981 that in the spring of this year the Minister got approval from the Cabinet for the expenditure of £43.8 million on the health services over and beyond the £652 million provided for in the Estimates.  He did this following a series of meetings between himself, his secretary and <Col N="2516" /> finance officer of the Department and the chairman and CEOs of the health boards. While he may have discussed the issue with the Cabinet there is no official documentation in the Department to prove that it happened nor is there a record of a Government decision having been formally taken in the matter.  Word of mouth counts for nothing.  These are always written down, but it was not done so on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote from the non-capital health allocation of 1981 dated 20 February and from the Minister's documents left in the Department.  The Minister had a meeting with the health boards and prior to that the expenditure limits which could be allowed within the approved grant allocation had been indicated provisionally to the chairmen and CEOs.  They had met to discuss the situation.  When the Minister met them to let them know the result of the joint consideration of the position they said that the allocations which had been indicated to them were so deficient that they thought it unwise to let the health boards as a whole know of them.  They said reaction would be adverse and the services seriously affected.  At their request the Minister agreed with the chairmen to adjourn the meeting and said the allocations provisionally notified to them would not be conveyed to their boards.  It was agreed there would be an urgent in-depth analysis of the situation in each health board area between the Department and CEOs with their managerial teams.  A team from the Department, headed by the secretary, visited most of the health boards and met in Dublin.</P>

      <Col N="2517" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £30,363,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Environment is required to meet additional expenditure on 16 subheads of the Department's Vote.  The net amount needed is £30,363,000 when savings of £2 million on subhead F.2. are taken into account. This brings the total for the Vote for Environment in 1981 to £367,334,000. An unfortunate aspect of this Supplementary Estimate is that a large proportion of it was foreseen when the original Estimate for 1981 was being determined and should in fact have been included in that Estimate.  The subheads involved were mostly in the area of subsidies and grants to local authorities where reasonably accurate advance estimation was possible.  If a proper and true Estimate for my Department had been provided at the beginning of this year the Supplementary Estimate now before the House would be considerably less.</P>
      <P>The amount provided for &ldquo;pay&rdquo; in subhead A.1. of the original Estimate did not, and this was in accordance with standard practice, make provision for the extra amounts needed to implement pay awards negotiated during the year.  The additional £823,000 included in the Supplementary Estimate results in the main from the implementation of a number of such awards for various grades of Departmental staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of £80,000 in subhead B.1. for travelling and incidental expenses arises because of increases in the rates of travelling and subsistence allowances with retrosptective effect to 1 January <Col N="2518" /> 1981 in each case.  An extra £149,000 is included in subhead C, to meet additional costs arising on telephones and telegrams and in particular some arrears of telephone accounts from previous years.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry into the fire which occurred at the Stardust Club, Artane in February of this year is now entering into its final stages.  The estimated cost of the tribunal to be met from my Department's Vote this year is £650,000.  This amount excludes legal fees which will be met from the Vote of the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Following the Stardust disaster, a special task force was established within the ambit of the Fire Prevention Council, to undertake special projects, additional to the normal programme of the council, aimed at increasing public awareness of fire hazards in places of public entertainment and resort.  The task force activities include seminars and conferences, a media campaign and the production of leaflets.  The cost of these activities is being met by my Department.  Provision is accordingly made in the Supplementary Estimate for payment of a grant not exceeding £125,000 to the Fire Prevention Council to defray the cost of the task force activities this year.  This expenditure is over and above the amount of £52,500 already provided for in subhead V.8. for payment of a grant to the council in respect of their normal programme.</P>
    <P>Subhead X. provides for the introduction of a new State subsidy on fire service capital investment in accordance with a recommendation in the Report on the Fire Service.  The subsidy will apply at the rate of 50 per cent of loan charges to all approved loans where the payment of loan charges commenced on or after 1 January 1981.  £85,000 has been allocated to the scheme in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate contains a number of items relating to housing and I propose to speak about these at this stage.</P>
    <P>The first item is a provision of £16.5 million in subhead E.1. for housing subsidy bringing the total for 1981 under this subhead to £79.273 million.  The vast bulk of this sum &mdash; £78.693 million &mdash; meets the cost of borrowing by local authorities <Col N="2519" /> to enable them to provide houses for renting.  The need for the extra subvention is due primarily to the regrettable decision taken by the previous administration in the context of the January 1981 budget to under-provide for this item and so fail to honour the long-standing commitment to meet these costs.  The scale of the shortfall resulting from that decision, which amounts to £15 million, is such that it would have placed local authorities in intolerable financial difficulties this month when loan repayments would have to be met.  The balance of £1.5 million arises mainly from our decision of July last to allocate an extra £30 million of capital moneys for the local authority housing programme.  The Government have decided that their liabilities to local authorities should be honoured and the extra £16.5 million will do this.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is included in subhead E.3. to meet commitments arising in the current year under the new mortgage subsidy scheme.  This scheme applies to first-time owner-occupiers of grant-type new houses.  It also applies to tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority houses surrendering their houses and to certain persons on approved local authority waiting lists purchasing new or previously occupied houses.  Under the scheme, the applicant must take out a mortgage loan on the house and the mortgage must have been executed on or after 10 April 1981.  Those qualifying under the scheme can receive up to £3,000 in six instalments over three years &mdash; two payments of £750 in the first year, two of £500 in the second year and two of £250 in the third year, subject to the subsidy not exceeding the total loan repayments in any year.  As the first instalment becomes payable after the applicant has completed his loan repayments for six months and as the mortgages must have been executed on or after 10 April 1981, payment by my Department did not begin to fall due until mid-October.  The £1 million now being provided will enable some 1,350 first instalments to be paid before the end of the year.  To date, over 4,500 applications for the mortgage subsidy have been received and over 1,500 <Col N="2520" /> of these have been approved.  Liabilities, in terms of public expenditure, under this scheme will, of course, increase substantially over the coming years.</P>
    <P>An extra £1.25 million is provided in subhead N in respect of the interest subsidy for building societies which was reintroduced by the previous administration with effect from 1 June 1981.  As the subsidy is paid six monthly in arrears payment in respect of only the month of June 1981 arises this year.</P>
    <P>I am seeking an additional £3 million under subhead O. for recouping local authorities that part of their bill for malicious damage to property falling on the Exchequer.  Unfortunately, activities leading to wanton damage to property have been on the increase and the taxpayer has to meet the bill.  It is a waste of scarce moneys which we can ill afford in the present very unsatisfactory state of our finances.</P>
    <P>The extra £5.2 million being provided under subhead P. for the rates grant will also go to the local authorities to recoup them the cost of rates relieved on houses, secondary schools, community halls and farm buildings.  This shortfall might have been predicted at the start of the year on the basis of local authorities availing of the full amount of the permitted increase of 12 per cent in rate poundages and it is regrettable that adequate provision was not made at that time.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of the additional £3 million now being sought for subhead F.1., water supply and sewerage, etc. subsidies, the £160,000 for subhead M.1. for recoupment to local authorities of the expenses incurred in connection with the registration and licensing of mechanically propelled vehicles and the issue of drivers' licences, the £65,000 for subhead S. for grants for the public library services and the £250,000 in subhead T. for the rehabilitation of travelling people.</P>
    <P>The extra £26,000 in subhead U. for the grant to An Bord Pleanála arises as a result of the recruitment of a chief officer and the appointment by the former Minister of additional board members.</P>
    <P>Finally on Subhead F.2. offsetting savings of £2 million arise because EEC <Col N="2521" /> approval of the programme for implementation of the private group water schemes element of the western package of FEOGA aid was not received until April 1981.  The necessary statutory regulations to bring the new scheme of grants into operation at national level were made in May and became effective in June 1981.  This loss of five months has had a disproportionate effect on the level of group scheme activity in 1981.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's brief &mdash; I do not hold him responsible for it &mdash; there is the usual allegation from Government sources when dealing with Estimates, that the previous Government did not provide sufficient for housing.  I can truthfully say that never did Fianna Fáil Governments allow the housing drive to be slowed down because of a lack of money.  I want to warn the Government that they are facing tremendous social unrest particularly in the larger urban areas, because of the housing shortage and the inept way the Department are dealing with the housing situation.  At present there are 7,000 people on the approved waiting list of Dublin Corporation.  I am mentioning Dublin Corporation because I have knowledge of it and it has the highest housing demand in the country.  There are many people who would not be eligible to go on that list but are in great need of housing.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of confusion about the various mortgage schemes to be introduced by the Government.  On one occasion a Minister announced that a new scheme was being brought in, but when some people tried to work it out they found certain essential facts were missing and without them could not make an assessment of the new scheme.  The next day the Minister said the scheme was not ready.  That is the kind of confused thinking that exists in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department, I am sure, are conscious of the need for more houses.  Every public representative knows we must build more dwellings, and I suggest that the Department should look at their work and see how they are using their <Col N="2522" /> resources.  Proper housing is a basic need. Many social ills in our urban areas are the result of houses which are not up to the required standard.  Yet we face the remainder of the year knowing the housing drive is falling behind.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation's approved housing list is growing daily.  Apart from the fact that buildings get older and may have to be pulled down, there is a natural increase in population in this city.  Many people are returning from Britain and coming from the country to settle in Dublin.  All these facts must be faced by the Government.  Fianna Fáil had a more dynamic approach to the housing problem than the Coalition have.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the present situation.  He should ask his Minister if he is doing his best to solve this housing problem.  I admit this is not an easy problem to solve, but it has to be solved because we are living in a time of intense social strife.  The northern troubles affect the people in the Republic because families coming here to live have to be housed.</P>
    <P>I spent many years in the Dublin City Council and at one time thought we had almost solved this problem.  Some years ago emigration eased the burden but that was never a solution we accepted.  I will take the Minister around this city and show him people living in overcrowded conditions.  It was said at one time that Dublin had the worst slums in Europe. Admittedly a great deal of the bad housing has gone, but we have a new problem now &mdash; overcrowding.</P>
    <P>People are marrying younger.  A daughter and her husband might live with her parents and this can lead to a great deal of tension.  From bad housing conditions stem many evils and social ills.  If we cannot house these people properly we may have to pay more dearly later because these people will have to be hospitalised if there is a breakdown in their physical or mental health.</P>
    <P>I cannot say the Minister's brief raises any hopes that he is going to do something great in this area.  Because of the rising population one can never become complacent about this situation. I am putting a great deal of emphasis on <Col N="2523" /> housing because in my view it is a basic need and we have to do all we can to help these people.  I want to condemn the Government for not finding all the money needed.</P>
    <P>There is no point in blaming the last Government.  People looking for houses do not worry about fiscal policies or national finances.  We who believe the family is the basic unit of society must do everything we can to ensure the family structure is not impaired because of substandard or faulty housing.  We hear a great deal about marital breakdowns.  We must ask ourselves how much of this is caused by bad housing.  We all know it is not always people living in local authority houses whose marriages break down. Young people who want to buy their own. houses cannot find the necessary deposit and this Estimate will not be very much help to them.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties, but the Government must have a dynamic approach and press ahead with our housing drive.  I appeal to the Government to have another look at the provision set out in this Supplementary Estimate and I should like to assure them that if they require additional money for this we will facilitate them in every way.  It is no harm to warn the Government that we are in a situation which could explode at any time.  We must bear in mind the suffering of young couples who cannot get proper housing.  They want to settle down they are good people but they are under great strain because of the lack of proper housing.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of the exorbitant profits being made from the sale of land. I do not deny that that is happening and I consider it most immoral that anybody should make profit from something that is scarce at the expense of those waiting to get proper housing.  If the Government cannot finance a proper housing policy in this city, or in other urban areas, in an orthodox way I suggest that they discuss the matter with the Land Commission because I understand that when the Land Commission acquire a farm they pay for it in land bonds.  It may be possible to do something similar in regard to the purchase <Col N="2524" /> of land for housing.  However, a new system must be devised to remove the terriuble burden of the price of land on local authorities.  If we do not do something about providing proper housing, the force may well surface here in the future that will tackle such problems in a much more radical fashion.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of malicious damage.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me when I say that there is a great waste of public money because some mindless people destroy property, public and private.  I do not excuse those who say they have a political motive either.  Our people must pay for the malicious damage to such property and I often wonder if those who are guilty of this crime give any consideration to the fact that even old age pensioners must in some way make a contribution towards the cost of reparing the damage.  The State must raise the money through taxation and consequently, everybody must contribute.  If we did not have such a massive bill for malicious damage it is possible that the Government would be in a position to devote more funds to helping pensioners and other needy people.  I appeal to those people, young and no so young, who set out to destroy property, who engage in this mindless occupation, to take into consideration that everybody must contribute towards the cost of reparing the damage.  The media should highlight such an appeal and it should be brought to the attention of children in schools.  It is no harm to show those people how ridiculous and cruel it is for them to embark on a campaign of damaging property.  Compensation must be paid from State funds and maybe some day we will see a reduction under this heading.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the frequent hints we get from members of the Government parties that rates on private dwellings will be reintroduced at some stage.  At meetings of Dublin City Council members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael party hinted at the prospect of the reintroduction of rates.  They expressed the view that since rates were abolished the democratic process was weakened.  That seems to indicate that if rates were reintroduced <Col N="2525" /> the democratic process would be strengthened.  Rates were removed by Fianna Fáil because it was felt that it was an unjust tax.  It is for that reason that we call on the Government to announce that it is not their intention to reintroduce rates on private dwellings.  I am aware that our friends across the channel envy us when they are told that rates no longer apply to private dwellings.  We have been asked on many occasions how we manage to achieve that.  In fact, the removal of rates may become a national issue in Great Britain.  We considered that rates represented an unjust tax on couples, young and old, because they had to find the money to pay the bill whether they had the resources or not.  Fortunately, such families do not have to face the dreaded twice yearly demand for rates now.</P>
    <P>All public representatives are deeply interested in the Department of the Environment and for that reason I regret that I do not have more time to deal in greater depth with the various schemes operated by it.  While I do not hold the Minister responsible for the contents of the speech he read out this morning, I believe Government Ministers should cease bemoaning, rather untruthfully, that the last Government did not provide sufficient money for housing.  The last Government faced many obstacles but they did not neglect housing. I was attracted to this party because of its policy in relation to housing and I have always maintained that irrespective of what other section of the economy is left short, the housing drive must be maintained.  I have always looked upon the building industry as the barometer of national progress or otherwise.  If the building industry is kept going it means more people can be housed and employment maintained.  When we resume office shortly we will show the same dynamism we displayed down the years in regard to the building industry.  We will always be critical of the Government until they meet the growing needs of our ever-increasing population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> This is the first occasion I have had an opportunity <Col N="2526" /> of addressing the House and I feel very honoured and privileged to do so. The importance of local government is evident to anybody in public life because it affects all citizens within the State.  It is therefore essential that local government as a system should continue and should be expanded to make it more local and more meaningful for our people.  For that reason I welcome the additional funds being given to the Department in this Supplementary Estimate.  I listened to Deputy Moore's contribution about the Government's housing programme and I noticed that he conveniently forgot that there would not be any need for this Supplementary Estimate for the Department of the Environment if it had been funded properly in the 1981 Estimate.  It is unfair of him to criticise the Government's housing programme when one considers that the Government have only been four months in office.  It is obvious that for housing alone we were left £16½ million short.  Those of us who have entered political life throught local government realise that it is essential, irrespective of the Government that is in power, that adequate funds are provided so that the local authority can carry out its proper function.  Local government affects everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the number of residents' and community associations that have sprung up in recent years because when one is dealing with such groups one brings local government to the people and makes it more meaningful.  There is a great deal of saving on the public purse to be achieved by urging residents' associations and community associations to become more involved in their communities and environment.  We all realise that this is done on a voluntary basis.  It is the responsibility of each local authority to pay heed to these associations and indeed encourage them.  There are many areas in which residents' associations can assist, not least of which is the encouragement of the community at large to respect their environment.  Not alone should they act as watchdogs with regard to planning matters, road proposals and so on that may effect them but <Col N="2527" /> they have an even wider role to play in Irish life generally.</P>
    <P>Since this debate commenced we have heard a lot about housing policy.  I agree with what Deputy Moore said, that the housing policy of any government or any party is essential to the formation of any future society.  I entered public life through the local government system.  I am a member of Dublin County Council and am aware of the problems facing them in the housing area at present.  It is essential to recognise that housing is a basic right of any individual and that the family unit &mdash; long a feature of Irish life &mdash; depends for its very existence on proper housing facilities.  While a great deal has been and is being done under the local government housing programme &mdash; whether by Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, or Dún Laoghaire Borough &mdash; it is time we ascertained where we are going.  There will always be people in our society who, through no fault of their own, will be in need of housing by a local authority.  But it is essential &mdash; and this Government recognise this fact &mdash; that we encourage those who are capable of providing homes for themselves to do so.  In the Dublin area in recent years, because of the escalation in house prices, occasioned mainly by increased land values, it has become practically impossible for a young couple to raise the necessary deposit with which to but their own home.  This means that more and more people who heretofore would not have put their names on local authority housing lists have no option but to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's proposal to create the Housing Finance Agency which I have no doubt will prove of enormous help to the thousands of young couples on the waiting lists of various local authorities, and indeed to those who will be getting married in the future.  If we can evolve a system which will encourage young people, at an early stage of their relationship, to save through one of the lending agencies, with the Government assisting them later in raising a deposit, we will be eliminating a number <Col N="2528" /> of people at present seeking accommodation from local authorities and in that way, building a better society.</P>
    <P>If I might give the House one example of this, an example which could be given by any of us here who hold clinics regularly.  There is the option open to anybody to get married, find rented accommodation, but because of the points scheme operated by local authorities, most young people will take the worst accommodation they can get because the better will be their chance of being rehoused.  Therefore the trend is to get married, take bad rented accommodation, a child comes along and they are all then living in bad conditions, which is bound to have an effect on the marriage and endanger the health of that child. After some considerable period of time on the waiting list the local authority may provide them with a home.  Would not it be far better if we could say to any such young couple; you save a certain percentage and the State will assist you in accumulating a deposit so that you can get your own home straightaway.  In my opinion the effects of that on society would be tremendous, it would assist marriages and also the health of those children who become part of the family unit.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we get our housing programme right, that we spend money on local authority housing for those who genuninely need it, who have no option, and continue to encourage those who can afford to save and but their own homes to do so.  If the State must give them some encouragement then I am all in favour of it.  Certainly the proposed Housing Finance Agency should help to a greater degree in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the announcement by the Government to examine the possibility of controlling land prices.  There is no doubt but they have had a drastic effect on house prices in recent years.  It is only reasonable that people get a fair price for their land, but the exorbitant prices paid in recent years have gone out of all proportion.  Any action that can be taken by the Government in that area will be of tremendous advantage to us all and particularly <Col N="2529" /> those who will be in need of housing in the future.</P>
    <P>To revert to other aspects of the operations of the Department, the road tax now reintroduced should solve the problems we have been encountering on our roads, certainly those in the greater Dublin area.  None of us like having to impose taxes but I think the public at large would be prepared to pay a reasonable amount for the provision of a proper road network.  I sincerely hope that the money collected from this road tax will be spent solely on the construction and maintenance of our roads because if we do not have a proper road network, ultimately the cost to the State will be very high.  There will be additional charges to be imposed on industry, delays in deliveries, in the receipt of goods, waste of fuel, damage to health, to mention but a few.  I am sure the Government will provide adequate funds to local authorities for the construction of a proper road network, which will ultimately be of great saving to the Exchequer.  In this regard the Excequer is being asked to pay too much continously.  There is no reason private enterprise cannot be involved in road construction.  I am sure private enterprise would be only too willing to become involved in the provision of a proper roads network.  This idea has worked well in other countries, as all of us who have travelled abroad will know. We have seen toll roads.  If roads are provided more speedily through private funds I cannot foresee any objection.  I am sure the public at large would be agreeable to the payment of a small toll if roads were provided more speedily. Therefore we should investigate the possibility of encouraging the private sector to become more involved in the provision of funds for our roads network.</P>
    <P>We are providing a further £3 million here for sanitary a services.  In Dublin country there is massive development at the moment and one of the reasons for prices being so high is because of a lack of serviced land.  The money for services is provided from the Exchequer.  I do not think that is the only way in which to provide the money.  Private enterprise should be encouraged.  The more serviced <Col N="2530" /> land available the cheaper it will be, because it is a question ultimately of supply and demand.  Serviced land is needed for housing and industry and, if it is scarce, whatever is available will become more and more valuable.  More serviced land in Dublin country is required to meet housing demands and the demand for jobs.  Private enterprise should be encouraged to become involved.  If we can have toll bridges there is no reason why we should not have tool services. These things should be provided speedily and we should not always have to wait for the public purse to provide the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning there is a sum provided here for An Bord Pleanála.  In my opinion planning is about people and local authorities should have a responsibility at all times to remember that they are dealing with people.  What may appear to be an attractive scheme on a map may not necessarily result in a proper environment in which to ask people to live.  An Bord Pleanála should be respect the wishes of local authorities and not grant permissions which involve a change in Zoning.  Planning must be done in a properly organised way and I do not think An Bord Plannála should be involved in changes.  Technical matters should, of course, be dealt with on appeal but the public should have an opportunity to become involved.  The development plan gives the opportunity to the public of examining the proposals of the local authority, making suggestions for change, lobbying the public representatives and so on.  If, however, an independent body not answerable to the public has the power to change zones that is detrimental to the whole planning process.  It is, indeed, undemocratic.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is looking at the planning laws.  If a planning authority has to face having to pay compensation as a result of certain decisions that is not in the best interest of the public, and I sincerely hope the law will be changed to enable local authorities to refuse planning permissions on valid grounds and not find themselves faced with compensation claims which must be met out of the public purse.  If a planning authority <Col N="2531" /> feels some development is premature or undesirable it should be entitled to refuse permission for that development without any fear of being faced with a subsequent massive compensation claim.  At the moment local authorities are faced with having to give permissions or else meet massive compensation claims.  That is not right and the law should be changed.  I hope that during this Government's life these loopholes will be closed and we will get down to proper planning and proper protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, local government affects everybody.  We should ensure that what we do today will be something of which people can be proud in the future producing an environment in which they can live in peace and security.  I doubt if the direction we are taking is the right one.  The public should have a say in development.  It is quite easy to provide long rows of houses with a community centre and a shopping centre and perhaps other facilities without advertence to the dangers that may ultimately arise from speeding traffic putting the lives of children in jeopardy.  Such areas can, in fact, be completely lacking in a community spirit.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that areas like Malahide, Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, and Dundrum are becoming more and more attractive.  The reasons why they are attractive is because of the community spirit that exists.  That is the reason why housing is always increasing in these areas.  People want to be part of a community.  As a member of a local authority I shall always insist on our remembering in the planning process that we are planning for people and what may appear to be suitable may not necessarily be what people want.  This is a point that should be remembered, too, from the point of view of appeals.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Seán Moore said, malicious injury claims have to be paid out of the public purse.  Those who scrawl graffiti on our walls or damage property should be compelled to make good the damage done.  I notice pop groups are now disfiguring our walls with advertisements. Those who behave like this should be <Col N="2532" /> compelled to remove these graffiti.  Such an abuse of public property is unacceptable.  Steps should be taken to make those who carry out malicious injuries do something to make good the damage they have caused.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore hinted that the Government intended to reintroduce rates. That is very unfair because it creates doubt in people's minds.  It has been stated clearly and often by the Minister concerned that this Government do not intend to reintroduce domestic rates. We all recognise that the rates were a very unfair system of taxation because they did not take into account one's ability to pay.  Any tax that does not take that into account is unfair, and it is right that rates were removed.  I would like to remind the Deputy that the process of removing the domestic rates was begun by the Coalition Government in 1974. While a subsequent administration may have removed them the process was begun by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be given power to raise some finance of their own. That need not necessarily be by way of tax.  It is quite common in the United Kingdom for local authorities to run their own lotteries and they have made a considerable amount of money as a result of this.  If local authorities here were given that power, the moneys collected could be used to provide further amenities for the county involved.  We have been very fortunate in Dublin that some years ago we began a parks programme, the benefit of which is now to be seen throughout County Dublin.  I do not see why local authorities should not be able to raise their own funds through a lottery system and the money raised could be spent on the provision of amenities in the county in which they were collected.  It would also give the local authority an opportunity of raising funds without having to depend on the Exchequer.  We all realise that there is only a certain amount of money available, bearing in mind the demands on the Exchequer, for local government but, because of the growing demand on local government, it is impossible to keep pace with these demands. Therefore we should look at other ways <Col N="2533" /> of raising finance.  The lottery system would be optional and would be of tremendous benefit.  I hope that local authorities will be given the power to raise their own funds through this system.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the funds made available for special environmental grants.  Recently Dublin County Council, with a relatively small sum of money, £160,000, were able to create 45 jobs. There is room in the local government system to give employment of a productive nature.  Local authorities can carry out works which will, ultimately, be of overall benefit if they are given the finances to do so.  I have met a number of unemployed people who would be delighted to work for a local authority if they were given an opportunity to do so, even on a temporary basis.  We should examine the possibility of transferring funds from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of the Environment, provided the local authorities could show that the person was being employed by them.  I do not accept, as has been suggested, that there are large numbers of unemployed people who do not want to work.  Of course there are people in every society who will try to abuse the system and who are not too particular about working, but the vast majority of unemployed people would be pleased to be given an opportunity of working.  If we can do it through the local government system, even on a temporary basis, it would be of tremendous benefit to the State and local authorities.  There are numerous areas where this could be done, in provision of amenities, road maintenance and sanitary services.  It would only involve a transfer of funds from one department to the other.</P>
    <P>I am sure this suggestion has been looked at before but I ask the Minister to look at it again.  It would not involve any additional expenditure.  Dublin County Council managed to provide 45 jobs for a sum of £160,000 and, at the same time, carried out works which are going to be of tremendous benefit to the residents of County Dublin.  If that can be multiplied it is easy to see the number of jobs which could be made available in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2534" /> It has been a privilege for me to address this House, and I hope the points I made will be of some benefit.</P>

His contribution was of the standard I expected from a chairman of the county council.  While we differ politically, I have considerable admiration for his grasp of the local government system.  He is a fine chairman of Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the problems facing the Department of the Environment and the appalling decisions that have been made since the election of the Government.  In the speech by the Minister of State, there is what is now becoming a discredited catch cry with regard to the accusation of underprovision of finance in the original Estimate which I introduced at the beginning of the year and which other Ministers introduced for their Departments.  The Minister spoke about underprovision and then referred to additional services, schemes and charges for the Stardust Tribunal inquiry, which could not have been calculated at the time of the original Estimate.  The Government should catch themselves on with regard to labelling the previous administration with not providing enough funds.  We have had some well publicised meetings of the Government to consider the Estimates for the various.  Departments for the coming year.  We will be keeping a very close eye on the Government and will be making every effort, through this House, to see that the progress we made during our four years in Government will be continued, I am talking about progress made in the provision of roads, sewerage schemes, water schemes, housing schemes, mortgage subsidy schemes, the rates programme, abolition of rates, library services, the concern shown for the travelling people, the strategies we were pursuing with regard to toxic waste <Col N="2535" /> and industrial waste dumping, various environmental works and the improvement of the fire service.  We will be insisting, as far as we can in Opposition, that the Government continue the progress we have made.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer first to the mortgage subsidy scheme for which provision is being made in this Supplementary Estimate.  This relates to a scheme introduced by me as Minister in April last for first-time owner occupiers of grant-type new houses.  It was a provision of a subsidy of £3,000 spread over a three-year period.  In the first year £1,500 was to be paid, in the second year, £1,000 and in the third year, £500.  This scheme with other items introduced in April comprised our housing package of 1981.  That mortgage subsidy scheme included payments of subsidy to single people but perhaps the greatest example we have of discrimination on the part of this Government is the decision to exclude single people from the scheme.  This has had an effect throughout the construction industry.  In addition it has implications for the morale of the nation in terms of one section of the community being discriminaed against.  Our scheme provided for a mortgage subsidy for both married and single people alike but in July the Minister for the Environment announced that the mortgage subsidy would no longer apply to single, first-time owner occupiers.  According to his figure these people comprised 22 per cent of all first-time owner-occupiers.  That 22 per cent is on a national level but if we were to take the major urban areas I would suggest that in respect of Dublin, for instance, the figure would be at least 30 per cent and possibly up to 40 per cent. By a single stroke of the pen the Government have discriminated against single people.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to use his good offices to persuade the Government to make the subsidy available for single people as well as for married people.  I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment to the Department of the <Col N="2536" /> Environment.  I know that he has a background in local government and I am confident that he will share many of the views I express here, including the view on the mortgage subsidy.</P>
    <P>Another decision made by this Government was the abolition of the mortgage interest subsidy.  In Government Fianna Fáil recognised the burden of mortgage repayments.  We recognised the burden of continuously-rising interest rates and, consequently, we decided to assist mortgage holders through the difficult period of worldwide high interest rates.  However, this uncaring Government, this Government of pseudo-economists whose main concern is for figures rather than for people &mdash; though they do not even get their figures right &mdash; removed the mortgage interest subsidy with the result that since July last a mortgage holder with a building society has been paying 16.25 per cent compared with a mortgage when we left office of 13.15 per cent.  I should be interested to hear the Minister of State's response as to how he can justify this type of action at a time when interest rates have been increasing so much.  Has he any idea of the burden that the removal of the interest subsidy is placing on the shoulders of mortgage holders?  Has he any idea of the effect it is having on householders, on marriages and on family life?  This decision together with the other decisions taken in July by the Minister for Finance in the context of the 5 per cent increase in VAT and the various other increases leaves us with a current inflation rate of between 23 and 24 per cent.  Despite this we have a Government who are asking the workers to take reductions in incomes and in living standards supposedly in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The Government are also composed of members of the Labour Party, who purport to represent the workers.  I will come back in greater detail on another occasion to the removal of the mortgage subsidy from single people and the question of mortgage interest.  As a result of other decisions made in July the whole local authority loan scheme is in tatters because the Government have not yet sent out instructions to the local authorities <Col N="2537" /> about this scheme in relation to joint incomes.  The income of the husband and wife being taken together has to be under £7,000 a year.  When both incomes are taken together very few couples will be earning under £7,000 a year.  At Question Time the Minister of State said that the wife could be in temporary employment and then her income would not be included.  When we asked him to define temporary employment he could not define it for us.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues come to me with complaints about their local authorities in relation to the operation of the SDA loan scheme, which is falling apart. What is the Government's response in this area of house purchase?  It is the announcement of a Housing Finance Agency.  We have heard a lot of talk about it but we have not seen the legislation.  I understand the enabling legislation, rather than the setting up of the agency, will come before the House before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I welcome any additional funds that can be made available from any source for the housing industry and to assist young couples starting off to buy their own homes.  I welcome any scheme which will assist them in the early years when they are facing the problem of deposits and early repayments.  It was that concern which guided me in the preparation of the mortgage subsidy scheme, the £3,000 spread over three years to assist the first time buyer over the first three difficult years of the mortgage.</P>
    <P>What do we know of the Housing Finance Agency?  If we are to take the Fine Gael programme as the guiding principle for the agency, this scheme will provide mortgages at a fixed percentage of the income of the mortgage holder varying from 17½ per cent to 20 per cent. If we take 20 per cent, this fixed percentage will carry on throughout the life of the mortgage.  Let us take a 20 year mortgage of £20,000.  In the first year the mortgage-holder will pay a fixed percentage of his income, £1,000 in the first year. I am being conservative when I say that the average increase in salary will be 10 per cent.  If we take a 10 per cent increase over every year of the 20-year mortgage, <Col N="2538" /> this person will find himself still paying 20 per cent of his income in the twentieth year of the mortgage.  In that year he will pay more in his mortgage repayment than the original mortgage was.  Figures were published recently by a respected financial journalist which suggests that in the mortgage period of 20 years on a £20,000 mortgage the unfortunate mortgage-holder will repay in the region of £130,000 to £140,000.</P>
    <P>There will be another occasion to discuss this Housing Finance Agency when the Bill comes before the House.  I would like to set this marker down for the Minister of State.  If that is the type of scheme and that is the type of rip-off which is in mind, I suggest he should reconsider his situation and look again at the type of mortgage.  I also want to set down a marker for him that he should not interfere with the operations of the local authority loan scheme at this stage and incorporate it in this new bureaucratic structure of an agency.</P>
    <P>Why is an agency needed?  If there are additional funds available can they not be put into the SDA loan fund?  The administration of that fund runs at about a half per cent, which is very low when compared with mortgages from building societies, insurance companies and banks.  The Minister of State does not need a new agency.  Apparently one of the ideas behind the agency is that it will have the power to raise funds, provide funds and so forth, but this can be done under the Office of Public Works.  They have the power to raise money in the manner in which this agency intends to do so.  I believe this agency has a nice title, but the substance of the agency is questionable.  I welcome any additional funds made available to the housing industry to help provide houses for young people starting off.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authority houses, a percentage of the population through no fault of theirs are unable to buy their own homes and they must be housed by the Government through the local authority housing programme.  It is the responsibility of any Government to provide adequate housing for those people. Fianna Fáil in Government have always <Col N="2539" /> recognised that position.  Last year and in each of the four years of our term of office we built over 6,000 local authority houses.  Last year was a record year for housing construction when we built nearly 28,000 houses.  In relation to local authority houses and those on waiting lists we also took the imaginative step last April of assisting those who could afford the repayments but could not afford the initial deposit if they got a house.  In our housing package for 1981 I introduced a scheme where tenants of local authority houses or those on the local authority housing list for one year and who had one child could get a mortgage of up to £18,000 and would also be eligible for the new house grant and the mortgage subsidy.  The mortgage subsidy would be paid whether the house was new or second-hand.</P>
    <P>One of the problem of housing generally is the cost of the site.  This is a major element in the cost.  One important way of reducing the cost is to provide adequate sewerage and water supply facilities throughout the country.  Taking the law of supply and demand into account, the more serviced land that is available the less will be the cost of the site.  With this principle in mind, this year we provided in our estimates for sanitary services record allocations for the provision of sewerage and water supply schemes.  I was Minister for the Environment at the time and I sanctioned schemes amounting to approximately £75 million so that we could provide adequate serviced land for our housing and industrial programmes.</P>
    <P>As a party we are totally opposed to the windfall profits that some people get as a result of the extension of sewerage facilities and water supply schemes to their area or of decisions of local authorities regarding zoning of land.  In such cases the landowner concerned benefits from what can only be described as windfall profits.  We will examine and support a scheme introduced by the Government to tackle this problem.  Accusations were made by members of the Government parties about our attitude on this matter, <Col N="2540" /> but I want to put it on the record that we will support such a scheme if the Government put it forward.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not here when the National Coalition were in power from 1973 to 1977.  They did nothing about the matter then but we will wait and see.  A matter that is causing much concern at the moment is the hint of the reintroduction of rates in some guise by the Minister for the Environment.  In a significant move, the Minister recently wrote to the chairmen of local authorities and asked that meetings be held to discuss reorganisation of local government and means of raising additional funds by local authorities.  I want to put the record straight on this item also.  Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to the reintroduction of rates in the domestic sector.  When we came to office in 1977 we took the courageous decision to remove rates from domestic property. We will oppose at local authority and at national level any attempt by this Government to reintroduce rates.</P>
      <P>Very innocently the Minister asked local authorities to advise him on how they would like to raise extra funds.  A previous speaker spoke of a lottery. There is merit in a lottery system and there is the element of choice.  I wish to emphasise that we will oppose totally the introduction of charges for services such as the collection of domestic refuse or any other charges that may be suggested by this Government.  If the Minister has proposals to make about reorganisation and funding, he should make the decisions.  He is the Minister and that is his responsibility.  He should not ask local authorities to do his dirty work for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in government I proposed a system of charges to be made for planning applications.  At that time I had in mind charges for planning applications where local authorities were faced with unusual applications: for example, there was the case of Wexford County Council who had to deal with the application for Carnsore Point for the nuclear power <Col N="2541" /> station and there was the case of Meath County Council who had to deal with applications for Tara and Bula.  In such cases there is a considerable charge on the local authority concerned as they have to bring in specialist advisers.  It was my view that where there was commercial benefit to be obtained, the commercial operators should make a contribution towards processing their planning permission applications.</P>
    <P>We will oppose totally any proposal by this Government for the introduction of charges for domestic extensions or other types of extension to domestic property. This Government will be totally opposed by us in any attempt to introduce rates under any name.  The Minister for the Environment is chasing around the country in his efforts to introduce certain charges but we will oppose them.  He spoke in Limerick on the matter.  He asked local authorities to tell him what they would like to charge their people.  It is merely an attempt to reintroduce rates. The Minister will not get away with it. He will be fought tooth and nail by this party on any proposal to reintroduce rates.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that it is the intention to abolish the £195 tax-free allowance in respect of each child?  The first part of the answer says it would result in a saving of £50 million and in the second part the Minister seems to indicate that it will be abolished.  Is it also the intention to abolish the allowance in respect of all children including those who are over 16 years of age and still receiving education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to implement the joint programme and that programme states that child tax allowances will be replaced by an augmented child benefit payment to mothers of dependent children of £3 per week and £4 for the sixth and later child.  As the Deputy is aware, there are different rates of tax allowance.  There is £195 general allowance, £500 allowance in respect of incapacitated children regardless of age and £195 in respect of each child over the age of 18 years.  This matter is being considered by the Government in replacing the scheme.  It is also a matter for the Minister for Health and Social Welfare who will be introducing the replacement scheme.</P>

      <P>My reply stated that the £50 million saving will be offset against the cost of the scheme to augment the child benefit under the social welfare arrangements.  This is a major redistributive <Col N="2543" /> beneficial transfer in terms of family income support and is one which Members will generally support.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will refund the VAT which was charged on an environmental aid for a disabled person (details supplied) in Waterford in line with the spirit of the special exemption introduced in the January Budget for the International Year of the Disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme announced in the January budget provided for exemption from VAT in respect of certain specified goods specially designed for the disabled.  It is not possible under these provisions to refund the tax incurred by the person the subject of the question.  The Revenue Commissioners have, however, been examining the existing arrangements and their proposals <Col N="2544" /> are at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that practical difficulties arise in the provision of relief in respect of certain categories of goods which are not identifiable in themselves as being designed specifically for disabled persons.  Nevertheless, I intend to have an appropriate repayment scheme in operation by the end of the year which will apply to qualifying purchases and importations made on or after 1 March 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the practical difficulties in instances such as this could be readily overcome by reference to the disabled person?  Would he further agree that it is possible to have such reference from suitable experts available through both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance?  I am sorry that it is not possible to go ahead with this now but I hope that in his review the Minister will consider this case.  It is sad that this should occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now, under the scheme previously introduced there is a zero rating for clearly indentifiable items used by or associated with the disabled. That includes items such as invalid carriages, artificial limbs and orthopaedic appliances.  It will be possible to provide relief in this case or in similar cases only where the purchase of equipment can be examined by reference to the actual disability of the person making the purchase.  In this case quite sophisticated environmental equipment of an electronic and mechanical nature was purchased.  It did not come under the general scheme of the zero-rating exemption.  I assure the Deputy that an examination of the expenditure incurred and a repayment arrangement for qualified purchases and importations made on or after 1 March will be carried out.  It would require a ministerial order.  That is currently being considered.  The Deputy may rest assured that in the case concerned it may be possible to refund the VAT expended.  In future it would require examination of each case on its merits in respect of particular equipment bought.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not making it clear to the House why zero rating in this and other similar cases cannot be applied once the items are for the use of the disabled.  He refers to a scheme introduced subsequently.  The Minister at that time disagreed with some of the stringent conditions attached, thus enabling other disabled people to benefit. Why can he not now see to it that a similar condition is applied rather than reviewing and considering the possibility of a ministerial order?  Will he stop waffling and say that this can be done?  It can be done under the terms of the scheme, no matter what advice he has been getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated clearly that they had to be items which were identified clearly as associated with or used by the disabled.  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of the scheme as announced related to items such as invalid carriages, artificial limbs, orthopaedic appliances and so on.  In this instance the person purchased sophisticated electronic and mechanical equipment operated by signals such as blowing into tubes which performed tasks such as drawing curtains, turning on and off a television set, room heater and so on and <Col N="2546" /> enabling the person to speak on the telephone.  The equipment was necessarily of an environmental nature but such was the nature of the equipment that the Revenue Commissioners are proposing now to introduce a scheme whereby in similar cases, including this case, the identifiable item will be examined directly and then a refund will be made if it is identified clearly that the sophisticated equipment relates to the disabled person.  Otherwise, as the Deputy is aware, there could be very considerable difficulties regarding zero VAT rating for sophisticated equipment which somebody might buy for other purposes.  The original scheme which we all welcome can be amended to cater for disabled persons generally with the necessary safeguards.</P>

Will the proposed plan include the various items as outlined in the Fine Gael manifesto, namely five-year projections of Government revenue-expenditure and will it contain proposals for the elimination of the current budget deficit?  If I might ask an additional question, could the Minister indicate the relationship, if any, which the independent economic commission referred to in the Fine Gael proposals will have to the plan?  They are given some important functions and in the light of the initial report of the Three Wise Men I would like some indication as to whether the same commission will be retained for the planning activities or whether some other independent economic commission is envisaged.</P>

The headings outlined by the Deputy in the joint programme <Col N="2549" /> relating to economic growth, budgetary policy, incomes policy, elimination of deficit and public expenditure profiles certainly will be included in the plan together with what we would regard as an innovation long overdue, social policy criteria and social expenditure analyses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Special Border Area Programme which is being jointly funded by the Exchequer and the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund.  Payments totalling £1.1 million have been made to date from the special fund which was established for the implementation of the Special Border Area Programme.  This allocation has been used to commence projects in the Border counties as follows: Development of Glenveagh Park in Donegal; development of Arranmore/Burtonport landing facilities; development of Sligo airport; purchase by CIE of second-hand buses for LLSR Company; minor road improvements in all five counties by local authorities; provision of tourist-related amenities and recreational facilities in all five counties by local authorities; accommadation grants provided by Bord Fáilte in all five counties; provision of tourist-related amenities and recreational facilities in all five counties by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2552" /> In addition Bord Fáilte have been promoting the Border counties and Córas Tráchtála are assisting the marketing potential of small and medium-sized industries at various locations in the Border areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the non-quota section, the fund may participate in financing specific community regional development measures which differ in whole or in part from quota section measures.  There was very little scope for measures in Ireland in the particular categories I have outlined.  Following the Irish Government's request and the agreed statement presented to the Council of Ministers specifying that the non-quota section may assist measures relating to Border problems in the most deserving areas of the community, submitted jointly by two or more member states concerned, I want to stress that the only measures for the Irish Border problems which the Commission were prepared to consider were based on tourism in the Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourist measures proposed relate to development of accommodation, tourism promotion, provision of amenities and infrastructure directly linked to the development of tourism &mdash; for example, Sligo Airport comes under that heading <Col N="2553" />&mdash; and improvements in communications giving access to tourist areas.  I can provide the Deputy with more detailed information about the estimated total draw-up of the fund in 1981, but he will appreciate that there is a great deal of data involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government put forward very careful proposals which have to meet the criteria laid down under the regional development programme. Many of the projects I have read out, such as Sligo Airport, Burtonport or the work done by the five local authorities in the area, could be regarded as assisting the tourist industry of the Border counties.  It was on that basis that Sligo Airport was included and a sum of £134,000 provided.  The work done by Córas Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte, local authorities, Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department of Transport relates to the Border counties.  It would be very difficult to maintain that special agreements have been reached, as, I am sure, the former Minister will agree.</P>

      <P>I realise the importance of the Dunkellin river to the Deputy's area.  It is on the priority list of minor catchments to be considered.  The design work is going ahead but there are problems in the sense that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have to be consulted about the matter.  There is an oyster bed at Clarenbridge and a wild life habitat at Rahasane Turlough and they will have a bearing on the cost-benefit analysis.  When those studies are completed we will be able to finish the design but we will have to consider the effect on the wild life habitat and the oyster beds of the drainage of the river.  It is not a simple matter.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of what promises were made but I am aware that a visit was made to the area in the company of an engineer.  What I am saying is this: it was implied in one question here that the cost/benefit survey was going on.  That was not the case.  I am saying that the cost/benefit studies were not commenced during the term of office of my predecessor.  The preparation of a design is now being undertaken.  I indicate <Col N="2558" /> that there are problems there, creating special difficulties.  I am not saying that they will not allow us to drain that river.  I am saying that there is a wildlife habitat and an oyster bed close to it and we must consider the effects of the drainage on those and of those on the drainage.  I have commenced consulation with the Department of Fisheries in regard to the oyster beds.  That is all I am saying. I am not concerned with promises or anything of that sort.</P>

I was hoping he would tell us about the cost/benefit survey on which the previous Minister made a decision and issued an order for work to go ahead.  I cannot understand why the cost/benefit survey could not go ahead.  Is it a problem of finance, personnel, or what is the reason the Minister of State is giving for delaying this cost/benefit survery into 1982?</P>

We must consult with people like Fisheries and with several others who will want to know exactly &mdash; before they can decide on their involvement &mdash; what we are going to do with the river.  Therefore the design must be at an advanced stage before we can progress to the cost/benefit.  I am in a position to say that I hope &mdash; I stress the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; because I will not be accused of making promises that are not fulfilled &mdash; the cost/benefit survey will be undertaken in 1982.</P>

These are things that would have to be seriously considered by any government in the design of a drainage scheme.  Of course they will have an effect because the people concerned will be worried about the effect the drainage of this river will have on the oyster bed.</P>

      <P>The Nanny river is in the Corrib-Clare catchment, a scheme which, under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945, was carried out between the years 1954 and 1964.  The river Nanny was included in the scheme, as confirmed by the Minister for Finance.  But, because of the possibility of damage being caused to the Tuam waterworks by silt, the work projected did not go ahead at that time. That scheme ended in 1964.  While the scheme was still in progress Galway County Council indicated that a new water supply was being considered. When, in 1964, all other works on the drainage scheme were completed and there was no prospect of an early decision on the proposed new water supply, a certificate of partial completion was issued for the Corrib/Clare scheme.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that there is now an alternative water supply in operation in Tuam and that there is nothing stopping the Office of <Col N="2562" /> Public Works from going ahead and completing these drainage works?  Might I ask the Minister also whether this drainage scheme has to go back on the priority list or, with the goodwill of his offices, can it be done without being replaced on the priority list?</P>

I cannot accept responsibility for delay now since I have only been four months in office. There was considerable delay in carrying out this scheme and I have explained the reasons for that delay.  I understand as a result of discussions with the county council that the scheme is now technically possible and am expediting this river drainage to the utmost of my ability.

      <P>I appreciate there is flooding in the area.  The Laune catchment is second last on a priority list of 28. Under the Act, as the Deputy knows, the Office of Public Works cannot drain this area.  During Deputy McEllistrim's term in office officials from the Office of Public Works visited the area accompanied by <Col N="2568" /> a representative of a local drainage action committee.

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the seriousness of the flooding for families from the Cork-Kerry border to Killarney?  The situation has worsened over the last couple of years allegedly because of the drainage of new forestry development in the area.  In view of difficulties experienced last winter by this group of farmers would he use his good offices to investigate a development in conjunction with the Department of Forestry, the Department of the Environment and Kerry County Council to alleviate the hardship for the residents there who now find it impossible to get insurance to cover their property and stock?</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that in the letter which the Minister for the Environment has circulated to the Chairmen of all the local authorities, he asked for their observations of the question of rates and charges to be imposed by them to secure improvements in their funding.  I was assuring the House that the Fianna Fáil Party are totally opposed to the reimposition of rates under any guise.  However, the second part of the circular from the Minister refers to the reorganisation of local government.  It should be the role of the Minister to put forward proposals in this matter rather than to request comments from the local authorities.  In putting forward his proposals I would ask the Minister to take special note of the role of the community organisations, the voluntary community associations, community councils and the various residents and tenants associations, because within the local government structure there should be a special place for these fora of local democracy that have been developed in the past 15 to 20 years.  These various organisations have been doing superb work.  They developed originally in the major urban areas of Dublin, Cork and Galway but <Col N="2579" /> they have extended into the rural areas. In whatever proposals are put forward for the re-organisation of local government the Minister should provide for the involvement of the community councils and tenants associations.</P>
      <P>In regard to infrastructure generally, I would remind the House that my predecessor, Deputy Barrett, accepted the major road development plan for the eighties.  That was a ten-year programme which envisaged the improvement of the major roads between towns, the by-passing of existing towns and the development of access to ports and airports so that the industrial programme in which we are engaged and the expansion of housing schemes could be facilitated in terms of adequate road structure.  We took the courageous step at the time of committing large allocations of money to the roads plan this year but we are now told by the Government that we should not borrow for such purposes.  They tell us that our national borrowings are too high.  I reject totally the theory that we should not borrow in the long term in order to provide a proper road structure. If we are to have serviced land a proper telecommunications network and a road structure adequate for our industrial development and if we are to have proper schools and a general industrial base we must engage in long-term borrowing.  In Government we involved ourselves in such borrowing for the roads programme.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister of State that that programme will be continued in the same dynamic manner in which we tackled it. This year I sanctioned proposals for road works dealing with 85 to 90 per cent of all of the items listed in the schedule of the programme or of the Blue Book as it is called.  The work was to be undertaken at various stages.  Some of it related to construction, some to the purchase of land and some to planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking of roads leads me to the question of the disgraceful decision of the Government to reintroduce road tax on those vehicles from which we had removed it.  In June last the Government made no mention of their intention to <Col N="2580" /> reintroduce this tax, just as they failed to tell the people about the many other changes they were making such as the removal of the mortgage interest subsidy. I want the Minister to assure me that the total revenue that will accrue from the reintroduction of road tax will be spent on the roads programme.</P>
    <P>We were involved in a programme of including the private sector in the road construction programme.  I was very pleased to hear one of the Fine Gael Deputies speak of this commitment to the toll road project proposals and to the benefits that would accrue from this move.  I had the privilege of signing the permission for the new bridge over the Liffey but I should like to see that work proceeding as soon as possible.  By way of encouraging the private sector to become involved in the roads and bridges programme, the setting of the totals should be the decision of the Government and not of the local authorities.  I say this having regard to the Government's overall control of the programme. It was my intention that the setting of tolls would be a matter for the Government and therefore I shall welcome and facilitate in so far as possible the passing of any legislation to change the present situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage the Government to proceed with the development of the library service.  In rural areas where it is not always possible to build and furnish permanent libraries in every town and village the Minister should encourage by way of grants and subsidies the mobile library system.  Our aim should be for a full mobile library service in every town and village in which there is not a permanent library.  Some local authorities have been very active in this regard but there are other areas in which there has been no mobile library programme.  The matter is one that should be tackled at national level and with specific guidelines set down.</P>
    <P>Regarding the travelling people, I know that the Government are awaiting the report of the committee set up by the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Environment and who are to report later this year.  In the meantime I would <Col N="2581" /> draw attention to a major problem that is developing particularly in the Dublin region as a result of a court decision given in respect of one itinerant family.  I am not in any way questioning the right of the judge in that case to reach the particular decision but the position is now that the local authorities are hiding behind the decision and are failing to take action to facilitate the settling of travelling people.  I call on the Minister to use his offices to ensure that local authorities act on the question of the designation of trading areas within the terms of the Casual Trading Act which was brought into force last year.  There is a very serious problem as a result of casual trading by itinerants.  Apart from the danger to themselves they endanger other road users but in addition they are engaging in unfair competition for the businessman and the shopkeeper who must pay rates, taxes and other overheads.  These fly-by-night traders park on the perimeters of towns, clear out the business for a particular sector and then move on.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern is the question of what action the Government are taking on industrial and toxic waste. When in Government I introduced a strategy for the treatment of such waste. Specific proposals were made early on in the life of this Government and we were assured by the Minister for the Environment that the matter was a number one priority.  As we have not heard anything further since I would be anxious to hear what action is being taken on the matter. We are all aware of the incidents in which thousands of fish have been killed, of where there has been concern on the part of community groups about the problem of the dumping of toxic waste but there is no national operation in force in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is renamed from the old Department of Local Government, but one fears that not enough attention is paid to the environmental aspect of the work of the Department.  In his reply I should like the Minister to outline his proposals in the sphere of a general environmental policy. He will be aware that, as Minister, I had an environmental policy proposal passed <Col N="2582" /> by the then Government in April or May last.  It was on the lines of the Environmental Council report and I would like to hear the Minister's plans for the future of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fire services we had a debate yesterday for three-and-a-half hours on the Committee Stage of the Fire Services Bill.  We made considerable progress although it was not as much as I hoped for.  I found we were receiving scant co-operation from the Minister on basic aspects such as staffing and the additional staffing which will be required for the improvement of the fire services in line with the proposal set down in that Bill.  In giving a specific example I would like to refer to Tallaght, one of the three new towns envisaged in the development plan of Dublin County Council from the early seventies.  A new fire service and staff are being provided there.  The staff will not be additional to the overall staff complement of the local authority.  The staff there come out of the existing complement and this means that to employ a fireman, a roadman, a part development man, a lighting maintenance man or some person doing another job has to take on the duties of a fireman.  This is the reality of the situation as told to us by the Minister yesterday.  The regulations sent out last July concerning recruitment within the public and semi-State sector is causing havoc within the local government service.  What I say about the fire services can be said about other services in the local authorities.  What does the Minister intend to do about the removal of the control?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Stardust Inquiry.  It has become a cant to say that this inquiry is costing too much and no further inquiry should be proceeded with.  No matter what it costs, in the national interest it is vitally important that that inquiry be held.  I look forward to hearing not alone the report of that inquiry but the recommendations on future needs in regard to fire fighting and fire prevention in places like the Stardust. The cost is very little when one compares it with the gains which can be got from that inquiry.  We had a debate on the fire services at great length yesterday but it <Col N="2583" /> would be wrong of me not to mention this in the context of a debate on this Supplementary Estimate.  When the Government parties were in opposition one particular supporter of the Government who is now an Independent Deputy in this House called for a public inquiry into the Bundoran fire tragedy.  I am taking this opportunity to again call on the Government to honour their commitment to a public sworn inquiry into the Bundoran fire tragedy.  There is great concern about that tragedy.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this.</P>
    <P>I had the honour of being the Minister in charge of the Department of the Environment for eight months and I would like to put on the record my appreciation of the great work of the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary and all the staff in the Department of the Environment.  During the period I was in the Custom House I had the fullest co-operation of all of the staff as well as their total loyalty in the task I was trying to carry out.  We should be very proud of our civil service.  They carry out their work in a very unselfish way without any concern for the demands on their time no matter what hour of the day or night.  It has become fashionable recently for the present administration to talk about the over-manned civil service and the wastage within the public service as if the public service did not produce anything on behalf of the people.  I can say, on behalf of the public service, that during the three years I was Minister of State in the Department of Industry and Commerce I had considerable contact with the private sector in industry both at management and factory floor levels.  I believe that the future of industry would not be in doubt if many of the management and workforce I saw in the private sector worked as hard and unselfishly as those involved in the public sector.  We are on a slippery slope if this attitude in relation to the public service continues. I want to register my appreciation and gratitude for the loyalty and unselfish dedication to their duty of the staff of the Department of the Environment during <Col N="2584" /> the time I had the pleasure of being Minister there.</P>

      <P>Tenant purchasers should be given the opportunity to purchase their houses under the tenant purchase scheme immediately they are appointed tenants.  It is not just of the Department of the Environment to take from the local authorities 60 per cent of the income under tenant purchase schemes.  That kind of revenue would enable them to carry out repairs to houses.  At the moment that programme has fallen behind to the extent that people who apply for tenant purchase are three years on the waiting list.  The Department of the Environment have laid down a condition that a house cannot be vested until repairs are carried out.  The Department of the Environment must waive the restriction introduced by Deputy Burke which lays down that where a person <Col N="2588" /> purchases a site with the maximum SDA loan he will not be allowed to pay the local authority over a period of five years. We operated this scheme in Mitchelstown, Mallow and in other areas of North Cork until the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, told us we could not do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With reference to the remarks of Deputy Raphael Burke, it ill behoves any Fianna Fáil Deputy to come here and heap criticism on subsidies that have had to be cut back or withdrawn or public expenditure that, of necessity, has had to be pegged or reduced when one looks at the record of Fianna Fáil, their policy on taxation and the way they came to power in 1977.  What did they do?  They abolished rates, a matter on which the Deputy keeps harping.  They abolished car tax and wealth tax.  They decimated capital gains tax.  They set about providing for those by massive borrowings abroad thereby sending the economy rapidly downhill which requires a major gigantic effort on the part of the Government to arrest let alone reverse. <Col N="2590" /> Yet a Fianna Fáil Deputy criticises our attempt to put the finances in some kind of order.  He heaped jibes and comments, not only in this debate but in other debates since last July, on the Labour Party.  The Labour Party did not indulge in or attempt to buy votes at the polls by offering gifts and promises to the electorate as a means of obtaining power, which was the means adopted by Fianna Fáil in 1977.  The burden of those debts abroad, not all for productive purposes, are still with us today and affect necessary items of public expenditure in local government and so on.  It was not my intention to dwell on this but I felt compelled to do it having regard to the tenure of many of the remarks made.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of building land, Deputy Burke spoke about the prime factor in this being the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  The major factor by far is the speculative dealings that go on in the development and rezoning of land.  We have experience of this in Dublin County Council.  When one looks at the record there to see by what means rezonings took place, one finds it was on the votes and support of councillors belonging to Deputy Burke's party.  The Fianna Fáil Party are nothing if not consistent and presumably that pattern will be repeated in other local authorities.  It is those practices which are producing the windfall profits referred to by Deputy Burke and it would better behove that party to ensure those profits do not arise by voting against rezonings on the advice of planning officials of county councils and local authorities.  Those are matters that increase the price of houses and price many young people out of a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the Stardust tragedy.  I see in the estimate that the Department's vote on the cost of that tribunal for the current year is £650,000 and that excludes legal fees which will be met from another source and no doubt will be that much again.  After an appalling tragedy such as occurred in the Stardust, some form of inquiry would be required but one must call into question expenditure of massive amounts of money on an inquiry of that nature.  One cannot help but wonder if that money <Col N="2591" /> would have been better spent in compensation for the families of the unfortunate victims and also for people who were injured.</P>
    <P>As regards An Bord Pleanála there is an additional sum of £26,000, bringing the expenditure up to £328,500.  As we know this board was set up by legislation in 1975.  The operating of the board as an appeals procedure has been a disappointment.  The time has come to have a look at a more acceptable and adequate appeals procedure for hearing planning appeals.  There are inordinate delays in many appeals.  Many are held up for three, six or nine months, and a year or more is not uncommon.  It is an injustice to people that decisions on matters which vitally affect them should be held up for long periods of time.  As the saying goes, justice delayed is justice denied.  Many people are held up waiting for appeals for houses and so on.  I ask that this situation be overhauled to ensure that decisions are given within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Many decisions given by the board from an environmental point of view leave a lot to be desired.  They have given decisions which have caused grave concern to the residents in the areas involved.  I refer to a decision which they gave for a toxic waste disposal plant in the Dublin mountains in the vicinity of the Dublin water supply feeding the streams that run into the reservoir providing the water for Dublin city and county.  We are faced with a situation, based on a decision they gave, where there is no more than a few millimetres of plastic between the safety of that water supply and disaster because the planning permission provides that toxic waste may be dumped in reservoirs protected by sheets of plastic, on the suggestion that this would be adequate to hold poisons and wastes that eminate therefrom and would not reach nearby streams feeding the Dublin water supply.  We are trusting the safety of the water supply on a few millimetres of plastic.  That was an incredible decision for An Bord Pleanála to reach.  I cannot but comment adversely on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2592" /> I do not know if there are any steps the Minister can take but he should look at the situation because it is causing worry and concern to the people in Tallaght who live nearby.  If anything went wrong it would effect the whole of Dublin.  The best made plans can go wrong.  We saw the situation in Bantry and other locations.  Expensive equipment can develop defects and things do not go according to plan.  The risk may be small but in this kind of issue any risk is too great.  Where the health and safety of all of us are concerned it seems remarkable that the board would reach such a decision.  Not too far away from that they gave another permission which caused serious concern to the residents in the Tallaght area and that was for a lead plant.</P>
    <P>There is provision of £3 million for certain malicious injury claims.  The time has come to look at the entire concept of this code.  It is time the burden of malicious injury payments which the State has accepted for many years was lifted.  It is time that that liability of the State was ended.  It was introduced as a penal measure many years ago during the British administration of this country and there is no logical reason why that system should continue in operation any longer. Virtually the entire damages which come under that category are covered by insurance policies and these payments by the State are little more than an operation in ease of the insurance companies.  The insurance companies should carry the can themselves.  After all, they quite happily take the premiums on those policies in which they indemnify their policy-holders against that damage.  Therefore, it would be more appropriate for those companies to pick up the tab and pay it rather than have the State pick up that burden and carry that liability.  The State has enough burdens to carry without having to bail out the insurance companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is introducing this Supplementary Estimate for a Department which probably has more expenditure than most other Departments.  However, despite the very difficult economic situation the Government inherited, the Minister for the Environment <Col N="2593" /> has found it possible since coming into office to provide an additional £30 million for housing grants, the lion's share of which went to the Dublin region, which is very badly in need of it.  I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has shown such urgency regarding the problem which all of us, particularly in the Dublin region, know is enormous &mdash; probably the biggest single problem we come across in our advice clinics.</P>
      <P>The re-introduction of the home improvement grants is very welcome.  It is a pity they were abolished even for such a short time.  That was a very short-sighted decision.  The housing stock in Dublin City is in need of grant aid &mdash; this is an old city &mdash; and the encouragement the Minister has given will ensure that the housing stock will last for a considerable period longer than it otherwise would have endured.  This applies not just to development of the housing stock of the city but also to the environment generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever expenditure or funding is mentioned in connection with the Department of the Environment the Opposition tend to speculate that the Government are going to re-introduce some form of rates, and that is a great throwaway phrase for the electorate to pick up.  However, two Cabinet Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment &mdash; have stated that there will not be a re-introduction of rates.  All the same, that is not the same as saying that the local authorities do not need additional funding.  They could do with additional funding and they could raise additional funding without the re-introduction of rates or any additional cost whatever to the domestic sector.  In the non-domestic sector, the business area, there is a good, a just opportunity, for local authorities to charge realistic fees to the business sector, something they have not been doing heretofore.  For instance, planning consultants in Dublin, many of whom are involved in very large multi-million pound developments, use the planning departments of local authorities, corporations and county councils to get expert advice and an indication of <Col N="2594" /> what the problems will be in a development.  They get it all free.  They, in turn, charge their clients very handsome fees for this information.  Dublin Corporation, for instance, would be quite justified, particularly in the stringent economic situation we are in, in charging for that sort of consultancy and in asking this section of the business sector, who more than others have been doing very well in recent times, to contribute to the local authorities who have been providing these facilities.</P>
    <P>I believe and hope that the time will come when local authorities will be given greater autonomy.  There are many issues which local authorities could very well deal with without having to refer to Government Departments.  Take, for instance, one simple issue.  At a recent meeting of Dublin Corporation a grant of £5,000 was approved for Women's Aid out of corporation funds, the corporation having satisfied themselves that this was a very worthwhile project.  When the payment of this £5,000 went to the Department of the Environment somebody there decided to hold it up.  Somebody there was not satisfied, despite the fact that local representatives were satisfied. That sort of dual bureacracy is unnecessary.  The decisions on purely local matters should remain with the local authorities, particularly large authorities such as Dublin Corporation who probably are spending somewhere in the region of £300 million plus on capital revenue in the year.  In the Dublin city region alone the corporation expenditure would probably be about £200 million.  When that sort of financing is involved and considering the cost of interest and insurance paid by the corporation, the Minister should consider giving authorities the power to go into what I would term city business.  They should be given the power to participate in the insurance and banking sector if they wish to do so and to develop into the building society sector. They are already acting in part as building societies but are confined to the lower end of the market.  Given the sort of funds being spent in Dublin and the sort of funds available to the local authorities in Dublin, those local authorities should <Col N="2595" /> be encouraged to compete in many sound profit-making areas in order to fund the very costly services they are providing for the community.</P>
    <P>I come to another point which I mention, not for the sake of alarm or sensation but because I feel something needs to be done about it.  It is the question of the audit of the accounts of local authorities.  In the case of Dublin, where I have explained the extent of the expenditure, it is and has been common that three years have passed before the set of audited accounts is presented to the Minister and then referred by him back to the local authorities.  If that was to be repeated in Dublin county we could have something in the region of £1,000 million in today's terms of Government funds not reported on for the best part of three years.  When they are reported on it is done in a very limited way.  I question whether the report will come up to the standard of the full independent audit which any reasonably sized company, private or public, would be expected to provide for their shareholders.  We should consider, even on a trial basis, the possibility of encouraging private audit companies to audit the accounts of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The local authorities pay a fee to the Department of the Environment for an audit.  I do not believe the audit is approached in the same way as an audit of a public company.  It is undesirable to have a Department of the Environment auditor working almost full-time in Dublin Corporation because he can get close to the people working there and could easily accept the explanations given to him.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have set up a committee of public accounts because of allegations about certain developments.  Certain councillors have raised the question of alleged financial difficulties and these are being examined.  If these allegations are proved, we have to ask ourselves how worthwhile are the local authority audits. Substantial amounts of money are being spent here and I feel very strongly about this.  Local councillors should be encouraged to satisfy themselves that the money <Col N="2596" /> spent has been properly audited.  On an experimental basis we could allow independent auditors to examine local authority accounts.  This already happens in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Councillors should be provided with postal services because the present system is unjust.  The authorities are only waiting for the nod from the Minister to extend reasonable facilities to councillors.  Many councillors work very hard but do not get any recognition.  They should be provided with facilities to monitor the work of the local authorities and the Minister should give attention to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts that there is a need for local government reform in the Dublin region.  The situation is crazy.  We have Dublin Corporation in the centre, in the east the Dún Laoghaire authority and then there is Dublin County Council. To complicate matters Dublin Corporation are building houses in county council areas and there is one county and city manager, with some officials common to all authorities.  This is an absurd situation and the sooner real reform is introduced the better.  Any such reform would have to refer to the power of the manager <i>vis-á-vis</i> the power of elected representatives.  In the interest of local democracy the powers of the manager should be transferred to the elected representative.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to rates.  The Coalition Government of the day had removed the health charge from the rates.  They started to abolish domestic rates by degrees.  Nobody who looks at the facts will accept that the removal of rates can be credited only to the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the permission he granted for road building and expansion but the reality is different. Everybody knows that we cannot get potholes filled, let alone a road built. Local authorities have been starved of funds and they were not allowed to raise the funds &mdash; not, I suggest, by an extra charge on the domestic sector but by a charge on the non-domestic sector.  There are many big companies using the facilities of this city &mdash; road, water and so on &mdash; who are not contributing proportionately. <Col N="2597" />  If Deputy Burke had been more innovative in this area we would not have so many potholes.</P>
    <P>I compliment the library services in this city because they have been providing a very good, loyal and worthwhile service throughout the years.  I am particularly pleased they have extended their services into the area of art lending, tape and record lending and so on.  Those facilities should be extended throughout the country because they have proved to be very worthwhile services in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous traffic problem in this city and the local authorities are trying to overcome it.  Given the increase in the number of vehicles used &mdash; many families have two and three cars &mdash; no matter what sorts of roads we built we will always have traffic problems unless people are encouraged not to bring their cars into the city or we ban cars from the city altogether.  If we take either of those steps we must be able to provide a very good public transport service which must include an underground service.  I am not talking about something that could be provided overnight, but in the long-term, there are plans for an underground connection between the main railway stations.  The Minister should ask the local authorities to give this priority and he should encourage them, through the new transport authority, to make innovations.</P>
    <P>Will it be possible during the Christmas period to ban unnecessary car traffic in the city centre in order to encourage greater use of public services and provide people with easy entry to and exit from the city?  This would have a spin-off effect in that it would encourage more business in the centre of the city, which has been dying off, and it would also encourage people to go to the centre of the city and save it from decay.  That could be done without any great additional expenditure.  It should be tried during the Christmas period because we are all aware that it is impossible to move in a car in the centre of the city at that time.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment and I look forward to working closely with him.  I congratulate him on the early <Col N="2598" /> introduction of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>Many people are inclined to put the blame for the cutback in the services of local authorities in recent years on the shoulders of Deputy Burke, the former Minister for the Environment, but I do not think he was responsible.  In my view, Deputy Burke would have made a good Minister but he was not long enough in the post to prove his worth.  I worked with him for many years on a local authority and he was very dedicated.  He was deeply concerned while he was Minister for the Environment.  I was pleased when he was appointed.  I do not say that he ran away from his responsibilities but his party did in that the former Taoiseach did not keep his head and called an election, which was not in fact due until next year.</P>

      <P>There may be, but I do not think the Deputy's party would welcome <Col N="2599" /> it.  I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and I wish him well.  He served his time in a local authority and is aware of the problems that confront those bodies.  Were it not for local authorities I do not think there would be any need for a Department of the Environment.  I have no doubt that the new Minister, Deputy Creed, will have every sympathy for the problems of local authorities.  They will get a sympathetic hearing from him as they will get from the Minister, Deputy Barry.  One of the first decisions taken by the Government last June was to rescue the housing situation by allocating an additional £30 million to that area.  However, even that allocation is not sufficient and local authorities will still be short of money.  That amounted to a considerable amount of money to come out of an empty purse and many of those on local authority housing lists are deeply grateful to the Government for making that allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a report in one of this morning's newspapers under the heading, &ldquo;Housing horror for unmarried mothers&rdquo;.  I made an effort to contact the society mentioned, St. Anne's Adoption Society, Cork, about it, but I was unsuccessful.  I am sure there was no harm meant in the report but it seemed to indicate that the problem referred to was a national one.  I hope it was meant to convey that the problem was confined to the Cork area.  The report stated that a total of 210 pregnant girls, 26 under the age of 17 years, sought help from St. Anne's Adoption Society last year, an increase of more than 30 per cent on the previous year.  The report went on to state that unmarried mothers were never a priority on the public housing list and that in the present financial crisis they would get a very poor hearing from the housing authority.  I should like to refute that statement as far as the Dublin local authority is concerned.  We have given unmarried mothers and deserted wives priority on our housing lists.  I do not have the exact figures but I am aware that about 18 months ago in one area of Dublin county out of 19 two-bedroom <Col N="2600" /> units 13 of those went to unmarried mothers.  Shortly afterward there was another allocation of eight two-bedroom units, all of which went to unmarried mothers, deserted wives or single parent families.  That is the category in which we have place unmarried mothers in our housing priority lists in the county; they are coupled with the deserted wife with one child and the single parent family.  It is only right that the record be kept straight.  Very many people will have taken that to be a national report rather than a Cork one.  I hope it will be corrected because it is unfair to members of Dublin County Council.  Indeed that is not the only area in which we have been first.  I am sure other local authorities have followed our example.</P>
    <P>I have just been given more detailed figures than those I have already given the House.  For the 12 months up to November there were housed by Dublin County Council 22 deserted wives, 11 separated wives and 24 unmarried mothers, giving a total of 37 in that category.  That is a fair achievement.  If these figures were published it would give a different impression from that given by this report.  I accept the report.  Unfortunately I have not had an opportunity of checking with the society.  However it was a great pity that it should have been publicised in the newspapers and on radio this morning and would go across to the general public as being a national position when it is far from being that.</P>
    <P>There is a grave situation obtaining in local authorities throughout the country simply because &mdash; as the Minister said in his remarks this morning &mdash; the Estimates sought for this year were not met by the previous Government.  I believe this was a deliberate act on the part of the former Government, very likely on instructions from the then Taoiseach, because he knew then there would be an election and to meet the full Estimates would have meant that the Minister for Finance would have had to impose even heavier taxes in the January budget. Of course that would have left them in an unfavourable position politically in an election year.  This is probably the reason also that we have had so few contributions <Col N="2601" /> from the other side of the House this afternoon.  Many local authorities now have their workers on a three-day week.  We in Dublin County Council, in co-operation with the manager, have made desperate efforts to ensure that there will be no lay-offs or unemployment in the Dublin county area.  Indeed I congratulate the manager on his efforts in this regard to date because, despite a shortage of cash, he has been able to maintain the workforce in the county.  I would ask the Minister to examine the workforce situation in all local authorities.  I do not know what is the position in his own area.  I know of several local authorities who now have staff, particularly road staff, on a three-day week.  But what happens then?  They draw social welfare for the remainder, so it is the State which is paying anyway.  Perhaps the Minister would examine this situation and if necessary have funds transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to ensure that men are kept at work in local authorities.  Goodness knows everybody inside and outside this House knows that local authorities are now operating at great disadvantage and if their work is discontinued then we shall all be the sufferers.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Mitchell referred to the potholes in our roads.  He contended that they were there simply because there was an insufficient allocation of funds.</P>

      <P>In my opening remarks I said that a considerable proportion of this Estimate was foreseen in the January 1981 budget.  Accusations were made by Deputies Raphael Burke and Moore about the Government's handling of the problem.  I would remind those Deputies that the Government have been in office for just four months.  It would be impossible to resolve the problem overnight or in the time already at the disposal of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard housing as a most important area and hope that as many resources as possible will be diverted towards improving the difficult housing situation obtaining throughout the country.  There is no way anybody can wave a magic wand to provide the necessary finance for the solution of this problem.  We have had a housing problem for many years and &mdash; I want to be honest in this respect &mdash; when we go to the country in about four years time I hope I will be in a position to say that a considerable amount of work has been done in this area but the problem will not have been resolved altogether.  But for the supplementary budget introduced here allocating millions of pounds to local authorities their work would have come to a standstill through lack of capital investment which should have been provided for them in the January 1981 budget.  The supplementary budget of approximately £15 million, again devoted to resolving the housing situation, is a clear indication of where this Government stand in relation to this problem at present.  Deputy Moore contended that he could not understand why the Government would not and could not make all the necessary money available to resolve this problem. One would think, hearing some of the points made by Deputies Raphael Burke and Moore, that it was their first term in <Col N="2603" /> this House and not that Deputy Burke has been a Minister of State and then Minister for the Environment latterly. This situation was inherited by the present Government, and every effort is being made to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I accept that a considerable amount of work remains to be done in the housing area.  My priority, particularly in relation to parents of young children living in appalling situations, mobile homes and so on, would be to endeavour to make finance available, because that is the area of responsibility with which I am now charged.  I shall try to make sufficient finance available to at least effect an improvement in this situation.</P>

      <P>On the information available to my Department it is not possible to say whether or not the person concerned satisfied the qualifying conditions for receipt of a free television licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs E. Desmond) Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs E. Desmond)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 23 September 1978.  Payment was disallowed after 7 March 1981 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was not incapable of work. Following her appeal against the disallowance of benefit she was again examined by a different medical referee who considered her to be incapable of work. <Col N="2576" /> Payment of benefit was, accordingly, restored from 9 March and all disability benefit due, less refund to the health board of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, has been paid to 21 November 1981.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment was due to the fact that the claimant has been engaged in part-time employment since May 1980 and it was necessary to investigate the nature of this employment before payment could be restored.</P>
