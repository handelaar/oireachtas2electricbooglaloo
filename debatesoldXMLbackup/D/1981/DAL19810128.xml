      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that it was not.  I have been in this House for 11 years and in all of that period it has been the constant practice to ask if the Taoiseach will make a statement on a matter of public importance and it is for him to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, or that he will consider it, or that it can be discussed by the Whips.  To have this ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle is something new and without precedent.  I think you are exceeding your rights in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Perhaps I might make a short submission to the Chair.  There is a long established precedent in the House whereby Members of the Opposition may ask the Taoiseach to make time available for a statement on matters of national importance.  Whether or not that is in accordance with Standing Orders, it cannot be denied that it is in accordance with precedent.  As I understand it, Deputy Cluskey is now asking the Taoiseach if he will comment on this matter of national importance.  This is a matter of fundamental principle.  If Deputy Cluskey is not proceeding with it now, I should not like to have a precedent established that Deputies are precluded from asking the Taoiseach to comment on matters like this.  The Chair should look up the precedent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the reason I am not pursuing it now is to try to avoid any conflict with the Chair.  I am respectfully asking the Chair to consider the importance of this whole matter.  I will raise it again tomorrow morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Chair between now and tomorrow morning to have examined the number of occasions on which this has happened and been allowed over the past ten years.  If he gives us that information tomorrow morning we will make up our minds.  That is a reasonable request.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Title>Malicious Injuries Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the <Col N="272" /> Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I welcomed the opportunity of discussing this Bill and I made three points of substance which I should like to summarise briefly now.</P>
      <P>The most important of these points related to the legal cost of bringing a malicious injuries claim to the courts for a judicial decision.  It has been the practice in the courts that costs are allowed with the case.  In these circumstances, if a local authority lose a case, they must bear the cost.  Under this Bill there is no provision whereby a local authority may be recouped in respect of such costs.  That is an inherent weakness in this legislation. I accept that the excess of 20p in the £ which must be paid by any local authority can be recouped from the Minister for the Environment.  That is essential.  It is a reflection of inflation and also of the increasing burden on local authorities because of malicious injuries cases.  However, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill in respect of this vital question of legal costs.</P>
      <P>The Bill should favour the local authorities in a situation in which they consider that a case should be contested in court but there is a disincentive so far as they are concerned in terms of taking a case to court.  I am talking about major cases. Minor cases can be dealt with easily and at relatively little expense.  We should endeavour in this legislation to give every support to local authorities to contest in court any case which they consider should be contested.  I hope I have laboured the point sufficiently for the Minister to take note of and that he will refer to it in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point relates to the question of the minimum damage in respect of malicious injuries cases.  In this context I consider the £100 stipulation to be somewhat on the high side.  It may be a relatively small amount of money to some people but relatively large to others.  In the case of the latter, it is hardly fair that they should be debarred from claiming malicious injuries damages in cases in which the damage is not to the extent of <Col N="273" /> £100 but which may be of the order of £60 or £80.  If, for instance, a person is the victim of vandalism by reason of having his car windscreen or headlamps broken during the night, the damage is likely to be of the order of almost £100 and to some people that represents a week's wages.  Consequently, it is extremely unfair that provision is not being made for the claiming of malicious injuries damages in such cases.</P>
    <P>The other point I made relates to the lack of support on our part so far as the District Court is concerned.  The district justices deserve every praise for the work they are doing.  They are supported in their work by the District Court clerks and indeed by the Garda Síochána who are the people on the ground and who have the responsibility for ensuring that law and order is maintained.  By providing for the consideration by the District Court of claims to the extent of £2,500 we are adding to the burden that rests with the district justices though we are not making any extra special financial provision for that extra burden.</P>
    <P>A short while ago I was speaking with a District Court clerk who indicated to me that the burden of administrative work on the District Court staffs is very heavy.  The jurisdiction of the District Court has been increased recently and we are increasing it further in this Bill.  If we are to ensure that the courts are adequately and efficiently staffed we must make the necessary financial provision. This, also, is a point that the Minister should consider.</P>
    <P>We all know that during the seventies there was a serious increase in the level of vandalism in our society.  I am talking of wanton vandalism as distinct from the vandalism and violence that is perpetrated by subversives.  This phenonomen of increased vandalism is reflected in the writings of the decade just ended.  The situation may have been brought about by the effects of modern media, of the portrayal of violence on television and of the pornographic literature that is available freely.  However, this increased vandalism has become a serious problem. There has been the factor also of relatively higher levels of unemployment and <Col N="274" /> this, too, may have added to the rate of vandalism because people who cannot find employement very often have a grudge against society.  This is true especially of young people who may be under the impression that society has reneged on them.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are doing very good work in their endeavours to combat this sort of crime but their task is very difficult, particularly in the larger urban areas.  I have been impressed by the work of the juvenile liaison service, which has been of value to young people.  There is a need to enlarge that service and give it a greater backup than has been the case in the last few years.  If we are serious about being in close contact with very young people we have a duty to ensure that there is a close and friendly relationship between the Garda and the young people who go astray in our society.</P>
    <P>The level of vandalism is a cause for concern.  Citizens are entitled to the full protection of the courts in relation to their private property and the damage that can be done by vandalism.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to discuss the Bill and I hope the Minister will reply to the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill proposes to consolidate with amendments what is commonly called the malicious injuries code, that is the statutory basis for the payment out of rates of compensation for malicious damage to property.  Compensation out of rates for malicious injury to property is a totally out of date concept, especially as regards the motor car.  A case could be strongly made that insurance companies should be responsible.  If there is such a thing as malicious injuries and a concept that the State, in collecting taxes, has a responsibility to defend property or owners of property, it is nonsense in 1981 to say that it is a local charge.</P>
      <P>When this code was introduced 100 years ago there may have been some merit in saying that local people should see to it that local property was not damaged and, if it was, that they had a duty to pay for the damage through the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he would not enter into <Col N="275" /> a debate on the merits or demerits of the code.  He said that whatever its origins it must be recognised that many people do recognise it as having been a non-profit making and valuable system of communal insurance against malicious damage to property.  I never heard anyone defending that but it may be that many people do defend it.  Whatever merit there may have been in it years ago there is no merit in it now.  This should be a national charge and no portion of it should be levied on local rates.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in centres where big matches take place have all experienced one of the most common forms of malicious injury nowadays where damage is done to property.  This is most common in Dublin with people following football teams and travelling here for various reasons.  After the events, there are a number of claims against the local authority for malicious injuries.  This is not just confined to football matches. There are many other events that large groups of people attend.  It is not fair that people in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or wherever the event takes place should have to pay for the damage.  It seems unfair that this should be a local charge, as is proposed to be consolidated under the Bill, even though there is a limit in the section of the Bill that states that an amount over 20p in the £ will be refunded to the local authority by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 limits claims to cases where damage exceeds £100.  The 1836 Act limited it to £5.  There was a recommendation to increase it to £20 a few years ago and it is the present limit of £5 which is being increased to £100.  No matter what the size of the claim the first £100 will not be paid.  This figure is far too high.  In his opening contribution from this side of the House, before the recess, Deputy Keating said that the 1978 Garda review showed that a huge proportion of the claims were for relatively small sums of money.  I would venture to say that probably 70 per cent to 80 per cent of claims would fall between £1 and £100.  Many of these claims are made by people who are least well able to carry the effects of <Col N="276" /> vandalism on their property&mdash;the old person living alone whose door is kicked in or whose windows are smashed or whose garden gates have been stolen or knocked down or whose house has been ransacked and property taken.  Such a person would not be able to afford the loss of property or the cost of repairing damage done to it.</P>
    <P>The argument is made that such a ceiling would prevent frivolous claims being made against local authorities.  I am not sure that that is a valid argument.  There was a famous compensation case here which was settled about seven years ago for many hundreds of thousands of pounds following a big fire.  If the State accepted liability for protecting that property against malicious damage it has far more of a liability to accept responsibility for damage caused to the property of the poorest and least well off sections of the community.  I am speaking of widows and old people living alone in very remote areas.  It is becoming common for old age pensioners and others to have their property damaged, their goods stolen and so on.  If any of the claims is for £150 they will get only £50 compensation from the local authority when this Bill goes through rather than being compensated for anything over £5.  This is a serious defect in the Bill and the Minister should rethink his position on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is keeping in line with inflation and that it has not been increased for 80 years.  However that is not the argument.  The argument against increasing it and indeed for abolishing it, is that the Minister is automatically cutting out the vast bulk of claims from people who can least afford to pay for damage caused to their property.</P>
    <P>Section 8 extends the period of notice of intention to claim compensation from the present seven days to 14 days.  I have always taken the view that the date should run from the time the intended applicant becomes aware of the damage done to his property and not from the date the damage is done.  When people are away on holidays their property is most likely to be damaged.  Modern criminals keep an eye out for that kind of situation.  They wait until people are on <Col N="277" /> holidays and then ransack their houses. The people come back from holidays a fortnight or a month later and discover the damage.  Under the provisions of the Bill they cannot get compensation because they have not made the local authority aware within 14 days of the damage being done.  The Minister should reconsider the matter and ensure that the claim will be accepted providing the applicant makes a claim within 14 days of his becoming aware of the damage being done, not within 14 days of the actual damage being done.</P>
    <P>Section 12 allows the court to reduce the amount of compensation payable by as much as it thinks fit having regard to the general conduct of the applicant in the circumstances of the case.  I am not sure if there is a similar provision in any other legislation.  It seems extraordinary wording to put into any Bill that the judge can make a decision on the basis of the attitude of the applicant in the conduct of his case &mdash; presumably that means whether the applicant has taken adequate steps to protect his property.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick will refer to this matter also.  It might be prudent on the Minister's part to tighten up the section so that the grounds for a judgment being made on the conduct of the applicant will be more narrow than the provision in the section at present.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) sets out the circumstances in which compensation shall not be payable.  The provisions in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) appear to be all right.  Paragraph (d) refers to damage to an unauthorised structure under the Planning Acts or damage to a structure in respect of which specified notices have been served by the local authority.  I can see what the Minister has in mind here but I should like to know if the provision in paragraph (a) of this subsection means that local authorities can wash their hands of the matter if there is the slightest technical breach of the planning laws? Every public representative knows that there are unintentional breaches of the planning laws, although I accept that many breaches are intentional and I do not have any sympathy with the people <Col N="278" /> concerned in such cases.  I know of one instance where an extra door was put into a building for which planning permission was not granted.  The property in question, a warehouse, is worth about £60,000 or £70,000.  If it were damaged tonight by an arsonist, does that mean the local authority under this subsection could decide not to entertain a claim for malicious injuries?  I see what the Minister is trying to do but he should make a change here to ensure that there is a difference drawn between a technical breach of the planning laws and the deliberate flouting of the laws.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 13 has been incorporated in a Bill that came before the House before Christmas.  I wonder if more work is being thrown on the district courts?  Has the Minister had any discussion with district court clerks on the general organisation of the courts to see if they are capable of handling this extra work?  I appreciate what is being done but we must make sure there is adequate machinery to deal with it.  Will the Minister tell the House if there have been any arrangements to appoint district justices? I know this Government are not adverse from appointing people to jobs.  In this case I accept that the district courts have a much heavier burden of work and we must make sure the structure is adequate to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Section 16 states that a local authority may settle any claim brought against them.  While I disagree with the principle of the Bill, I accept that because the Government have a majority in this House the Second Stage will be passed. However, I welcome the provision in section 16 because there is no doubt that local authorities are capable of dealing with claims.  It is a long overdue vote of confidence in the competence of the staffs of local authorities.  However, subsection (2) needs some comment.  It states that a local authority may make a lodgment in court against a claim made and this principle can be recommended.  Nevertheless I think it would be simpler if instead of lodging the money in court the local authority would be empowered to make an open offer of settlement and if the applicant refused to accept it then such <Col N="279" /> an amount could be deemed to be the lodgment in court.  I think this would be a more efficient way of achieving the same result.  It would save time from the point of view of the local authority; it would keep the money where it properly belonged and it would also save a lot of paperwork in court.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the provision that allows the Minister to lift the threshold of the amount that can be refunded to a local authority.  It will be established in this Bill that the amount will be 20p in the £ on the rates and the Bill also states that a claim cannot be entertained if the amount is less than £100.  The Bill provides for the first time that the amounts may be varied after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance.  That should not be the case. Once this Bill is passed there is nothing to prevent a Minister for Finance who is short of money going to the Minister for the Environment and substituting a figure of £1,000 while deciding at the same time not to refund local authorities anything over £1 in the £ on the rates.  Any change in that regard should be discussed in this House.  At the moment local authorities have not got any money and the Minister is putting a very firm limit on the amount he is refunding to them. Any change would disimprove the services available to local communities.  It is my opinion that the two subsections dealing with these matters should be deleted. Every other piece of legislation that has figures of this kind written into it has to be debated in this House if there is a proposal to change the figures.  For example, if there is a change in the borrowing requirement of semi-State bodies, the Ministers concerned must bring the matter before the House.  For the first time we are giving power to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment to put charges on local authorities and to exclude a further category if they decide to do so.  I think this is wrong and that those two subsections should be deleted, that changes should be decided by the Oireachtas and not by two Ministers of any Government.  Once this <Col N="280" /> becomes law it will not be changed and it will find its way into other legislation. It will have a roll-on effect so that another Minister will come here in six months or three years and do exactly the same thing quoting as justification for doing so the precedent set in this Bill before us today.</P>

      <P>I can only describe the Bill as a half-hearted, lukewarm effort to improve the present situation which is highly unsatisfactory.  Vandalism has become a cancer in our society and it is high time to make a concerted effort to stop it or reduce its level.  If we pick up a provincial paper we can read lists of cases coming before district courts or local circuit courts claiming for malicious damage to the property of business people or private householders.  The efforts made to stop this type of thing &mdash; in some cases it is crime &mdash; are not coherent and logical.  An effort must be made to get at the root cause of this growing disease in society.  Has the Minister any solution?  Is legislation the answer?  I think it is not. We must bring in some measure to prevent the type of vandalism which is increasing year by year.  There is no provision in this Bill for any preventive measures. Indeed the public have accepted malicious damage as a way of life, as a matter of fact.  I think the public are entitled to be chided because the Garda are not getting the full co-operation of the people in many instances where the apprehension of wrong-doers is concerned. They look upon it as merely money out of public funds which is used to compensate the injured party.  That is not the point.  It shows a complete lack of civic spirit and if our society and our country are to thrive we must have the civic spirit and national pride so obviously lacking at present.  Can the Minister give us any hope that a positive effort will be made, not with mickeymouse legislation like this, to eliminate the root cause of the increase in vandalism? That is the way to tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not sufficient recreational facilities for young people.  Much of the time which should be devoted to meaningful recreation is spent in causing damage to other people's property.  The <Col N="281" /> notion has got abroad in this country, and it is merely another aspect of the permissive society which has spread from America to Europe and now to Ireland, that you may damage or destroy public or private property with impunity.  We must get rid of that notion and the only hope of doing so is to provide some meaningful, gainful outlets for young people. The attitude of mind by which people break, or wrench off car aerials, smash windows or do general damage such as tearing up flower gardens cannot be tolerated but it is being tolerated.  It must stop because that mental outlook is permeating our society.</P>
    <P>I note that in the district courts and circuit courts where such claims are made and almost invariably succeed, most often the wrong-doers are not apprehended. Apprehension of these wrong-doers must increase and the perpetrators of these crimes will have to be made an example of because this is a crime against society, a serious offence against other members of the public.  An example must be made of miscreants.  The half-hearted, half-baked efforts at present made in the application of the Probation Act in almost every case is not sufficient.  The time has come when those caught damaging public or private property maliciously should be compelled to make reparation to the community.  It is time to evolve a system whereby offenders would be compelled to carry out community work.  In most cases they plead that they have no money and cannot make reparation.  Let them do it in time, in work.  I should like to see schemes drawn up by the Minister's Department to ensure that these people are properly punished for their misdeeds.  We are not facing the reality of the situation which will become worse if it is not tackled.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have already made the point that the cost of malicious damage claims to local authorities is not adequately dealt with.  There is a ceiling of 20p in the pound.  The local authority cannot be asked to make any greater contribution and the balance will come from central funds.  There is a very important point which is not covered and I should like the Minister to indicate if he <Col N="282" /> would accept an amendment from my party or consider putting down an amendment himself to the effect that the cost incurred by a local authority in contesting a malicious damage claim which they lose should not fall on the local authority.  That cost can be considerable. Because of the restricted manner of financing local authorities nowadays they are not very well able to meet some of the prohibitive costs involved.</P>
    <P>Recently in County Waterford the county council contested a malicious damage claim concerning the burning down of a hotel in Tramore.  The circuit court awarded almost £1 million against them.  On appeal to the High Court that sum was reduced by almost half but at the end of the day, while the council were protected as regards the amount of the award because of the 20p in the pound limit, it was not protected against, or compensated for, the cost incurred in contesting the case in the Circuit Court or the High Court.  Because the case involved such a huge amount of money and a great number of experts giving their views on how the fire started along with other witnesses, the cost which the county council had to pay was something like £25,000.  There is no provision in the Bill or under present legislation whereby the local authority can get that form of aid from central funds and that is surely a major failing.  I would like the Minister to give us some hope that a ceiling will be put on the amount of costs which will be payable by a local authority.  That is a major loophole.  If a local authority had a number of major cases such as that in a year it would mean that other services for provision of water, housing repairs, refuse collection or repairs to roads would suffer grievously.  The amount of elbow room a local authority have, because of the financial restrictions due to the elimination of rates on houses, is so small that an imposition like this can affect seriously the running of their services. I would like the Minister to consider that point.  I make the point also that all malicious damages claims should be paid out of central funds and all the costs involved should be paid out of central funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> The insurance companies in this country should be made responsible for a major part of malicious damages to property. That is their major function in society. At the moment they are virtually immune to charges under the malicious injuries code and that should not be the case.  It should not fall back on the local authorities the whole time.  If you want to solve the problem, to reduce the amount of vandalism and malicious damages claims, you must bring it home to companies such as insurance companies and the public in general that it is up to them to tackle the problem and to cooperate with the Garda Síochána in preventing or detecting these crimes.  That message has not got through.  The State, the insurance companies and the public in general will have to wake up to the fact that this cancer is gnawing away at the very core of and undermining our society and cannot and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The malicious injuries code which this Bill proposes to amend extends back into practically the beginning of the last century.  We see here a number of Bills mentioned as dealing with it and the first is the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836, the next the Malicious Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1848 and then the Malicious Injuries (Ireland) Act, 1853.  I mention those three Acts to indicate how far back this code extends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The malicious injuries code, as I understand it, when it was introduced had a two-fold purpose.  First it was set up to compensate owners of property who had that property damaged maliciously and &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; was defined broadly speaking as a wanton or malicious act.  It was some act that was done by the wrongdoer intentionally either because he had malice against the owner of the property and wanted to damage him or it was done wantonly.  It was something that was not accidental.  It was done by a person who knew and appreciated what he was doing. That is a broad definition of the word &ldquo;malicious&rdquo;.  An accident had to be <Col N="284" /> excluded.  If there was no evidence as to how the damage was done but it could have been done accidentally as well as intentionally, then the applicant in the claim could not succeed.  Also it had to exclude damage by either a very young person who was so young as not to be able to appreciate what he was doing or a person of unsound mind.  That was the first object of the code, to compensate owners of property for damage caused to their property maliciously or by a wanton act.  The next object of the code was to prevent the commission of crime of this nature by punishing the community where the wrong was done, by punishing the community of ratepayers by extracting from them the cost of the damage done to the owner.  That, broadly speaking, represents the malicious injury code as I understand it.</P>
    <P>The fact that the damage was meant to be paid for locally can best be appreciated when I say that the respondents in a malicious injury claim were the local authority, the local county council where the damage was done, but if the damage was done adjacent to a county boundary &mdash; within a mile of it I think &mdash; then the neighbouring local authority was joined as well as the authority within which the damage was done.  That indicates to us that in those days if the damage was done near a county boundary the wrongdoer could have come across the county boundary.  That shows the parochial nature of the code and it shows also that in those days people did not travel very far and it was meant to cover only a very limited community: those who resided within the boundary of the local authority where the crime was committed or, if a crime was committed within a mile of another local authority, it was presumed that people could have travelled the mile and they were hauled in as well.  Of course the entire cost of the code was borne by the local authority concerned and by the local ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Obviously, this Bill proposes to deal with a very different situation.  Circumstances have changed dramatically. When this code was first introduced I suppose the bicycle did not exist, not even the penny-farthing bicycle.  People <Col N="285" /> travelled about on foot, by coach or on horseback.  Certainly the combustion engine did not exist and there were no motor cars.  That is all changed.  People can fly about from one part of the country to another within a few hours.  They are travelling distances of 20 or 30 miles in so many minutes or less.  Illegal organisations are at large in the country who travel about over a wide area as well.  The parochial nature of crime has disappeared completely and changed.  It is absolutely wrong that people near where a crime is committed should be punished to any extent by having to pay the cost of that crime because there is no guarantee or even likelihood any longer that the people who committed that crime are from the area.  Therefore, we think that the cost of malicious injuries should be made a national charge.</P>
    <P>For another reason also it should be made a national charge.  This Bill proposes to take away, to some extent at any rate, the element of malice necessary to succeed in a malicious injury claim.  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>It shall not be a defence to an application for compensation under this Act merely to show that the damage to which the application relates was caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child.</P>
    <P>Up to now, as I understand it, it was a defence in a malicious injury claim to show, for example, that a fire was started by a child under seven years of age because that child could not be guilty of malicious damage in that he or she was not responsible for his or her actions. That defence has now been taken away and the fact that the damage is caused by a child, however young or innocent, is grounds for a malicious injury claim. How can anybody say that it is sensible or reasonable to punish a local community for the act of a child?  How can one ask a local community to pay £50,000 or £100,000 compensation, with costs &mdash; that is what 20p in the £ on the rates will amount to in a lot of areas &mdash; for the act of a child?</P>
    <P>If the damage was caused by an unfortunate person of unsound mind, up to now, as I understand the law, no claim <Col N="286" /> lay.  It was impossible to succeed in a malicious injury claim if it was established that the damage was done by such a person because that person could not act in a malicious or wanton manner. That defence is being taken away.  It is unreasonable to punish a local community or people of a district electoral division for damage caused by such an unfortunate person.  Not wishing to compare the two but it would be just as illogical to ask ratepayers to compensate for the killing of sheep by dogs.  The logic and reasoning is the same.  It may be a good thing to consider including a provision in the Bill to cover damage by dogs to sheep because such animals are doing grave damage throughout the country.  Very often it is not impossible to identify the dogs responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have been braver and grappled with this problem in a more comprehensive manner.  The local element has gone because of modern methods of transport, but section 7 proposes to exclude to some extent malice from the proof of a malicious injury claim.  The Bill changes the whole code because we now have what one might call a contributory negligence clause introduced.  Malice has gone altogether.  Up to now if my car which was parked outside my house was damaged during the night I could claim compensation under the malicious injury code but now contributory negligence is being introduced under section 12.  That section states:</P>
    <P>12. &mdash;(1) In determining an application for compensation under this Act, the court may reduce the amount of the compensation it would otherwise award by such sum as it thinks just and equitable having regard to the general conduct, in the circumstances, of the person who suffered the damage or loss to which the application relates, including, in particular, his conduct as respects any precautions which might reasonably have been taken by him to avoid the damage or loss.</P>
    <P>In other words, a judge can say that it was unreasonable for me to leave my car outside my house at night and that I should have put my car in a garage. <Col N="287" /> Instead of granting me an award of £500, the cost of the repair of the damage, the judge could reduce the amount of the decree to £250.  Up to now it would have been sufficient for me to show that the damage was caused by some ruffian passing by my house at night.  If I left my kitchen door open when going to town and some of my property in my house was damaged while I was away, the judge may say I was negligent in leaving that door open and refuse to compensate me or decide to award me only a portion of my claim.  That is wrong.  I do not agree with that section.</P>
    <P>Under the old code the amount of the damage had to be at least £5 before a person could pursue a claim.  The intention was to eliminate trivial claims but in the event of a plaintiff succeeding in such a claim the award included the first £5 worth of damage.  However, under the Bill unless the amount of damage exceeds £100 one cannot bring a claim and in the event of a decree being granted by the court the first £100 is excluded.  That does not make sense and that proviso should be amended.  Subsection (2) of section 12 states:</P>
    <P>(2)  The court shall reduce by one hundred pounds the amount of the compensation it would, but for this subsection, award to an applicant for compensation under this Act, so however that no applicant may suffer such reduction in respect of more than one claim under this Act for the same property as a result of acts occurring during any period of twelve months.</P>
    <P>When I glanced at that provision first I did not know what it meant but it appears to me that, irrespective of the extent of the damage, a plaintiff will not be compensated for the first £100.</P>
    <P>VAT should be excluded.  I do not mind a limit being put on the amount below which compensation will not be paid but when that limit is exceeded the injured person should be compensated for all the damage.  I see a proviso here enabling local authorities to settle these claims and if the code continues to be operated that is a good thing.  I always <Col N="288" /> thought it ridiculous that local authorities, even when malice and damage were sticking out a mile, had to go through the nonsense of contesting claims and adding to the cost of compensation awarded. The Minister &mdash; I presume the Minister for Justice &mdash; is taking the right to fix solicitors' costs and barristers' fees, which is wrong.  Why should the Minister fix these costs and fees when there are several statutory committees already in existence for that purpose?  I am no longer a practising solicitor so it does not affect me but it is wrong that this should be introduced into the code when we have various statutory bodies with judges, solicitors, the Minister's nominee and the Fair Prices Commission and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputies Collins and Deasy made a very good point, apparently from their experience in County Waterford.  Section 19 provides that where the cost to a local authority of compensation under the Act exceeds the produce of a rate of 20p in the £ the excess shall be refunded or recouped by the State, in the person of the Minister for the Environment. Apparently that means that while compensation will be refunded the costs will not.  A substantial claim running into many thousands &mdash; and perhaps £1 million as happened in this city &mdash; which could happen in any rural county at present would be contested in the Circuit Court with expert witnesses, senior and junior counsel on both sides, with very substantial costs and expenses.  There may even be an appeal to the High Court, resulting in a very heavy cost indeed.  It is right, in the interests of the ratepayers, that the issue should be contested but, under the Bill as drafted &mdash; and I shall certainly be tabling an amendment on this &mdash; while the Minister for the Environment would be obliged to refund the compensation in excess of the produce of 20p in the £, he would not be obliged to refund the costs involved by the local authorities, which could be very substantial, and that is wrong.</P>
    <P>There was an excellent case at any time on the grounds which I have argued, firstly, the change in methods of travelling and the loss of the parochial element <Col N="289" /> and, secondly, the departure from the malicious element, that the cost of malicious injury claims should be shifted from the local authorities to the Exchequer. However, with the new change in financing of local authorities, there is an unanswerable case.  I have been trying to work out what 20p in the £ amounts to.  I knew what it was in old currency but it could, without any trouble, cost a local authority far in excess of £50,000 and we shall take that figure.  An unexpected claim for £50,000 could upset the financing of a local authority, especially when local authorities are now prevented from budgeting for it.  They are simply compelled to accept such percentages as the Minister for the Environment lays down.</P>
    <P>I can put it on the record of this House that I am a member of a regional development organisation which commissioned a water survey for three counties &mdash; Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  The survey was a very useful exercise in deciding where there was sufficient water for industrial and domestic use and, having regard to the Government's stand at the moment on working on the infrastructure and being ready to take off when the recess is over, it was a very worthwhile exercise.  Unfortunately, when the consultants had bored six bore holes and when there were still two or three bore holes to be completed, they ran out of money.  It would have taken another £20,000 to complete the survey, but it had to be dropped last year.  Cavan, Monaghan and Louth between them, after scraping the barrel, could not raise the £20,000 to complete the survey.  The Minister was a member of a county council himself.  The regional development organisation asked the consultants to have another look at the project to see if there was any way of getting this extra money even on tick, by promising to pay next year, so that the job could be completed, but the £20,000 could not be raised by the three county councils.  The survey had to be terminated when three-quarters completed.  I am merely bringing that point out to indicate how a claim for £50,000 &mdash; and it could be more than that, with legal costs on top of it, which could be £50,000 on their own if <Col N="290" /> the claim were big enough &mdash; would upset the financing of a county council enormously and would mean, perhaps, laying off more men as has happened this year. I am arguing very strongly and with reason that the entire costs of this code should be changed from the local authorities to the Exchequer.  I take it that the Minister does not seriously argue that the payment of these claims from local funds in any way prevents the claims, I do not think it does and that cannot any longer be seriously argued as the element of malice and the parochial element are gone.  Therefore I cannot see the sense in continuing it.</P>
    <P>For some reason or another, jewellery or articles of personal ornament are excluded.  They include a watch, for instance.  How can a watch be described as an article of personal ornament any more than a suit.  A watch could be worth £200 and some ruffian could break in and smash it.  I can agree that money should be excluded in the same way as it is from many insurance claims, but I cannot see why a watch, which could be of considerable value, should be excluded.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is only tinkering with the problem.  For a start, the cost of these claims should be shifted entirely from local to central government.  Circumstances have changed utterly since the malicious injuries code was introduced. Nowadays there is no local element in crime: it is a travelling operation. Other Deputies have shown the absurdity of operating the malicious injuries code on a local or parochial basis. Yesterday Deputies pointed out, for instance, that if you had a trainload of football enthusiasts &mdash; we will call them them that for want of a better word &mdash; from Dublin to Cork for a match and they wrecked the train at Portloaise, the people of County Laois would have to pay the compensation.  That does not make sense.  It is a striking example of what could happen.</P>
    <P>The next reason I have given for changing this from a local to a national charge is that malice is no longer a necessary ingredient, if one refers to section 7.  Section 12 seems to change the whole nature of the code.  At the moment, it is not <Col N="291" /> possible for local authorities to raise funds locally.  They are not permitted by the Minister to levy the amount on the rates.  If they budget for their ordinary expenditure during a given year and there is a claim for £100,000, or 20p on the rates, the Minister will chop it and tell them they can increase the rates by only 10 or 11 per cent.  That will prevent local authorities from raising the amount of compensation in the way the Bill is directing them to do.</P>
    <P>I will be putting down some amendments, particularly in regard to the watch.  For the moment I will content myself by saying that I am against some of the proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that all legislation should be overhauled and up-dated and it is fair to say that whoever attempts such an operation will not satisfy everyone.  Some aspects of this Bill are welcome and I will preface my remarks by saying something about malicious damage in general.  The greatest victims are local authorities themselves. It seems to be a trait of our times to commit wanton damage to property, and I instance the graffiti we see on walls of public buildings at a time when we are better educated than ever before.</P>
      <P>When I was growing up, only a few had post-primary education, but this problem of defacement and other damage to public property hardly existed.  Now we have the terrible problem of young people going out deliberately to wreck and deface public property.  I do not know what the answer is.  It could be more Garda serveillance but the gardaí cannot be everywhere at once.  Perhaps it has something to do with education.</P>
      <P>This wanton destruction of public property is a thing you do not notice among our counterparts in the Common Market.  In capital cities abroad you do not have this vandalism demonstrated by graffiti.  We should cop ourselves on in this regard.  It is a big weakness in us when we resort wholesale to this type of damage which costs everybody a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick a few moments ago referred to the inability of local authorities to raise money to pay for this damage. Ultimately it is John Citizen, the taxpayer, who has to pay for all this damage, whether it is done to local authority or Department of Posts and Telegraphs property.  One should look at telephone kiosks throughout the country.  One would think people have some sort of hatred for the telephone service.  They hack the kiosks to bits.  Whoever is responsible for legislation to conserve and to protect our little country has one hell of a job.  As spokeman for tourism, this wanton damage bugs me particularly. I am being reminded of it constantly by letters from constituents.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to injuries to the individual or damage to his property.  In the old days if a haybarn was set on fire the cost would be no more than £200.  Now it is counted in tens of thousands of pounds.  There was such damage in my area recently, it looked like a job of vandals, but even in the biggest council area in the country we cannot face up to these bills.  Local authority money has been cut to the bone because of the virtual abolition of rates and if we are to pay for such damage it must be out of the Central Fund and it must be designated and budgeted for properly.  We are put to the pin of our collars to get by on our estimates, we have to cut back substantially on our services and we cannot come up with the money to pay huge bills we had not bargained for.  There should be some kind of national insurance policy to help to meet such bills.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the malicious aspect has been removed and this is a very important point.  It has in the past been very difficult to prove that damage caused was malicious.  People have approached insurance companies and been told to make a malicious injury claim, but having gone through this lengthy process they have been told that the damage was not malicious and that they should make an insurance claim. The position now is that the local authorities can deal with these matters, and they <Col N="293" /> are competent to do so because they are experienced in dealing with compensation of many kinds for the acquisition of land and so on.  This will certainly cut the cost to the State and it is right that such matters should not be hauled unnecessarily before the courts.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers regarding marauding dogs.  If there is one thing that will wipe out the Irish sheep industry it is the problem of these marauders, not price levels or costs.  I should like to see included in this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems that a person who suffers merely £100 worth of damage must pay that sum himself.  If that interpretation is correct.  I would strongly oppose it.  It is damage of this type which is all too prevalent.  For instance, some careless person may walk through a car park carrying a sharp instrument and scratch every car, causing about £100 worth of damage to each vehicle.  The person whose property is so damaged is entitled to compensation.  People must park their cars in public places and they <Col N="294" /> pay the corporation for permission to do so.  Perhaps we could extend the role of the traffic wardens by giving them some responsibility with regard to these vehicles because a person who pays for parking should be protected, even to the extent of damage costing only £10.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to prove that there has not been contributory negligence.  A person who parks his car outside his own house may be told that he should not have done so or, in the case of damage to his house, he may be told that he should not have left a bedroom window open. The part of section 12 dealing with contributory negligence should be completely omitted.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there should be more emphasis at school level on respect for private and public property.  There must be something wrong with us as a nation that our record in this respect is so bad.  Wanton damage is caused to cars, particularly if they are new and expensive.  It is reprehensible and stiffer penalties should be introduced for those caught in the act. The taxpayer cannot afford to pay for the damage being perpetrated throughout the country and I cannot comprehend how we can be so unchristian as to damage the property of our neighbour or of the State.  The cost of this damage should be met from a central fund and the bill for a single year would make the taxpayer aware of the huge extent of the damage being cause by irresponsible people who deface our beautiful country.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of very good material in this Bill and certain sections are welcome and desirable.  If I had to tackle the malicious injury situation I would approach it from a different viewpoint than the Minister and from that mentioned by everyone else.  I would approach it from the point of view of the Criminal Injuries Tribunal.  If possible I would have all these claims heard by the tribunal.  Proof would be submitted in writing and then rejected or passed.  The applicant would have the right to appeal to the Circuit Court.  If the local authority or the Department of Finance were dissatisfied, they also could appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from experience that when <Col N="295" /> applications are made for malicious injuries there have been considerable delays in obtaining compensation and repayment of expenses incurred.  In many cases when these people got their cheques they found they had suffered a loss.  That is wrong.  These people had to go to the Circuit Court, perhaps had their cases adjourned not just one day for three or four days, Garda witnesses had to travel long distances to prove malice and so on and the applicant had to travel and incur very heavy expenses.  All this has made the malicious injuries code appear archaic and, in many cases, silly.</P>
    <P>If a bomb blast injuries somebody, or if somebody is seriously injured because of a stabbing or something like that, he applies to the Criminal Injuries Tribunal for compensation.  In many cases written submissions, affidavits, medical reports, reports from the Garda and so on are sent to Dublin and there is a very strict time limit.  I know of cases where cheques were received by applicants within six to 12 months.  There were few problems and very little expense involved.  This is a very highly desirable system and I am putting it to the Minister today because it has not been mentioned by anybody else.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed this has not been investigated by the Minister or his Department.  The present malicious injuries code needs a drastic overhaul.  If I ever had the power to overhaul that code I would do it in the manner outlined above because it would be expeditious, economic and satisfactory.  For what they are worth those are my views and I ask the Minister and his advisers to consider them.</P>
    <P>I am totally against the levying of claims for malicious injuries on local authorities.  This system should be scrapped.  At present a very limited number of people have to meet these claims because householders no longer pay rates.  This burden has fallen on a limited number of farmers and the business community. Because the number of people who pay rates is limited it is undesirable that rates should be increased to pay malicious injuries damages.  These claims should be charges on central funds.  This <Col N="296" /> would be a much more desirable and satisfactory approach.</P>
    <P>I would continue to use the services of the Garda to carry out investigations.  To avoid unnecessary travelling expenses for engineers, architects and so on I would ask local authorities to continue their investigation work.  I am sure their personnel would be very happy to oblige.  As I said, local authorities should not be responsible for paying these claims but they could investigate them.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 people in certain localities will no longer be responsible for the payment of malicious injuries.  Up to now the people in one small townland could be held responsible for paying malicious injuries claims &mdash; for example, damage to a haybarn costing £5,000 or more.  It can be in the form of a shed burnt down and machinery inside being malicious damaged.  It could run into £100,000.  People in a townland, who may number no more than 100 and are ratepayers, would have to pay the compensation. This is distinct from levying the rate on the whole county.  Normally, the order by a judge is that the decree will be levied on the county at large but I have seen instances where a particular townland has been responsible.  This appears to be amended in the Bill by section 11. I am glad to see that item being changed, because even at present there are claims being made whereby people in certain townlands have been levied with specific decrees, which is very unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make section 11 retrospective to a year or two because I have seen a case in a townland where a decree was going to be levied on the townland.  I consider it a grave injustice, where perhaps five farmers in a townland may be levied with a very sizeable decree. That is wrong and should be rectified.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 5, I am disappointed to see that, where the aggregate amount which exceeds £100 is maliciously caused to property, the person who suffers damage shall be entitled to compensation. The Minister should leave that figure at a maximum of £10.  A number of people have had their windscreens broken by stones and it costs £70 or £80 to have them repaired.  It now appears as if <Col N="297" /> they will no longer be able to claim for amounts under £100.  It is a strain on a working man to find £60 or £70 for a new windscreen.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the District Court will be playing a far more positive role in regard to malicious injuries.  Up to now, all the actions have been in the Circuit Court.  The District Court will play a very important part and will help to expedite the hearing of a lot of claims.  It will simplify them also and they will be dealt with far more expeditiously.  I welcome this innovation because, for far too long, this was a matter for the Circuit Court alone and they sat only once a quarter and on occasions on a half-yearly basis. It has meant that claims have been outstanding for a long time, over periods of years instead of months.  Normally, the District Court sits monthly which means that the cases can be heard on a far more regular basis.  I congratulate the Minister on this innovation.  Overall, the bringing in of the District Court will improve this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Up to now, there have been far too many delays and this will, to some extent, expedite matters.  I am not sure if it will expedite them sufficiently but it will improve them to a large extent.  While I am opposed to the particular method of collecting decrees by imposing them on the farming community and the business community &mdash; they should come from a central fund &mdash; the Bill itself contains a lot of welcome innovations and I am happy with most of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputies for their contributions. Deputy Keating criticised the Bill on the grounds that it did not attempt to deal with crime or proposed ways to reduce the incidence of crime.  This is not the purpose of the Bill.  As will be seen from its long title, it is to amend and consolidate the law relating to compensation for malicious damage to property.  The purpose of the Bill is described in some detail in the first two paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the text of the Bill.  The Bill is not concerned with the criminal law in general nor with suppression of crime.  It is to do with the reform and updating of the code of law going back to 1836, under which compensation may be paid by order of the courts to those persons whose property is maliciously damaged.  That is its only purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further suggestions were made that it should provide for the creation of recreational outlets and the operation of new schemes and so on.  This is not the purpose of the Bill.  The Deputy also mentioned the desirability of providing that the financial limits in the Bill could be updated periodically, in line with inflation, without the necessity of having to bring legislation before the House.  In this connection, perhaps there was an oversight on Deputy Keating's part, because there is provision in section 25 of the Bill to enable the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary by order the threshold figure of £100, which appears in a number of places in the Bill. Deputy Keating also made a similar suggestion in relation to the provision in section 13(1)(a) limiting the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Bill to <Col N="299" /> cases where the amount claimed does not exceed £2,500.  In the course of the recent debate on the Courts Bill 1980, the same question also arose.  A suggestion was made that the monetary jurisdiction limits of the lower courts should be linked to the consumer price index and the changes should be made in those limits by ministerial order, rather than by Act of the Oireachtas.  As the Minister for Justice said, when this matter came up in relation to the Courts Bill, such a suggestion was considered inappropriate for two reasons, namely, (1) the inherent importance of the issue which would justify the full attention of Parliament itself acting through its legislative process and (2) the special constitutional position of the courts which arguably make it inappropriate in principle that Parliament should seek to delegate to any other authority the right or power to determine the level of jurisdiction of the particular courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating also referred to the inflated claims for compensation and claimants being pressurised into settling for too low a figure.  I agree that many claims are for inflated amounts but I am satisfied that the local authorities recognise this and do, in fact, contest the amount of such claims, employing expert consultants to give evidence in complicated cases.  Section 8 requires a claimant to serve a preliminary notice on a local authority within 14 days of the occurrence. This will enable the local authority staff to carry out an early inspection of any damage done.  Examination of decrees granted by the courts in malicious injury cases indicates that the amount awarded is usually much less than the amount claimed, which I think shows that both the local authorities and the courts are concerned to avoid unwarranted expenditure on compensation for malicious damage.</P>
    <P>Taking a somewhat different line the Deputy also expressed concern at the empowering of local authorities to settle claims out of court, as is proposed in the Bill, that would result in injustice because claimants might be pressurised by local authorities into settling at too low a figure. <Col N="300" /> I do not believe there is any danger of this happening.  The claimant will always have the option of having the matter determined by the court.  In some instances at present what might be described as a modified system of settlement operates.  In these cases the claimant and the local authority agree on a figure to settle the claim but the case must still go before the court so that a decree may be given for the agreed amount. When this happens the claimant must wait a considerable time before receiving payment.  This is because under the present statutory provisions the amount must be included in the local authority estimate and the award is not payable until the rate has been levied and collected. Under the new system in the settling of claims out of court there will be no such delay.</P>
    <P>A further suggestion of Deputy Keating's was that interest be paid if payment of compensation is delayed.  If it should happen that a successful claimant has to wait an unduly long time for payment of the compensation he should be entitled to be paid interest on the award.  I would point out that under the present law interest is not payable on malicious injury awards even though delays in payment are inevitable because of the present statutory requirement that payment may not be made until provision is made therefor in the rate that is next struck after the court award.  I am confident that the two proposals for amendment of the law embodied in this Bill, namely, the provision in section 16 enabling claims to be settled out of court and the provision in section 11 enabling compensation to be paid out of local authorities' funds, will substantially overcome the problem of delays in payment.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside it would be wrong to regard awards of compensation for malicious injuries as being on all-fours with judgment debts.  In ordinary civil proceedings where the plaintiff is awarded damages the respondent is a wrongdoer in that he has caused injury to the plaintiff in some way, by breaking a contract, by his negligences or whatever. In such cases the law provides that interest on the judgment is payable by the <Col N="301" /> respondent in the event of delay.  An entirely different situation obtains for malicious injuries compensation.  In those proceedings the local authority is the respondent who is, as it were, standing in for the wrongdoer, the person who actually caused the malicious damage. The local authority has been given this role in the interests of the community and it is not necessary, nor would it be in the interests of the community, to deal with local authorities in malicious injuries legislation as if they were no different from respondents in ordinary proceedings for damages.  It is for this reason that the Bill makes no provision for any change in the present law on this matter of the non-payment of interest on awards of compensation for malicious damage.</P>
    <P>I might mention that in another respect also the Bill, like the present law, differentiates between court awards of compensation for malicious damage on the one hand and court decrees in ordinary civil proceedings on the other.  This difference of treatment will be seen in section 5 (4) of the Bill which prohibits the award of compensation for consequential loss for which damages may be awarded in ordinary civil cases.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, Deputy Keating being the first, also expressed doubts about the provision in section 7 of the Bill which states that it shall not be a defence to an application for compensation under this Act merely to show that the damage to which the application relates was caused by a person of unsound mind or by a child.  He acknowledged that the purpose of the provision is to ensure that a person whose property is damaged does not lose the chance of getting compensation merely because the person who caused the damage was of unsound mind or was a child.  However, the Deputy went on to suggest that the provision involved a contradiction and seemed to imply that on a test case might not stand up.  The provision has effect solely in relation to this Bill &mdash; it has no wider purpose or effects.  I would point out that under section 5 (2) the meaning of the word &ldquo;malice&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill differs from its everyday meaning. Similarly, under the present code <Col N="302" />&ldquo;malice&rdquo;, as judicially interpreted, has not its everyday meaning.  I am satisfied that the provision is sound having regard, of course, to the fact that heretofore a child under seven years of age could not be considered to be capable of malice and indeed the proof would have to be there between the ages of seven and 14. I hold that what we are trying to achieve in this Bill is that malice is not a necessary ingredient or essential prerequisite insofar as the compensation claimed could be paid.</P>
    <P>There was a reference by Deputy Keating to section 12 (3) (d), which provides that compensation shall not be payable in respect of damage to a structure which contravenes the Planning Acts.  He instanced a case where, for example, a person inherits a property that contravenes these Acts but is not to blame for the contravention.  He suggested that the provision should not apply in such a case. Apart from the obvious consideration that hard cases made bad law, to modify the provision on these lines would weaken it and provide loopholes for evasion.  The Deputy seemed to think that the 14-day limit on the service of a preliminary notice under section 8(1) could not be extended and pointed out that in certain cases this could lead to injustice.  I should perhaps say that this is a preliminary notice of intention to claim only.  The actual application to the court for compensation is provided for under section 9.  I would point out that section 14 (3) provides for an extension of the 14 day limit at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies, including Deputies Keating, Tully and, I think, Kelly commented on the proposal in section 22 (1) to have a three-year period within which proceedings for compensation must be commenced.  It was suggested that a three-year period was too short.  As we all know, under the present law it is six years.  The interdepartmental committee on malicious injuries recommended that the period be reduced to three years.  A local authority is in a special position <i>vis-á-vis</i> claims in that they have no control over and possibly no knowledge of the property in respect of which a claim is being made and they <Col N="303" /> could be placed in a very difficult position in defending a case taken towards the end of the present six-year period.  In Northern Ireland the period within which a claim must be made is four months with provision for an extension of up to 12 months.  It is to be noted that the proposed three-year period can be extended at the discretion of the court under section 14 (3).</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies also mentioned situations in which malicious damage is caused in one local authority area by persons from another local authority area.  The Bill provides that in these situations it is the local authority in whose area the damage was caused which is to be proceeded against, section 8 (2) (a), but it must be noted that the local authority can secure, under section 10 (1), the joinder of another local authority or authorities in proceedings and it would be open to the court to order that any compensation awarded shall be paid either in whole or in part by local authorities that are to be so joined.  Similarly, in the case of damage to property &mdash; for example, a motor car or a boat &mdash; which, having been unlawfully taken, is removed from one local authority area to another, the claim for compensation under section 8 (2) (b) will be made against the local authority from which the property was removed.  That local authority may secure the joinder of any other local authority or authorities in the proceedings and they need not be contiguous authorities.  So it is quite possible that it would be the local authority in whose area the offenders reside who would be ordered by the court to pay the compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 7, which deals with damage caused by persons of unsound mind or by children, was mentioned in a number of contributions.  I believe I am correct in saying that Deputy Kelly viewed it as an improvement on the present position whereas Deputy Tully viewed it with some misgivings.  The position under the existing law is that compensation is excluded where it is shown that the damage was caused by persons of unsound mind and I have referred to this in relation <Col N="304" /> to Deputy Keating's contribution but in view of the fact that Deputy Kelly spoke at such length I will refer to it again.  So far as children are concerned &mdash; and in this context we are talking about children under 14 &mdash; whether the damage caused can be compensated for under the present malicious injuries code depends on the circumstances, including the age of the child.  Under the criminal law a child under seven years of age is incapable of the <i>mens rea</i> necessary for a crime and therefore is incapable of committing a malicious act for which malicious damage compensation would be payable. Under the general criminal law children between the ages of seven and 14 are presumed not to have criminal capacity but this presumption may be rebutted by strong evidence of a mischievous disposition. Where a child of seven to 14 years causes damage to property the decision as to whether malicious damage compensation is payable under the present code depends on the circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provision under section 7, which is a new provision and is to the effect that it will not be a defence to an application for compensation merely to show that the damage to which the application relates was caused by a person of unsound mind or a child, is a good provision.  I think it will be generally accepted that where property is damaged by a person of unsound mind or by a child the owner of the property should not be deprived of the opportunity of securing compensation on those grounds.  I should point out that the effect of this section will not be to make the action of a person of unsound mind or a child causing the damage criminal for the purposes of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe raised the question of the situation which arises where the person causing malicious damage is identified and convicted and the right of the owner of the property to secure compensation in those circumstances.  The present law on the matter is not altogether clear but it is generally held that the effect of section 139 of the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act of 1836 is that where an injury is done to property for which the applicant <Col N="305" /> is entitled to claim compensation from the local authority, under the malicious injuries code he is prevented from suing the wrongdoer in a common law action for damages.  However, under the present law a person whose property is maliciously damaged is not prevented from obtaining compensation in a case where the wrongdoer is known and the Bill does not propose to change the position in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and some other Deputies suggested that the threshold figure of £100 proposed in section 5 is too high and could result in hardship for some people.  Under the present law damage must exceed £5 before compensation is payable.  This figure of £5 was fixed in 1898.  The 1963 interdepartmental committee on malicious injuries recommended a figure of £20.  When adjusted by reference to the consumer price index, £20 in mid-November 1963 would be equivalent to £104.61 in mid-August of 1980.  From that it will be seen that the figure of £100 proposed in the Bill does not even keep step with the decline in money values.</P>
    <P>Deputies Collins, Keating and Kelly suggested that it would be desirable if, in the calculation of the amount of the refund that the local authority may be entitled to receive from the Minister for the Environment under section 19, account were taken of the local authority expenses, legal or otherwise, in defending proceedings for compensation under the Bill in the courts.  I shall certainly look into this matter and will carefully consider the views expressed by the Deputies with other Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the financial responsibility for malicious injuries compensation. As I explained in the Second Stage speech, the involvement of local authorities in the administration of the malicious injuries code is vital.  They have the expertise, professional staff and so on to process claims and to contest them in court.  A centralised organisation could not hope to do the job as efficiently or as economically and the financial responsibility of ratepayers for malicious injuries compensation has been reduced or eliminated <Col N="306" /> in recent years.  In 1974 a non-statutory arrangement was introduced whereby if in any financial year the cost of compensation to a local authority exceeds the produce of a rate of 20p in the £ the excess is refunded to the local authority from the Exchequer.  Section 19 of the Bill proposes to put this arrangement on a statutory basis and of course the threshold gives the Minister an opportunity to raise or lower and in most instances it would be considered that the best reaction would be the lowering of the threshold from 20p to 19p to account for factors that might arise from time to time.  Since 1978 occupiers of domestic and certain other properties have been granted full relief from payment of rates and in fact 60 per cent of all rates in the country are now borne by the State.  That in itself reflects the transfer or switch of responsibility to central Government and the Exchequer in this regard.  Should it be decided at any time in the future that the financial liabilities of local authorities should be further reduced or effectively eliminated this can be brought about by order as provided for in section 19.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also raised the question of the doubtful constitutionality of the provisions requiring compensation to be paid for by local rates on the grounds that this might be held to discriminate against the ratepayers concerned or that it might impose a penal obligation on them.  First of all, I would dispute that the payment out of rates for malicious damage compensation is penal at all.  Many socially desirable local services are paid for out of rates and the extent of local funding is related to the extent of local demand and many people who avail of services in this country today avail of the services in so far as the taxpayers or ratepayers, who might not necessarily benefit under the services themselves, are prepared to contribute to those services in the social interest.  Consequently if a malicious act is perpetrated against society we must accept the fact that the injury or damage done to an individual in our community should quite rightly be protected by a service that would operate under a malicious injury Act.  In this situation it is intended that the providing of compensation <Col N="307" /> for somebody who has suffered loss or damage can be best done by the community even though they themselves would be at some minimal loss.  But that loss would be in the social interest and for that reason Deputy Kelly's point of being doubtful about the constitutionality of the provisions requiring compensation is not valid.  Also, any objection on such grounds as there may have been to the existing law can scarcely apply to any practical extent to the provisions of the Bill for two reasons: the Bill abolishes the local levy concept so that any payment out of the rates will be from the county at large, and the Bill gives statutory effect to the arrangement whereby any liability of local authorities for compensation requiring a rate of more than 20p in the £ is being assumed by the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also referred to the phrase &ldquo;unlawfully and riotously or tumultously assembled together&rdquo;.  He questioned again the doubtful implications that the use of the phrase or these words might have in the proposed Bill. This phrase is well known to the law and has always been traditionally interpreted and I would refer the Deputy to pages 36 and 37 of Kennedy and MacWilliam's book on criminal injuries.  I take the view that it would be unwise to introduce change for change's sake since to do so could lead to doubts and give rise to further litigation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry and other Deputies referred to the question of items of jewellery &mdash; watches specifically &mdash; and coins, money and stamps.  They said that watches should not have been excluded. One of the reasons that these items have been excluded is that there is a likelihood of temptation existing for people to try to get compensation fraudulently for these items because it is difficult not because of their value but because of their smallness to establish whether the damage actually occurred at a particular time or indeed at the time that the claim for compensation is connected with.  He also referred to the question of contributory negligence and the question of reasonable care.  If it is established that part of the responsibility for the damage done lies with them or <Col N="308" /> that they in some way contributed towards the damage, it would be unfair for the community to have to bear the loss of compensation.  It must be presumed that a person has an obligation to take reasonable care.  It is not an unseemly presumption when it is a person taking care of his property.  Anybody who through negligence shows a lack of responsibility should be obliged to suffer some reduction in compensation and where the negligence is deemed to be a total contributing factor the person must be presumed to have no entitlement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the recoupment of local authorities and said that the Bill should favour local authorities more. Section 15 includes a provision for recoupment to local authorities and the threshold can be moved downwards by the Minister if he so desires.  Where claims fail it is up to the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to decide whether he will deal with the costs.  Other Departments are involved.  I would certainly have that aspect carefully considered after consultation with the Ministers involved.  The court can and may award costs to local authorities if the claimant's case fails.  If a claimant's case is a bona fide case it is usual for the court to make no order for the costs and that means that the local authority must pay their own costs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the planning laws, as did other Deputies, and he referred to a technical breach of the planning laws and gave an instance where a door was not erected in accordance with the planning permission granted and said that in that situation the person suffering the damage might be disallowed compensation on the basis that the planning requirements had not been met.  We must satisfy ourselves that our planning laws are an essential part of planning and development.  To provide legislation which would afford an opportunity to people who would have suffered a loss although that loss while it was genuinely suffered was connected with an unauthorised development or building which contravened all the planning laws, to receive compensation would not be fair to the people at large or to the Government. <Col N="309" /> One envisages a situation where the planning Acts invoked might not continue to be there when the accident occurred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry also raised the point about the courts not being able to handle the increased workload.  The Deputy referred to the provision for the settlement of claims and to the ability of the District Court to cope with the increased workload.  Deputies O'Keeffe and Collins raised the question of whether the District Court would be able to deal with the extra work under this Bill.  This arose in a more general context under the Courts Bill now before the House which proposes widespread increased jurisdiction in the District Court.  Replying to the Second Stage debate on the matter on 18 November last at column 619 the Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>Allied to the physical accommodation question, of course, is the question of how best to organise the use of the accommodation available and of court time.  In anticipation of the enactment of the legislation now before the House my Department have been considering ways and means of improving the organisation of the District Court in order that it may be in a position to cope with the increased jurisdiction which will be conferred on it.  Already plans are well advanced for the enlargement of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court district in order to provide for greater flexibility in the disposal of District Court business in Dublin city and county.  Plans are also well advanced for the reorganisation of a number of provincial District Court districts in order to relieve pressure on some justices.</P>
    <P>My Department will consult closely with the President of the District Court, the justices, the local legal profession and the Garda to see what further improvements can be made. Deputy Enright's suggestion that different days be set aside in each District Court area for the hearing of the different categories of business coming before the court and his other suggestions for the more expeditious disposal of court business will be borne in mind <Col N="310" /> when the administrative arrangements necessary to implement the new jurisdictions are being made.  The various interests concerned will, of course, be consulted.</P>
    <P>Provision has not been made in this Bill for additional judges of the Circuit Court or justices of the District Court to take account of any increased workload falling on these courts as a result of the jurisdiction proposals as it is difficult at this stage to forecast the extent of the increase.</P>
    <P>At the levels of litigation prevailing at present, the only certainly is that the workload of the District Court would increase, justifying the appointment of some additional justices and court staff, and that the work of the High Court will be reduced.  As far as the Circuit Court is concerned, however, and still assuming the present level of demand on court time, it appears that any new work falling on the court as a result of the increase in the contract and tort jurisdictions would, at the least, be offset by the District Court taking over the Circuit Court's existing caseload in its entirety.</P>
    <P>However, it must be emphasised that the direct result of the proposals must be to reduce the overall workloads of all the courts since they involve a transfer of cases from courts of considerable procedural complexity to courts of comparatively simple procedures. The real uncertainty in estimating future demand on court time arises from the successful outcome of the proposals in terms of access to justice &mdash; in other words, the greater ease with which legal action may be taken as a result both of the provisions of this Bill and of the civil legal aid scheme.  I am sure that many Deputies will be aware of instances where difficulties might have been resolved by recourse to the courts but for the inconvenience or costs of taking such action.  It is impossible to quantify the number of such cases which as a result of this Bill will now come before the courts.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant, therefore, to make provision for an increase in the number of the Judiciary until such time as the <Col N="311" /> scale of the increase can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</P>
    <P>That should allay any doubts or fears in the minds of well-intentioned Deputies who have contributed to this debate this morning.  The Minister for Justice is quite committed to ensuring that if any difficulties arise, either physical difficulties in relation to the provision of accommodation or improved accommodation on the one hand, or in relation to the improvement of existing accommodation, or in relation to the examining of the situation as it develops increased numbers in the Judiciary will be provided once it is established that they can be suitably deployed in the best interests of the court services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the first £100 being excluded.  Section 12 (2) deals with that.  This section is a new provision which provides for the reduction or exclusion of compensation in certain cases.  In Northern Ireland Article 10 of The Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 is a somewhat similar provision. Section 34 (2) (d) of the Civil Liability Act 1961, deems a plaintiff's failure to exercise reasonable care in the protection of his property to be a contributory negligence in an action for the conversion of the property.  Section 26 (2) of the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964 relates to the return to the owner of stolen property which was pawned, such return being with or without payment by him to the pawnbroker of whole or part of the loan, regard being had to any failure on the part of the owner to protect his property.  Section 9 of the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act 1923 provides that an applicant shall be wholly disentitled to compensation if he connived at, assisted in and so forth the causing of the damage or was associated with its perpetrators or was connected with a subversive organisation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that compensation shall not be awarded in respect of the first £100 of a claim.  However so that no applicant may suffer a reduction in respect of more than one claim for the same property as a result of acts occurring during any period of twelve months, <Col N="312" /> article 10 (7) of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) order 1977 contains a similar provision, which also provides for a reduction of £100.  This provision is in line with the practice followed by insurance companies. In the absence of such a provision a person who suffers a loss amounting to £99 would not be entitled to any compensation. That can be seen in section 5 (1) whereas a person who suffers a loss amounting to £100 would be entitled to full compensation.  A line has to be drawn somewhere in this connection.  If one relates the £5 which has existed to £100 in mid-August 1980, to inflation and the changing value of the currency, it is the equivalent of £104.  We are a little step ahead of the £5 if one takes it in association with the value of the currency changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the point is that if the damage is malicious and if there is a loss it is not so very important whether it is £5, £100 or £1,000?  A sum of £100 could be very important to some people. If the damage is malicious and it is shown to be malicious why should there be any bar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied that it has worked successfully.  We have reduced it by giving the figure of £100.  I take the Deputy's non-acceptance of the point.  I must make the point as I understand it to be valid.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also referred to the question of the child and the person of unsound mind.  He stated that it was unreasonable that provision should be made in this Bill where a presumption would exist that a person under seven or a person between seven and 14 years might, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have criminal responsibility.  There is no criminal responsibility in the sense that we know or understand it.  We are simply providing in the Bill an opportunity to protect people from serious and extraordinary losses that could have occurred from the act of a child who would not be capable, in the first instance, of maliciousness and, on the other hand, would not have criminal responsibility as we know it over the age <Col N="313" /> of 14, so far as young persons are concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also referred to the fact that malice could not exist.  The Bill does not provide for the existence of malice in the case of a child or a person of unsound mind.  He equated the situation with one where worrying dogs were killing or damaging sheep and said that that should be provided for in this Bill as did another Deputy who spoke after him. First of all, the equation is a bad one and, secondly, the question of extending maliciouseness to animals for the purpose of the Bill could be described as nothing less than a little bit silly.  I do not think Deputy Fitzpatrick meant that it should be included.  I believe it was an afterthought by him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>A vicious dog, yes, but not a malicious one.  A number of Deputies mentioned section 12 of the Bill in relation to the reduction or exclusion of people and the question of reasonable precaution.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also mentioned section 15 and asked why should the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, regulate the scales and costs of solicitors and fees of counsel where the costs are payable by local authorities.  At present these scales of costs and fees are prescribed by the Rules of Court which are made by the Court Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  I will give the reasons for this.  The second part of subsection (1) provides that subject to the exceptions stated the Rules of Court in relation to the costs will apply to proceedings under the Bill when enacted. The only Rules of Court relating to costs that would not apply are those actually prescribed in the scales of solicitors' costs and the fees of counsel which would be applicable.  Costs are normally payable by a local authority where the applicant is awarded compensation by the court. Subsection 2 empowers the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations prescribing the actual amounts of items of solicitors' costs and counsel fees that will <Col N="314" /> apply.</P>
      <P>This provision is new.  At present in legal proceedings under the malicious injuries code scales of solicitors' costs and fees of counsel as between party and party are prescribed in Rules of Court made by the Circuit Court Rules Committee with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.  This subsection provides that in future the scales of solicitors' costs and the fees of counsel that will be applicable, where the costs of an applicant for compensation are payable by a local authority, will be prescribed as regulations to be made by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>An applicant's costs are normally payable by the local authority where the court finds in his favour and awards him a sum in compensation for the malicious damage.  At the end of the subsection, it is provided that the power of any rule-making committee to make rules of court shall be limited accordingly, that is, that the rule-making committee will no longer have power to prescribe the scales of costs and fees which, under the subsection, are henceforth to be prescribed in ministerial regulations.  It should be noted that the costs to be prescribed by the ministerial regulations are party-and-party costs and not solicitor and client costs.  This is a fundamental difference.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I should like to refer to the fact that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, gave full relief in relation to the payment of rates in respect of domestic property, including secondary schools, community halls and farm buildings.  From 1978 on, rating authorities have continued to strike the rate annually, but the rating authorities are compensated for the rates due on the property mentioned by a grant from the Exchequer.  Other properties on which rates are due, business premises and so on, are therefore unaffected by the scheme of relief, and occupiers continue to pay their usual share of total rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning reference was made to malicious damage to schools, places of resort, places of recreational ammenity, <Col N="315" /> and so on.  The fact that some of these properties, community halls and secondary schools, have been derated shows clearly that the Exchequer has taken over responsibility for the payment of rates on these properties.  Responsibility for 60 per cent of the rates is now vested in central government.  The lowering of the threshold in certain situations indicates the direction in which the Government are going in connection with compensation under the Malicious Injuries Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to charges on rates in respect of malicious injuries I want to give some statistics to the House.  In 1949-50 the total charge on the rates for County Councils and Borough Councils was £24,729.  In 1979 the total charge for both authorities was £5,067,495.  This reflects what I said in my Second Stage speech.  The increase in criminality is something we all regret but it is a justifiable reason for ensuring the provision of a proper and adequate system of malicious injuries compensation for people who are injured or who suffer damage or loss in our society.</P>

      <P>This is a fundamental section.  Before I deal with it, I should like to ask the Minister a basic question which will affect the manner in which I will be contributing to this discussion.  Is the Minister flexible in this area?  Is it possible that he will introduce changes arising out of what I or Deputy Horgan might suggest?  I do not want to waste time.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I always wish to have a flexible answer for the Deputy.  The reference to sexual intercourse in subsection (2) relates to natural intercourse as construed in the 1861 Act mentioned in the subsection and is deemed to be complete on penetration.  It is not considered that the definition of rape should be changed, or should be extended to include the other forms of sexual assault which have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief case for such an extension.  One is concerned primarily not with the semantics of the issue but with the varying penalties which apply.  I should like to see the definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; broadened to include other acts of sexual assault which are tantamount to rape in their psychological and physical effects.  Arguably the only difference is possibly that rape as we understand it, and as now legally defined, may give rise to pregnancy.  Assaults with weapons of various kinds such as bottles and the other tragic paraphernalia which people who are sexually perverted employ cannot and do not.  There is a group of people for whom such assaults are perhaps more serious than the crime of rape which is a most repugnant crime to any civilised people and which needs to be dealt with very firmly, in that it makes a savage assault on the most intimate parts of a person's dignity and physical being.  Instead of facilitating people in evading the rigour of the law in this respect I should like to see a situation whereby those who would indulge in the kind of attack we are talking of could be charged with the crime of rape.  It is not unique that legislation could be so interpreted. Among the material I collected by way of preparation for this Bill is a copy of legislation from the Australian Parliament.  In this legislation the definition of rape includes a number of the permutations that have been referred to. It would not be necessary to change the Bill before us to include these permutations. What is at issue is the provision in <Col N="317" /> section 1 (2) where references to sexual intercourse are construed in a certain way.  The words &ldquo;sexual intercourse&rdquo; can be interpreted in a variety of ways.  In this Australian Act, sexual intercourse includes the introduction of the penis of one person into the anus of another or into the mouth of another.  These travesties should be open to being defined as rape.  The same should apply to such travesties as assaults with bottles or broom handles, for instance, in the context in which we are speaking.</P>
      <P>The problem is that a much more lenient attitude is adopted in relation to these other but equally serious types of assaults.  Added to that is the possibility which has been argued by some women's groups, though not particularly in this country, that the more there may appear to be a censure of the crime of rape by way of severe sentences, there may arise a situation in which there are attempts to avoid rape as we understand it, that is, sexual intercourse in the normal way but against the consent of the party involved, but to engage in so-called indecent assault which carries lesser sentences. Therefore, I would argue strongly that the Minister should have regard to international experience with a view to amending the definition of rape which is very narrow and traditional and is not necessarily what is needed now when, unfortunately, there are various forms of sexual assault of a kind that most of us are abashed even to talk about.</P>
      <P>The legislation does not meet that need but we have an obligation to women and to society as a whole to ensure that they are protected.  Some of the figures that I have for these types of assault are horrific. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the definition of rape and to consider the possibility of broadening that definition to include the travesties I have in mind.  Failing that, we should ensure that the sentences which apply in these other areas are of equal severity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that a system of long sentences is the best way of dealing with these offences but assuming for the moment that this is so, we should ensure that a person who attacks another sexually <Col N="318" /> with an instrument of the kind to which I have referred and, in so doing, inflicts serious injury, both psychological and physical, is as guilty as is somebody found guilty of the crime of rape as we understand that crime.  Just as the crime is of equal severity with the crime of rape, the sentence should be equally severe.  It is likely that the factors which give rise to the criminality involved are the same in both cases.  It is a question of one crime being accepted as being serious but the other being accepted as being serious also but to a lesser degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make on this section.  The first relates to subsection (2).  The key words in this subsection are the words &ldquo;natural intercourse&rdquo;.  I am presuming that natural intercourse in the context of the Bill is the type of intercourse from which pregnancy might result but at this level this Bill is not about pregnancy or about the possibility or the probability of pregnancy.  It is a Bill which, among other things, is about the crime of rape which may or may not involve the possibility of pregnancy but which in its fundamental aspect is a violation through force or through threat of force of the bodily integrity of a woman, usually by a man. I consider it secondary as to what part of the body has been violated or indeed as to the nature of the instrument that may be used in such violation so long as the motivation is predominantly sexual and that the violation takes place under the threat of force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the problem can be resolved.  My opinion is that the dividing lines that are drawn in this Bill as between one kind of offence and another are not nearly as clear as the law would wish them to be and that the law by trying to make distinctions in regard to the mind of a person committing the crime or to the mind of the victim of the crime, may have no substance whatever and is an attempt to split hairs.  It might be possible to amend the subsection by including the words &ldquo;or unnatural&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo;.  This begs the question of what is natural and of what is unnatural but the case made by many concerned individuals <Col N="319" /> for widening the definition might be met by extending the definition of rape to include many acts which are intended as rape by the people who perpetrate them and which are experienced as rape by the victims.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to consider widening the subsection in this way between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The other point relates to the first part of the definition section which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a rape offence&rdquo; means any of the following, namely, rape, attempted rape, aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring rape or attempted rape, and incitement to rape</P>
    <P>In relation to the aiding and abetting clause, can the Minister tell us where there is included, for example, the concealment or withholding of information after the rape by people who may have reason to know that rape has taken place? Normally I would imagine that in criminal terms, certainly in relation to murder, people can be accused of being accessories after the fact.  I am wondering whether there is this provision also in relation to rape within the terms of the definition section.</P>
    <P>In general one would hope that this would be the case but there may be problems, too, in this regard.  For example, it may be the case that a man who has committed a rape is unable to conceal that information from his wife but that his wife is either unable or is terrified to inform the authorities of what has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government deeply regret the decision of the Irish Rugby Football Union to accept a South African invitation for a rugby tour in South Africa in May 1981.  As I indicated in my statement on 3 January, the Government are gravely concerned about the proposed <Col N="321" /> tour which, if it takes place, will be seen in South Africa and in many other countries as evidence of a lack of concern about the evil of apartheid and the dangerous situation in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude towards the proposed tour has been expressed on a number of occasions.  In my reply to a question on this subject on 10 December, I indicated that I had met with representatives of the executive committee of the IRFU and that I had expressed to them the Government's concern about, and opposition to, the proposed tour.  This meeting took place in my office on 21 November and resulted from a letter which I sent to the president of the IRFU on 14 October inviting him and members of his executive committee to discuss the issue with me.  The IRFU delegation comprised, in addition to the president, the two vice-presidents, the two Irish representatives on the International Rugby Football Board and the secretary of the organisation &mdash; a total of seven.  At the meeting, which was a lengthy one, I was informed that no decision had yet been taken and that the IRFU were in the process of consulting their membership on the issue.</P>
    <P>The IRFU announced their decision on 2 January.  In addition to the condemnation of the tour by the Government it has been opposed by all the political parties represented here, by prominent Church leaders, by trade union leaders and by many other bodies.  It has also given rise to expressions of concern internationally and has been raised both at the United Nations and in the European Parliament. African countries, too, have already demonstrated the concern that they feel about this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government have, of course, taken steps to make clear their opposition to the tour.  The Minister for Sport has informed the IRFU that their application for grant-aid cannot be approved so long as their present policy on sporting contacts with South Africa is maintained. Special leave will not be granted to any State employee who may be selected for the Irish team.</P>
    <P>I am giving further consideration to the <Col N="322" /> possibilities for any additional action that may be needed to make clear the Government's concern on this issue, including the possibility of a further approach to the IRFU.  As I indicated in my statement on 3 January, the Government recognise and value the contribution that rugby football makes to Irish life and society and do not wish to interfere with the independence of sporting bodies in Ireland.  I sincerely hope that the IRFU will now reconsider the issue in the light of the serious reaction that it has provoked.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question from Deputy Browne about the trade implications of the proposed tour, I have already taken steps to ensure that the Governments of African States with which we have diplomatic relations have been kept informed of the Government's attitude. The Government's position has been clearly expressed also at the United Nations, and my statement of 3 January is being circulated as an official document of the UN Special Committee against Apartheid.  I hope that as a result of the action I have taken other countries will be in no doubt as to the Government's position and will recognise that the tour, if it goes ahead, is contrary to public policy in Ireland in relation to sporting contacts with South Africa.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question from Deputy Quinn relating to the services provided by the honorary consul in Johannesburg, these services are entirely of a consular nature and are the minimum necessary to meet the needs of Irish citizens in South Africa, some of whom are engaged in work of a missionary or humanitarian nature.  They in no way imply the existence of diplomatic relations with the South African Government.  I do not, therefore, intend to take action of the kind suggested.  I will, however, continue to use every appropriate opportunity to put forward, at the United Nations and in other fora, the Government's strong opposition to South Africa's apartheid policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I speak for everyone in the House, properly within the terms of order, when I congratulate the <Col N="323" /> Minister on the action he has taken to date.  It has the full support of everyone in the House and I hope it has the support of the IRFU.  If the IRFU do not bow to the democratic wishes of the majority of Irish people does the Minister think he is in a position to take further action to try to convince them of the Government's opposition and, arising out of that, would he propose formally to meet the council of the IRFU yet again to express to them the damage that would be done to this country and to human interests in South Africa if the tour goes ahead?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Quinn in congratulating the Minister on his unequivocal answer.  I should like to make two constructive suggesions to the Minister which may be helpful to him.  The first is, would it be possible for him to consult with the Congress of Trade Unions and ask the unions to make it impossible for the team to fly to South Africa by refusing to carry them in our aircraft or to go by any other means? Secondly, would the Minister consider, if all else fails and as a last resort, holding a referendum in order to convince these people that they only represent themselves and to make it clear that they do not represent the Irish people in taking a decision to go to this country where there is the disgraceful situation of apartheid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a matter that would be appropriate to a referendum.  All three political parties have made their views known.  We are the parties representing the people and that stance is sufficient to indicate our moral attitude as the Irish people's representative parliament.  As far as the other point is concerned, while I share the abhorrence expressed by congress in regard to apartheid, I do not think it would be appropriate for the Government to suggest to the trade union movement particular lines of action which lie within <Col N="324" /> the province of decision-making by the trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating the Minister on the vigour and determination with which he has pursued this issue with the full support of all parties in the House.  Has the Minister considered communicating our position not merely to the African States with which we have diplomatic relations which are, unfortunately, politically few but to the others also through their ambassadors at the UN or by direct contact because of the danger of misunderstandings.  I should like to add, for the Minister's information, that my own contacts with Ministers in the other continents has shown that sometimes they have quite incorrect perceptions of Irish attitudes.  They are always glad to be told what our position is.  I urge the Minister to consider extending the range of diplomatic action lest misunderstandings in the states with which we do not have diplomatic relations should have unfortunate repercussions for us.  I agree with the Minister's decision with regard to the honorary consul whose work in helping Irish citizens in trouble, including one person who was in jail for a number of years because of his activities against the regime there, is beyond praise.  Without the work of the honorary consul people like the person I mentioned would be in very great difficulties.</P>

Anything I can do in regard to widening and strengthening information about the Government's attitude in this respect will be done in the countries concerned, those of black Africa and the Arab world.  I will be in touch with the Deputy about this matter. I am conscious of what he says about the dangers of this tour being misrepresented. They may not be fully aware of the democratic distinction that exists in our society between a representative rugby team and the Government of the country.  That is the important point we are anxious to get across.</P>

      <P>We cannot underestimate the extent of misunderstandings.  I recall meeting the Foreign Minister of a very important African state who was convinced that the IRA was our army and that we sent them across the Border but that they were disowned for the purposes of propaganda.  That Minister was pleasantly surprised to learn the contrary. He was willing to tell all his friends this great news of which he was quite unaware.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if he is in a position to confirm newspaper reports to the effect that Government Ministers will not attend domestic IRFU functions &mdash; I refer to the home internationals &mdash; and if he can further tell us &mdash; the Minister for Justice is present and he may be in a position to help &mdash; whether the Garda band or the Army band will be withdrawn from the IRFU as a mark of our disproval?</P>

      <P>The International Development Strategy for the Third United <Col N="326" /> Nations Development Decade, the 1980s, was adopted at the 35th Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly in December 1980.  The strategy calls on developed countries which have not yet reached the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance to exert their best efforts to reach it by 1985 and in any event not later than in the second half of the decade.  The strategy also recommends that the target of 1 per cent should be reached as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>During the formal adoption of the new International Development Strategy the Irish delegation, on my instructions, made the following statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland have accepted the 0.7 per cent aid target and intend to reach it as soon as possible, although it may not be feasible for them to do so within the specified time-frames.  Although it is the Government's intention to increase ODA in the years ahead, it is not possible at the present stage for the Irish Government to envisage a commitment as regards the 1 per cent target&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This statement was made because, in the present world economic situation, it is difficult to say how rapidly it will be possible for Ireland to progress towards the 0.7 per cent target.</P>

      <P>A similar sort of reservation with regard to the whole question of development aid under the European Community was made by the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1974.  A similar reservation was entered into in regard to the possibility of not being able to implement certain time-framed objectives. In April 1974 the Government entered a reservation in the minutes of <Col N="327" /> the Council of Ministers Development of the European Communities to the effect that Ireland could not hope to attain the target in that decade because of Ireland's state of economic development and given the different income between Ireland and other member states and the industrialised countries generally.  This is consistent.</P>

What is different at home and abroad that enables the Minister to promise one thing and deliver it at home and to promise but not deliver it internationally?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obvious answer but I will not get into an argument with the Deputy about it.  The national understanding is concerned with a short span of time in which commitments can be made &mdash; the Deputy will see that picture shortly &mdash; but we are talking about international commitments over a long time span.  We are talking about 1985 and 1990.  In that situation surely it was sensible and practical on our part to enter a reservation?</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister think it necessary to mislead the House by halting the quotation when he did?  I have the original, in my own handwriting, of what I said at the meeting of the Council of Ministers and the Minister ought to know, and will recollect, that it goes on to say that given the difficulties of achieving the target for the period we would, in <Col N="329" /> fact, increase our share of GNP by .05 per cent per annum.  That is to say that each year the ODA would be increased by .05 per cent of that year's GNP.  That formula was adhered to by us with the exception of one year, 1976 &mdash; we tried to catch up thereafter &mdash; and I should like to know why the Minister suppressed that.  That formula applied to the ten years of the eighties would bring us to our present figure of 0.2 to 0.7 per cent and we would not have had to enter the reservation.  It looks as if the Minister is going back on the commitment I entered into on behalf of the Government in 1974 as well as misleading the House by giving a wrong statement of what he said in the UN.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's assertion that there has been a lack of progress in the area of mutual recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications in member states of the EEC. As the Deputy may be aware, a total of seventy-eight directives have been proposed and adopted to facilitate the practice of economic activities and of professions which are governed by or subject to training conditions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 July 1980 the Government decided that a number of <Col N="333" /> new shipbuilding orders should be placed with Verolme Cork Dockyard&mdash;a fisheries research vessel by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, two new-design naval vessels by the Minister for Defence and a bulk carrier by Irish Shipping Ltd. The placing of these orders was subject to the satisfactory negotiation of contract terms and delivery dates.  It was envisaged that these new orders would provide work for the yard up to 1983.</P>
      <P>Letters of intent were issued by the Departments of Fisheries and Forestry and Defence on 10 December 1980 in respect of the placing of contracts for the fisheries research vessel and the naval vessels.

      <P>In order to allow Irish Shipping to acquire the bulk carrier at a price related to a fair world market price, a substantial subsidy will have to be paid by the State. Significant subsidies are also inherent in the prices to be paid for the other vessels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>Because of excess production capacity, grant assistance for the bread-baking sector has been discontinued by the Industrial Development Authority since 1974 except in respect of cases involving group rationalisation or restructuring.  Grant assistance for the flour confectionery sector has also been suspended by the authority since the beginning of 1980 pending the outcome of a review aimed at determining whether there is excess production capacity in this sector.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that the applicant in question first contacted them in November 1979 but that a formal application for grant assistance was not received from him until 4 July 1980.  The review of the flour confectionery sector is still in progress but the applicant has been informed that if, as a result of the review, it is decided to resume grants to the sector, his application in so far as it relates to that sector will be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that people have been and are being turned away from the legal aid centres recently set up by the <Col N="341" /> Government; if he proposes to allocate more staff to them; and if he will make a statement on the future of these centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the present the Legal Aid Board have opened seven centres, of which two are in Dublin.  I have been informed by the board that there is no problem in dealing immediately with all applications for legal aid received at the five law centres located outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>As regards Dublin, a very heavy demand for services was experienced as soon as the centres opened last August. This was undoubtedly due in part to the backlog of cases awaiting the introduction of the scheme and it created teething problems for the centres which became quite difficult late last year.  The position has improved since then and, as I shall explain in a moment, a further improvement may be expected very shortly.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the present position in the centres is that all cases which are considered urgent by the board's solicitors can be and are dealt with immediately. Non-urgent cases in one centre are given appointments to see a solicitor within seven days while such cases in the other centre are asked to call back or telephone in two weeks when they are either given an appointment to see a solicitor within three weeks or dealt with immediately if circumstances have changed so as to make the matter urgent.</P>
      <P>I am assured that there is not, nor has there been, any question of refusing to receive applications.  All persons who seek legal aid are invited to complete an official application form when they call to a centre and are assisted in this by the clerical staff if necessary.  This happens whether the applicant can be granted an immediate interview with a solicitor or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the position has already improved since the end of the year but, in addition, measures have been taken to increase the capacity of the Dublin centres.  At the request of the board I recently authorised the appointment of four additional solicitors with the necessary support staff for these centres.  I am <Col N="342" /> informed that one of the solicitors has already been recruited by the board and that they are in the process of recruiting the other three.  This will bring the total number of solicitors employed by the board in Dublin to ten.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 21 October 1980, in reply to a previous question, the firm with which a contract was placed by the National Building Agency Ltd., on behalf of my Department, for the construction of flats at the barracks, was then in receivership.  Accordingly it was necessary to arrange for the placing of a contract with another firm.  The National Building Agency Ltd., offered a contract to such a firm.  As this firm sought a significant increase on its original tender price, it was decided to invite fresh tenders. The tenders are due on 6 February 1981, and I expect that it will be possible to place a contract soon afterwards.  The contract will be for the construction of 12 flats and will provide that work should commence within seven days of the placing of the contract.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the flats will be completed within a year of commencement of the work.  The 12 dwellings will be the first phase of a programme for the replacement of the married quarters at the barracks.  A clear site is available and accordingly the vacation of quarters pending the provision of the new dwellings will not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister conscious of the appalling damage to the morale of soldiers and their families in the quarters in question because promises made down through the years have not yet been fulfilled? Further, is he aware that, notwithstanding that he now says that the building will take place on a clear site, a number of families have been asked to move from their present accommodation to other accommodation in order to facilitate the demolition of buildings to enable construction to begin?  It seems from the information which I and also the Minister <Col N="352" /> have received, I am sure in good faith, that there is a conflict.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence having regard to the number of experienced soldiers in Dublin who are obliged to leave the Army in order to obtain adequate housing for their families, if he will expedite the building of sufficient modern accommodation for the married members of the Defence Forces and their families; and if, in the meantime, he will make representations to Dublin Corporation with a view to that body terminating the practice of not favourably considering applications for housing from soldiers residing in Army quarters, even when such quarters are substandard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that any soldiers are leaving the Permanent Defence Force solely to obtain houses.</P>
      <P>The provision of housing is primarily a matter for local authorities.  The policy of my Department is to supplement the efforts of local authorities where soldiers' housing needs are greatest.  Since 1954, 334 new married quarters have been provided at various locations throughout the country, including 92 in Dublin city.  Married soldiers have equal claim on local authority houses with other members of the community in the same category. Dublin Corporation are very co-operative in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention that all unsuitable married quarters will be replaced by <Col N="353" /> modern housing, as part of the programme for improving conditions for serving soldiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that quite a number of long-serving soldiers who live in the married quarters concerned, Cathal Brugha Barracks, have tendered their resignation from the Army from time to time long before it might be expected that they would want to leave the Army?  I realise that this is not a question but recently on one day alone three different families in those quarters indicated to me that the men were resigning from the Army in order to get decent accommodation. They could no longer tolerate the appalling conditions.  That happened on one day alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the elements of the Government's strategy for the management of the public finances in 1981 have already been published in recent weeks. The proposals for capital expenditure were set out in the investment plan 1981 which I announced a fortnight ago and were expanded last week in the Public Capital Programme.  The volume of Estimates for the Public Services for 1981 has already been circulated.  A review of the economic situation for 1980 and prospects for 1981 has been set out in the paper &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget&rdquo;.  It is not necessary, nor would it, I feel, be expected of me to traverse in detail the ground covered by these various documents.  I shall, however, point during the course of my statement to the main features in them relevant to the budget which I now present.</P>
      <P>The budget must have regard to social as well as economic and financial aspirations, and to our capacity to pursue these aspirations, if it is to make an effective impact in achieving progress and harmony within the community.  At the best of times it is difficult to reconcile the expectations and needs of the different elements in society.  This year the constraints are especially severe.  We are not expectional in finding ourselves in this position.  Our EEC partners, most of whom have already introduced their annual budgets, have been faced with the problems of severe recession, inflation, rising unemployment and the need to generate economic activity.  These problems extend beyond the EEC boundaries into other countries of the OECD and beyond.  They have persisted longer and have been more severe than even the most pessimistic of commentators had earlier predicted.  There are some signs that the worst may be over and there are indications that a measure of growth will be resumed abroad this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poor international outlook is both a challenge and a warning to our own relatively small but dynamic economy. The Government have not been prepared to let the economy drift in the prevailing international recession.  Active support for investment, development and <Col N="388" /> employment remains at the centre of the Government's strategy.  The present lull in economic activity elsewhere must be seen as an opportunity for a breakthrough in the development of the national economy.  Consequently, the investment plan aims at concentrating available resources on directly productive investment and supporting infrastructure. This will create the foundation for further, and faster, national growth when more buoyant economic conditions follow the expected upturn in world trade later in 1981.</P>
    <P>Concentration of available resources on productive investment can only be achieved, however, if the growth of current public expenditure is curbed.  The 1981 Estimates for the Public Services make it quite clear that the Government intend to follow this policy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE ECONOMY</P>
    <P>The international economy went into recession last year as a result of the massive increases in oil prices, which more than doubled between 1978 and 1980. The growth rate in both the OECD and the EEC slowed to near 1 per cent.  World trade grew by 2½ per cent in 1980, little more than one-third of the 1979 rate.  The impact here of this international recession was particularly severe, because the decline in output and imports in our principal external market, the UK, was much greater than in any other major country. Against that background, the fact that our growth rate was in line with the OECD and EEC average represents a worthwhile achievement, largely reflecting the impact of Government policies designed to offset the effects of the recession.</P>
    <P>Our performance on external account last year was also creditable.  Exports rose by over 6 per cent in volume, well above the average for EEC countries.  Import volume fell by 5 per cent, a far greater decline than experienced internationally. As a result, our balance of payments deficit was cut from 10 per cent of GNP in 1979 to 9 per cent in 1980, despite an increase of about £200 million in the cost of oil imports.  The deepening international recession last year led, however, <Col N="389" /> to an abnormal level of job losses, resulting in a rise in unemployment despite the creation of many job opportunities.  Most other countries, both in the EEC and elsewhere, also experienced growing unemployment&mdash;in some cases much greater than here.</P>
    <P>The Government deplore the growth in unemployment which has been forced upon us.  They have acted energetically to contain it, as is shown by the specific employment measures announced by my predecessor last October, and by the Government's investment plan.  The Government have also availed of every suitable opportunity to emphasise, at international level, the pressing need to give more attention to unemployment in formulating economic policy.</P>
    <P>We have demonstrated in recent years our ability, given reasonably favourable external conditions, to create sufficient employment both to absorb fast growth in the labour force and to reduce unemployment. Figures recently published by the CSO on the basis of its Labour Force Surveys show that new employment was much higher since 1977 than had been estimated earlier.  It is now clear that total employment increased by 80,000 between April 1977 and April 1980.  The investment plan and the high level of job approvals last year and earlier will result in substantial new employment this year. I am confident that this record of success will be sustained and that we will achieve this year the growth in employment envisaged in the second national understanding. While international economic prospects this year are uncertain, there are grounds for optimism.</P>
    <P>The worst phase of the recession has passed and a gradual upturn should soon be under way.  The GNP of the OECD area, for example, which fell during the second half of 1980, is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 1½ per cent in the first half of this year, with the pace quickening thereafter.  A similar view of prospects for the EEC is taken by the EEC Commission, and recovery in the UK during the year is also possible.  Internationally, inflation fell during the course of last year, and this welcome trend seems likely <Col N="390" /> to continue this year.  The position in Britain in this respect still has a significant influence here, despite the break in the sterling link, and the expectation there is that prices will rise more slowly this year than last.</P>
    <P>The international background should be more favourable this year.  We must of course be realistic.  Further increases in the price of oil could postpone the expected recovery.  So too could over-restrictive economic policies in the major countries, and the Government will continue to exert whatever influence they can to avert this danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestically there are already signs of recovery.  The trade figures for December showed a large growth in imports of raw materials and capital goods, pointing towards an upswing in production and investment. Capital formation will be boosted considerably by the investment plan.  Industrial exports should also be reasonably buoyant, reflecting the continuing success of the IDA in attracting new exporting industries, and the expected international upturn.  Cattle prices should also be higher.  Overall, the economy should grow faster this year than last.</P>
      <P>Faster growth and a higher average oil price than last year will lead to some increase in the balance of payments deficit this year.  This budget is designed to contain that increase.  Implementation of the investment plan will generate imports and, if the budget is to contribute to keeping the balance of payments deficit at a tolerable level, progress must be made in reducing the current budget deficit. This need is reflected in the Government's decisions on current expenditure and taxation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Medium-term Strategy</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking beyond the period of the present investment plan, the Government will continue to concentrate on a vigorous and programmed expansion of the productive base of the economy as the centrepiece of their medium-term strategy. Continuing priority will be given to <Col N="391" /> investment in the directly productive sectors and to providing and strengthening the productive infrastructure.  This is essential if our predominantly youthful and rapidly increasing population is to have the employment opportunities to which it aspires and which it is entitled to expect.  The performance of the agricultural sector is of vital importance to the economy but one must look to the other sectors for employment opportunities. There is no defensible alternative to a strategy of growth across the entire economy. This must be pursued with due regard to ensuring social justice and assisting the vulnerable members of society. Social investment, therefore, must grow in reasonable relationship to overall economic capacity.</P>
    <P>The investment plan will be followed by a paper dealing with medium-term economic development.  In 1982, and subsequently, the Government's plans will be reviewed and updated annually. The administrative arrangements for planning have been strengthened, and, in particular, liaison on planning between my Department and other Departments has been improved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MONETARY POLICY</P>
    <P>We shall soon have completed our second year of participation in the European Monetary System.  During this period, the EMS has continued to make a significant contribution to exchange rate stability. There has been a higher degree of stability between the eight participating currencies than at any stage since 1972. This is in marked contrast to the great fluctuations that have affected other international currencies.</P>
    <P>The pound sterling has appreciated strongly, outside the System against all the EMS currencies including the Irish pound.  This has been due to continuing high interest rates in London and the relative advantage that the UK has in regard to oil.  The effective depreciation of the Irish pound against sterling has benefited our manufactured exports, but it has also pushed up the prices of necessary imports from the UK, thus complicating <Col N="392" /> our efforts to reduce the rate of inflation here.</P>
    <P>The Irish pound has performed satisfactorily against the other currencies participating in the EMS.  The Government are firmly committed to the pursuit of domestic policies that will ensure continued stability of our currency within the system.</P>
    <P>The broad objective of monetary policy in 1980 was to ensure an adequate level of external reserves in the context of continued membership of the EMS, while at the same time avoiding the introduction of a deflationary element into economic policy.  To this end a guideline of 13 per cent for the increase in private sector credit was adopted by the Central Bank; this was expected to encourage some recourse to external borrowing by the private sector, which would serve to supplement public sector foreign borrowing. It is likely that the growth in private sector credit will be close to the guideline. The official external reserves increased in 1980 by £371 million to £1,346 million or by 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>After peaking in the early part of the year, domestic interest rates fell, partly because of the reduced demand for credit and partly as a result of the effects on liquidity of foreign currency borrowing by both the private and public sectors. The prime lending rate of the Associated Banks fell by 4 percentage points since the beginning of July, to its current level of 14 per cent.  The launching during the year, on the initiative of the Government, of loan schemes operated by the ACC, the ICC and the Associated Banks, for which the Exchequer gave an exchange rate guarantee, provided credit for agriculture and manufacturing at very competitive rates of interest.</P>
    <P>In the case of the building societies, the Government took action in April to prevent an increase in the mortgage rate for householders.  Subsequently, following the general reduction in interest rates, the mortgage rate fell for the first time in over two years.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, interest rates are now lower than they have been for some time.  The interest rates of the Associated Banks and the building societies are <Col N="393" /> lower than in most EEC member countries. Although the international financial outlook is rather uncertain at present and although Ireland cannot insulate itself from financial developments abroad, I am hopeful that the satisfactory situation with regard to Irish rates will continue.</P>
    <P>As regards 1981, the basic objectives of monetary policy will continue to be the maintenance of the exchange rate and of adequate external reserves.  Credit restraint will still be necessary.  The detailed monetary policy measures for 1981 will be announced shortly by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Inflows to building societies during 1980, at £183 million, were almost as high as the exceptional figure of £192 million recorded in 1979.  The societies are entering 1981 with a high level of liquidity. The prospects are that they will continue to make a major contribution to housing finance.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF BUDGET 1980 OUTTURN</P>
    <P>The 1980 budget was designed to make progress towards a financial balance on domestic and international account, without impeding growth and the creation of employment.  There was some optimism at the time that the world economy would emerge in the course of the year from recession.  This, in the event, proved not to be so.  In the circumstances it was necessary to relax the tight limits on spending in the budget in order to sustain the momentum of the economy, to avoid unacceptable deflation and to provide employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A large part of the additional expenditure was directed to the Public Capital Programme&mdash;to provide employment in the building and construction industry and to maintain the rate of development of productive enterprise, in industry and agriculture, through capital grants and credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> Some of the supplementary non-capital expenditure also went to assist agriculture but the bulk of it was required for general and special pay increases in the public sector and for social welfare payments, including the double-week payment made to most social welfare recipients in December.</P>
    <P>Revenue receipts were, in the aggregate, close to the budget target.  There was some shortfall in income tax receipts from the self-employed, due partly to the fall in agricultural incomes and partly to the impact of the recession on business. A shortfall arose also in Post Office revenue, partly because of a slowing down in the growth of telephone and postal traffic.  Some £42 million of the Post Office shortfall is expected to be collected in 1981.</P>
    <P>The current deficit for the year, at £547 million, was £200 million above the budgeted figure and the overall effect of the various changes was that Exchequer borrowing reached £1,217 million, or 14½ per cent of GNP.</P>

        <i>Exchequer Financing</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestic sources, mainly sales of Government securities and the savings institutions, provided £650 million towards financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement. Non-banking support for Government securities was very strong; £336 million of the £650 million came from this source, £130 million more than in 1979.  Receipts from small savers, at £52 million, were almost double the 1979 outturn.  I would hope that this range and level of support will continue and increase.</P>
      <P>The banks put £243 million into Government securities, an increase of almost £140 million on the 1979 outturn.  This result, to some extent, reflected the reduced demand from the private sector for bank credit.  I believe that private sector needs should not be submerged by public sector borrowing.  It will be my concern in 1981 to ensure that the private sector is not deprived of the credit it requires for productive investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> The policy of improving the range of Government securities available to the public was continued in 1980.  Three new short-dated Government stocks were issued as well as £820 million nominal value of tranches of existing Government stocks.  The policy is working well and is largely responsible for the satisfactory development of the Irish gilt market in recent years.  The range of stocks on offer will be examined regularly to ensure that the needs of potential investors are fully met.  An improvement in the underlying rate of inflation and the relatively high yields available on Irish Government securities should continue to make the gilt-edged market an attractive investment outlet.</P>
    <P>Apart from the sale of securities through the Stock Exchange, we have a very varied and attractive range of small savings schemes, some with tax-free concessions.  In the past these schemes have been a good source of funds.  In recent years, however, the total of receipts from the small savings schemes has been disappointing, although, as I have already said, there was a significant improvement in 1980 as compared with 1979.  I have reviewed the schemes and have decided that there are two areas in which improvements might be effected.</P>
    <P>I consider that the minimum age limit of 65 for the purchase of indexed-linked savings bonds in unnecessarily high and I have decided to reduce this age limit to 55 years.  I have also decided to double to £3,000 the maximum amount which a person may hold in the bonds.</P>
    <P>The return from sales of saving certificates has been falling for some time.  To correct this declining trend I have decided to issue a new certificate which will give a better return to investors.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that these improvements will be welcome to small savers and will result in a further increase in receipts this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the members of the National Savings Committee who, over the years, have freely given of their services in the promotion of savings, particularly in the establishment of savings <Col N="396" /> groups at places of employment.  The committee were 25 years in existence in December 1980.  They are currently undertaking a large-scale publicity campaign on the theme of savings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>The European Investment Bank once again made a significant contribution towards financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Loans from the Bank last year totalled £156 million.  The loans attracted interest subsidies under the agreement reached when Ireland joined the EMS.  The bank will continue its welcome and significant support in 1981 and its loans will, as heretofore, attract the EMS interest subsidy.</P>
    <P>This and other foreign borrowing of £410 million in 1980 served the dual purpose of financing the Exchequer borrowing requirement and supporting the external reserves.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of foreign borrowing will be required in 1981.  This will be undertaken only after the financing needs of the Exchequer and the level of support needed for the external reserves have been carefully considered.  The planned participation by the private sector in investments hitherto carried out by the public sector will serve to reduce Exchequer recourse to foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL BUDGET STRATEGY 1981</P>
    <P>
      <i>Borrowing Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are concerned that borrowing for current purposes must be reduced with all practicable speed and on an orderly basis, consistent with the fiscal, economic and social constraints that are all too obvious.  They consider that it would have been wrong in present circumstances to pursue this policy rigidly and without regard to immediate economic and social needs.  To have done so would have resulted in increased unemployment and would have added to the difficulties caused by the external economic situation.  Having allowed for the present economic situation, therefore, Government policy will concentrate on reducing, progressively, borrowing for <Col N="397" /> current purposes and directing available resources to productive self-sustaining investment programmes.  Policy will be elaborated in the paper on medium-term economic development to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the Government are maintaining a relatively high level of borrowing this year and have drawn up a programme of investment on the scale set out in the investment plan.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure 1981</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1981 investment plan provides for an unprecedented investment expenditure of £1,733 million, an increase of 36 per cent on the 1980 level.  I stress two aspects&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Government have assigned a major role to industrial development in the plan; £334 million has been allocated this year to industrial credit and promotion.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A major role has also been assigned to infrastructural investment programmes: a total of £781 million has been allocated to expand our capacity to meet energy requirements, improve telecommunications, road and transport facilities and provide improved sanitary services.</P>
    <P>The overall level of Government investment in 1981 will result in a substantial increase in employment.  Most of this will occur in the building and construction sector and in firms associated with the development of infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>In addition to the investments which I have outlined, the Government have under consideration the possibility of making additional capital available to certain State-sponsored bodies and in this connection I am making a contingency provision of £70 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Private Participation in Public Investment</i>
    </P>
    <P>In our mixed economy there has always been a close supportive relationship between the State and the private sector. The Government have decided to <Col N="398" /> strengthen this relationship by inviting a more active participation from the private sector in capital development.  The Government believe that this policy will be to the maximum benefit of the economy and will advance the pace of national development.</P>
    <P>Discussions have already been held with a range of private sector interests in order to explore the extent to which their support might be forthcoming, particularly for investment in infrastructure. These preliminary soundings have been encouraging and, as a result, the Government have adopted a target of £200 million as the extent to which this year's Public Capital Programme might be financed from private sources.</P>
    <P>The form of this proposed participation will, of course, vary with the nature of the assets and services being provided. For activities that are essentially commercial, arrangements may be appropriate whereby the public sector will be relieved of the responsibility for both the provision of the new asset and its subsequent operation.  In other areas a less prominent role for the private sector is envisaged.  Final arrangements have not yet been worked out but I am determined that the terms of participation will at the same time represent reasonable value for the State and provide new and different investment opportunities for the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Expenditure 1981</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recently published expenditure Estimates for 1981 represent an integral part of the Government's overall budget strategy.  They have been determined on the basis that the strong upward trend in current expenditure must be halted.  It is virtually impossible, however, because of the committed nature of much of the expenditure, to reverse its trend radically in the space of a year or two.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the total of the non-capital Estimates for the supply services &mdash;generally speaking the ordinary day-to-day expenditures on salaries and services by Departments&mdash;shows an increase of only 9 per cent in cash terms in what was actually spent in 1980.  Non-pay services have been severely pruned.  The <Col N="399" /> estimates for these services total only 3 per cent more than actual expenditure on them in 1980.</P>
    <P>Public service pay and pensions&mdash;to which I shall refer at greater length later- &mdash;involve commitments which the Government, as employer, must meet under the terms of the national understanding. Standard increases alone are expected to cost the Exchequer well over £200 million in 1981.  The cost of special claims adds to the pay bill.  However, even here the determination of the Government to restrain the growth in expenditure is evident.</P>
    <P>Central Fund Services are estimated to cost 27 per cent more in 1981 than in 1980, largely because of higher debt service charges which must be met.  As Minister for Finance, I will have the support of my colleagues in special measures to ensure that the allocations for these services will not be exceeded in 1981, apart from the additional expenditure to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>The new practice introduced last year of the preparation by the National Board for Science and Technology of a science budget based on the requirements of the public sector institutions in science and technology has been continued this year in accordance with the relevant legislation. The science budget recommendations have been taken into account in fixing the provisions for these institutions. In fulfilment of the Government's commitment to the promotion of science and technology as key factors in development, I have found it possible, in the main, to give increases above the general average in the provisions for science and technology.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue Buoyancy 1981</i>
    </P>
    <P>Revenue receipts for 1981, before today's adjustments, are estimated at £3,654 million, or 16 per cent more than the 1980 outturn.  Tax revenue is estimated at £3,009 million, 15 per cent above the 1980 receipt.  This rate of increase is not as large as in recent years, mainly because of the incidence of the <Col N="400" /> full year cost of the extensive income tax concessions given in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>The estimate for non-tax revenue, at £645 million, is 20 per cent above the 1980 outturn.  It makes allowance for further recovery of outstanding Post Office receipts, growth in the number of telephone subscribers and resumption of normal growth in other areas of Post Office business in 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Deficit on Current Account</i>
    </P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure of £4,178 million on current services and the revenue estimate of £3,654 million give an opening deficit on current account of £524 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>Because of its predominant influence on the expenditure side of the budget, I propose at this point to comment on incomes policy and its effects on the cost of public sector pay.</P>
    <P>Earnings last year grew much faster here than in most of our competitor countries. They rose, for example, at over three times the rate experienced in Germany and the Netherlands, countries with whom we participate in the EMS and whose products compete with our exports, not only on home markets but, more importantly, on the British market. In a wider context, the rate of increase in real labour costs here was exceeded only in one other OECD country.</P>
    <P>The trend of incomes will be crucial in determining to what extent this country can share and exploit the expected international economic upswing.  After a pronounced recession, over-capacity internationally will be slow to disappear. Competition will remain very tough.  Further, growing unemployment has led to intensified competition for internationally mobile investment and our prospects of attracting it will be diminished if income increases here continue to run ahead of the international average.</P>
    <P>The national understanding provides the framework for the development of incomes this year.  The basic pay terms of the understanding are generous.  Without any other additions they will lead to an <Col N="401" /> average increase per head in non-agricultural wages and salaries of over 14 per cent.  By comparison, single digit figures are becoming the norm for new settlements in most of our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>The national understanding provides for a meeting of the Employer-Labour Conference to discuss the position in the event of an increase in consumer prices of more than 10 per cent from mid-May last to mid-February and, having regard to the economic circumstances prevailing, to consider an upward adjustment in the amount of the second phase of pay increases under the Agreement on Pay Policy.  This provision does not impose an obligation on employers to negotiate a particular level of increase.</P>
    <P>Measures to increase revenue which I shall announce later have an effect on the Consumer Price Index.  The question as to whether pay increases should compensate for increases in taxation on nonessential items has been frequently raised in recent years.  Obviously much depends on the purpose of the increased taxes.  In any case compensation through pay increases could have highly undesirable consequences for prices, costs, competitiveness on home and foreign markets and, in particular, for employment.  The effectiveness of the Government's action to support employment through the investment plan would be eroded through a further loss of competitiveness. It could be damaging therefore, and self-defeating, to seek compensation for indirect taxes imposed for social welfare and other socially defensible purposes.  I would hope that these points will be to the forefront of any further consideration of the existing national understanding provisions on wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Relations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The national understanding is regarded too often as simply an agreement on pay.  It is much more than this, dealing as it does with wide-ranging economic and social issues of fundamental importance.  The Government are determined to do everything in their power to maintain progress in all areas embraced <Col N="402" /> by the terms of the understanding despite the present unfavourable external pressures on our economy.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the Government's efforts will not be fully realised unless all the parties to the national understanding fully discharge all their obligations under it.  This will call for discipline and leadership on the part of both management and workers.  I would stress in particular the need to make full use in settling disputes of existing procedures agreed between management and employees.  If discipline and leadership are absent severe damage will be done to the community. This damage will show itself in rising unemployment and all the hardship which that entails as well as in disruption of production and services.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the importance of preserving industrial peace in the public sector.  When jobs are at risk in so many areas of the economy it is incumbent especially on public sector employees to take no action that would present an even greater threat to employment in the economy at large.  There is a special responsibility on those dealing with essential services to guarantee continuity of service by observing the terms of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Sector Pay and Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of pay and pensions increased from £1,158 million to £1,555 million, or by 34 per cent, between 1979 and 1980.  They are estimated to cost £1,780 million in 1981.  That sum no more than covers the cost of the 1980 National Understanding Agreenent on Pay Policy and the carryover effects of other pay awards already made.  That brings me to the question of the treatment of claims for special increases.</P>
    <P>Special pay increases in the public sector give rise to grave concern.  In the past two years alone such increases cost the Exchequer about £260 million.  Almost all public servants received an award of this kind in this period, in addition to the increases provided for under the standard terms of national agreements.  These awards were made under the special increase clauses built into such agreements. <Col N="403" /> The frequency with which such clauses are availed of in the public service must become the subject of special scrutiny when the time comes to review arrangements at national level.  It is very disquieting to learn that further special claims are already in the pipeline.  The Government fully appreciate the contribution that public servants are making to national development, but in the present critical situation they would hope that public servants would have regard to the greater degree of security attaching to their employment and be prepared to moderate, or not to press, claims which they otherwise would consider justified. I would earnestly ask all concerned to consider the matter seriously in the national interest.  Failure to respond to this appeal will regrettably mean the imposition of further taxation and reduction of services.</P>
    <P>While I can affirm that the Government will honour their commitments under the National Understanding Agreement on Pay Policy, I must say that every such claim will be subjected to close scrutiny and processed strictly in accordance with the provisions of the pay agreement and with established and agreed procedures.  Reluctant as I am to make any provision for special pay increases in the public sector in 1981, it would be imprudent of me not to allow for the probability of some settlements this year. I am therefore allocating in the budget a further sum of £80 million to cover any increases in pay and pensions for which provision has not already been made in the Estimates Volume.</P>
    <P>I must warn however that, if the cost of pay increases in the public sector continues to develop on the lines of recent years, it will call into question the future of national pay agreements.  Over the past two years the cost to the Exchequer of special pay increases has been in excess of the cost of the standard national agreement increases themselves.  This is unacceptable. It raises doubts about the arrangements at national level which result not only in generous standard increases but also in the negotiation of special claims at such high cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" />
      <i>Rationalisation in the Public Sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>The sheer size of the public sector and the amount of finance required to sustain it suggest that there is considerable opportunity for savings by rationalising its programmes, administrative machinery and structures, staffing and systems. An interdepartmental task force is being established to make a critical appraisal of the scope for such action and to draw up proposals as a matter of urgency to achieve savings this year of at least £25 million on the Estimates figures.  On the basis that these savings will be identified and implemented, I am making a deduction of £25 million from the budget expenditure.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>The Government's over-riding concern for the more vulnerable sections of our society, particularly social welfare recipients, has been demonstrated in a positive way by the substantial improvements made in welfare payments in recent budgets.  The Government intend that those in need should not suffer by reason of changing economic conditions over which they have little or no influence. The measures I shall now announce will not only prevent this happening but will, in fact, improve further and significantly the position of those dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided that from next April personal and adult dependant rates of long-term weekly payments&mdash;such as old age and widows' pensions, invalidity pensions, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, and health allowances&mdash;will be increased by 25 per cent.  The corresponding short-term weekly rates&mdash;which include unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowances &mdash;will be increased from their present level by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>These increases will mean an extra £6.15 a week for the contributory old age pensioner who is under 80 and £5.25 for the non-contributory pensioner.  For a married couple, both of whom are of <Col N="405" /> pension age and under 80, the new rates will mean an increase of £10.75 a week in the present maximum contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>For a contributory widow under 80 there will be an extra £5.65 a week and for her non-contributory counterpart £5.25.  A married man on flat-rate unemployment or disability benefit will get an increase of £6.75 a week.</P>
      <P>The Government have also decided to increase from April next weekly social welfare rates in respect of child dependants by amounts varying between 40p and 75p per child depending on the particular benefit.  In addition, general children's allowances, which are payable monthly, will be increased by £1.50 in July next to £6 per month for the first child and by £2 for the second and each subsequent child to £9 per month.</P>
      <P>As a result of all these improvements, a contributory widow with three children will receive an increase of £9.15 a week, while a non-contributory widow will get a weekly increase of £8.30.  For a married man with three children on flat-rate unemployment or disability benefit, the weekly increase will amount to £9.60.</P>
      <P>Full details of the various changes are to be found in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>Paid Maternity Leave</i>
      </P>
      <P>I am also glad to announce, as foreshadowed in the national understanding, a new scheme of supplementary social insurance maternity benefit.  The new scheme will effectively apply to women who are in employment and entitled to approved maternity leave under legislation being prepared by the Minister for Labour.  As a result, much improved benefits, which will be substantially pay-related, will be payable for a basic period of 14 weeks.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Free Fuel Vouchers</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July last the Government approved the introduction of a national fuel <Col N="406" /> voucher scheme to provide assistance towards the purchase of various forms of fuel for the less well off sections of our society.  The present value of the weekly fuel voucher is £2.  As a further measure to aid these groups, principally the old and alone, the Government have decided to increase the value of the weekly fuel voucher by £1, to £3, with effect from a current date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cost of Welfare Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>In aggregate the cost in 1981 of the social welfare and health changes I have announced is estimated at £144 million. Social insurance contributors' normal share of these costs would be £64 million. The Government have decided, as an exceptional measure this year designed to mitigate the burden on employers and employees, to raise only £33 million in 1981 from contributors, the balance of £111 million being met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aid for Disabled Persons</i>
    </P>
    <P>I shall be referring later to improvements in allowances and reliefs related to disabled persons.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abuse of the Social Welfare System</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are much alive to the question of abuse of the social welfare system and in integrated series of measures has been adopted to combat such abuse.  If these measures are to be successful and to have public support, we must of course create a climate of confidence among the public generally that genuine claims are being dealt with in an efficient and sympathetic manner.  The campaign against abuse is a continuing process that is steadily achieving its objectives.  It will be further developed as necessary, thereby ensuring that the maximum amount of resources are available to meet the genuine entitlements of beneficiaries.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AGRICULTURE</P>
    <P>I come now to agriculture.  Throughout most of the period 1970 to 1978 Irish agriculture enjoyed very favourable conditions. These were reflected in an unprecedented advance in farmers' incomes. <Col N="407" /> In that period family farm incomes per head grew at an average annual rate of almost 9½ per cent in real terms.  This growth was in large measure due to the benefits of the common agricultural policy of the EEC.  It was generally recognised that income growth of that magnitude could not continue indefinitely. However, in place of a slower rate of increase, or even a standstill, there has been a substantial drop in farm incomes over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Government view the decline in farm incomes with the deepest concern. This concern extends not only to the situation of the individual farmer and his family but also to the impact of a weakened agricultural sector on the rest of the economy.  The importance of agriculture to the economy is illustrated by the fact that in 1980 agricultural output represented 17 per cent of national output compared with an estimated average of about 4 per cent for all the EEC countries. For the farm family the substantial fall in income which has occurred over the last two years has involved a reduction in living standards and has reduced their ability to finance the development of the farm and increase production.</P>
    <P>The concern with which the Government view the situation is clearly demonstrated by the extent of the measures to aid agriculture which were implemented over the past six months or so after close and frequent consultations with the farming organisations.  These measures included an increased allocation for farm modernisation grants, a doubling of the rates of grant under the disadvantaged areas scheme, a national supplement to the EEC suckler cow scheme and additional rates relief.  They cost an extra £39 million in 1980.  In addition, the Government arranged for the provision of £100 million in reduced interest loans for agriculture.</P>
    <P>As well as these national measures, the Government authorised the Minister for Agriculture to seek EEC aid for a special range of measures for Irish farmers. Negotiations on these are continuing in Brussels and the Government are hopeful of a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> The forthcoming review of EEC farm prices will also provide an opportunity to compensate farmers for rising costs. There are well-known constraints in this area arising from the limitations on the EEC budget and the surplus of some products.  Within those constraints, the Government are determined to obtain the best possible deal for Irish farmers. There are, in fact, good grounds for expecting that the price increases this year will be more realistic than those of recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what may be achieved on the EEC front the Government are resolved to ensure that agricultural production and exports are expanded with consequential benefits for farmers' incomes.  The Government have considered, in the light of the measures already taken in recent months and the prospects for special EEC aid and price increases, how best this objective can be achieved.  They have decided in favour of a number of direct reliefs as the quickest and most effective way of compensating farmers for income erosion and of providing finance for, and generating confidence in, further farm development. These measures involve the disease eradication levies, income tax, agricultural rates and the introduction of special aid for seed potatoes.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Disease Eradication Levies</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government consider that it is appropriate that the agricultural industry should make a contribution to the enormous cost of the disease eradication programmes which, in themselves, yield such benefits to farmers.  However they recognise the exceptional difficulties which farmers are undergoing at the present time.  The Government have decided, therefore, to suspend the levies for the time being with effect from 1 February. This will represent an increase to farmers of ½p per gallon of milk and £3 per head of cattle without affecting prices to consumers. The resultant loss to the Exchequer is estimated at £9.65 million in 1981. The Government will review the position <Col N="409" /> at the end of the year and decide in the light of prevailing conditions whether the levies should be reimposed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aid for Seed Potato Industry</i>
    </P>
    <P>During the past few years the seed potato industry has been going through difficulties to which storage and marketing problems have been added.  As a result there has been severe pressure on the resources of the industry.  The position has not been helped by the fact that a common organisation of the market for potatoes has not yet been introduced by the EEC.  The seed potato trade is an important one for this country and affects the livelihood of a large number of small farmers mainly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>There are definite possibilities for expansion of exports, particularly in the light of promising new varieties recently developed by An Foras Talúntais.  In this connection suitable grading and storage facilities are of vital importance.  I am, accordingly, providing a sum of £250,000 for financing measures to assist the development of the seed potato industry and alleviate some of the main problems arising at present.  The details will be announced later by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farm Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the context of farm taxation generally I shall now refer to income tax as well as rates.  In the 1980 budget farm income tax, rates on land and the resource tax were estimated to yield about £86 million on the basis that farm incomes had fallen in 1979 by some 4 per cent.  We now know that such incomes actually fell by about 11½ per cent in 1979 and are thought to have fallen by a similar amount in 1980.  This has inevitably been reflected in the yield from farm taxation. Income tax, which had been estimated to yield £32 million, yielded only about £25 million last year because of the decline in farm incomes.  For the same reason the Government waived the second half of the 1980 rates due from farmers in the valuation range £40-£60 at a cost of £6 million.  The Government's request last year to local authorities to adopt an &ldquo;understanding attitude&rdquo; to individual <Col N="410" /> farmers who had temporary difficulties in meeting their 1980 rates liability has naturally meant that payments of rates have been slower than normal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided earlier that the resource tax would be discontinued after one year and I am now confirming this decision.  The consequent saving to the farming community is over £6 million a year on the basis of the tax provisions introduced last year.  Resource tax due last year and not yet paid remains due and must be collected in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that last year's budget established a system of farm income tax, based on accounts, which is broadly similar to that which applies to other small businesses.  I do not propose to make any major changes in that system. I do, however, propose to make a further change in the stock relief provisions as they apply to farmers.</P>
      <P>Last year's Finance Act considerably improved the stock relief provisions for farming.  While other sectors get relief in respect of 75 per cent of the increase in stock values over 20 per cent of net profit, farmers were allowed full relief in respect of the increase over 10 per cent of profit. In view of the vital need to encourage the expansion of the national herd I propose to remove the 10 per cent restriction completely so that farmers will now get full relief in respect of increases in stock values. This will cost about £500,000 in 1981.</P>

      <P>As the Government decided last year that the threshold for liability to income tax would remain at £40 RV for the following three years, the number of farmers within the scope of income tax remains unchanged.  Last year, too, it was decided that farmers should have two payment dates rather than a single payment date.  In view of the situation in which farmers now find <Col N="411" /> themselves, I propose to continue the two payment dates of 1 October and 1 January for a further year.  This will improve the position of farmers to the extent of £5 million in this difficult year.</P>
      <P>My predecessor indicated in his Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill last year that technical discussions on the question of income averaging for farmers were proceeding between the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners. These discussions are continuing and I expect to be able to fulfil the commitment to introduce income averaging in the Finance Bill 1981.</P>
      <P>Farmers have been critical of the rates system and there have been demands that farmers should not be required to pay both income tax and rates.  As more and more farmers come into the income tax system and pay amounts of tax appropriate to their income, the burden of rates, which are not so related, is being reduced.</P>
      <P>In view of the difficult income position of farmers, however, the Government have decided to introduce a further concession on agricultural rates leviable this year.  This will involve full relief from rates in the case of farmers with land valuations under £50 RV and 50 per cent relief in the case of farmers with land valuations of £50 or over but under £70. This concession will cost the Exchequer about £19.6 million in 1981.  It will mean that farmers will pay only £31 million in rates leviable this year together with the carry-over of rates from 1980 as a result of the &ldquo;understanding attitude&rdquo;.  The Minister for the Environment will introduce the necessary legislation in due course.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Future Outlook</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures which I have announced will cost the Exchequer £35 million in 1981.  These measures have been designed, as I have already indicated, to provide immediate help for farm incomes.  Together with the other national measures implemented recently, the outcome of the negotiations for special EEC aid and the forthcoming EEC price review, they should stimulate and <Col N="412" /> increase the confidence of farmers and put Irish agriculture back on the path of growth.</P>
    <P>It is crucially important that farmers should regain the drive and determination to expand production.  Increased output is the only sound and long-term solution to present problems.  Injections of Government or EEC aid on their own will not provide the answer.  If the farmer does not increase production he will become increasingly dependent on such injections to which the scarcity of resources, at both national and EEC levels, places obvious limits.</P>
    <P>There is potential for increasing Irish agricultural production both through better management and through additional investment.  In many cases, higher output can be achieved without costly investment through improvements in farm management effected with the help of the education and advisory services.  Efforts by farmers in this respect will be greatly assisted by the reorganisation of those services under ACOT, for which the Government have allocated £15.2 million in 1981.  As indicated in the investment plan, investment grants and other capital aids totalling £141 million are being provided this year to encourage and support higher agricultural production.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>Taxation is expected at one and the same time to provide an adequate revenue base, to encourage economic and social development and to be distributed equitably.  Considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed in recent years with the taxation system.  This dissatisfaction has focussed on two aspects&mdash;the overall level of taxation and the manner in which different sections of the community are taxed.</P>
    <P>The fact that our level of taxation is relatively low by EEC standards is not generally acknowledged.  In 1979, for instance, it was 33 per cent of GNP compared with an average of 41 per cent for other EEC countries.  There are other factors which also require to be considered.</P>
    <P>The high level of borrowing required <Col N="413" /> in recent years in order to finance the annual budget deficits underlines the need for a wider tax base.  Expenditure restraint alone will not eliminate these deficits.  It seems inevitable that the aggregate level of taxation may have to be increased in real terms over the next few years as part of this process.  Every community has to accept in the long run that it must pay its way on current account.  The desirable balance between tax increases and expenditure curbs in order to close the budget gap over the next few years will be discussed in the context of borrowing policy in the forthcoming paper on medium-term economic development.</P>
    <P>The problem of how to secure equitable tax distribution is, if anything, more difficult.  Solution calls for compromise between apparently irreconcilable sectional assessments of what is fair and equitable; between the competing requirements of economic growth and equity; and between different approaches to the merits of direct and indirect taxation in the apportionment of the tax burden.  The Government's commitment to achieving a more equitable system has been stated repeatedly.  Significant advances in that direction have already been made in recent years and particularly in the 1980 budget.  The commitment of the Government is incorporated in the national understanding.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Commission on Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government decided last year that the time was ripe for a comprehensive review of the taxation system and established a Commission on Taxation for this purpose.  The commission is undertaking a thorough investigation of all aspects of taxation policies, including the machinery for assessment and collection of taxation. Its report will, I trust, be a landmark in the evolution of a more equitable and effective system of taxation.  I know that the commission is thankful to the various organisations and individuals who have made submissions to it.</P>
    <P>The Government look forward to having the benefit of the commission's advice and recommendations as soon as possible.  My predecessor, <Col N="414" /> speaking about this matter last year, did not preclude the possibility that the commission might find it feasible to provide interim reports on specific areas of taxation.  The Government would welcome any such reports, but it is of course for the commission to decide whether interim reports would be practicable.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year's budget introduced a radical change in the income tax structure with the decision of the Government to implement in full the principle of income-splitting for married couples.  That change and other reliefs and concessions were made at a cost to the Exchequer of £227 million in tax revenue in a full year. Those concessions represented a major step forward towards a more equitable distribution of taxation pending the outcome of the work of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government carefully considered whether the objective of reducing the budget deficit would justify an increase this year in the rates of direct taxation. They were satisfied that such action would represent an economic disincentive of considerable danger to the economy at the present time and would be likely to neutralise in whole or in part the stimulus to private sector effort provided by the investment plan.  Apart therefore from a proposal involving the timing of tax payments rather than the rates of taxation.  I have no major proposals for increasing direct taxation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Special PAYE Allowance</i></P>
    <P>A special allowance was introduced last year for PAYE taxpayers generally in order to improve the tax progression of those taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed, and others assessed under Schedule D, enjoy advantages within the taxation system which the PAYE taxpayer does not share.  In line with the Government's commitment in the national understanding, I now propose to increase this allowance from £400 to £600.  Where a husband and wife are both within PAYE, each spouse will, as before, be entitled to the increased allowance.  The increase will <Col N="415" /> cost £40 million in 1981 and £60 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Rate Bands</i></P>
    <P>Under the present structure of allowances and rate bands a single person with basic allowances only would enter the 45 per cent rate band with a weekly income of £125.  Because of the income-splitting provisions the corresponding income for married couples would be about twice that amount.  I am anxious to avoid the situation where a single person with an income not a great deal more than the average industrial wage could enter the higher rates of tax.  The increase in the PAYE allowance which I mentioned earlier will have the effect, for the great majority of taxpayers, of raising the point of application of all rates of tax.  I am also increasing the 35 per cent rate band from £4,000 to £4,500 for single, and widowed, persons and from £8,000 to £9,000 for married couples.</P>
    <P>As a result of these two proposals a single person with an income of £100 per week from a PAYE employment will get tax relief of £70 a year.  A married person on £100 per week and paying tax under PAYE will also benefit by £70 annually. On an income of £140 per week, the gain to a PAYE taxpayer will be £140 if single. The gain will remain at £70 for married persons as they benefit from the double rate bands.</P>
    <P>Where a husband and wife are both in PAYE employment, the gain will be greater because each will qualify for the increased PAYE allowance.  The effect of these improvements, and of the other changes which I propose, can be seen in greater detail in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Exemption Limits</i></P>
    <P>The introduction last year of an income tax exemption for those on low incomes was a particularly significant development in that it provided a worthwhile relief for the less well-off while at the same time ensuring that the relief was directed to those most in need.  I now propose to increase the general exemption limits from £1,700 to £2,000 for single <Col N="416" /> and widowed persons and from £3,400 to £4,000 for married couples.  Marginal relief will be available for those whose incomes do not greatly exceed these amounts.</P>
    <P>A single person on £38 per week will have no liability to tax; this represents an annual saving of £115.  A married couple earning £76 per week will be relieved of all their income tax, amounting to £330 per year.</P>
    <P>I also propose to raise the age exemptions which apply to the elderly.  For those aged between 65 and 75 years the limits will be increased from £2,000 to £2,300 for single and widowed persons and from £4,000 to £4,600 for married couples.  For persons aged 75 years or over the limits will be increased from £2,500 to £2,800 for single and widowed persons and from £5,000 to £5,600 for married couples.  A married couple where either spouse is aged 75 years or more will pay no tax on an income of £107 per week or, in the case of a single or widowed person aged 75 years or more, £53 per week.  The corresponding weekly amounts for those aged between 65 years and 75 years are £88 for married couples and £44 for single and widowed persons.</P>
    <P>These new exemption limits will remove 37,000 persons from liability to income tax and marginal relief will benefit many more.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Subsidiary Allowances</i></P>
    <P>An additional tax allowance for one-parent families was introduced in 1979 and increased last year.  I appreciate that the difficulties, financial and otherwise, of providing for a family are particularly acute when the burden falls on one parent. I am therefore proposing to increase the one-parent family allowance from its present level of £500 to £650.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Relief in Respect of Residence-Related Work</i></P>
    <P>A scheme of tax relief to encourage residence-related employment was introduced in 1979 on a temporary basis.  It was decided last year to continue it for another year because the postal dispute of 1979 had seriously disrupted its operation. <Col N="417" /> In view of the unemployment situation I am proposing that the scheme be further extended for another year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Taxation of Self-Employed</i></P>
    <P>In the course of his Financial Statement last year, my predecessor indicated that he was examining the possibility of bringing the PAYE sector and the self-employed to an equivalent basis of assessment. An arrangement which would be effective and equitable poses difficult and complex problems.  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing their examination of the technical aspects of this matter.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the income tax changes which I have outlined, inclusive of the cost of the extended PAYE allowance, is £60 million in 1981 and £93 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I recognise the burden which is borne by PAYE taxpayers in particular.  Naturally, I would have preferred to have been able to grant them greater relief. However, given the financial realities which I must take into consideration and especially the need to provide substantial improvements in social welfare payments, I have gone as far as I can on this occasion.</P>
    <P>TAXATION OF BUSINESS</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Corporation Tax</i></P>
    <P>I turn now to business taxation.  The Finance Act, 1980, provided for the introduction of the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax for manufacturing industry generally with effect from 1 January last.  The scheme replaces export sales relief, which has been our major industrial incentive for many years, and should be of special benefit to firms selling on the home market.  It will assist the IDA in the increasingly competitive task of inducing mobile international investment to locate manufacturing projects in this country.  Corporation tax accounted for only 5 per cent of tax revenue last year and corporation tax paid by manufacturing industry for only an estimated 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Finance Bill last year, my predecessor <Col N="418" /> indicated that the Government intended, depending on the outcome of discussions with the EEC Commission, to make provision in the 1981 Finance Bill for the extension of the 10 per cent scheme to certain of the non-manufacturing activities which had benefited from export sales relief.  These activities are the repair of ships, the production of fish on a fish farm and the cultivation of mushrooms. He also indicated that it was intended to extend the scheme to non-manufacturing services at Shannon.  Discussions with the Commission are continuing and I would hope to include the necessary provision in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Payment Dates for Corporation Tax</i></P>
    <P>Companies are required to pay corporation tax in two instalments.  The first payment is due nine months from the end of their accounting period while the date of payment of the second instalment can vary as between companies from nine to 21 months.  This is an exceptionally generous arrangement compared with the treatment of personal taxpayers either under PAYE or Schedule D.  It can mean, when account is taken of the two-month period of grace in relation to interest on overdue tax, that the second instalment of tax might not be paid, in the extreme case, until 23 months from the end of the accounting period in which the relevant profits have been earned.  The case, on grounds of tax equity, in favour of bringing forward the dates of payment of tax by companies has been well recognised for some time.</P>
    <P>I have considered the question carefully and I now propose that the date of payment for the second instalment of corporation tax for all companies should be brought forward by three months, but not so as to make the due date fall earlier than nine months from the end of the accounting period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This change will apply in respect of accounting periods ending on or after 6 April 1980.  For companies affected in this financial year, the <Col N="419" /> payment date will in general be brought forward from early 1982 to late 1981.  For instance, in the case where a company's due date for the second instalment is at present 1 January 1982 the new due date will be 1 October 1981.  The normal period of grace will continue to apply. This change will also mean that the timing of tax payments by companies will be brought more into line with that applicable to unincorporated traders with the same accounting periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved is a three months' advancement in the date of payment.  It is an increase neither in the rate of tax nor in the amount of tax payable by companies.  It will have the effect of increasing Exchequer revenue in the closing months of 1981 by an estimated £66 million.</P>
      <P>
        <i>New Special Incentives for Capital Development</i>
      </P>
      <P>I spoke earlier of the Government's policy to encourage greater participation by the private sector in capital development. With this objective in mind, and also to generate employment, I propose to introduce a new special allowance of 100 per cent in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation. The new allowance, which would be set against rental income, should increase the attractiveness of investment in a sector where a recognised need exists, especially in our major towns and cities and in areas affected by the Government's plan for public service decentralisation.  The allowance will apply to qualifying expenditure incurred after today and will be subject to review at the end of a three-year period.  Details will be announced at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also considering whether an incentive might be appropriate in relation to the provision by the private sector of multi-storey car-parks and toll roads and bridges.  Allowance in those cases could act as a positive inducement to the private <Col N="420" /> sector to become more actively involved in some essential infrastructure requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Also with a view to encouraging greater private sector investment in capital development, I have decided that in cases where industrial buildings are leased to State-sponsored industrial promotion agencies and subleased by them to industrial occupants, an initial allowance of 50 per cent will be available on the expenditure.  This brings the position of lessors in these cases into line with cases in which the lessor contracts directly with the industrialist.</P>
      <P>There will be no cost to the Exchequer in 1981 as a consequence of the proposed new allowances.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Stock Relief</i></P>
      <P>Stock relief is a temporary measure, renewable on an annual basis, providing relief to traders in certain sectors to compensate them for the effects of the increased cost of replacing stock in an inflationary period.  Under present legislation the relief is available for companies in respect of accounting periods ending before 6 April 1980 and for individuals in respect of the year of assessment 1980-81. I have decided that stock relief should be continued for a further year.  This extension of the relief, which for trades other than farming will be at the present 75 per cent level, will cost the Exchequer £3 million in 1981.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Taxation of Financial Institutions</i></P>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation is investigating in depth the question of the taxation of financial institutions.  Because the commission is examining the matter, I do not propose any changes in existing arrangements this year.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Indirect Taxation</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased social welfare benefits and the other concessions and improvements which I have just announced <Col N="421" /> clearly require additional revenue to finance them.  It would, as I have already explained, be contrary to Government policy to increase the rates of direct taxes at the present juncture when private sector enterprise, particularly of individuals, is all important.  Bearing in mind also that rising prices have the effect of reducing the real level of those excise duties which are charged on a flat-rate basis rather than on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis, I am turning to such duties as the principal source of the additional revenue needed.  An added factor influencing this decision is the discretionary and less-essential nature of a large proportion of the consumption involved.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Petrol, Road Diesel and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) used in Motor Vehicles</i></P>
    <P>Revenue, balance of payments and energy conservation reasons all point to the appropriateness of an increase in the duty on petrol and hydrocarbon fuels used in motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I propose a tax increase of 15p per gallon on petrol and road diesel, and an increase of 10p per gallon on LPG used in motor vehicles in order to preserve the present tax relationship with diesel.  Bus fares will not be affected because there will be a rebate for diesel oil used in buses on services scheduled in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing any increase in the rate of duty on other hydrocarbon fuels.  Instead, I would draw the attention of large-scale energy users in the manufacturing sector to the new energy conservation incentive scheme in the 1981 Estimates.</P>
      <P>I am proposing one very specific concession by way of partial rebate of the existing duty.  Sea fishermen are substantial users of hydrocarbon oil and I am satisfied that a measure of relief is warranted in their particular circumstances. Accordingly, I propose to provide in the Finance Bill for a partial rebate in their case of 2p per gallon and for the necessary procedures and controls under which the rebate will be operated.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Tobacco Products</i></P>
      <P>I am proposing a tax increase of 10p on the packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category with <i>pro rata</i> increases for cigars and other tobacco products.  These increases are estimated to bring in extra revenue of £23 million in 1981.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Beer</i></P>
      <P>An increase of 6p in the tax element in the retail price of the pint of beer.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £32 million this year.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Spirits</i></P>
      <P>I am aware that home distillers are facing difficulties at present but I must nevertheless, for the sake of revenue needs and having regard to the taxation of beer, propose an additional 12p tax in the retail price of a glass of spirits.  This represents an extra 6p on the normal half-glass measure.  This is estimated to bring in extra revenue of £14 million in 1981.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Wine and Made Wine</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tax increase of 25p is proposed in the retail price of a bottle of table wine. <Col N="423" /> The increase will be <i>pro rata</i> for stronger wines, and for sparkling wines the proposed increase is 50p per bottle.  The extra revenue expected this year is £3 million.</P>

      <P>Finally in relation to indirect taxes, I propose to increase the initial and annual registration charges for cars of 16 horse power and under from £10 to £20.  The new rate will apply from March and will yield an extra £6 million in 1981.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="424" /> TAX EVASION AND AVOIDANCE</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance and tax evasion are subjects which arouse strong feelings in the general body of taxpayers, who rightly condemn such activities which clearly operate to their detriment.  Sometimes much is made of the legal distinctions between these two areas, tax evasion being defined as a straight-forward breach of the tax law while tax avoidance is a careful and well-planned exploitation of that law and is defended on the ground that the letter of the law is not breached. As has been stated before, the margin between avoidance and evasion in many cases is no more than hairline.  This is particularly so where the device used by the tax avoider involves the use of artificial and legalistic arrangements which serve no economic or commercial purpose but are entered into for the sole purpose of avoiding tax.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for ambivalent thinking on this subject.  The taxes payable are imposed in the name of the community and are expended on purposes determined by the community in a democratic process.</P>
    <P>Whatever merit the distinction between evasion and avoidance may carry in law, it carries none for the general body of taxpayers who must bear, in addition to their own share of the total tax burden, that part of the tax load of which the evader and the avoider have divested themselves.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it behoves the Government and the Minister for Finance to take such steps as will ensure that all citizens pay their appropriate share of tax.  To achieve this objective two requirements are essential.  First, the system must contain adequate measures which not alone will provide for the detection of evasion but will act also as a deterrent to evasion and avoidance.  Secondly, adequate Revenue staff is needed to apply the tax system effectively.</P>
    <P>In recent years action has been taken to meet these requirements.  Large numbers of additional staff have been made available to the Revenue Commissioners and, as Minister for the Public Service, I <Col N="425" /> have taken a personal interest in ensuring that staffing in this area is adequate.  The additional staff, even allowing for such factors as the time needed for training, have already achieved results.  The new resources enabled the Revenue Commissioners to strengthen their staffs, particularly in the tax districts where counter-evasion is part of the day's work.  Specialist divisions were also set up to deal with the more difficult cases.  In the past year the number of staff&mdash;inspectors and accountants&mdash;attached to the Taxes Investigation Branch has been doubled and the number of cases referred to that branch for investigation has doubled also.</P>
    <P>The special inquiry units set up in 1979 to seek out those not already on record brought in 14,000 cases.  Over 8,000 of these have already been brought into charge and the remainder are under investigation.  In 1979 alone, £2.75 million was recovered in back duty.  Court proceedings were initiated in over 900 cases, the majority for failure to make returns.  Penalty proceedings in connection with under-payments of tax were taken in a number of cases.  In recent years, the Revenue Commissioners have been asked to place more emphasis on legal proceedings, rather than on agreed monetary settlements, in cases where there have been false declarations and fraud.  They have this course of action very much in mind when looking at the back duty cases which come before them.</P>
    <P>The penalties in the Income Tax Acts for various offences have remained unchanged for many years.  I will be looking at them to see how best they may be adjusted so that they will be seen as an effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>A major problem in relation to tax avoidance schemes is that, traditionally, the corrective legislation applies only from a current date, so that the tax avoider will already have secured the benefit of his avoidance devices for an extended period.  I am concerned that greater control should be exercised to ensure that our taxation system is not subjected to this abuse.  I would advise tax planners and tax avoiders that they should not assume that future anti-avoidance legislation <Col N="426" /> will invariably apply from a current date.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to post office charges.  These are classified as non-tax revenue.  In principle, the postal and telecommunications services are expected to pay their way but, in fact, they have been incurring heavy losses.  In 1978 and 1979 &mdash; years that were particularly difficult because of lengthy strikes &mdash; the deficits on these services were £19 million and £42 million respectively.  Although charges were increased in 1979 and again in 1980 to meet sharply rising costs, there was a deficit of about £27 million last year.  It is expected that there would be a further large deficit this year if present rates of charge continued in force.</P>
    <P>The deficits on Post Office services have to be met from general taxation.  It cannot be expected that taxpayers generally should continue to carry such heavy losses.  It is proposed, therefore, to increase postal and telecommunications charges by an amount sufficient to produce a cash yield of £35 million during 1981.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will announce the details later.</P>

      <P>The Government are concerned about the position of the disabled and the handicapped.  Many of these members of our society have special needs and are particularly deserving of support and sympathy.</P>
      <P>I propose, therefore, to make a number of improvements in existing reliefs and allowances.  It is particularly appropriate to do so since 1981 has been designated by the United Nations as the International Year for Disabled Persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already announced that long-term weekly social welfare payments will be increased by 25 per cent from next April.  This increases will, of course, apply to the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The payment of allowances in respect of dependants of disabled persons is also being reviewed in accordance with the undertaking given in the national understanding.  The <Col N="427" /> details of a new scheme for such allowances are being worked out and will be announced later.  I expect that the new arrangements can be implemented in the autumn and a provisional allocation has beeen included in the global provision of £111 million for social welfare and health improvements which I have already quoted.</P>
    <P>I am making separate provisions for a number of other improvements and reliefs.</P>
    <P>I am raising the blind person's tax allowance from £330 to £440.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Where both spouses are blind, the difficulties are more than correspondingly increased and accordingly I propose that, in such a case, the allowance will be increased from £660 to £1,000.</P>
      <P>I propose to increase the incapacitated child tax allowance from £390 to £500.</P>
      <P>A tax allowance of £330 is available where an individual or his wife is totally incapacitated throughout the year of assessment and is obliged to employ someone to take care of him or his incapacitated spouse.  I am increasing this allowance to £500.</P>
      <P>I have also been considering the position of the disabled under the VAT code. I propose to provide complete relief from VAT on certain medical aids such as wheelchairs, orthopaedic appliances and the like.</P>
      <P>The domiciliary care allowances payable by the health boards to parents of handicapped children who require constant attention at home will be increased from its present level of £35 to £45 a month, effective from April 1981.</P>
      <P>Also from April, the mobility allowance of £150 for severely handicapped persons will be raised to £200 and will be extended to persons in certain institutions who fulfil the standard criteria for entitlement.  The ceiling on the motorised transport allowance for the disabled will be increased from £1,000 to £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also propose that, from April, the free telephone rental scheme will be <Col N="428" /> extended to include recipients of the disabled person's maintenance allowance under the same conditions as apply at present but with no age limit.</P>
    <P>Finally, I propose to provide for an increase in the weekly spending allowance for physically and mentally handicapped persons in long-term residential care.  The increase will have the effect of raising the average allowance from £2.50 a week to £4 a week.  It will take effect from April next.  The total cost of these special improvements will be £1.4 million in 1981, that is £0.7 million for tax reliefs and £0.7 million for additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>Consultations have commenced with regard to the Green Paper, referred to in the national understanding, on certain aspects of services for the handicapped. Publication of the paper is expected in the course of the year.  The national understanding also referred to the Government's commitment to increase employment opportunities for disabled persons in the public sector and confirmed their aim to achieve a quota of 3 per cent as quickly as possible.  I am pleased to say that the Government have been assured of the full co-operation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in working towards this goal.  I am confident that significant progress will be made during 1981.</P>
    <P>I hope that these measures will be seen by the disabled as a positive gesture by the Government, on behalf of the community, showing their concern.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Veterans of the War of Independence</i>
    </P>
    <P>In a somewhat similar context, I turn now to veterans of the War of Independence. Because of the very special service which they have given, it is fitting that we should do our utmost for them and their families, especially where they are in difficult circumstances.  I propose, therefore, to provide some improvements for them and for their widows.</P>
    <P>I propose to increase the rate of military service pension by 20 per cent, subject to a minimum of £500 a year for a pensioner, or £250 a year for the widow of a pensioner.</P>
    <P>I am increasing in each case the appropriate <Col N="429" /> annual sum payable to special allowance holders by £60.</P>
    <P>I propose to raise the allowance payable to widows of special allowance holders from £185 to £225.</P>
    <P>Finally, I intend to extend the free telephone rental scheme to the widows of veterans.</P>
    <P>These concessions will come into force with effect from 1 July 1981.  The estimated cost in the current year will be £0.5 million.</P>

      <P>When the various expenditure and taxation proposals which I have outlined are brought together, it will be seen that the expenditure proposals will result in a net addition to the expenditure side of the budget of £197 million while the revenue adjustments add £161 million net to the receipts side.  This will increase the opening deficit on current account by £36 million but Departments have on hands an estimated £45 million in balances from 1980 which reduce, to that extent, the amount which has to be issued from the Exchequer.  The estimated current budget deficit emerges therefore as £515 million, or 5¼ per cent of GNP.  This compares with a deficit of <Col N="430" /> £547 million, or 6½ per cent of GNP, last year.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the public capital programme is estimated at £1,733 million. To this has to be added a sum of £87 million comprised of the contingency provision of £70 million which I mentioned earlier and £17 million for other capital expenditures outside the public capital programme.  These bring total public capital expenditure in 1981 to £1,820 million.  The resources available to defray capital expenditure, including the projected £200 million from private sector participation, are estimated at £1,039 million, leaving a balance of £781 million which will be found by borrowing.</P>
      <P>Together with the current budget deficit of £515 million, the total estimate of Exchequer borrowing for 1981 is £1,296 million, or 13 per cent of GNP.  This compares with borrowing last year of £1,217 million, or 14½ per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>The Government have for a considerable time now been concerned with the problems of vulnerable and sensitive industries.  The change to fully pay-related contributions in funding social insurance expenditures, while principally taken for other reasons, was, in practice, of major assistance to these industries, which are mainly labour-intensive. It will also be recalled that the employment maintenance scheme and its successor, the employers' temporary subvention scheme, made a further major contribution towards securing employment in the textiles, clothing and footwear sectors, but had to be terminated following objections by the EEC Commission that they represented a distortion of competition through State aids contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  In view of these EEC objectives, it must be recognised that the difficulties involved are very great.  The Government are, however, continuing to examine the problem to see if firms with a prospect of long-term viability can be helped through temporary difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="431" /> I might add that the services of Fóir Teoranta are available to any firm which may be experiencing temporary or cyclical difficulties but which is potentially viable in the long run.

      <P>The fiscal policy followed in the budget will help to contain the balance of payments deficit. Unnecessary increases in current expenditure have been eliminated, without cutting back on essential services.  The tax <Col N="432" /> adjustments have not been excessive and should be beneficial to the balance of payments.</P>
      <P>The indirect tax changes will have only a moderate effect on the consumer price index.  In the case of most people this impact will be offset, wholly or partly, either by the direct tax reliefs I have also announced, or by social welfare increases.</P>
      <P>The national understanding restated the Government's commitment to increase social welfare payments at least in line with the cost of living.  That commitment has been generously honoured by the increased benefits which I have announced today.</P>
      <P>The budget recognises the difficulties of the farming community and, to the extent feasible, seeks to relieve them.</P>

      <P>Much of it has been irresponsible and partisan, but to those commentators who are genuinely concerned I would say this: the supplementary expenditures sanctioned last year represented for the most part deliberate and considered departures from budgetary policy to meet the needs of the emerging economic situation.  The relevant borrowing was fully justified by reference to those needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general issue, borrowing may be high but there is no question of Government complacency about it.  Exchequer borrowing will, as a result of this budget, be reduced from last year's figure of 14½ per cent of GNP to 13 per cent this year.  This represents substantial progress.  It might be argued that, ideally, the reduction in the current deficit &mdash; and <Col N="433" /> consequently in the borrowing requirement &mdash; should be greater.  However, harsh measures could cause severe hardship and unemployment at any time, but particularly at this time of world recession.</P>

      <P>That, obviously, is also the view of the more responsible commentators.  They also recognise that appropriate remedial action should be effected over time.  That is why Government policy must be related to and will be presented in its medium-term context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's reduction in the borrowing requirement as a proportion of GNP does not of itself give the full picture of the improvement in the public finances. Within the expenditure programmes covered by that borrowing requirement, there has been a major shift to productive capital expenditure.  The investment, and the growth which will follow from it, will greatly increase the financial resources of the economy and assist in the eventual elimination of the Exchequer current deficit. The growth potential of the investment will be supported by a uniquely beneficial tax régime over a large area of private industry, by reasonable levels of personal taxation, by competitive interest rates, by abundant credit for viable entrepreneurial enterprise and by an independent, stable currency by reference <Col N="434" /> to all the mainland European currencies.</P>

      <P>The achievement of growth and prosperity depends on the degree of response to this investment and the favourable fiscal and monetary environment.</P>
      <P>There is, I believe, a growing realisation in our community of the problems facing this country in today's world.  This realisation must be turned to practical effect.  I believe that our people are now open to conviction that rising living standards cannot be expected without effort and discipline.  Today's budget provides a strong impetus to economic growth while at the same time marking a step forward in social progress.</P>

      <P>This budget aggravates our ecomomic situation and represents the continuance of the policy of drift and expediency on the part of the present Government.  On the two basic issues facing this country this budget will do nothing but harm.  This budget is bad for employment and will increase the cost of living.  It administers a crippling blow to industry.  All incorporated business will, as a result of this budget, have to pay one and a half year's tax in one year and at current interest rates and given the fact that many of them are deep in debt at the moment this burden imposed upon them this year by the Minister for Finance will drive many of them over the brink into bankruptcy and will create many redundancies and aggravate our already acute unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>This budget does nothing for agriculture. All that we can see here are a few inconsequential crumbs offered to the farming community which bear no relation whatsoever to the magnitude of the problems being faced by our primary industry at this time.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the budget for the PAYE taxpayer.  In fact as a result of the budget and as a result of the normal trend in incomes over the past 12 months the real burden of income tax after this budget will be greater than it was 12 months ago and this is an incontrovertible fact which I shall demonstrate.  The position is that for a married man the thresholds and bands cumulatively will have been increased between 4 and 9 per cent as a result of this budget in a year in which inflation has increased by 18 per cent.  So, in fact, we have not had indexation of the tax free allowance and the increases in the allowances which have taken place will not prevent a larger slice of the real income, the real take-home pay of the man or woman in PAYE employment, being taken as a result of the policy of drift in taxation which is occurring here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the concessions for the farming community are mere crumbs.  It has been calculated that to bring farmers back to the income position that they enjoyed relative to the rest of the community in 1978, a transfer of resources to <Col N="454" /> agriculture of approximately £645 million would be needed.  What does this budget do?  It offers them £29 million, a mere 5 per cent of what is needed.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in this budget for the PAYE taxpayer in his basic personal allowance.  Only one of the tax bands, the 35p band, has been raised.  So there has not been indexation of tax for the PAYE sector of this community this year.  This budget will also increase the cost of living.  I estimate that it will increase it directly by a mimimum of 2 per cent and that the consequential increases in the cost of living by the normal operation of the knock-on effect that occurs when an initial price is increased will bring the total increase in the cost of living resulting from this budget up to, at a conservative estimate, 3 per cent, We now have a situation where this Government since they came to office have increased in tax the price of the pint by 15p; we have a situation that since they came into office the Government have increased the price of a gallon of petrol by almost 30p.  All of this has happened with no improvement in our finances.  In fact, despite all of these burdens being imposed on the community our financial situation is getting worse.  This State was founded 60 years ago on a policy of self-reliance, a policy of Sinn Féin.  But now, as a result of the utter and irresponsible policy of the present Government, continued and aggravated in this budget, our economic future depends not on ourselves but on the good will of the international banking community.  In economic terms we are less independent now as a country than at any time since this State was founded.</P>
    <P>This Government started in 1977 with a strategy contained in their election manifesto.  That strategy, in every measure that it set itself, has been a complete and abject failure.  Government policy is not about figures, it is about giving leadership, about helping people to understand what can be done and what cannot be done and helping them to achieve what can be done.  Economists have no magic solutions.  What is needed is a government with courage and conviction and this Government have neither.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> Some might argue that the most important fact about this budget is that it is not to be trusted because of the proven unreliability of the figures underlying the budgets of 1979 and 1980.  I do not share that view.  To my mind a most important fact about this budget is that it retains the economic strategy which has quite simply failed.  This strategy, first announced by the Government in 1976 and amplified in the 1977 manifesto and pursued right up to the present, has achieved none of the targets it set itself.  Both the men and the measures have proved failures and both should be changed.  Let me illustrate. According to the Government's declared economic strategy in 1977 unemployment should now be down to 32,000; it is 122,000 and rising.  According to their declared plan in 1977 the rate of price increase in 1980 should have been 5 per cent; it is 18 per cent.  According to their plan the gross national product in 1980 should have risen by 7 per cent; it did not rise at all.  According to their strategy a campaign would be initiated which, over three years would transfer 3p in every £ spent in Ireland from imported goods to Irish produced goods.  We are now at the end of three years and instead of transferring 3p in the £ from imported goods to Irish produced goods we have had a move in the opposite direction. Now 2p more in every £ is spent on imported goods than was spent when this Government initiated their programme. On practically every index they have abjectly failed to meet their own self-declared targets.</P>
    <P>It is not only as against their own targets that they have failed.  In absolute terms the situation is much worse than it was in 1977.  The level of unemployment fell in 1977 and in 1980 it rose by 34,000, the highest ever recorded rise in unemployment in one year, since figures were kept.  In 1977 our economy was growing at a rate of 5 per cent a year, not adequate but very significant.  In 1980 our economy did not grow at all.  Agricultural output in 1977 rose by one-third; in 1980 it fell. In terms of real money the average worker is now paying £120 more a year in income tax, and the situation will disimprove <Col N="456" /> when this budget comes into effect, than he paid in 1977.  Yet after all of this we owe more than we did in 1977. In 1977 our net debt to foreign banks was £170 million but it is now almost ten times that amount&mdash;it is £1,600 million.  This is the result not merely of incompetence and the failure of men but of the failure of the policy of the Government.  The Government's economic strategy in 1977 has collapsed and they do not know what to do.  They are lurching from one expedient to the next hoping that something will turn up.  It has not yet and this budget has not improved the prospects of finding a solution.  The experiment with Fianna Fáil's economic theories has cost us dearly.  About 80 per cent of all the Government collected in income tax last year will now simply go to servicing the debts of the Government.  Our external reserves, the foundation upon which our currency, our creditworthiness and our economic stability rests, have been depleted to half their effective level of 1977.  This Government have mortgaged our future.</P>
    <P>It is time for us to ask ourselves some awkward questions about economic strategy. After almost ten years of Government budget deficits incurred deliberately so as to create employment we now have almost twice as many people unemployed as we had in 1970 when this policy of budget deficits was initiated by the present Tánaiste.  The lesson we have failed to learn is that deficit budgets, spending more than we earn, may make sense in a closed economy with spare capacity but in an open economy which imports so much, such a policy does not work.  It creates jobs but the jobs are not in Ireland.  The latest example of the error of this strategy is to be found in the so-called investment plan announced a short time ago by the Minister for Finance.  Under it, Aer Lingus, who are laying off staff, are to get £19 million. This is to be spent on buying a jet.  The purchase of that jet will create jobs but the Minister forgot to tell us that they will not be in Collinstown, County Dublin, but that they will be in Seattle, Washington. That is the type of job creation that we have as a result of much of the material <Col N="457" /> contained in the investment plan. Government investment and Government spending involve taking money from one person and giving it to another. The Government now spend 61p of every £ produced here and of that 61p 39p is being taken from the taxpayer of today and 22p is being postponed to be taken from tomorrow's taxpayer.  There is no doubt that we are not getting value for the 61p that the Government are spending out of every £.  That is why Fine Gael have put forward and will amplify detailed plans to reorganise the entire method whereby public money is disbursed, and will introduce a new long-term system of budgeting to give much greater public control over the way in which expenditure is sanctioned in this State.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this budget is not that it is based on unreliable figures but the fact that it represents an economic strategy which has abysmally failed.  I cannot but refer to the manifest unreliability of this budget and of the documents upon which it rests.  One of the first requirements of any budget is that it should be honest.  I am afraid that this budget does not live up to that requirement.  In the past this Government have got their figures so wrong that one could only have scepticism about the figures in this budget.  In 1979 they spent £130 million more than they promised to spend having made a solemn declaration that they would maintain the level of expenditure at no more than what was budgeted for.  In 1980 they were worse, they spent £300 million more than they had solemnly declared in their budget would be spent.</P>
    <P>If the Government without consulting the Dáil or anyone else can simply abandon spending targets set out in the budget this exercise that we are going through is virtually useless.  It deprives and has deprives the words uttered by Ministers for Finance on budget day of their meaning. I will give a few examples of the incredible utterances of Ministers on budget day.  In 1978 the Minister for Finance said that his target for pay in 1978 was 8 per cent and he underlined this by saying that the Government's <Col N="458" /> commitment to this was unequivocal and that they should take the necessary measures to ensure that excessive increases, if any, were recovered from those who achieved them.  As everybody knows, in 1978 pay went up not by 8 per cent but by 16 per cent and the Minister did not do anything.  In fact when 1979 came around the Minister tried to take credit for what happened when he said that this was amongst the largest rises in living standards ever recorded in this country, and he forgot about what he had said the previous year.  In 1980 the same thing happened all over again.  The Minister set aside £100 million for further pay increases in the 1980 budget and he said that if this had to be increased he was determined that it should not be paid by borrowing.  Of course, it was increased to £182 million and it was paid by borrowing. This year's figures are equally bizarre and unreliable.  The Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Transport, the Department of Defence, the Department of Social Welfare and the Stationery Office are very important departments, and, according to official estimates, they will spend £750,000 less on telephone calls and letters than they did in 1980.  Did they consult the Minister for Finance about the increase in postal charges before they put their Estimates in?  If the Government believe there will be this saving of £750,000 on sending out those letters in this year above any other year they will believe anything.</P>
    <P>Various Departments, according to official estimates, will actually cut their travelling expenses.  Did they consider the increase in the price of petrol that was to be introduced?  They are to save £1.2 million in travelling expenses according to the figures upon which the speech of the Minister for Finance today was based. The gardaí will obviously stay in the stations because they are supposed to save £500,000 in travelling expenses this year according to the figures on which the budget is based.  It gets better the deeper one goes into it.  The Army and the Navy are to save us £9 million by running down their stores.  When it comes to December, if a man has torn his uniform he will be <Col N="459" /> told he has to sew it himself because there is no replacement.  The Government will run down the stores of the Army and the Navy but those stores will have to be built up next year so there will not be any actual saving.  We see how incredible the type of figures are that the Government have based this budget on.</P>
    <P>A number of Departments are to reduce their expenditure on fees to international organisations.  I have not heard of any international organisation which have reduced their fees.  If any member of the Government has heard of this I would be delighted if we could be told which one it is.  According to official figures put before us by the Minister for Finance a number of Departments will actually reduce the fees paid to international organisations.  The Government should have told us if they plan to resign from any international organisations during 1981.  I do not believe they do and I believe that the figure for reductions in expenditure under that heading is bogus.</P>
    <P>We will, according to the Book of Estimates, cut back on school transport. The Minister for Education has left the House but, according to the Estimates presented by his Department, there will be a saving of £500,000 on school transport. We all know that the cost of running a bus this year will be more than it was last year.  The Government can only save this money by putting the children off the buses or providing additional money later in the year.  I believe they will do the latter and the cut of £500,000 is a bogus cut inserted in the estimates for the purpose of deceiving the public about the balance of the budget.  If they intend charging for school bus services or putting the children off the buses I hope they are honest enough to tell us that straight away.  It is clear from the few examples I have given of the type of figures the Government are asking the House to accept that they are not honest.  There are examples in the budget of reckless misestimation of expenditure.  This must stop if there is to be any attempt at honest budgeting.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have very little regard for truth in the economic <Col N="460" /> figures they present to the House.  One example of this I can give is very serious because it possibly involves deceit by the Government in relation to the social partners. The national understanding was published last October.  According to the Government in the solemn understanding they entered into with the social partners the national understanding tells us that the number of jobs in manufacturing industry up to the end of 1980 would increase by 25,000.  Now, scarcely three months later, we have this budget.  In paragraph 19 of the national understanding we are told that it is estimated that on average during 1980 there was very little change on the 1979 level of employment, an increase in service employment being offset by a decline in agricultural employment and a decline in industrial employment.  I do not know if the trade unions were taken in by what the Government put in the national understanding but there seems to be a great contrast between the economic background to the budget and the national understanding. This seems to indicate that the Government were trying to deceive the social partners in the national understanding or they simply did not know what was going on in the country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very badly misinformed about the economic situation when he delivered his speech on 17 August last year at 12.45 p.m. at a Fianna Fáil meeting held in the West County Hotel, Ennis.  They came in early to meet him but they did not get a lot for their trouble.  The Taoiseach told the people at that meeting that the financial strategy of the 1980 budget had been successful, the financial target set had been generally adhered to, the balance of payments situation had stabilised and our external reserves position was maintained and even improved.  Everybody knew then and everybody knows now that the financial strategy of the budget was not successful. The financial targets had not been adhered to, as far as expenditure and borrowing were concerned; they were grossly exceeded and the balance of payments situation got much worse during last year.  The Taoiseach in that speech in Ennis was able to give this <Col N="461" /> deceptive balm to the supporters who had come to hear him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with certain aspects of the budget.  Before I refer to them I would like to say on my own behalf and on behalf of my party that the provisions in the budget in regard to the increases to social welfare recipients are very welcome.  They are very necessary.  I realise they cost a considerable amount of money and nobody should attempt to minimise the cost of them.  The Government are to be commended for the increases they have introduced for this very deserving sector of our community.  There are many misunderstandings inside and outside this House about the position of people in receipt of social welfare.  I know &mdash; and I am sure members of the Government know &mdash; that their situation is far from good.  The increases introduced on this occasion are all the more welcome for that reason.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I must express my disappointment that the Government have done nothing significant about the position of large families.  I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are aware of the recommendations made in Reports Nos. 37 and 47 of the National Economic and Social Council on the position of large families.  In those documents it has been made quite clear that in recent years the position of large families has worsened gravely.  While the position of a married couple may have improved, and the position of a married couple with two children may have been maintained at more or less the same level <i>vis-á-vis</i> previous years, the position of a married couple with a family of six children or more has worsened gravely as a result of the fiscal changes made in recent budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government accepted in the national understanding that something should be done about this.  In paragraph 30 they undertook to examine very carefully <Col N="462" /> the question of family income support, and accepted that the relevant NESC reports to which I have referred provided a basis upon which this might be done.  Therefore, I am very disappointed that they have done nothing about most of the recommendations made in the reports.  I will itemise the recommendations and the costs, and we will see that something should have been done about them.  There was a recommendation for £1 per week extra for children over 12 years of age which would have cost £3 million.  It takes account of the fact that children in the age group between 12 and 16 years are at the most expensive period so far as the outgoings of the parents are concerned.  In view of the relatively modest cost and the relatively significant benefit of that concession, the Government should have done something along those lines.</P>
    <P>The NESC report also recommended an additional clothing grant for poor families in the month of September to allow children to be clothed going back to school.  It was estimated that that would cost about £1.35 million.  The Government did not see their way in this budget to do anything about that, and I must express my disappointment.</P>
    <P>Furthermore &mdash; and perhaps this is the one I am most disappointed about &mdash; the Government were asked by the NESC to give an extra £1 per month per child to families where the number of children exceeds six.  It is well accepted that the incidence of families of that size is largest amongst the poorest sections of the community. While one might criticise the children's allowances provisions in general on the grounds that they are indiscriminate, any additional benefit given to large families, given to families with over six children, would undoubtedly go in large measure to the poorer sections of the community and would exclude most of the families who do not really need it from getting whatever extra help was being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy taking into account the increased children's allowances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that an additional increase was recommended by the NESC over whatever level was being given at the time.  I am quoting from Report No. 47.  The Government could have done something extra for the large families.  Perhaps it is not too late to do something about them between now and the announcement of the final arrangements by the Minister for Social Welfare. If my words have any impact in that direction I will be only too pleased.  Indeed, I am glad the Taoiseach is paying such attention to what I am saying in this regard.  In view of the report presented to the Minister for Social Welfare by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul I am sorry that more has not been done for people who are living alone, old people without the basic amenities of water and proper sanitary facilities in their houses.  Something extra should have been done in this budget to help those people.</P>
      <P>I am particularly disappointed at the increase in postal charges.  These increases are above the rate of inflation and above the rise in pay costs in the Post Office.  Obviously some inefficiency is disclosed by the fact that they were necessary. I should also like &mdash; and this is a very important point &mdash; to draw particular attention to the claim made by the Government that they would reduce the borrowing requirement for this year.  I believe that is not true, because they are deducting from the borrowing requirement the £200 million which is to come from the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the type of investment and the way in which it is being financed under this heading, the money which will come from the private sector, that £200 million, if it ever comes, will cost the Government more than if they had borrowed the money elsewhere when all the costs to the Government are analysed finally and worked out.  All this £200 million from the private sector represents is borrowing under another name.  Far from reducing the borrowing requirement if one were to include this £200 million as borrowing, as I believe it is, there would be no reduction in our borrowing requirement but, <Col N="464" /> in fact, a marginal increase this year on the figures presented by the Government which I have already indicated are highly dubious.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset &mdash; and I can do no better in conclusion than to repeat what I said &mdash; in this budget the Government have increased the cost of living and done nothing about employment.  In every respect, when the balance is taken into account they will aggravate our already alarming unemployment situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We must look at this budget against the background of the economy, things which are happening in the economy, things which have failed to happen in the past year, and the way the economy is likely to fare during the coming year as a result of decisions taken in recent weeks.  What the Minister had to say here today is an illustration of the fact that the Government wish to escape from the toils of the manifesto programme. They are prisoners of the economic recipes in the manifesto, and they have been unable to escape from the ridiculous policies in the manifesto and the borrowings resulting from it.  That programme was the gloomiest recipe ever foisted on our electorate.</P>
      <P>Features of the serious situation with which we are faced are a depressed agricultural industry and a stagnating industry which make the recession more serious than the recession facing the country in 1974-76.  If we take the critical state of agriculture in conjunction with falling output in industry, the present recession is likely to last much longer than did that of 1974-76.  What we heard here today would suggest that no remedy has been adopted to shorten the length of the recession and to hasten the day when our industry will begin to recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget repeats the errors of last year's budget by relying once more on increased indirect taxation.  This brings into action the clause on inflation in the national understanding which will see a very high rate struck by the unions in bargaining on the second phase.  No Government Minister, and certainly not the <Col N="465" /> Minister for Finance, can gainsay the fact that unemployment in 1981 will be an even more formidable problem to deal with than it was in 1980.</P>
    <P>The ESRI predict that before the end of this year there will be about 135,000 on the live register.  We understand that almost one quarter of those on the live register at the moment are under the age of 25.  This gives us a real figure of the order of 50,000 unemployed who are under the age of 25. I am sure everybody here will agree that unemployment is the major social evil in our society.  Any of us who appreciates that inflation is worsened as a result of increased reliance on indirect taxation cannot be in any way confident that this serious social evil is being tackled either in the first part or in the latter part of this year.  The level of redundancies in 1981 will cancel any gains made by the IDA in the area of grant-aided industrial job increases.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the critical position of public finances.  The Minister has suggested a new borrowing target for the current year and he compared the target adopted this year in this respect with the actual outturn in borrowing last year.  The comparison suggested that there was an improvement, a pruning down and a more prudent pose adopted in the area of borrowing this year.  However, the Minister forgot to mention what was mentioned by his predecessor as his borrowing target and which was exceeded. Consequently, there is a new law which we might refer to as Fitzgerald's law and which tells us to compare what happened last year with the projection for this year instead of comparing this year's projection with the projection for last year.  The Government are forced to live in this topsy-turvy world because of their having inherited the looney economic recipe of the manifesto.</P>
    <P>From 1977 on we have been pointing out the madness of adopting those policies. The excess borrowings of 1978-79 were undertaken at a time when they were not absolutely necessary.  That so-called pump priming referred to in the manifesto was not necessary.  The result of the excesses and the mistakes of those <Col N="466" /> years has left us in the position of having no manoeuvrability to deal with the worsening employment situation and this is at a time when we are facing perhaps a lengthier recession than that which we experienced in the years 1974 to 1976. Therefore, though our capital programme was increased last week, a case could be made for an even sharper increase in the capital programme.  But the exigencies of the situation will force the unions to seek higher wage increases than would have been the case otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that last year's budget had the effect of increasing the inflation rate in the quarter to mid-May by 7.4 per cent.  About 50 per cent of this increase in consumer prices was attributable directly to the action taken by the Minister in the budget for last year.  The indirect tax increases announced today will add about 3½ per cent to the consumer price index, that is including the Post Office charges, increases and the increased excise duties. I am confident that when the consumer price index figures for the period up to mid-February are made available, they will show an increase of 10 per cent or more for the previous nine months.  This increase will have been triggered by the indirect taxation imposed in this budget and the unions will have to react by seeking compensation in the second phase of the national understanding.  So far consumer prices for the period in question have increased by 6.1 per cent.  If I am correct in my estimation, it is clear that the increases in some of the items mentioned today will be the cause of forcing the unions to seek corresponding compensation by way of higher wages and that will be a fillip to inflation in the early months of this year, a situation which must have an impact on the prospects for employment creation in the second part of the year when, according to many experts, there will be a revival in international export markets.</P>
    <P>The borrowing programme of the Government has resulted in a serious balance of payments situation.  We can surmise that these increases which will add to the cost of living will mean that the Government must bank on any increase in <Col N="467" /> employment being based on this revival in the export market rather than on any expansion in home demand.  We cannot try that policy road.  It has been tried in years when it was not absolutely necessary but it is being denied to us now in times when a case might be made for it.</P>
    <P>I would be surprised if the Minister, in the light of his experience in the Department of Labour, would have penned that part of his speech in which he said that the trend of incomes will be crucial in determining to what extent we can share and exploit the expected international economic upsurge.  In other words, there is a recognition of what I am talking about.  The Minister admits that measures to increase the level of revenue will have an effect on the CPI and he says that the question of whether pay increases should compensate for increases in taxation on non-essential items has been raised frequently in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the adoption of this elderly statesman pose to these questions is no substitute for a recognition of the reality which he knows is inherent in the increases being imposed in the budget.  The reality is a fat claim from the unions in the second phase of the national understanding.  There is no point in hoping that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Government have very few options in dealing with the situation. They are forced, at least in theory, to suggest that borrowings must be wound down because while there are some who suggest that anxiety about indebtedness is a matter which may be simply the concern of only a few people, the reality is that for the past year we have been approaching the point where the servicing of our debts is almost equal to the entire take from income tax.  One would not need to know much about the situation to realise that is a road down which we cannot continue to travel indefinitely.</P>
    <P>It is clear that such has been the borrowing mistakes of the past few years that the weight of that borowing is now a burden and an impediment to taking the right measures at home.  In the two recessions we have faced &mdash; that of 1974 to <Col N="468" /> 1976 and the present one, which will be longer &mdash; the effort of the Government lay in preparing the economy for the upturn internationally.  Their decisions were such that they were geared to ensure that when foreign markets were in a position to take our goods once again they would be as good as possible to avail of the openings on those markets.  Mistakes were made during that time and our opponents were not averse to pointing out our errors.  Nevertheless the borrowing requirements of 1977, the national understandings and wage agreements signed and looked for by the Government in the latter period of the 1973-1977 Government, were such that we had secured free agreement from the unions on moderate pay agreements. Therefore we were in a position to avail of the opportunities accorded by the expansion on the foreign markets.</P>
    <P>I do not deny the fact that we were helped in those years and that the life of the recession was shortened because agriculture was in a buoyant state.  That is something which is absent now and is obviously retarding economic recovery. I take the point, as one not known as a great friend of the farmers as we are categorised in politics, that Irish agriculture is in a paralysed condition.  Some effort was made to assist agriculture today but, if I am to believe what a farmer's spokesman said in recent days, their situation is far more serious than the help offered to them in the budget would suggest.  There was a catastrophic drop of 24 per cent in their income last year.  There is no likelihood of an improvement in the common agriculture policy.  Anyone in the European Parliament or Commission knows that there are no increases or bonuses coming to Irish farmers from Europe.</P>
    <P>The state of agriculture in 1974-1976 had a lot to do with our recovery.  Any fair-minded person looking at that period would accept that the Government attempted to hold the line and preach economic reality.  From the first day of the present Government's arrival back in power the promises in the manifesto, which elected them all and which still limits their actions, had to be financed <Col N="469" /> from borrowing, which was unnecessary in the years of economic upturn.  The manifesto programme was responsible for the kind of expectations that arose in 1978 and 1979.  When they were satisfied we were robbed of the possibility to cope efficiently now in these dark days of reality with bringing the economy back on its feet and expanding employment once more.</P>
    <P>The budget cannot be supported on the basis that it does not enhance the increased possibility of employment later this year when the foreign markets return to take our produce once more.  As a small open economy we have expensively realised in the last few years that the exercise of pouring cash out on to it means that the imports bill rises and jobs do not increase in number as a result of that kind of misunderstanding in the late&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>His hands are not clean.  He was one of the chief members of the chorus, the gang of four, who introduced the manifesto in the first place.  They still live with the illusion that the manifesto did something for the economy. I described it as the looniest economic document ever foisted on the Irish electorate.  It won an election, but at great cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about increases as a result of <Col N="470" /> indirect taxation, the Minister for Finance said that the extra fuel charges would not be passed to CIE, but CIE are already cut £5 million in their Exchequer subvention and are busily preparing for an increase in their fares system.  Without any action taken here today CIE will be looking for increased fares.  Electricity charges are on the way up.  The ESB have applied to the National Prices Commission for an increase under the fuel variation clause.  We cannot blame the ESB for that.  The increase in the price of oil is not something we can lay at the door of the Government, but the increased duty and the increased price of petrol today will have folow-on effects in the economy.  We do not have any information about the size of the ESB increase. Last August the price rose by 19.5 per cent.  The increases in ESB charges are on the way.</P>
    <P>Looking at the budget we cannot be hopeful that the rate of inflation will drop to 15 per cent, as is expected this year. We had an inflation rate figure of 18 per cent last year.  If the budget has the effect of forcing the unions to look for compensatory wage increases under the 10 per cent increase in the consumer price index to mid-February clause, the figure of 15 per cent may be on the conservative side. The Minister has brought in, as he undertook to do in accordance with the national understanding, an increase in the tax free allowance of £200, from £400 to £600.  He has altered the bands for single people.  It would be a mistake to conclude that because the demonstration in Dublin last Sunday was not of the same proportion as demonstrations were when the Tánaiste was egging them on, making speeches on the morning and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The demand for tax reform goes very deep and it is to be doubted if the changes made here in the tax code will in any way dampen down the strong feelings there are throughout the work force for fundamental changes <Col N="471" /> in the tax system.  From the figures given in the estimates for receipts and expenditure the Government will take almost £200 million extra in tax this year.  Even with the allowances given under the tax changes in the budget they will be the net gainers from the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>It would be a mistake to conclude that because there was not the same number of demonstrators on the streets in Dublin last Sunday that people are satisfied with the existing tax system.  Part of the legacy of the manifesto philosophy is that nobody is satisfied in the country today. The Government are like a group of people beleaguered by demands, many of which they brought into being.  It is not so long ago since the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development was going around the country telling us that the miracle of European economies was our own.  In that type of situation he was largely responsible for bringing a great air of unreality into the expectations of many of the electorate.</P>
      <P>The national debt at the end of 1980 amounted to £7.5 billion, or almost £12,000 per PAYE taxpayer.  A very disturbing feature is that the total of our foreign debt has increased sharply under Fianna Fáil.  Foreign debt at the end of 1980 was almost £3 billion, or almost £5,000 per PAYE taxpayer.  By the end of this year, as a result of the proposals in the budget, every PAYE taxpayer will owe in excess of £6,000 in foreign currencies. Unemployment is at the highest figure ever in the history of the State.  During 1980 it rose by 34,000, the greatest rise in a single year.  We cannot say positively that the budget brings the day any nearer when unemployment will be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will probably be the last chapter in the manifesto saga.  I do not imagine this administration will be introducing another budget.  The budget may fail when it comes to the question of preparing the ground for expanding employment, and it may fail when it comes to the test of bringing some responsibility back into public finances. As a budget it is framed to present the best picture possible for a Government <Col N="472" /> anxious to test the will of the electorate. The Government should accept that it would be best from the point of view of the country to exorcise the ghost of the manifesto.  They should say that this is the end of the manifesto policies and test the popular will.  In the last few days a leading industrialist in his annual report said he expected realism to be reintroduced after the coming election.  Let us have realism and responsibility.  That realism should be directed to expanding the possibilities of employment.  That should be the major economic objective of any Government.  The criteria by which Seán Lemass judged the effectiveness of any Irish Government was the number of jobs created in the economy. That criteria will stand the test of time, no gimmicks or dressing of facts to suggest otherwise.  A test of the effectiveness of Irish Governments on the ground is the number of people put into gainful employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not in artificial employment but in employment in industries involved in exports, the only sustainable jobs in the Irish economy.  Others have an artificial life as was pointed out recently by economists.  We cannot get that realism from a Government trapped in the promises of their manifesto. We cannot expect it in any further budget from the Government.  I hope the Government will be encouraged to go to the country soon.  I also hope that the Government formed after the election will accept the responsibility of bringing control into our public finances and direct our economy once more into the creation of new jobs.  Our young people are described as our great challenge but it often strikes me that &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; is the word used by perplexed politicians to describe something for which they do not have an answer.</P>

      <P>I am calling on the party of reality to meet reality in an early election.  The budget will have a bad effect on industrial relations in the coming year although most people agree that an improvement in that area is the foundation on which our industry can be made more competitive.  The provisions in the taxation area will not improve industrial relations.  There is a connection between taxation reform and contentment on the part of trade unionists in their places of work.  Absenteeism, which caused controversy earlier this year, to some extent, results from discontent with the taxation system.  The budget has not done enough to meet the demand for tax reform.  I accept that we cannot have the entire instalment of tax reform but we could begin a serious step by step improvement in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no credibility attached to the borrowing requirements.  If one looked at the record of the two previous Ministers for Finance one could not suggest that the present Minister has much capital to go on in the hope that his targets will be received seriously.  To paraphrase <Col N="474" /> another man at another time in history, all we can say to the Government at this juncture is, in the name of God go.</P>

      <P>In relation to this resolution I should like to state that I asked the Minister recently the present level of taxation, excise duty and VAT, on cigarettes and tobacco products. Under this resolution the Minister seeks to extract an additional £23 million from smokers and he has told them that if they do not like paying it they need not smoke. The public should be told the existing rate of tax on cigarettes and tobacco, pressed and unpressed.  Has the Minister those figures in his brief?  I did not get a reply to my question although the Department may have been aware that the complete figures will be available after midnight tonight.  I wonder if the Minister would be kind enough to let me have the present rate, including excise and VAT and any other hidden tax such as the VAT paid by shopkeepers.  There are two types of VAT, the first-day payment and sales-day payment, so the Minister has to be watchful.  I would like to know what the total is.</P>

      <P>As one Corkman to another let me say that, if the Deputy wants to repeat the question, he may please do so and let me know the position. He asked about the duty on 20 of the most popular priced variety of cigarettes. On that the post-budget situation is that the total duty is 55.9p made up of 48.6p on duty and 7.3p on VAT.  Regarding pipe tobacco I am probably the more expert on cigarettes and he on tobacco, or on the smoking of it.  On plug tobacco the post-budget situation is 52.4p duty and 8.5p VAT making a total of 60.9p. On flake tobacco the post-budget situation is 65.9p duty and 10.2p VAT and the total there is 76.1.</P>

      <P>I was about to congratulate our fellow Corkman on this prescription which he has given to smokers today.  In any case, aside from what our specialists and others tell us, smoking is a tradition of the Irish people and I am sure will not disappear overnight.  I maintained here 12 months ago, when a somewhat similar Financial Resolution was before the House, that the smoking public were asked to bear an undue proportion of taxation and I think that what I said last year can be reiterated with more emphasis this year.  On 20 cigarettes we have 56p all but .1p.  On flake tobacco you have 76.1p.  I maintain here that this is an unfair burden.  Why ask the smoking public, who are already contributing hansomely to the Exchequer, to bear a further £23 million?  I believe I am quite justified in standing up and making such a statement because, whatever the specialists may say about smoking, many people find it relaxing.  Some of our friends will be digesting this budget and the increase on tobacco, cigarettes, beer, 15p on petrol and so on and the limited adjustments made in other sectors such as PAYE.  I think that they should have a smoke if they like because they will be inclined to after digesting what is in the budget.  In any case I object strongly to Financial Resolution No. 1.  It is unfair <Col N="477" /> and unjust to ask the smoking public who, as I have said, are already heavily burdened, to contribute a further £23 <Col N="478" /> million to the Exchequer cost of running this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the Financial Resolutions dealing with excise on beer, spirits and on wine and made wines.  It is difficult to understand how the Government could have introduced this duty, particularly on spirits, at this time.  Obviously they did not believe what the chairman of the Irish Distillers Group said when he pointed out the danger of unemployment in the industry and the fact that they were postponing investment because of the damage done to the trade by the measures introduced in last year's budget.  The Minister was frank in saying the reason he introduced the duty was because he wanted the money but when one considers the amount of juggling carried out by the Government on the figures in the Book of Estimates and in the budget today one cannot understand why they did not engage in some further juggling without imposing this tax on spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three months ago a booklet was issued stating that the number of people treated for alcoholism had increased in a ten-year period and in a comment on this the Minister for Health said it showed the justification for increasing the duty on spirits in last year's budget.  I object first to the Minister trying to make political capital out of this sad disease.  He should <Col N="481" /> know the reason more people are being treated for alcoholism: this is something that should be encouraged because the more people realise it is a disease that should be treated and one that can be suspended the better.  It is recognised by the social people who are concerned with alcoholism that increasing the price of drink does not cure the disease.  What happens is the families of alcoholics have to do without while the alcoholic spends more money on drink.  I do not want this duty on spirits to be represented by the Minister for Health, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance as something of social benefit and something that will help to cure alcoholics.  All it will mean is that the families concerned will be more deprived.  The only way to treat alcoholism is by education not, as was suggested by the Minister for Health, by imposing extra duty on drink.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Government is responsible for the budget.  They are endangering the jobs of people already at work and they are preventing the creation of further jobs in the distilleries, even though they say their primary objective during the year will be to create employment.  When Deputy O'Leary was speaking a short time ago the Minister for Energy took exception to a remark he made; he gave a figure of 30,000 jobs created in the past three years.  Evidently the Minister is not reading the publications issued by the Minister for Finance and the Government.  In the &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget, in 1981&rdquo; there is the following statement:</P>
    <P>It is estimated that on average during 1980 there was little or no change in the 1979 level of employment, an increase in services employment being offset by a decline in agriculture and industrial employment.</P>
    <P>This was referred to by the chairman of the Irish Distillers Group when he said they had plans to increase employment but for the 1980 budget.  Last autumn he said that unless trade improved during the remainder of that year there was a danger of people being laid off or put on short-time.  He appealed publicly in the press &mdash; presumably he appealed privately <Col N="482" /> to the Government&mdash;and said that a further imposition of duties in this budget would further postpone investment and the creation of new jobs and would make more likely the prospect of laying-off people.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say that he did this in ignorance of the consequences of increasing the amount of tax.  It is an ill-conceived move which is bound to have a detrimental affect on employment in distilleries. It will also make it that much more difficult to reach the hoped for employment levels.  This is only a small sector of Irish industry but it is, and always has been, a very profitable one which gives good, worthwhile employment and has enormous export potential. These factors are in danger because of the high level of duty imposed by this year's budget and the same goes for the pint of beer.</P>
    <P>We have in this country three breweries, two of which, very small ones, happen to be in my constituency.  I know from the owners that the increase in the price of beer will also have a detrimental effect on employment in those breweries. Last year there was a slump in trade, with a danger at one time that people would be laid off, but because they expected, as normally happens after a budget, that after some time the demand would pick up again, they held on to their employees. They will not do that this year.  They are not expecting an increase in the price of beer this year and a similar decline in sales as occurred last year would definitely result in people losing employment, at least temporarily.  I do not know how up-to-date the figures from the CSO are or, in this case, from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. These figures will certainly tell the Minister that this month, January, has been the worst month for sales in the liquor trade since the war.  Every indication that the publicans' associations have, either from tapping their own sources or from any semi-official information available to them, is that in the month of January 1981, sales are lower, in volume terms, than at any other time for almost 40 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> The Taoiseach may shrug his shoulders and say that this is not important but there is a considerable number of people working in publichouses and considerable part-time employment given to people to assist in balancing their household budgets.  The two steps taken in this year's budget will further increase unemployment and make it more difficult for us to pull out of this recession.</P>

      <P>On Resolutions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 the Taoiseach and his Government anticipate extracting an additional £49 million from the general body of taxpayers who take a drink.  This is unfair and unjust.  What has been said on Resolution No. 1 relative to tobacco and cigarettes could usefully be said on Resolutions Nos. 3, 4 and 5.  In order to refresh our memories, I ask the Taoiseach what will now be the taxation, both excise and value-added tax, on a pint of beer, a glass of spirits and on the wines covered by Financial Resolution No. 4? The statement does not give that information. Would the Taoiseach be kind enough to let us have the actual amount, because the people who have to pay the piper would like to know what it really means and I am sure that our publicans would also like to know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has <Col N="484" /> informed us that beer will have a total taxation of 34.1p on a pint, including VAT.  By any standards this is a formidable figure.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Barry's comments on alcoholism.  The number of alcoholics in this country is relatively small and 98 per cent of people who take a drink could not by any stretch of the imagination be termed alcoholics.  To some extent, publichouses are the life's blood of our rural countryside, possibly to a greater extent than in the city of Dublin or any other largely populated centre.  It is traditional in Ireland for the pubs to be the gathering place on a few nights a week for the people in the surrounding district.  The people congregate in their local pubs and I see nothing wrong with that.  It is a reasonably good idea to relax, discuss the business of the week or of the day, exchange views and talk about one's problems.  This is a fine tradition which particularly helps the atmosphere in rural Ireland.  Also, old people like to have their half-one or their few pints a week.  The Government, by the continuous imposition of taxes on beer, spirits, wines and cigarettes, will phase out that tradition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry adverted to another aspect, which was the employment content. We all know that there are many people employed in the licensed trade.  I do not know how many publicans there are in Ireland but I am quite sure that the number is a sizeable one, and then there is the employment given by publicans, by breweries and by distillers.</P>
      <P>Guinness is a name known throughout the world.  The poor man was there in the 18th century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The name of Murphy has been closely associated with the brewing industry and it deserves special mention, as do other names.  The cumulative effect of these three taxes on the brewers and distillers, the public houses and the transport industry will be to cut down on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have read a statement by the Irish Distillers Group &mdash; the Taoiseach's predecessor <Col N="485" /> is a member of the board of that august body and I am sure he was a party to the statement &mdash; intimating that it has become necessary for that industry to reduce their work force by something in the region of 500.  The reason given for this sizeable reduction is a drop in sales: they claim their spirit sales declined by almost 20 per cent in the 12 months they were dealing with.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach expects to gather an additional £14 million under Resolution No. 2.  The Government believe that consumption of drink will not fall as a result. The fact is that the Taoiseach has made it impossible for us to drink.  He may think, or hope, that this increase in taxation will be forgotten and that people will drink as much as ever after a time. He could be wrong because last year's decline in the sale of spirits indicates a downward trend.  We may reach a stage when the Taoiseach, by imposing this tax, will do more for the pioneer movement than Father Matthew ever thought could be achieved.  If Father Matthew is looking down he is smiling at the Taoiseach and saying: &ldquo;You did a good job.  I could not do it.  You seem to be making a better hand of it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In 1979 people were buying farms at prices far beyond value.  I advised some of them that there must be a stop, that farm prices could not continue to go up and up while the value of money was falling.  Apparently the Taoiseach thinks there is no end to the money to be got from drink.  I suggest that the peak has been reached.  I do not want to be taken as promoting drinking, but having a drink is traditional in Ireland &mdash; we all take a drink &mdash; but there is no obligation on our beloved Leas-Cheann Comhairle to do so; he has freedom of choice.  However, this is the spirit that prevails here and for that reason I am opposed to all three Financial Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government expect to collect an <Col N="486" /> additional £49 million in this way.  I do not think the Taoiseach will be too popular because of this.  If two people go into a pub and call for two half ones the Government will pocket 72p straight away.  It is too much.  The Government are taking more over the counter for drink than the publican, the distillers and brewers and the transport interests &mdash; they are taking more than 50 per cent of the counter price.  People like a pint after a hard day's work in Dublin and throughout the country and now, already collecting 28p, the Exchequer are adding another 6p to the price of the pint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The budget speech today and other publications we have been reading indicate a demand for wage moderation. It has been emphasised that we are becoming less competitive and that that is causing unemployment, damaging our balance of trade and our balance of payments. The three Financial Resolutions we are dealing with now, especially that relating to beer and spirits, will generate a demand for wage increases because the effects will be included in the cost of living index.  Though we may not regard these things as necessaries of life, they are regarded as simple luxuries and this substantial new tax on them will start another round of wage increases.  Deputy Bruton said earlier that the effect of the budget will be to put up the cost of living by two or three points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some abuse of alcohol in Ireland but it is fairly limited and those who abuse alcohol will not be deterred by further taxation.  They will forego many other things to get alcohol, possibly at the expense of their families.  In latter years the abuse of alcohol has been greatly reduced and during the week one finds very few people in public houses up to about ten o'clock.  They are now spacing their drinking and going in for an hour or so before closing time to have a couple of &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; drinks.  Long ago I heard the Taoiseach use that term when advocating eating and drinking in restaurants without licensing restrictions.  Public houses are not doing all that well at present, with some exceptions, and this <Col N="487" /> will affect employment in the licensing trade.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why our whiskey exports have not captured a greater share of world markets and I was interested to receive a circular from the distillers setting out their position.  They are competing with Scotch and other foreign distillers who have a far bigger home market and who can therefore compete on better terms.  Our distillers are operating in a very small home market of approximately three million people and if their sales are cut they will be in a worse position to export and make a profit.  This further increase of 12p on a glass of whiskey, increasing the tax content to over 71p, is bound to hit our home distillers.  They were complaining of being in a bad position last year and this could be the straw that will break the camel's back and cause unemployment at home as well as affecting our balance of trade.  The increase of 6p on the pint to bring in a further £32 million will reflect itself in a demand for increased wages.</P>
    <P>Some people have not much sympathy for the person who buys a bottle of wine. Are we not saying with one breath that a tax on spirits and beer will reduce the abuse of alcohol while at the time discouraging the use of wine, which is a weaker and less damaging drink?  People are using wine with discretion and the effect is to cut down the number of drinking sessions.  Twenty years ago there was far more drinking on a Sunday morning in rural areas than is now the case.  Public houses, which used to be very busy around mid-day, are comparatively slack now and people are substituting by having wine with their meal on a Sunday. Are we to discourage that?  The cumulative effect of these three resolutions is bad for employment and bad for our balance of trade and balance of payments and the tax on wine is bad socially.  However, the taxes are necessary because the Government have bungled along since 1977 and have run the country very badly. They now find themselves on the run-in to a general election, whether it comes in February, March, the summer, the <Col N="488" /> autumn or next year.  We are round the bend and heading for the home straight.</P>

These resolutions will do no good to temperance or to the economy and should be opposed.</P>

      <P>Some years ago there was a popular song called &ldquo;The Pub with No Beer&rdquo;.  When the full impact of these increases is felt there will be plenty of beer but very few drinkers.  The increases announced today are very sizeable and the commodities involved have already been hit so often and so hard that saturation point has now been reached.  If the Taoiseach had asked any of his backbenchers about the present position of the licensing trade in rural areas he would have been told that there has rarely if ever been such a slump.  There are a number of reasons for this and the cost is one of them.  People cannot afford to buy drink and I believe that they have become more mature in their drinking habits. People attending social functions often go with a teetotaller or arrange for special buses due to the breathalyser laws.  The difficulties being experienced in the licensing trade are very obvious.  They are experiencing unprecedented difficulties at present.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years major improvements in our pubs were carried out and they have improved the appearance of many villages, towns and cities.  These improvements were not grant-aided but when they had been carried out the rates were increased.  I believe we have reached the stage where people are no longer improving their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far reference has not been made to the tourist industry.  The chief executive of Bord Fáilte and everybody involved in <Col N="489" /> the tourist industry must be very concerned about these increases, and I do not blame them.  That industry has been experiencing many difficulties over the past few years.  People who spent a lot of money improving their hotels have also experienced many difficulties.  Last year many people blamed the weather for these difficulties but last year I told the then Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy when he was introducing his budget, that the tourist industry would be affected by the increase in the tax on beers and spirits.  I was unfortunately proved right, and the same will happen this year.</P>
    <P>Many people who had decided to come to Ireland for holidays this year will now reconsider and may change their mind. That will be a pity because Ireland has a great deal to offer any tourist.  Bord Fáilte spent a large sum of money on promotional campaigns and I regret to say most of it will be wasted because it is so expensive to holiday in Ireland.  I am sure the Taoiseach has met many people over the past 12 months and discussed holidays with them.  People who like a few drinks, a bit of crack and to have a good time find it cheaper to fly to Spain, the Canary Islands or somewhere like that for a holiday than to stay at home because the price of beer, wine, spirits and so on is often the determining factor when deciding on a holiday.  It is a terrible pity this happened.  It is also a pity to see the wonderful work done by Bord Fáilte handicapped by these major tax increases.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for anybody who owns a hotel and is depending on the coming tourist season.  Throughout the year there will be a number of young girls and men hoping to make a living out of this industry. People in small guesthouses have a short season and these taxes will deal them a very hard blow.  We should start thinking about where we are going.  Last year the then Minister for Finance said the situation had not reached saturation point.  The report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> shows that we have now reached saturation point, and that is what concerns me.  These old reliables are being <Col N="490" /> kicked to death.  We should take a further look at them and revive them instead of further kicking them.  Only so much can be added to the price of beer and spirits and we have now reached the limit.</P>
    <P>The tax on a glass of spirits is 71.4p a mighty amount.  How much further can we go?  I do not know.  Irish Distillers warned that there was a 5 per cent quantity fall in spirits sales on the home market in the 12 months to 30 September last.  Their spokesman said that, irrespective of what happened in the budget, short-time working was inevitable and would touch on 520 workers in Cork and Dublin.  I believe these tax increases will make a bad situation even more difficult.</P>
    <P>The licensing trade has gone through a very difficult 12 months.  The number of people employed in that trade is getting smaller.  This is a very big industry which pays very good wages.  These increases will affect the people in the spirit and brewing trades.  In my view with these increases we have gone for the overkill and we will have to take a serious look at the situation.  We should be encouraging the production of spirits in every way possible because this is a very important export trade and tax increases of this size can be seen only as discouragement.</P>

When you add the brewers' and the publicans' margins to the Financial Resolutions, it is going to have such an effect on the cost of living and on wage costs that it will become more profitable for brewers to brew abroad rather than at home.  Wage increases are chasing price increases and our rate of inflation has been pushed up much higher than our competitors in the European Continent and in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party find it necessary to oppose these resolutions.  In particular, I find it quite extraordinary that the Fine Gael Party should have voted against Resolution No. 1 on tobacco.  I will deal with some of the points made on Resolutions 2, 3 and 4.  I do not think there is any need for me to remind the House that this type of debate takes place on practically every budget. The number of Governments since the foundation of the State who did not find it necessary to tax tobacco and drink to some degree in a budget must be very very few indeed.  If you want to get revenue you must tax something which is reasonably popular.  It is no good putting a tax on something which as soon as you tax it disappears.  People will not buy it any more and you get no revenue from it.  To get the sort of revenue required these days you have to tax things which are in fairly popular usage.  Of course, the obvious things to tax are beer, spirits and wine.  These are things which people are going to consume anyway and, therefore, it is almost axiomatic that, if you want to get the sort of revenue you need to pay for the various State services in a modern community, you are almost inevitably driven to taxing tobacco, beer and spirits to some extent.  The Opposition parties are foolish in opposing these measures because of the purposes to which the revenue will be devoted.  I do not think it is unfair for me to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the question of Irish Distillers.  It is difficult to know what the reality is in this regard. We all know there is a great ritual exercise gone through before every budget. There are particular people in the community who orchestrate a whole chorus before a budget, proving that if the thing in which they are involved is taxed, ruin will follow.  One can recognise it.  The same pattern is followed every year.  People <Col N="494" /> try to frighten the Government off imposing taxes on their particular area by a whole orchestrated chorus of propaganda. We had it in a big measure this year.  Very large sectors of the community set out to establish before the budget is introduced that their particular sector must be left alone because, if not, total ruin and disaster would follow.  I do not know what the reality is in so far as the Irish distilling industry is concerned.  I do know that if there is some falling off in the consumption at home as a result of these duties then surely the obvious thing for that industry to do is go out and make good that deficiency on the export market. Despite what Deputy Enright thinks, excise duties do not apply to exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish distilling industry has that enormous currency advantage in relation to its principal competitor at present.  Furthermore, if I recall correctly, the Irish distillers, with very considerable assistance from the State, have built a new, modern distillery down in Midleton.  It is probably one of the most modern distilleries in the world; if it is not, it should be and it has received very considerable grant assistance from the Exchequer through the IDA.  There is the Irish distilling industry with a new, modern distillery built with considerable assistance from the taxpayer, a very considerable currency advantage over its principal competitor with nothing we do here today affecting the competitiveness of their product on export markets.  If there is some falling off in the consumption <Col N="496" /> of their product on the home market surely it is not unreasonable for us all to ask them to go out and make up the deficiency in the export markets.  But I am not even convinced that there will be a falling off of consumption on the home market.</P>
      <P>Let me make another point.  Deputies opposite were at great pains to persuade me that the Irish public are becoming very reasonable and moderate in their drinking and therefore we should not be imposing this cruel tax on the Irish drinking man or woman.  I do not accept that. Surely Deputies opposite, just as I have over the last 12 months or two years, have seen from time to time in our newspapers and our media, consistent reports of seminars which give staggering figures for the amount the Irish community spends on drinking in any year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, that as a community we do not spend a very high proportion of our national income or resources on drink?  I think that is the position, at least as I find it from these reports and I have never seen it contradicted by anybody in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not true also that the Irish trade union movement has found it necessary to institute programmes designed to cut down absenteeism in Irish industry because of alcoholism?  Is that not so?  Do the Deputies opposite say that that is not true?  I know it is true because I am in very close touch with the trade union movement about this matter.  I know it is a very serious cause of concern to the <Col N="497" /> trade union movement and to Irish industrialists, that is, the amount of absenteeism in Irish industry because of alcoholism, and not necessarily alcoholism but just because of excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>That is the other side of the coin. Therefore, it is all very well to get up here in this House for a particular purpose, for the sake of a given argument, or to emphasise a particular case and say that generally speaking the Irish people are very moderate and reasonable in their drinking and that it is very unfair and cruel to impose these taxes on them.  But there are those two other factors which the House should keep in mind.  I do not really think that this argument about the effect these taxes will have on the drinking habits of our community are all that relevant in this context.  I do not think any of us can assess what will be the effect with any degree of accuracy, or foretell with any degree of accuracy what will be the effect.  I am just rejecting the argument that we should not put on these taxes because drink, in our circumstances, is very moderately used and that it is unfair to do so for that reason.  I base my case for these resolutions on one simple premise, that is, drink, alcohol, beer, whiskey, wine, these things are good reliable, old revenue producers.

They are certainly an important aspect of relaxation and enjoyment in the community and I would not ever attempt to adopt a killjoy attitude in relation to them but we must accept that they are not basic necessities of life, and they are good revenue producers and we need this revenue for the very sound social purposes of this budget.  I would like to make <Col N="499" /> this point to the Fine Gael people in their own interest.  I find, going around talking to people and looking at reports, even market opinion pools, that the ordinary man in the street has the reaction that he does not mind paying a bit more for his pint or his glass of whiskey provided the old age pensioner is looked after.

      <P>One will always mollify the drinking man in this country if one satisfies him that the extra tax being extracted from him is going for a good social purpose and particularly for the purpose of looking after the old and the disadvantaged and the underprivileged in our community.  This is a very sound argument and Fine Gael are trying to get a little temporary political advantage by opposing these resolutions.  They should consider that much wider, much broader, much deeper sentiment in the Irish public. These increases are fairly substantial. The Government recognise that but we have a very tight, difficult budgetary situation this year.  We are determined to keep down the budget deficit, to reduce it.  We wanted to make these adequate provisions for the social welfare classes, particularly for the old and pension categories and, looking around the entire taxation spectrum, these offered themselves as one of the best avenues available to us.  We feel that the people who will be paying these extra taxes for their beer and spirits or cigarettes or wine will understand and appreciate that they are going to a very sound social purpose and bear with them perhaps not cheerfully but at least willingly.</P>

Am I to assume that the Taoiseach, as head <Col N="500" /> of the Government, is satisfied that these old age pensioners about whom he expresses so much worry and who need this kind of drink possibly more than any other section of the community are to be asked to pay £7.15½ on a bottle of whiskey or a bottle of gin or vodka and to ask the ordinary drinking public to pay £31.50 per keg of beer?</P>

    <P>(6)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution, which collects money from hydrocarbon oils, will yield more than £50 million.  That is £1 million more than the amount which will be raised from the duty on beer, spirits and wine.  When speaking on the other resolution the Taoiseach said that the money was required to help the less well-off people.  He said that no drinking man minded paying a few pence extra for his pint as long as the money went for a good purpose.  The Taoiseach says the <Col N="509" /> money is going for the old age pensioners but I believe the greater portion of it will go to pay the huge sums of money which have been borrowed over the last three years.</P>
      <P>We are now talking about the same amount of money under this resolution. Many people have to use their cars to get to work every day because there is no public transport, or an inefficient public transport.  Will the Taoiseach now tell me that the increased amount of money they have to pay for petrol is to give extra money to the old age pensioners?  What about the small shop-keeper who is trying to make enough money to keep himself and his family by delivering goods to people all over the country or the firm who are already in a bad way for cash and whose business is deteriorating but who still must provide a delivery service? What about the doctor in the country who has to travel great distances to visit his patients or the vet who has to travel long distances to see sick animals?  We are all concerned to see that the quality of our herds is kept up to standard and that all our herds are free from disease. Those people's cars are a necessary part of their jobs.  Will the Taoiseach tell me that the increase of 15p per gallon which they are being asked to pay on top of the 20p increase last year is in the interest of employment and that the livelihood of all those people should be in danger?  Inflation is bound to increase after this savage increase in the price of petrol.  Are all those things good for the country?  Will the people being asked to pay those taxes pay them gladly when they know there is a danger of pricing themselves out of their jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the third year running the Government have put a duty on petrol.  The accumulation of all those increases is about 40p.  That is about twice the amount put on a gallon of petrol in 1973. The Government have put more on petrol in the last three years than the OPEC countries did in that period.  This is the most damaging resolution which will be moved here tonight from the point of view of jobs and the competitiveness of our industry.  All the extra money <Col N="510" /> which industry will have to pay in relation to this savage increase will find its way into the cost of individual items which we will have to try to sell abroad.  Everybody is agreed that our salvation lies in selling more goods abroad at competitive prices. In one stroke here the Minister will add £50 million to the cost of goods manufactured here.  We are opposing this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of commuter workers I would like to protest in the strongest possible manner about this resolution. I refer to about 200,000 people who will suffer because of this exorbitant increase in the price of petrol.  Last year I described the budget proposals as a bomb whose main ingredient was the petrol increase and said that when it exploded it would cause havoc and an escalation in the cost of living.  My prediction proved correct.  Earlier this evening the Taoiseach gave us a summing up of Matt Talbot's views on alcoholism.  I would prefer to talk about something which is very vital to the commuter worker, his motor car, which he needs to get to and from work.  The price of petrol ranges up to £1.52p a gallon.  This increase of 15p will bring it to £1.67p a gallon.  There is another increase of 8p in the pipeline and we are also told that OPEC will put another increase on it.  As we approach the end of the first quarter of this year I believe the price of a gallon of petrol will be almost £2.  That is a further contribution to an increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The commuter workers are very important to industry.  They get into their cars every morning at 7 a.m., drive 20 miles to work and a further 20 miles home in the evening at 7 p.m.  Those people are entitled to some consideration.  Their cars are not a luxury.  Jobs are not available near where many of them live and they are prepared to drive to their jobs, so consideration should be given to them. Those people are being punished this year the same way as they were punished last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in 1973 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, put 15p on the gallon of petrol the <Col N="511" /> hue and cry which was raised throughout the country.  I consider the increase tonight a savage increase on the ordinary rural workers who travel a considerable distance daily to their work and who are also prepared to work Saturday and Sunday. They now have to face the prospect of the price of a gallon of petrol being £2 in about two months' time.  If you consider that such people are travelling 60 miles a day this savage increase will have completely eroded any relief they may get in income tax relief.  That is the reason why as a rural Deputy I want to make the strongest possible protest at this savage increase which commuters are being asked to pay.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not propose to take up much time on this because I do not believe it is necessary.  I spoke on the increase in the tax on beer and spirits and I pointed out that that would put up the cost of living and in that way generate a demand for further wages which would lead to our being less competitive, with all the drawbacks and disasters which would flow from that.  This tax will have the very same result.  Most people have to use petrol to get to work.  The effect will be to generate a further demand for wages.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are absolutely shameless in imposing this tax.  In 1977 they announced in their manifesto that they would remove the tax from motor cars.  The opposition parties said that if they did that they would collect the lost revenue on petrol.  The Taoiseach's predecessor immediately gave a solemn assurance to the electorate that the tax loss on motor cars would not be made up by a tax on petrol, but that is what exactly happened.  An increase of 20p a gallon was imposed last year and 15p is being imposed this year by a party who are pledged to reduce the cost of motoring. On top of that there is another resolution, which will be moved shortly, which restores £20 of the tax removed from motor cars.  Is there any shame left in the Fianna Fáil Party?  Do they think they can do what they like to the people?</P>

      <P>When Resolution No. 6 is adopted a person buying ten gallons of petrol will be handing over to the Taoiseach and the Government a sum of £9.14.  If he buys a bottle of whiskey he will be giving them £7.15½.  It is no harm to let the people know how they are collecting the money.  Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to 1977.  The Taoiseach and his party are quite capable of thinking up a good old gimmick to sell to the people. The &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; thought this up in 1977 <Col N="513" /> and they addressed themselves in particular to the motoring public.</P>
      <P>Let me preface my remarks by saying that during all my time in this House I never heard any Deputy from any party asking for the abolition of car tax.  It was assumed that roads must be maintained and everybody agreed that car tax had to be paid.  Perhaps people cribbed that it was too high, but nobody looked for its abolition.  The &ldquo;think tank&rdquo; conjured up this package and addressed themselves in particular to the motoring public.  They said: &ldquo;If we remove car tax young people with small incomes who own cars will give us a leg up on the day of the election.&rdquo; This was a contributing factor to the success of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that we got an assurance that if they gave it away with the right hand by abolishing motor taxation they would not take it with the left hand by imposing additional duty on petrol and diesel, and I see diesel is being increased by 10p per gallon.  The House was assured that there was no gimmick of giving something away with one hand and taking it back with the other, but this has happened in a much bigger way than anyone could have anticipated at the time.  Coming up to Dublin this week I could not have dreamed that a further increase of 15p per gallon on petrol and 10p on diesel would be embodied in this Financial Resolution.  It is very hard to find the proper term for what will happen as a result of these impositions.  Deputy Ryan mentioned commuters and Deputy Barry mentioned professional people who travel in their cars to do their business. Everybody could be mentioned including bread van drivers.</P>

      <P>And Ministers. Almost all sections of the community <Col N="514" /> must use petrol or diesel in the course of their work.  They will be looking for increases to compensate them and up will go the cost of living.  I want to say to the Taoiseach, with all respect, that he is leaning rather heavily on the people.  I can envisage him concluding this discussion, as he concluded the previous one on beer, spirits and wine taxation, and saying: &ldquo;The motoring public do not mind.  They know it is for a good cause and that we will give it to the old age pensioners.&rdquo;  I do not think that is quite correct.</P>
      <P>We all know the financial position.  We all heard the lengthy statement read out today by the Minister for Finance.  We know that as a result of the policies of the &ldquo;think tank&rdquo;, as set out in the 1977 manifesto, we proceeded in the wrong direction. They had a short term advantage for the Government in that they got across to the people.  I remember the gimmick about fisheries and all the other gimmicks.  By the accumulation of all those gimmicks they got themselves over there with a majority which almost made them disintegrate.  They did so well that they almost fell asunder.  There were so many of them there that they got in one another's way.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with this resolution which relates to the imposition of an extra 15p on the gallon of petrol and an extra 10p on a gallon of diesel.  The Government must find money in this way in order to offset the additional expenditure imposed on the State by virtue of what was promised in the manifesto.  In the next resolution we shall be dealing with the doubling again this <Col N="515" /> year of the car registration fee.  It is not correct for the Taoiseach to assert that the increases embodied in the resolution before us are necessary in order to pay old-age pensioners.  We are all aware of our balance of payments situation and of the extent of our borrowings.  We are aware, too, of the problems and difficulties facing the country today and of the increasing unemployment figures. Obviously, additional moneys must be found for the Social Welfare Department as a result of the closure of factories daily and the consequent redundancies.</P>

      <P>I am taking into account what has been said from the Government benches in respect of Resolutions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 and I am saying that the motoring and business public and the public generally will be hit hard as a result of the provisions of this resolution.  There is a car in each of 95 out of every 100 households and these cars are needed either in the course of business or as a means of commuting to and from work daily.  It will be seen, therefore, that the proposed increases will have a colossal impact on the cost of living and will push us further down the road which, unfortunately, we seem to be travelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider myself duty bound to contribute to the debate on this resolution.  For some weeks past people have been asking me what kind of budget might be introduced.  All I can say is that I expected something very different from the Taoiseach from what we have been presented with today.  He is the man whom many people expected to produce some ideas in regard to rescuing our economy.  Instead, the budget is merely a rehash of its predecessors, that is, a falling back on the old reliables for increased revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past two years we have been hearing Fianna Fáil say that the biggest factor in terms of the state of our economy <Col N="516" /> is the cost of energy.  I am speaking of the actual cost of energy as distinct from the balance of payments situation. However, one can only be totally disillusioned with the budget statement.  It does not contain any semblance of a new idea from the Taoiseach.  Instead, there is no indication of anything other than what might have been proposed in a budget of 20 or 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>Already the price of petrol is a severe imposition on those people who must commute to work daily and of small business people who must use cars and vans in the pursuit of their business.  In these circumstances one would have expected the Taoiseach, with his reputed magic touch in economics, to have taken some step other than crippling further these small business people and daily commuters. Hundreds of my constituents undertake a 50 to 60 mile round journey each day in order to get to work.  Is there any inducement for these people to continue travelling these distances and paying such a high proportion of their salary in travelling expenses merely to arrive at the place of employment?  They would be as well off staying at home and drawing social welfare benefits.  It is to the discredit of the Government that they should impose this extra duty on energy at this time.  In addition to the cost of petrol the daily commuter who must travel a long distance must keep a good car on the road and that, too, is very expensive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Such expenses cannot be claimed in terms of income tax relief either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point that I have made here on several occasions. A business person is allowed for expenses in connection with his business so far as income tax is concerned but that is not so in respect of the person who must bear the expense of travelling long distances to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to object to any taxation that may be imposed on items that can be regarded as being in the luxury bracket but petrol is not a luxury any longer.  Many years ago anyone owning <Col N="517" /> a car was considered to belong to the affluent society but that is no longer the case.  Petrol is an essential element of life today.  Even the health boards, who are not known for their generosity in relation to the granting of medical cards, take into consideration the distance that one must travel to work when assessing applications. There is no such consideration on the part of the Minister for Finance.  In these circumstances can we be surprised if many of the people I am talking of opt to stay at home and draw unemployment benefit?</P>
    <P>So far as the farming community is concerned this increase will represent a big imposition in terms of the delivery of milk to the creameries.  The Taoiseach was regarded by many, even by some outside his own party, as being a man who would be able to do something to help us out of the economic morass in which we find ourselves.  We are disappointed, disillusioned and agitated that no better means of raising tax could be found than to clap it on the old reliables and that there were no new ideas in the thinking of the Minister for Finance. What will stand to the discredit of the Government more than anything else is putting 15p extra on the price of a gallon of petrol.  That will resound through the cost of living and through the economy and increase our difficulties.  It will be bad for employment, industry and industrial relations.  The people who make up a great part of our work-force will have no alternative but to demand increases in their wages to cover these serious costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment knows that what I am saying is the truth.  He comes from an area which is adjacent to mine and he knows about people commuting from that area to the city to work.  He knows about farmers sending milk to the creameries.  He knows that this will add to the cost of everything in society.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to have another look at the 15p when the Finance Bill is introduced and see if there is not some other way to get the revenue and not further destroy the economy.</P>

Deputies will be surprised to learn that when one takes the effect of inflation into account the duty content on a gallon of petrol today is less than it was in 1970.  That is a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> These resolutions, amongst other things, increase the tax on motor vehicles with a h.p. of 16 and under from £10 to £20.  In other words it doubles the tax on motor cars.  Deputy Bermingham and myself said we would have expected a more imaginative budget from the Taoiseach &mdash; because it is the Taoiseach's budget without doubt.  The Taoiseach tells us here that he must rely on the old reliables like cigarettes, alcohol, petrol and car tax.  That was not always the way with the Taoiseach and his party.  In 1977 they had the bright idea of abolishing car tax.  On Page 5 of their manifesto under the heading &ldquo;The Economy: The Real Crisis&rdquo; they were to work magic and one of the prescriptions to cure what they said was the real crisis was to abolish annual road tax on cars up to and including 16 horsepower from August 1977, immediately the election was over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that was announced this party said that if Fianna Fáil got into power and did that they would tax petrol.  The people got a solemn assurance from the then leader of Fianna Fáil that in no way would the revenue lost on car tax be made up by a tax on petrol.  In spite of that solemn assurance, last year 20p tax <Col N="529" /> was put on petrol and 15p this year.  That is the difference between any tax put on in 1974 and the present: the tax put on now is being imposed contrary to a solemn undertaking given by the Taoiseach's predecessor.  Not only is that tax imposed but we find that when road tax, as it was called, was abolished in 1977 it was replaced by a £5 registration fee and last year that fee was increased to £10. This year it is being increased to £20.  In fact we have the tax on cars restored and we have petrol taxed to the tune of 35p. The motorist is now in a much worse position and much worse off financially than he was before this famous manifesto. The Taoiseach's only solution when he last spoke was that cars would consume less petrol if they were better serviced but the same Taoiseach allows the roads to run down last year and the year before to such an extent that it is impossible to keep cars in any reasonable condition.  If he inquires from garage owners he will find that under his management of the economy people are not servicing their cars because they cannot afford it and many garages are on a three-day week.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>The gravity of this increase in road tax is that it is evidence of a confidence trick on the electorate because in 1977 Fianna Fáil undertook to abolish car tax and gave a solemn assurance that they would not replace it with petrol tax.  They have not only replaced it with petrol tax but they are now bringing back the car tax itself.  Could anything be more despicable or more of a confidence trick on the people?</P>
    <P>I understand this budget is getting a very bad reception all over the country. No wonder, because it is not only a harsh budget but a budget which shows the Fianna Fáil Party as having utter contempt for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>These resolutions require particular attention and we should look at both of them with deliberation because in the think-tank manifesto of 1977 one of the most spectacular things was the abolition of car tax on cars <Col N="530" /> up to 16 horsepower.  Earlier in dealing with the petrol Resolution I said and I repeat now that since the State was founded and since Dáil Éireann began to deliberate here a proposal was never made by any Deputy of any party that car tax should be abolished.  It was certainly not done in my time and as far as I can see by reading through the debates of the twenties, thirties and forties, not in those periods either.  Roads had to be maintained. People generally were complaining that roads were not up to standard. Local authorities were agitating for more money through the tax fund for the maintenance or improvement of roads, national, secondary, main and county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government faced that kind of agitation as all Governments did because our roads are well below standard and particularly below West European standards.  This agitation was being carried on very forcefully by the general public through their local authority members and executives without any request from any Member of the House or from any Party.  Nobody went so far as to curry favour with the public by saying: &ldquo;You must not pay tax on your cars; roads can be maintained without your having to pay this tax.&rdquo;  But in their desire to get back to power in the 1977 general election the group headed, I understand, by the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue with three or four other think-tank members, this &mdash; I will not use the term &ldquo;gang of four&rdquo; because I do not like it but somebody used it earlier and described them as the Gang of Four &mdash; Group of Four or Group of Five &mdash; devised this great idea to tell the general public they would not have to pay car tax.  They told them they could maintain the roads without the public having to pay tax.  Where was the money to come from?  Was it to fall from heaven?  It was to come from the people's pockets or from borrowing at high interest rates.  I said then, and I repeat now, that it was a gimmick to buy votes.  Not a single individual, outside the think-tank, had asked for such a move.  I never heard any public representative in Cork, irrespective of party persuasion, ask for the abolition of car tax.  The idea was <Col N="531" /> ridiculous.  A person in a mental home would scarcely think of it, but Fianna Fáil thought of it.  It was one of the contributory factors that got them back in such strength at the last general election.  As a result of gimmicks like this Fianna Fáil got back so strongly they were in each other's way.  They were nearly torn asunder because of the strength they obtained as a result of the gimmicks they employed in the election campaign.</P>
    <P>The sum of £5 per annum seemed to be a notional figure.  Deputy Fitzpatrick read out the manifesto and I read the article relating to car tax.  In the manifesto it was stated clearly that there would be no car tax and it implied there would not be any additional tax on petrol to offset the loss of the tax.  The following year after Fianna Fáil came to office they said they would multiply the figure by two and made it £10.  This year they multiplied by two again and now it is £20.  I assume that next year they will multiply again &mdash; I do not know who will be doing the multiplication &mdash; and the £20 will become £40.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach was not personally responsible for formulating policy then.  I remember there were celebrations after the 1977 election and many acknowledged that the think-tank were the greatest.  As the former Taoiseach said, they succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.  I remember somebody told the former Taoiseach at the time that Fianna Fáil could get 77 seats on the strength of the manifesto but he thought that was a bit much.  I do not know what would have happened to the poor man if he was told he would get 84 seats.  Unfortunately it is a reflection on our people that they swallowed this kind of gimmickry.  They rushed to the polling booths and voted for no car tax and no increase in petrol as set out in the manifesto.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House I will exercise my right to oppose this increase on the basis that it was a firm promise set down in writing by Fianna Fáil at the 1977 election.  They promised that if they were returned to power there would not be any tax on cars of less than 16 h.p.  I hope the Taoiseach will not tell me there is no <Col N="532" /> car tax, that it is a registration fee.  That seems to be the word they use now.  Long ago we said we would tax our cars but now we are told we only pay a registration fee.  I do not wish to delay the House but it is only right to point out these facts particularly when cars and travelling costs are so expensive.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto is the bible.  That was the bible on which the 1977 election was fought. Therefore, I ask the Taoiseach to uphold what was said in that bible and not to go ahead with this tax.  I realise that is most unlikely but it is no harm for the public to realise that this is one of the gimmicks that went astray.  As Burns said, &ldquo;The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft a-gley&rdquo;.  Now the Taoiseach is coming to this House imposing a tax of £20 on cars.  It is completely unfair and out of place in view of the solemn promises given by Fianna Fáil at the time of the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House but I wish to follow the same trend as Deputy Murphy.  The increase of £10 will not put many of us in the workhouse and I would not take any exception to the amount were it not for the principle involved.  In 1977 we had all the gimmicks Fianna Fáil could think of; nothing was too much so long as it collected votes. This was one of the things that got Fianna Fáil votes.  It was not so much from the people who were taxing their cars but from those who were not taxing their cars because they could not afford to do so. Every time they took out their cars and saw a garda their heart was in their mouth but suddenly Fianna Fáil came along with the novel idea of removing car tax and they were, in the modern word, &rdquo;legit&rdquo;. They were then decent citizens, they could take out their old banger and drive it along knowing they were not breaking the law.  I am not sure that in the research carried out by the Fianna Fáil think-tank they did not look at this side of the question, that it was not in any way to alleviate the difficulties of tax on cars but to catch the people who were not taxing their cars. I wonder what trust they will have now in the present Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> As I say, £10 will not rob us.  For any person who is driving a car and can pay almost £2 a gallon for petrol &mdash; and it is approaching that figure &mdash; and anyone who burns 10 gallons of petrol a week, spending £20 per week &mdash; and most of us burn a lot more than that &mdash; a car registration fee of £20 is not so heavy a tax. However, it is the principle of the whole thing which is important.</P>
    <P>By a trick, the Fianna Fáil Party were able to add this into their manifesto of 1977, to gather votes.  The Taoiseach will look for money before the general election &mdash; and one would wonder when we are going to have a general election; the sooner the better &mdash; and will he be thinking, immediately after the general election if he is successful, of restoring the rates on houses?  After all, there are only about two or three of the promises made in the manifesto still unbroken, so the whole thing might as well be scrapped.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us regarding the tax on drink that people do not need to drink, they have a choice not to pay the tax and also that they can cut down on petrol.  However, if they own a car, they will have to pay £10 extra.  I add my voice to those of Deputies Fitzpatrick and Murphy in saying that this is a breach of faith on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Might I conclude by saying that, when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1977, I remember speaking to a few friends on the other side of the Border in a different context altogether and they said that if the Fianna Fáil Party could deliver all the things in their manifesto, a united Ireland would be no problem. If they could do without rates on houses and taxes on cars and produce all the other things promised, well that was the part of Ireland to be living in.  It looked like that at the time, but these people must be very disillusioned now.</P>
    <P>If this is the appreciation that the Taoiseach has of promises made in the last general election, then there is no appreciation of anything else.  Promises are worthless.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As some of the Deputies have said, this is a relatively small item.  However, it does bring in an extra £6 million which is very important from the point of view of the arithmetic of the budget.  I fully agree with both Deputy Michael Pat Murphy and Deputy Patrick Harte that it will not in itself be any serious imposition on motorists.  Let me deal now with the points which both Deputies made in regard to it.  Had the tax not been removed from cars of up to 16 h.p., it is calculated that by now that tax would bring in £60 million.  To put it another way, if there were a return to the normal old type tax, motorists in that category would be paying £60 million and at the moment the registration fee brings in only £12 million.  It is, therefore, a bit of a misnomer to describe this registration fee as being a restoration of car tax for that category of vehicles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the very beginning, when tax on these cars was eliminated, the principle of the registration fee was adopted because cars still must be registered. It is absolutely essential, from the point of view of the administration of the road traffic legislation, that a car be registered. There must be some registration somewhere of every motor vehicle; otherwise one could not possibly enforce traffic legislation.  The administration of the registration system is fairly expensive and the registration fee was introduced at the beginning, to pay the costs of administration of the registration scheme.  I am not sure what the exact figures are, but I do not think that this £20 will do a great deal more than pay for the administration of the registration system. As I said, it is totally misleading and fallacious to suggest that the £12 million now to be paid by motorists in this category is in any way relevant or related to the £60 million which otherwise would be taken from them.</P>

      <P>I have seen a report of the statement in question.  The introduction of legislation for the regulation or control of the private security industry has been suggested by a number of representative organisations operating in this area.  In reply to parliamentary question No. 474 of 23 October 1979, Volume 316, columns 464-466, I outlined the difficulties involved in the introduction of any such legislation. Owing to the complex nature of some of the issues involved it is unlikely that a final decision in the matter will be reached in the near future.</P>

      <P>The overall officer establishment of the Naval Service is 137.  The present officer strength is 88 and there are, in addition, 28 Naval Service cadets undergoing training at present.  My Department will be conducting competitions again this year for the award of further cadetships in the executive branch and in the engineering branch of the Naval Service and the practice <Col N="357" /> of recruiting suitably qualified direct-entry officers is also being continued.  I am satisfied that this orderly programme of recruitment of cadets and officers is adequate to meet the expanding role of the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>With regard to potential officer courses, the position is that non-commissioned officers of the Naval Service are eligible to participate in such courses which are held from time to time for personnel of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Irish Steel Ltd., with the approval of the Government, are carrying out a major redevelopment programme involving the refurbishment of the company's premises and the re-equipping of their steel-making and rolling plant.  My Department are making available to Irish Steel Ltd. limited facilities on their property to assist the company while the re-development work is in progress.  The company will be asked to carry out a general cleaning-up when the installation of the new plant has been completed.</P>
      <P>A steel-making plant has been located at Haulbowline for more than 40 years. Irish Steel Ltd. have a long lease of the area allocated to the company.  While the shared use of Haulbowline creates inconveniences for both my Department and the company, the arrangement in general has worked reasonably well.  A bridge to Haulbowline provided by the company is beneficial to the operation of the naval base.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the press report to which the Deputy refers.  In accordance with a decision of the Government that an order for two new design patrol vessels for the Naval Service should be placed with Verolme Cork Dockyard, a letter of intent, accompanied by a substantial down payment, was issued to the dockyard in December 1980.</P>
      <P>It had been hoped originally that an order for the new vessels would be placed during 1980 but completion of the detailed specifications has taken longer than anticipated due to the complexity of the project, the sophistication of the many new equipments involved and the necessity to ensure the highest standards of safety.</P>
      <P>Negotiation of the formal contract, including price and delivery terms, will be finalised as soon as possible and construction of the first of the two vessels is expected to take approximately one-and-a-half years from the start of steel work in the shipyard, with the second to take six months longer.  The dates for laying down, launching and entry into service will depend on the progress of the building schedules.</P>

As soon as this information is available I will be making arrangements for the holding of the public inquiries in relation to the council's application for a bridge order and the compulsory acquisition of land, should this prove necessary.  A grant of £170,000 was allocated to this project in 1980.  A further sum of £350,000 has been allocated for 1981.  Road grants totalling £520,000 are therefore available to Galway Corporation at present towards financing the project.</P>

      <P>The person in question was made redundant in 1978 and received a lump sum and certain weekly payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  He is now inquiring about entitlement to redundancy weekly payments in respect of periods of unemployment in 1979 and 1980.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979, which came into effect on 6 April 1979, abolished redundancy weekly payments except for persons receiving them on that date.  The case in question is not in the excepted category.</P>
      <P>Representations in relation to the effect of abolition of eligibility for redundancy weekly payments on a number of persons redundant have been made to my Department who are examining these representations at present.  It appears that amending legislation would be necessary to deal with the issues involved and it is not clear that such legislation would be justified.  The case in question is being covered in the departmental review referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Community's agri-monetary system MCAs are applied to CAP products to compensate for differences arising where the market rate of a currency differs from the &ldquo;Green&rdquo; rate which is used to calculate agricultural support prices.  Member states with revalued currencies apply positive MCAs as charges on imports and subsidies on exports.  Member states with devalued currencies apply negative MCAs which have the reverse effect.</P>
      <P>At present there is a positive MCA of 15.1 per cent applicable in the UK because of the continued strength of sterling. While the purpose of MCAs is to maintain the unity of the common price system despite currency fluctuations, they have nevertheless a disruptive effect on trade, particularly when they reach levels of the order now in operation in the UK.  Accordingly it is the Government's policy to support measures for the reduction or elimination of MCAs through adjustments of Green currency rates.</P>

      <P>The calculation referred to is done by the EEC Commission on the basis of data obtained from member states.  The Commission's calculations for the year 1981/82 have not yet been made available to member states and it is not possible, therefore, to say at this stage what price increases the &ldquo;objective method&rdquo; would justify for that year.</P>
      <P>The methodology used is rather complex. Broadly, the Commission take into account trends in member states of farm incomes and costs over recent years, monetary fluctuations and adjustments, inflation and productivity increases, as well as developments in incomes in non-farm sectors.  A detailed outline of the methodology is given in Commission document RI/CC 478 of 19 October 1976, a copy of which I am arranging to send to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The cost of having an electricity supply installed depends on the location and size of the dwelling.  In urban areas connection is normally free of charge but the cost of wiring varies.  The cost of connection in a rural area can be free of charge occasionally but where costs arise these can vary from about £400 or so up to very large sums indeed.  The cost of installing one light and one socket, the minimum requirement, is approximately £70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Rents of all local authority houses included in the differential rent scheme are generally based on household income and the family circumstances of tenants.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the annual revision of differential rents for local authority dwellings, an amended scheme was introduced to take effect from 1 May 1980. Under previous schemes certain anomalies existed in so far as the assessment for rent purposes of the income of social welfare recipients was concerned.  Some incomes from social welfare payments were assessed at 50 per cent while others were assessed at 100 per cent.  To obviate these anomalies all social welfare payments are now being assessed at the full rate.</P>
      <P>To offset the effects of any rent increases which this procedure might entail, and to assist those in the lower income groups, particularly social welfare pensioners and lower paid workers, substantial increases were made in the amounts of assessable incomes to which the various rent fractions apply and also in the graded scale of allowances for principal earners while at the same time the rent fraction at the lowest band of the graded scale was reduced from one-twelfth to one-twentieth.</P>
      <P>In the case of an employed tenant the rent is calculated on basic income, which is, in general, the normal weekly rate of remuneration exclusive of overtime, shift-allowances and bonus payments.  In the case of all tenants, children's allowances, supplementary welfare allowances, redundancy payments, disabled persons allowances, lump sum compensation payments and so forth are disregarded as income for the purpose of the calculation of rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a fixed rent applies to a house, the rent was increased by 30p per week with effect from the commencement of the revised scheme.  Tenants of fixed rent dwellings have their option of going on <Col N="385" /> to differential rent.  This should ensure that rent increases will not entail hardship in any case.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the scheme as revised is fair and equitable to both local authorities and tenants and is designed to ensure that tenants are not required to pay a rent that they cannot reasonably afford.  The scheme is reviewed annually and any amendments of the terms of the scheme, considered necessary, are made.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in cases of genuine hardship it is open to local authorities to accept from a tenant for a specified period a lesser sum for rent than that required under the scheme.</P>

The correct monthly rent payable from 1 May 1980, calculated in accordance with the terms of the 1980 national rents scheme, is £10.70 and is based on income from retirement pension payable at February 1980.</P>
      <P>I understand from Sligo County Council that the rent from 1 May 1980, as initially calculated, amounted to £22.32 per month.  This rent was incorrect due to a misunderstanding which arose in respect of the income from retirement pension payable at February last.  This matter has now been clarified and the rent reduced to £10.70 per month which will apply retrospectively to 1 May 1980.</P>
