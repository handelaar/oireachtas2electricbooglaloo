    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the contribution this country has made to the financing of the orbital test satellite.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No contribution has been made by this country to financing the development, launching or operation of the orbital test satellite.  Located in Dublin, however, is a small earth station which receives transmissions from the satellite, and this station has been jointly funded by the European Space Agency, who have paid £31,500 over a period of three years to cover maintenance and operational costs, and by the Irish Government who made a contribution of £40,000 from the Departmental Science and Technology subhead which preceded the present National Board for Science and Technology grant-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House, we have an earth station in Cork also.  Can this country avail of the facilities provided by this satellite even though we have not made a contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we were aided by the space agency to establish the station indicates that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any suggestion that this Government are going into orbit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we have <Col N="1166" /> been launched in the last five months and there is no problem about us staying in orbit for the next four years.  It was not necessary for us to contribute to the launching operation of the satellite in order to benefit from it, which is a very satisfactory situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if it is proposed to make any cutbacks in the telecommunications development programme for 1982 with specific reference to (i) cutbacks in stores purchasing, (ii) building contracts being held up and (iii) delays in finalising cabling contracts for contractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Harte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital allocation for telecommunications development in 1982 has not yet been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that it is normal practice to order in advance stores for the requirements of building contracts and that this should have been done to ensure that building contracts which were ready to start this year and which, we are all well aware, have been postponed, would go ahead in 1982?  That answer is totally inadequate to the question posed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the information sought by the Deputy but if he wants information about stores and cables, there has been no cutback regarding the programme for 1982 in the purchase of stores and cables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked specifically if it was proposed to have any cutbacks in relation to stores, building contracts and cabling contracts.  I asked a specific question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I misunderstood what the Deputy asked.  There are no cutbacks in the programme for 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that is what is in the brief of the Minister of State, but is he aware that in the major stores area there have been cutbacks of 40 per cent from certain suppliers for next year in relation to building contracts?  Building contracts which were ready to start have been postponed and cabling contracts which were tendered for and ready to proceed have been re-advertised.  Is that not a clear sign of cutbacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>No, quite the contrary.  The Department now are in a much better position to assess the needs than they were when the programme was first launched.  The building costs first projected three years ago are now out of date and they have to be reconsidered, but that is all that has to be reconsidered. There is no cutback for 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State has not the information in his brief perhaps he would inquire from the stores department and the major suppliers of stores equipment &mdash; specifically telephone exchange equipment.  Stores orders for next year have been cutback by 40 per cent.  That knowledge is freely available to me and surely it is available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to give me that information I will have the position checked for him.  I do not see any purpose in the Deputy making wild allegations like this.  If he has information to that effect and if he gives it to me I will have the matter investigated.  I am telling him what the official position is at this moment, and that is what he asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One final short supplementary. The Minister of State is asking me for information.  Surely he is in charge of his own Department and it is up to him to find out the situation on the ground. Everybody knows the situation on the ground except the Minister himself.  If he had been listening to the Gay Byrne Hour a couple of weeks ago he would have heard the stores people live on the radio saying that they had not got the material they required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is far from the truth. There is no scarcity of stores.  There was a scarcity of stores particularly in Donegal until about June this year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Proposals for improved management and organisation of work in the telecommunications service involving the appointment of district managers and the devolution to districts of more work and responsibility, including certain telephone accounting functions, have been formulated and these are being discussed with the various staff interests under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under consideration for the last seven or eight years.  The scheme has the goodwill of the Department and the full approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and myself.  The staff generally accept all the conditions, but there is disagreement about the details and discussions are continuing. There can be no satisfactory conclusion until the staff concerned agree on the details of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if tenders for the provision of multi-channel cable TV to Limerick have yet been invited; and, if not, the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>A competition for the exclusive licence for the provision of a multi-channel cable television system in the city in question has not yet been held. In this regard I would refer the Deputy to my reply to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department on 12 November 1981 &mdash; Official Report, vol. 330 No. 11, cols. 2036-2037.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the reply to the Supplementary Estimate which I read in detail.  It does not answer the question, any more than the Minister of State has answered it here.  There is no reason why the letters of tender cannot be accepted from Limerick as they were for Galway and Cork.  Would the Minister please answer the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obstruction as far as the Department are concerned. But the Deputy, as former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, must accept that the Department's prime responsibility is to protect the consumer.  No one has yet been able to tell us if the signal will be adequate for successful operation of the scheme.  The Galway and Cork schemes are pilot schemes and if they are successful the Department will give their blessing to the Limerick scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will request tenders he will find out whether a signal is there.  The contractors who are interested in supplying piped television for Limerick have to do their own tests <Col N="1173" /> and supply the Minister with all the technical data as to the existence of a signal. The Minister's answer clearly signifies there is no reason why he should not go ahead with the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could take Deputy Reynolds's advice.  Unfortunately, I have to take the advice of professional engineers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who deal with this on a daily basis.  They are very experienced and their advice to me this morning was that they are not satisfied beyond doubt that the signal to operate the Limerick system would be such as would guarantee a service. We may be accused of being overcareful but we have a responsibility to the consumer, and the Deputy should accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that the Minister must look after the consumer. But the best way of ensuring this is to have technical data supplied by outside contractors who are interested in supplying piped television and then the Minister can decide whether or not to let them go ahead.  That is the time to protect the consumer.  The Minister obviously does not know what he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dispute between Deputy Reynolds, the Department, the people who want this service and me.  Time will establish whether the system which has been proposed for Limerick is successful.  If it is successful the Department &mdash; I speak for myself also &mdash; will be delighted to go ahead with the scheme immediately because we are anxious to provide a good service to people who are not receiving it at present.</P>

      <P>It is planned to provide an additional kiosk to serve the Northside Shopping Centre.</P>
      <P>There are, however, over 800 kiosks included in the current programme for provision of kiosks throughout the country and it may be some considerable time before the kiosk at Northside Shopping Centre can be provided, but every consideration will be given to the early provision of a second one at this very busy centre.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is a rapidly developing new school?  It is already catering for 300 students and projected increases in that area would be an additional 50 to 100 students within 12 months.  Would the Minister not agree, therefore, that there is an urgent need for a proper telephone service here?  What is available at present is a temporary line which is temperamental to say the least.  Would the Minister also take into account the need for a service for this very large catchment area?  It is serving a large number of organisations, and services in that school <Col N="1180" /> are being availed of by those organisations.</P>

      <P>That is fully appreciated. The school about which the Deputy is talking applied in November 1980.  We would like to give the service at once but cabling work must be carried out.  One cannot provide a telephone service without cabling.  This cabling work would be carried out but for the amount of work in Dublin city areas, which is a high priority at the moment.  I am sorry that I cannot give the Deputy a better answer than that.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister propose, as decided by the previous Government, to provide a telecommunications school in Portlaoise?  The main project of the previous Minister has to develop Portlaoise as one of our major centres for telecommunication development.  I did not hear the Minister make any reference to the telecommunications school.  Does he propose to go ahead with this project and could he give the time scale and the proposed date of commencement of work?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his Department applied for planning permission to Laois County Council to provide a telecommunications school at Portlaoise and that that planning permission has already been granted?  In view of the fact that the application was received and permission granted by Laois County Council I would ask the Minister whether there is to be any watering down by his Department of the plan to proceed with the programme of development for the town of Portlaoise?  In view of the evasiveness of the Minister's reply, one can only conclude that there is a deliberate <Col N="1183" /> intention on his part and on the part of the Department to abandon that project? I put a straight question to the Minister and I am entitled to a reply.  In the absence of a reply I can only conclude that there is now a Government decision to water down that proposal for the development of a telecommunications system in Portlaoise.  Perhaps the Minister would have the courtesy to reply to the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account the situation concerning the interim arrangement made for Bantry in County Cork, have the Government changed the rules? Taking into account that employment in the Clifden exchange is of great importance to the telephonists whose living conditions are much worse than they are in Cork, can the Minister now give us a reappraisal of the situation so as to give us the hope that at least some of the people in the telephone exchange in Clifden will get what they are getting in Bantry and in other parts of the country?  It is important that places like Clifden, in the most westerly part of the country, should get employment because there is so little employment there.</P>

If we were to agree to do what the Deputy has been asking we would have between 500 and 600 automanual exchanges throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Public telex call office facilities are provided at present only at tele-communications headquarters in Dublin.  It is planned to provide them at the seven district sales offices outside Dublin over the next year or so.  The demand for these facilities is limited and it is expected that the use made of them will not be such as to justify their provision at other centres.

      <P>Operator services will be retained at Carrick-on-Shannon on an interim basis after automatic service is introduced in the area.  The volume of operator-assisted traffic there will, however, be greatly reduced under automatic conditions and there will, therefore, be a substantial reduction in the number of staff.</P>
      <P>Day staff who become surplus to requirements when the exchange is converted will have the option of transferring to another exchange or resigning.  Staff who opt to resign will be paid compensation and transferred staff will be paid a resettlement allowance.  Night staff are recruited locally for specific exchanges and are mainly part-time.  It may be possible to offer a small number of them employment elsewhere.  Other night staff will be paid compensation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Dáil will resume on 26 January 1982, the budget being introduced on 27 January, and the Book of Estimates will be published in mid-January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for confirmation I might repeat what the Taoiseach has said: The Dáil will resume on 26 January 1982, the budget will be taken on 27 January and the Book of Estimates will be published in mid-January.  Is that what the Taoiseach said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it fitting that we should have to wait until apparently a few days before the budget to have the Book of Estimates? How can the Taoiseach reconcile that with the exaggerated statements of the <Col N="1260" /> Minister for Finance about his intention to bring the Estimates before this House in the month of September this year so that the House would have a chance to discuss them well before the Christmas recess?  Would the Taoiseach explain to us why that undertaking of the Minister for Finance is not being adhered to and confirm that in fact the Book of Estimates will be very seriously delayed on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Book of Estimates will be published in the normal way.  For some years in fact it has not been published until even later.  The statement of the Minister for Finance referred to related to the procedure which it was intended to introduce as from next year &mdash; which could not of course be introduced in the present year because we have not had an opportunity to do so, coming into Government only on 30 June.  But that procedure &mdash; bringing in the Book of Estimates so that the Estimates are properly discussed &mdash; will take effect from next year.  That has been made clear already.  There is nothing new in that and the suggestion to the contrary is unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may or may not recall that on the occasion of the introduction of the July budget the Minister for Finance stated specifically that it was his intention this year to bring in the Estimates some time around September so that they could be discussed in detail before the commencement of the next calendar year.  In fact the Taoiseach may also recall that when I suggested to the Minister for Finance at that time that he should not be too optimistic in that regard he dismissed my suggestion as being unduly pessimistic.  I suggest it is just another example of the manner in which this Government run away from all their different undertakings and promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach now about the legislation on the Order of Business, the legislation that has now been ordered.  There are, in particular, two Bills before us which are of considerable public importance, one is the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) <Col N="1261" /> (Continuance) Bill, 1981, and the other is the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could give some indication of the time scale involved in these two Bills and their constitutional implications. Is the Taoiseach in a position to give the House any information on these matters?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two Bills before Christmas, as the Deputy is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are fairly considerable constitutional question marks arising in regard to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981?  Can he give any information about the constitutional validity of that Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any legislation in this area following a Supreme Court decision is difficult, from a constitutional point of view, because the decision does not give, as is often the case in these instances, sufficiently clear indications for a Government to be absolutely certain whether amending legislation to meet the case would be constitutional.  We are anxious to have this Bill through the House now, and through the Seanad as soon as possible afterwards so that there will be an opportunity for the constitutionality of the Bill to be considered, given that the present legislation to cover the interim period runs to 24 January and it is proposed to extend that period by three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the very grave public importance of this measure and its effect on a large number of people, we, the Opposition, are facilitating the Government and are considerably curtailing our discussion of this very important and complex measure.  It is our duty to do that in the interests of the common good but I hope the Taoiseach will appreciate that it places us in very grave difficulty in regard to the legislation. Therefore I ask his indulgence with one more question.  Is it the Government's intention to seek to have this legislation referred to the Supreme Court or <Col N="1262" /> does he propose to let matters take their own course in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the pressure of business to which the Deputy referred I would be reluctant to take further from the time in the House to discuss the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1981 and the Housing Finance Agency Bill, 1981.  I think it would be appropriate to give consideration to the matter the Deputy raised when we come to the Adjournment Debate.</P>

      <P>Could I have clarification of procedure arising out of a decision made here last Thursday during the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works?  At that time, despite the fact that I offered, three Opposition speakers were called.  I was informed that there was a private arrangement between the Deputies, which had been accepted by the Chair. That seemed an extraordinary decision and, if it was correct, I intend asking the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to take it up.  It is grossly unfair that three Fianna Fáil speakers should be allowed to contribute as against one Government speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up too much of the limited amount of time that is left to debate this Stage but I am anxious to summarise the points I made last week. I support the Bill because anything that helps the many thousands who are unemployed is welcome and, secondly, because there are so many organisations involved in dealing with youth unemployment it is important that a central agency be established.  It is unnecessary to have so many bodies working towards the one goal.  The agency represents an ideal opportunity to get away from that system and have one body dealing with employment for young people, whether it is training or placement that is involved. The objectives of the agency, their working methods or their relationship with the various organisations, are not contained in the Bill but, hopefully, that will be made clear later in the week.  I am anxious to know what happens to AnCO and the other organisations that are presently <Col N="1267" /> engaged in promoting youth employment.</P>
      <P>Figures for youth unemployment vary greatly because there is no proper data available.  The Manpower consultative group established a committee to look into youth unemployment but all they said in their report was that youth unemployment was at an unsatisfactory and unacceptably high level.  It is generally believed that there are from 70,000 to 80,000 people between 17 and 24 years of age unemployed and from the figures issued in the last few days it is obvious that the number is rising at a rapid rate. I am sure the priority of the agency will be to undertake a study to ascertain the extent of the problem.  None of the agencies that are dealing with the problem at present have issued figures relating to the number unemployed.  They have not identified the problem on a regional basis or the type of skills that are needed in different areas.  It appears that the problem of youth unemployment will be with us for some time to come and it has been estimated that between the eighties and nineties the number coming on to the labour market, as against those exiting due to retirement or death, will probably double.  That is an indication of the important role the agency will have to play in tackling the problem.  That is why it is important that we should deal with this legislation in a proper manner and not because it was an election promise given to a youth organisation.</P>
      <P>If the questions I have raised about the Bill are not clarified today we will have passed legislation that does not specify or clarify certain points.  In that event the time spent discussing the legislation will be wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of youth unemployment is characterised not only by the numbers unemployed but by the serious inadequacy of vocational preparation and career guidance.  This is something the agency will have to tackle.  At present we have many groups and people in different areas doing bits and pieces to educate our youth and introduce certain courses but that is not satisfactory.  In my view AnCO have done their very best but they can <Col N="1268" /> cater for only a small number of people. They run courses for 12 to 14 people over 48 weeks and that cannot be expected to do much for the 70,000 to 80,000 unemployed young people.  A further serious problem which has tended to undermine any successful attack on youth unemployment is the lack of effective co-ordination between the schools, the agencies, the placement services, Government Departments and the employers.  The problem is that there is almost exclusive control by the different sectors over their own area of responsibility.  This has hindered any overall drive towards solving the problem and has prevented the development of a comprehensive integrated scheme.  If that is to continue, if we will still have the full structure of AnCO, National Manpower Service and the other organisations, if they are going to stand as they are, then the agency will be waste of time and money.  It will be another costly exercise that will not achieve anything.  I hope that by the end of the week I will leave the House convinced in some way that the agency does not amount to an election promise that will not do anything for our young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A deep concern exists on all sides of this House about the present level of unemployment among young people and the prospects facing us as a community in this key area.  The introduction of this legislation provides us with an opportunity to discuss the situation in a constructive manner, to consider the implications and to examine possible alternative policies.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his introductory speech has given a broad outline of the extent of the problem.  He has indicated the problems facing the school leaver seeking employment for the first time.  The Minister does not, however, attribute the same urgency to the problem as, for instance, the president of the ITGWU, who has recently described it as &ldquo;a frightening prospect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The National Youth Council of Ireland in a memorandum on this legislation stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of youth unemployment is large and growing &mdash; over <Col N="1269" /> 35,000 registered unemployed under 25 years with a further 10,000 &mdash; 15,000 probably unaccounted for in this figure.</P>
    <P>That, of course, was before the dramatic announcement yesterday that the registered unemployment figure is now 133,000 plus.  The real figure today for youth unemployment must now be at a terrifying level.  I would not disagree with the figures which Deputy Ahern has mentioned. We must at this stage be contemplating a figure for young unemployed persons under 25 years of age of somewhere in the region of 70,000 to 80,000.</P>
    <P>It is our view that the issue of youth employment is something more than just the absence of employment.  It is a major social phenomenon whose effects spread deep down into community life and disturb the very fabric of our society.  Our approach to and our assessment of this legislation is based on that belief.</P>
    <P>This legislation falls to be considered from two separate aspects.  Firstly, there is the proposal to establish a new body to be known as the Youth Employment Agency and, secondly, there is the proposal to finance this new agency by means of a new type of levy.</P>
    <P>There is always a possibility when a new body of this sort is established to deal with a particular situation that it will in effect amount to nothing more than a substitute for positive action.  To a large extent in the case of any body of this sort we have to wait and see.  It is very much a question of intent and the quality of the persons appointed and whether there is a real commitment to the objectives stated.  Experience teaches us with new bodies or agencies of this sort which are established in response to a particular problem situation that, having been established, they can be greatly curtailed in scope and limited in their operations unless full support is forthcoming for them, especially from the Minister and Department of Finance.  In the case of this particular new body, we shall have to postpone judgment and await developments, but the signs are not propitious.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is usually categorised as either cyclical or structural.  Cyclical unemployment arises from a falling off in <Col N="1270" /> the level of economic activity and corresponds more or less to the rise and fall of economic activity.  Structural unemployment on the other hand is that degree of unemployment which can be attributed to organisational causes and to our failure to match the available labour force with reasonable precision to the requirements of the economy.  Structural unemployment derives from structural changes in the economy or because people are not trained or educated for or do not have the skills which would enable them to fit into, the employment opportunities which the economy offers at any time.</P>
    <P>It is to the problem of structural unemployment primarily that this legislation is directed, It will not have any impact on that level of unemployment which is attributed to a falling off in the general level of economic activity, nor will it contribute to promoting economic development as the real cure for unemployment. The legislation is basically organisational in its approach, providing training and work experience for young people and in some cases creating community-type employment outside the realms of normal commercial and industrial activity. There is one key sentence in the Minister's introduction statement which I quote with full approval.  It is:</P>
    <P>Unemployment among young people is high because unemployment is high in the community overall.</P>
    <P>That is a statement of significant importance and is the key to the assessment of this legislation.  The Minister is saying in effect that youth unemployment is part of the overall economic problem and he is recognising the fact that youth unemployment as a problem can be solved only in conjunction with the solution of the problem of unemployment generally.  In other words, youth unemployment will only recede when we succeed in achieving a level of overall economic development which will cope with the employment needs of the community as a whole.  In the meantime we may, through this new agency and otherwise, occupy young people in training, work experience and community improvement schemes, but we will not be providing employment for <Col N="1271" /> them.  In fact, in so far as he comments at all on this aspect, the Minister's comments are depressing and I quote:</P>
    <P>...the main plank of any policy to reduce youth unemployment must be a sustained attack on the scourge of unemployment at all levels in our society. For Ireland, this requires continued growth in our exports of goods and services.  Increased exports are vital in view of the sharp deterioration in our balance of payments position in the last few years.  Export growth must also be the engine for the creation of the new jobs which are going to be needed in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I find that repetition of the standard, stereotype economic formula discouraging and depressing.  Those sentences could have been lifted out of any Central Bank report during the past decade or even during the past several decades. They represent the ritual exhortation to economic virtue so dear to the heart of the professional economist without suggesting any clear lines of action &mdash; a long way indeed from what we might expect from a radical socialist Labour Minister. That empty phraseology by the Minister compels me to conclude that the Minister does not really accept that the root cause of youth unemployment in this country is the lack of investment in economic development and that this legislation will not contribute to solving that problem.  On the contrary, this legislation is devised merely to improve structures.  The new agency apparently will rely on the main on education, training and work experience schemes for a body of unemployed young people who may be occupied, but will still not be employed.</P>
    <P>This is unfortunately underlined by the Tánaiste in his interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> on 21 November when he said that he saw unemployment rising to 145,000 next year and that it was difficult to see unemployment in this country falling below 125,000.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I'm not saying that we won't do all we can to create jobs or that we should lie down and accept the situation.  But <Col N="1272" /> I don't think that we can create all that many more.</P>
    <P>This defeatist approach confirms me in my view that this legislation will not be utilised to undertake and attempt to effect a major reduction in the actual number of unemployed young people. The existing range of programmes which we had already established cater for up to 20,000 young people &mdash; 5,000 young people in the National Manpower Service's work experience programme, 10,000 in Anco's general training programmes, 2,000 apprentices and 11,700 in the community youth training programme. These are all excellent schemes, fulfilling worthwhile social and community objectives.  But they cannot be a substitute for the generation of permanent viable employment which arises from overall economic development.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that we must look very closely at this proposed new Youth Employment Agency.  It is coming into being at a time when the thrust of general Government economic policy is in exactly the opposite direction from economic expansion or employment creation. Deflation is the principal element in all ministerial speeches; cutbacks in both investment and current expenditures are the order of the day.  There is no possibility therefore that any significant amount of new resources will be devoted to a reduction in the general level of unemployment, of which youth employment is part.</P>
    <P>The figures published yesterday prove conclusively that if this Government have any employment policy&mdash;and it is my belief that they have not&mdash;it is in a shambles. In January of this year the number of registered unemployed was 125,000, but in June when we left office there had been a reduction to about 123,000.  The Coalition came into office then and after five months we find that there are an additional 10,000 people registered as unemployed.  That is the achievement of the Government in so far as employment generally is concerned.  This increase of 10,000 is attributable directly to the Government's economic and fiscal policies. About 5,000 of the 10,000 can be attributed <Col N="1273" /> to the ban on recruitment to the public service while the remainder is attributable to the general cutback in economic activity.  So far as we can see there is no indication of any let-up in employment.  The graph will keep on rising if the Government continue to pursue the economic and fiscal policies that they have been pursuing in the past five months.  The Minister recognises that youth unemployment is only part of the general problem of unemployment, but in so far as youth employment is concerned we cannot expect anything from these economic and fiscal policies of the Coalition.  The whole impetus of their policy is in the opposite direction.  It is calculated to create more rather than less unemployment.</P>
    <P>This new Youth Employment Agency therefore will be confined to a very limited area of operation, in the main dealing with the structural aspects of youth unemployment but not really influencing the overall level of youth unemployment which is part of the general employment situation.</P>
    <P>This concentration of the new agency on structural problems is very clearly enunciated by the Minister when he says in his introductory speech, that what is expected of the Agency is &ldquo;that it should very quickly achieve an identification as a primary agency, assisting and facilitating the employment of young persons&rdquo;. There is nothing there about job creation but a very clear description of the structural role of the new agency.</P>
    <P>A major obstacle in planning an attack on youth unemployment is the absence of full and accurate statistics, deriving largely from the fact that when young people apply unsuccessfully to an employment exchange they are not recorded and are not included in the number on the register.  I hope that the staff needed by the Department of Labour to prepare an adequate statistical profile of the problem of youth unemployment will be supplied and that that staff at least will be exempted from the general ban on recruitment to the public service.</P>
    <P>When we come to examine the financial provisions of this legislation, this limitation <Col N="1274" /> of the scope of the Employment Agency becomes even clearer still.  There is obviously no question of vast new resources being poured into the existing schemes or the provision of new ones.  In 1981 the cost of the existing measures, grants to AnCO, CERT, the Work Experience Programme and so on came to roughly £35 million.  The Minister indicated in his introductory speech that the new levy about to be imposed will raise £40 million in 1982.  This makes it quite clear that a considerable expansion of the resources available is not contemplated and that there will be a negligible increase if any in the programmes if there is to be an increase at all.</P>
    <P>It seems, therefore, that all we really have to consider in regard to this legislation is whether or not this new agency will be more effective in administering the existing schemes with possibly marginally increased resources.  It may well be, but we cannot be sure.  It seems to me that the Minister lays far too much stress on the importance of co-ordinating and integrating existing schemes.  He seems to be of the opinion that co-ordination in itself will improve the situation.  I doubt it.  Superficially, there is a great deal to be said for having all the schemes supervised by one body, but it is extremely doubtful if this supervision and co-ordination will on the ground add to the number of young people being included in the scheme.  In fact, it may do the very opposite.  We all know when the administrators get down to co-ordinating and integrating the language used on this occasion&mdash;it is more often likely to mean a reduction in the numbers than the reverse.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of co-ordination. The existing corps of unemployed young people, must, of necessity be of very diverse character.  The nature and extent of unemployment and the categories unemployed will vary from area to area.  The type of employment required will also vary considerably.  Young people seeking employment will have different ambitions, requirements, standards of education and training.  The response, therefore, to their employment needs must be equally varied and flexible. <Col N="1275" /> I ask the Minister to be on his guard against the possibility that because there is one new overall body integrating the schemes and co-ordinating activities this will hinder or limit the variety and the nature of the schemes or their ability to respond in a flexible manner to the differing situations that prevail.</P>
    <P>The whole approach to youth unemployment, for instance, in the inner city area of Dublin, must be radically different from that in a mixed urban rural area. I want to sound a very specific note of warning that in the process of co-ordinating and intergrating there will not be a reduction not so much in the overall level of numbers covered but in the flexibility of the response because a very different type of response to youth unemployment is needed in different areas and for different categories of the population.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to note that the board of directors of the agency will only include a representative from the Department of Education and one from the Department of the Environment.  I believe that it is a fatal weakness that neither Finance nor Industry and Energy will be represented.  The absence of a representative from the Department of Finance particularly clearly signals that there is no commitment from that Department and they prefer to stay aloof from this new agency and exercise their restrictive role from a distance.  I would like to have seen a representative from the Department of Finance, in particular, on the board of this new agency because no matter how admirable the representatives from the Department of Education or the Department of the Environment may be they do not command the same strength and muscle as the Department of Finance do.  I would be afraid that because the Department of Finance are not committed in this way by membership of the board they will exercise their traditional restrictive, limiting role from a distance and considerably curtail the functions and the activities of the agency.</P>
    <P>Equally, I believe it is extraordinary that we have not got a commitment from the Department of Industry and Energy <Col N="1276" /> by having a representative on the board. I believe that the board will suffer from a serious defect by the absence of some representative from the Department of Industry and Energy.  I believe these are two important aspects of the structure of the new agency which should have been considered but perhaps could be considered now before it is too late.  Unfortunately, we will not have a great deal of time to effect changes in the legislation on Committee Stage because we have undertaken to let the Government have the Committee Stage fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult, as Deputy Bertie Ahern has pointed out, to see serious problems arising over the respective roles of this new agency and the bodies which are already involved in the youth employment area, particularly AnCO.  AnCO train young people, place them with employers and secure funds from the European Social Fund.  Where exactly will AnCO stand in regard to these and other functions in relation to the new agency?  There is grave danger of confusion arising there.  When two State agencies have a role in the same general area it is very important that their respective roles be clearly delineated, that lines of demarcation be drawn.  I believe this legislation should have clarified that aspect and should have clearly laid down the functions of the different bodies and agencies concerned.  It should have defined exactly where the existing agencies will end their responsibility and that responsibility will be taken over by the new agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory speech was disappointing in a number of its aspects, especially where he speaks about the employment guarantee concept.  This guarantee has been watered down to something which is of very little significance, and one must naturally expect that this watering down has been for financial reasons.  In his introductory speech, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that what we are proposing for Ireland in the Bill before us at least matches what is being done in other countries.  The emphasis is on a comprehensive package to assist <Col N="1277" /> young people, and it is very similar to, if not identical to, the youth guarantee idea which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The important words there are, of course.  &ldquo;if not identical to&rdquo; because the unpalatable fact which the Minister is seeking to glide over in those sentences is that the idea of an employment guarantee has, in fact, been discharged.  There is no further mention of a guarantee or of a fixed period, such as six months, after which a job or a training place will definitely be offered.  The highest hope is, of course, expressed that existing schemes will be extended to take on additional numbers but I am afraid we cannot be in any way optimistic about that having regard to the funding provisions proposed.</P>
    <P>It is to the financial aspects of this legislation that we are most strenuously opposed.  It is improper to add this new levy to the health contribution.  If taxes cease to be what they say they are and instead of being a health contribution are in reality a youth employment levy, this undermines the acceptability and credibility of our taxation system.  This new levy of 1 per cent which is being raised as a health contribution is in reality an additional income tax, but a very crude form of income tax without any of the necessary refinements of the income tax code which cater for differing individual and family circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister puts up a very weak and feeble case when he talks about his decision not to establish a youth employment fund.  I think everyone confidently expected that would happen, that the existing schemes would continue to be financed from the Exchequer in the normal way, that the proceeds of the levy would be extra and would provide a major new source of funds which would be available to finance job creation on a considerable scale.  That is what the general public, and particularly the young people and the youth organisations, expected.</P>
    <P>The Minister's explanation as to why this is not happening is spurious.  He decided, he says, that it would be, and I quote, &ldquo;wasteful of resources and inefficient&rdquo;. <Col N="1278" /> There is no question of wasting resources or being inefficient in leaving the existing schemes to be financed by the Exchequer as they are now and making the new funds from the levy available for additional operations.  What has happened and what the Minister is endeavouring to cloak is that the Government have decided to use the proceeds from this new levy to transfer from the Exchequer the cost of the existing schemes. Unfortunately and regrettably, that is as clear as day.  There will be practically no additional funding for youth employment. In fact, it is not unreasonable to claim that this whole system of financing the new Youth Employment Agency, whatever the merits of the agency as a body may be, is simply a very clever device to shift the cost of financing youth employment schemes and to transfer that cost onto the shoulders of employees.</P>
    <P>At this point it would be possible for me in a cynical way to congratulate the Department of Finance on what they have achieved here.  They have taken particular advantage of a political situation. There was a commitment by the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael leadership to this new agency and to this new youth employment levy.  That seemed to be a fairly straightforward undertaking by Fine Gael to the young people to raise new money by way of an additional levy to finance additional youth employment activity.  However, somewhere along the line someone has succeeded in subverting that concept.  Now the levy is being imposed arbitrarily on all employees, but instead of the money going in total for new job creation it is being used to relieve the Exchequer of the cost of existing schemes.  In the interests of the Exchequer, someone has done a very clever job there.</P>
    <P>The great bulk of this new levy will be contributed by PAYE employees and will in effect mean a 1 per cent drop in the take-home pay of those employees.  That must surely generate demands for compensation. In this connection, it is well to note also that the levy can be increased by order of the Minister and that he can also by order define the &ldquo;reckonable earnings&rdquo; on which the levy will be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> So far as this levy is concerned, it is a wide open situation.  Members of this House should not think that this legislation is putting a limit in this area.  It is not.  First, the Minister may by order define &ldquo;reckonable earnings&rdquo; in any way he wishes.  The definitions section of the Bill is unusual.  As would normally be the case, it does not define &ldquo;reckonable earnings&rdquo; but states that &ldquo;reckonable earnings will be defined by ministerial order&rdquo;.  In theory, the Minister could define &ldquo;reckonable earnings&rdquo; as twice the salary or take-home pay of an individual.  Not alone can he define &ldquo;reckonable earnings&rdquo; in any way he wishes but he can also by ministerial order increase the 1 per cent levy.  I regard that situation as undesirable.  If we had more time and if this were a different type of legislation not directed to such worthwhile social purposes, we would take strenuous objection to such an open-ended type of legislation.</P>
    <P>We oppose this proposal of a levy on the two main grounds; first, because the new levy is arbitrary and unfair in that it does not take account of family circumstances and, secondly, because the new moneys raised will simply be used to relieve the Exchequer of the cost of existing youth employment schemes and will not go towards new job creation.  On that basis we are opposed to the levy in particular and to the financial provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>When we sift through these legislative proposals and the Minister's speech what are we left with?  All the Government are really doing is setting up a new agency which will co-ordinate and integrate existing schemes, oversee them and examine proposals for new schemes.  The whole exercise regrettably will have only a negligible additional impact on youth employment.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to accept that there may be a case for such a co-ordinating agency and we are prepared to give it every chance.  We will not, therefore, oppose the Bill as a whole, though we will oppose the sections which impose this new arbitrary levy because this is an additional direct tax on employees and <Col N="1280" /> simply a device to make employees shoulder an additional burden so as to relieve the Exchequer of what should be its responsibility for youth employment.</P>
    <P>We would like to see a number of changes both in this legislation and in the Government's approach to youth employment generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to this legislation itself we would like principally to see a major change in the financial provisions.  The arbitrary levy of 1 per cent on employees should be abandoned and the amount of money to be provided for youth employment should come directly from the Exchequer through the normal taxation process.  The proceeds of that levy should be additional to the existing schemes already financed directly from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the board of directors should include representatives from both the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Energy in order to ensure the full commitment of those Departments to the operations and activities of the agency.  There are other changes which could be made in the board which would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>On this aspect I would quote with approval the statement issued by the National Youth Council of Ireland as follows:</P>
    <P>But we stress again as we have done consistently in the past the absolute necessity to give real power to the Agency, yet another costly Committee would be a waste.</P>
    <P>That is very true.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the legislation should clearly and specifically designate the respective roles and areas of responsibilities of AnCO and the other bodies already involved in the youth employment area.</P>
    <P>On the general objective of tackling overall unemployment we would like to suggest action along the following lines. Firstly, there must be positive decision by the Government to award the provision of youth employment an absolute priority in economic and fiscal policy and to reverse present policies in this respect.</P>
    <P>Secondly, our 1981 National Investment Plan should be fully implemented and carried forward at an expanded level <Col N="1281" /> into 1982 with emphasis on capital investment in building up and improving our economic and social infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we would like to see the industrial development programme of the IDA intensified and expanded to the maximum level and in addition to see a major drive by the IDA to create a new services export-oriented industry based on our existing educational and professional advantages.  The legislation to build up such a services industry already exists and the IDA are statutorily equipped to promote it.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we would like to see a directive given to every semi-State body to maintain apprentice and trainee recruitment at adequate levels and in addition to carry out a detailed study of all their areas of operation to see where new viable and permanent jobs can be created through the development of their existing operations and possible new related ones.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, there should be a continuing shift in the emphasis of second and third level education away from the present academically oriented system to a scientific and technological one.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, the Government should take up the European Commission on their statement in the paper &ldquo;Job Creation &mdash; Priorities for Action&rdquo; that &ldquo;there is a wide range of measures available to the Commission to assist the entry into working life in the 19 - 25 age group&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Finally, the ban on recruitment to the public service should be scrapped.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable the the Government feel it is politically necessary to rush this legislation through because I believe it is legislation that could be greatly improved and that a good Committee Stage with a constructive non-partisan approach by the many Deputies who know a great deal about the subject would have been very beneficial.</P>
    <P>However, we have reluctantly agreed to give the Government all Stages now before the Christmas recess because we would not wish young people to think that any effort of any kind to improve their employment prospects and opportunities would be unnecessarily delayed in this House.</P>

He had his facts straight and would not handle a brief unless this was the case.  I am very sorry that he had deteriorated so much or that he has been given a brief containing so many inaccuracies.  If he seeks commitment, he has the commitment of the Government.  He has been using a brief which he did not check.

They will be borne in mind, particularly when drawing up the memorandum and articles of association of the agency when it is established. I am particularly appreciative of the remarks on the speed with which we have brought forward these proposals. They anticipate more general proposals which will deal with economic development and other relevant matters.  I should like to assure Deputy Haughey that his comment regarding the way the scheme will be funded is inaccurate and I will deal with this in the course of my remarks.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's opening speech the reasons for the decision to adopt such a course were made quite clear.  First, we wanted to see a co-ordinated approach between what had been done in the past and what is to be done in the future, and I am convinced that the best way to do this is by having a single source of Exchequer finance.  The alternative would be to finance expansions in the activity of certain bodies from the levy while continuing to finance their existing level of activity from general taxation. Such an approach would lead inevitably to administrative confusion and a larger bureaucratic structure.  I share the concern expressed by certain Deputies that this should not be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>The extent of the Government's commitment in the area of youth employment can be seen from our intention to increase the number of young people catered for under the various schemes from 20,000 in 1981 to 40,000 in 1982 &mdash; in other words, an increase of 20,000.  Net Exchequer contributions to the existing programmes, which in future will be financed through the agency, will total just under £20 million in 1981 as compared with an estimated £40 million anticipated in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the levy being an <Col N="1284" /> additional tax, I emphasise that the overall level of direct and indirect taxation will be set by Government in formulating their budget.  The existence of the 1 per cent levy will be taken into account when this is being done.  In this sense the levy is not an additional tax.  It is a positive step taken to identify a given amount of revenue as being devoted entirely to the important task of combating youth unemployment. The use of the moneys raised must be taken into account in looking at the impact of the levy.  I intend to improve the concentration of available resources on those most in need: young unemployed people in our poorer areas. By this means, along with the exemption of social welfare pensions and other payments from the levy, we are ensuring that the effect of this new measure will be progressive.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the variation of the levy.  This provision is designed to allow for the reduction of the levy at any time should the proceeds be greater than felt necessary for the operation of the agencies.  Such a situation would come about with a reduction in the extent of the youth employment problem.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to increase the levy to more than 1 per cent.  Section 19 (1) of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>(c)  Regulations under this paragraph shall not so vary the rate of levy specified in this Act that it exceeds the rate standing so specified upon the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 16, 17 and 18, which provide for the payment of the levy, specify that the rate of levy will be 1 per cent.  The proceeds of the levy will be paid via the social insurance fund and the Minister for Labour to the Exchequer.  An amount equivalent to the yield from the levy will be entered in a subhead of the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Labour. The agency will have a responsibility for channelling these moneys to approved programme sponsors.  For the first year provision for channelling funds direct to the programme sponsors is being made. This, of course, is an interim arrangement.</P>
    <P>As regards the detailed activities of the <Col N="1285" /> agency, this will be a matter for decision by the board.  The composition of the board, representative as they are of a broad spectrum of society, will put them in a position to devise and implement new programmes where existing schemes are deficient.  The proposed terms of reference leave scope for such an approach.</P>
    <P>Equally important is the need to maintain and, indeed, improve the quality of existing schemes as they are expanding. I regard this as one of the central roles to be entrusted to the agency.  The scope which the agency will have for bilateral contact with local bodies will make a major contribution both in the area of improving existing schemes and in developing new ones.</P>
    <P>I can see scope for the agency to take new initiatives in a number of areas.  For example, many new areas of social and community work are emerging.  The agency could take the initiative in looking at young people's involvement in the growing field of child care services, home care for the aged and similar activities. Assistance will be given with the development of enterprises and this will meet the wishes expressed by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the question of new initiatives by the agency, I would like to refer to the assistance which the agency would give to local areas and rural areas. The register of young job seekers prepared by the NMS will indicate the areas where excess labour exists and where there is a need for assistance for young people.  The agency will then arrange for programme sponsors to come forward with the necessary programmes.  I could envisage here the local organisation of an integrated series of activities which take account of local circumstances, in particular building education and training elements into all programmes including all those now providing only short-term employment.  This would involve co-operation between, for instance, local authorities, programme sponsors and VECs.  It is fair to say that existing schemes and arrangements do not cater for local areas and there is a clear need for the type of overall approach that will <Col N="1286" /> result from the activities of the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>The agency will also help rural areas. One of the terms of reference is to identify areas outside the scope of existing programmes into which Government aid to young people could be extended. Under this heading I anticipate a concentration on employment in agriculture and other primary activities.  In carrying out their activities the agency, of course, will be in continuous consultation with development bodies, including regional and local development bodies.  The overall objective is to equip young people to enter working life and to take emphasis off &ldquo;make-work&rdquo; schemes.  The agency's composition and their ability to take an overview of the whole area of transition from education to working life puts them in a unique position to make improvements to existing schemes and to devise new programmes.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that the setting up of the Youth Employment Agency is unnecessary and represents a needless addition to our administrative system.  In this connection I will point out that the programme for Government contained a commitment to establish a youth employment agency.  In making that commitment full regard was had to the existing arrangements.  That consideration indicated the failure of previous efforts at co-ordination.  To suggest now that the essential role being given to the Youth Employment Agency could equally well be discharged by one of the present sponsors is not convincing.  Their establishment as a limited company with the task of funding and assessing existing schemes, devising new programmes and encouraging youth enterprises afford flexibility which no existing sponsor has or could easily be assigned.  In addition, the agency's role in funding the activities of sponsors will mean that real co-ordination and assessment will for the first time become a feature of our approach to tackling the problem of youth employment.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed at the tendency for State agencies to expand and become bureaucratic in their approach.  One safeguard against this <Col N="1287" /> happening in the Youth Employment Agency will be the representative nature of their board.  Another will be the clear identification of the agency's source of funding with the objective they are intended to achieve.  Finally, the Minister for Labour himself will have to be consulted on staffing levels.  I intend the calibre of those appointed to the agency to be of the highest standards.  I know I can rely on the nominating bodies to assist me in this respect.</P>
    <P>I accept that the setting up of the Youth Employment Agency will not solve all the problems of youth unemployment.  In my opening statement I placed youth unemployment firmly in the context of the global problem of unemployment. The Government are committed to planning for soundly-based economic growth and work is proceeding on the preparation of an initial three-year plan.  We are also proposing to reform the Government's own financial procedures in such a way that the social and economic impact of Government spending will be made clear.  This is essential to democratic and participative planning.  Within this overall planning context, the Government will continue with existing forms of job creation in the productive sectors.  The National Development Corporation will be a major new initiative in this field.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Youth Employment Agency will make an immediate contribution to tackling the present high level of youth unemployment.  The agency's role in improving the transition from education to working life must also be seen as one of the building blocks of long-term social and economic planning. The young people now entering the workforce will form the backbone of our adult population for many years to come. Providing these young people with skills and the ability to cope with the many changes which will take place is vital.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his opening address on Second Stage that he intended to set up the agency on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. As I have heard no objections to this approach, it is proposed now to proceed on that basis.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the <Col N="1288" /> employment figure and using the unemployment numbers to show, according to the people opposite, that there was a tremendous increase in unemployment in this country.  Listening to the people who were speaking, one would imagine that unemployment had been invented some time in July and had not had any effect before that.  Of course, those of us who want to look at it and who care to give an unbiased view of the position know that unemployment has been with us for quite some time.  For a Government who had four years during which the employment position was deteriorating it is a bit much to hear them complaining that it has not been solved in five months.  The rising trend in unemployment which commenced at the beginning of 1980 at the onset of the recession has continued throughout 1981, but at a considerably lower rate.  Allowing for seasonal effects, the live register increased by 1,400 per month on average during the first 11 months of 1981 compared with an average monthly increase of 2,800 during 1980, twice as many.  This significant slowing down is an encouraging sign and, taken with other economic indicators suggests that unemployment should reach its peak level fairly soon.</P>
    <P>Recovery began in industrial output during the first half of this year and, while the decline in manufacturing employment continued, this was considerably less during the second quarter than in the previous four quarters.  The increase in registered unemployment here during the past year or so has been well below EEC average and very much less than that in other member countries.  This should be remembered.  Up to October 1981, registered unemployed increased by 54 per cent in Germany and the Netherlands, 47 per cent in Luxembourg, 45 per cent in the United Kingdom and 31 per cent in the Community as a whole while the increase here in the same period was 17 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition tried to give the impression that <Col N="1289" /> Fianna Fáil had solved the unemployment problem and, since they left office, that things had deteriorated.  Fianna Fáil made a mess of the unemployment problem. They were not able to produce the necessary money, even by borrowing as much as they possibly could, to try to keep industry going, and created the situation with which we are now faced.  We are trying to get unemployment back on an even keel and the Opposition are criticising us for that.  I do not mind being criticised by people who do not know any better but I find it hard to take it from Deputy Haughey who, I am sure, knows the true position.  His comments on the Bill did him no credit.  I believe he is capable of a far better contribution than that which he made to-day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey quoted a figure for January 1981 of 125,000 people unemployed and the seasonally adjusted figure as 119,600.  In June 1981 the figure was 123,600 and the seasonal adjustment was 126,400.  In November 1981 the figure was 133,100 as against 133,900.  It is not true to say that the unemployment trend was down in the January-June period and that statement should not have been made by Deputy Haughey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just quoted the figures. The effect of youth unemployment has created a situation which is pushing up the unemployment figure generally. Because of the fact that there are so many young people looking for jobs, prepared to do anything, older people who lose their jobs are finding it impossible to get new employment.  That is something we will have to face and we are hoping that this agency will at least give us the chance to take the pressure off older people by giving younger people an opportunity to get employment.  Deputy Haughey said it is wrong for any country to have such a high number of unemployed young people.  We all echo that sentiment but youth unemployment has not been created during the last five months and Deputy Haughey knows that.  He knows it was partly if not mainly as a result of <Col N="1290" /> maladministration which created a situation where it was nearly impossible for young people leaving school, no matter what qualifications they had, to find employment.</P>
      <P>Most of the Deputies opposite made constructive comments on the Bill and I hope, when we reach Committee Stage, they will continue to do so.  Deputy Haughey knows that my attitude to legislation has always been that it is not a one-sided affair, it must be dealt with by both sides.  Constructive criticism from the Opposition very often improves a Bill going through the House but it must not consist of carping criticism only.  We are pinning our faith on the fact that everybody knows that 1 per cent of his or her income is going to fund this scheme.  That 1 per cent cannot be increased and, if things improve, we expect to be able to reduce it.  It is not correct to suggest that we will increase it.</P>
      <P>Reckonable earnings &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Haughey is aware of this &mdash; follow the same definition as in the Health Act.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 10, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  For the purpose of an investigation under subsection (2) (d) the Council shall have discretion as to the manner in which the investigation shall be carried out and in particular may carry out the investigation wholly or partly in public and the Council or a person authorised by the Council (in this section referred to as an authorised person) may&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was dealing with the amendment put down by the Minister.  It states in the amendment &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo; but in that section of the amendment the Minister does not state the amount of the fine. Maybe the amounts are as they apply under the other sections of the Bill and I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that in his reply.  We had reservations about the earlier drafting of the section and welcome this amendment.  I had some reservations about evidence not taken on oath.  Such evidence would be hazy; witnesses called might not attend and, if they did attend, their evidence could be open to different interpretations. I presume that the tribunal, under this section, would, if necessary receive legal aid and that the Department of the Environment would pay these costs.  An inquiry recently ended has cost, in legal fees, over £1 million, which is an enormous amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an investigation were carried out on any small premises where a disaster might, unhappily, occur, what recourse would the owner have to legal aid?  A man who owned or managed a small hotel or business, or who leased property, could not afford to hire legal people to carry out an investigation which might last for weeks and cost a lot of money. This goes for any place where people might congregate.  There is no mention in the Bill of legal aid in such a case.  There should be an arrangement to indemnify these people in some way.  We did not put down an amendment, preferring to <Col N="1293" /> have the matter brought up in the House to see if it was possible to come to arrangements with the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bundoran inquiry, would the Minister let us know if there is a change of heart in that direction and if an immediate investigation will be carried out into this disaster?  We, on this side of the House, have been pressing for an immediate hearing on this and people are anxious to know the outcome of any hearing.  The leak in the reports has not helped and this matter should be cleared up immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment states that the hearing may be partly or wholly in public at the discretion of the council. All the investigations which the council may carry out should be in public.  Anything in the line of a major investigation which is held in private could be open to accusations that there was a cover up. That would be a dangerous situation and not in everyone's best interests.  The IIRS, or somebody qualified, should examine the seating arrangements of a number of hotels and places of entertainment where people congregate, to ensure that they are not of an inflammable nature.  It might be better if the amounts of the fines payable for offences were included in the amendment.  However, this may come under another part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies could be called upon to play a more positive role regarding legal expenses incurred by all the parties.  This matter should be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this amendment has been accepted and welcomed by the House.  I want to reply to matters raised in the debate on the amendment.  Deputy Burke asked if the council would be totally independent of the Minister.  As he pointed out, subsection (1) of section 16 requires the council to carry out such services as the Minister may specify from time to time. Subsection (2) lists some of the services which shall be performed at the request of the Minister, including at (d) the carrying <Col N="1294" /> out of an investigation into any fire or any emergency operation.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, clear that the council will hold investigations only at the request of the Minister.  Once the Minister has made a request, subsection (3) as outlined in the amendment will give the council discretion as to how the investigation shall be carried out.  It will, of course, be open to the Minister to give the council specific terms of reference when asking it to carry out any investigation. The question of whether an investigation would be conducted wholly or partly in public was also raised and the amendment clearly gives the council discretion to decide this.</P>
      <P>I believe that this is the correct approach since it will leave the council free to assess each case on its merits.  I am sure that we can rely on its members to make a fair and balanced judgment on this.  It is to be expected that in the majority of cases referred to the council should be in a position to produce a report without recourse to public hearings.  However, where the council consider the hearing of evidence in public is necessary for the purpose of its investigations, the amendment would enable them to do so. Not all investigations into fires are going to be of the scale and complexity of Stardust and Whiddy and it is likely that many will only involve an expert assessment with conclusions and recommendations on the lessons for the future.  It must be remembered that, if the Government of the day consider a public inquiry is necessary into any fire, they will have the option of setting up a public inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act or the Local Government Act, as appropriate.  It can also be expected that in the future more fires will come under judicial scrutiny by the courts in view of the obligations being placed by the Bill on persons in control of premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to note that, while the Council might hold public hearings, it would not be appropriate to require that their own deliberations would be in public, bearing in mind that the deliberations of a tribunal, once it has finished taking evidence, are not held in public. There were some questions as to what <Col N="1295" /> penalties would apply in respect of offences specified in the amendment.  The penalties are those mentioned in section 5 (1) (a): £500 fine or six months imprisonment or both the fine and imprisonment. These apply to most offences mentioned in the Bill except for contraventions of sections 18 (2), 20 and 37 and I believe they represent an adequate deterrent.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues were also raised which are not directly relevant to the amendment, in particular the Bundoran fire and the staffing of fire services. I have nothing to add to what the Minister said on Committee Stage.  In relation to the Bundoran fire mentioned by Deputy Connolly, I understand that the Minister went into great detail on Committee Stage and on the Second Stage of the Bill.  Deputy Connolly also raised the question of legal aid.  This does not arise in the Bill.  It is a matter which will be considered separately in the light of particular investigations by the council.  It is not something which is relevant to the Bill at this stage but it is something that could be considered by the council subsequently.</P>

      <P>While the Minister on Committee Stage went into some detail on the question of the Bundoran fire inquiry, we did not have at that time the amendment which the Minister drafted subsequent to the argument we made on Committee Stage.  In the spirit of the debate which we have had here and for the sake of clarity, will the Minister say what type of inquiry is to be held in relation to Bundoran?  Is it to be a public inquiry or will it be this type of inquiry?  Will the Minister at least tell us when there will be an announcement about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of Committee Stage the Minister indicated that there would be an inquiry into the Bundoran fire but that the Government had yet to decide what form that inquiry would take, to decide whether it would be a judicial tribunal established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, or <Col N="1296" /> an investigation by the Fire Services Council under section 18 of this Bill, and that no decision would be taken by the Government until these two options are available to them following enactment of this Bill.  He also pointed out that the question of criminal liability had been disposed of by the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions and what remained to be done was to establish the lessons to be learned for the future.  I cannot go beyond that at this stage.  As I said, the Minister dealt with it in detail. Beyond that I cannot give the Deputy any other information.</P>

      <P>For the information of the Deputy, there is an amendment No. 3 on the Order Paper which relates to section 36.  Recommittal is necessary in this case and this might cover the point raised by Deputy Taylor.</P>
      <P>Section 36 recommitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was seeking to have section 36 deleted in its entirety. The Minister's amendment, brought in as a result of what I said, is welcome.  It goes some of the way towards what I was looking for but it by no means goes all of the way.  Section 36 is rather a strange thing to find facing one in a Bill being put before the Oireachtas in the year 1981.</P>
      <P>The section in its original form gave the Minister, the fire authorities and the sanitary authorities complete immunity from being taken to task by any private citizen because of their failure to comply with any of their duties or obligations. That means that the Minister has duties imposed on him by the Bill, as have the fire authorities and the local authorities, and yet we have a section in the Bill which would seek to exonerate them from responsibility to any citizen who suffered injury or damage because of failure of any of these authorities to comply with obligations imposed on them by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That kind of immunity goes back to the old feudal notion that the king can do no wrong.  That was thought to have been transported into our law by saying that the State can do no wrong.  For many years it was thought that was the position, that a private citizen who sustained injury as a result of the negligence or the fault of a State servant or a State authority would not have a claim for damages.  This was not a theoretical thing: it was something relied on and used by the Government <Col N="1298" /> and State authorities until relatively recent times.</P>
    <P>The matter came to a head in the Supreme Court in 1971 in a case known as <i>Byrne v. Ireland.</i> It concerned a woman walking along who fell into a trench which had been cut there and negligently left by Department of Posts and Telegraphs workmen.  She sought to recover damages from the State for her injuries.  Despite the old traditional thing that the king could do no wrong, the State could do no wrong, the High Court upheld her claim.  It was appealed to the Supreme Court, who decided that this sort of immunity by the State was not a reality, and the State were held liable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the undesirability in this day and age of granting immunity to the State, or to State or local authority officers, when carrying out their lawful functions, this supposed immunity very likely is unconstitutional.  In any case, it is a retrograde measure which in this day and age should not be contemplated.  That old concept of State immunity used to apply in Europe.  In France it was abolished in 1873, in Germany in 1896 and in Britain, which was the fount of the whole idea, it was abolished by the Crown Proceedings Act of 1947.  Here, in 1981, when new responsibilities for fire services are being introduced, it is purported to introduce this immunity.  I shall refer briefly to some of the comments made by two of the Supreme Court judges in the case I have mentioned which are apt to this situation.  At page 281 of <i>Irish Reports</i> Mr. Justice Walsh is reported:</P>
    <P>Where the people, by the Constitution, create rights against the State or impose duties upon the State, a remedy to enforce these must be deemed to be also available.  It is as much the duty of the State to render justice against itself in favour of citizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> In page 20, line 2, to delete &ldquo;exercise of or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During his short contribution last Tuesday, when he was putting down his own amendment, Deputy Taylor drew attention to the provisions of section 36, which, as drafted, gives local authorities and the Minister immunity from civil actions for damages arising from the exercise or failure to exercise any of their functions.  Since then the Minister has had an opportunity to have another look at this section, the purpose of which was to ensure that fire authorities and the Minister would not be inhibited in the performance of their functions because of the constant threat of liability to civil actions.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I am legally advised that there is no objection to this section from a constitutional point of view.  However, I appreciate the point made by the Deputy that the provisions of section 36 might be regarded as retrogressive in so far as they relate to the exercise of functions.  This amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;exercise of or&rdquo; and will bring section 36 into line with the existing provisions of section 5(2) of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, on which it was based.  If the amendment is accepted it means that immunity from civil actions for damages will only apply where there is a failure to carry out a function.  I hope this will meet Deputy Taylor's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, the amendment goes half way to meeting the objection I had to the section. In its original form the section granted immunity in cases in which injury was caused or damage done either by the exercise of functions under the Act or failure to comply with any of the provisions of the Act.  It is proposed to take half of that out, but I still regard the section as 50 per cent objectionable.  I was quoting the comments made by Mr. <Col N="1300" /> Justice Walsh in the Supreme Court.  He referred to the duty of the State to render justice against itself in favour of citizens. He said that was as much a responsibility of the State as it was to provide justice between private individuals.  Even as the section has been left, a private individual would be denied justice as against the State.  If the Minister or one of his servants or one of the servants of the sanitary authorities or fire authorities fail to comply with their obligations under the Act and an injury resulted, the injured person would not be able to maintain an action for damages against the State.  Mr. Justice Walsh continued:</P>
      <P>In my view the whole tenor of our Constitution is to the effect that there is no power, institution or person in the land free from the law save where such immunity is expressed or provided for in the Constitution itself.</P>
      <P>Later, at page 299, Mr. Justice Budd put the thing very succinctly &mdash; I could not do any better myself:</P>
      <P>From what is to be deduced in the main from an analysis of the foregoing provisions of the Constitution in so far as they affect the immunity of the State from suit, it would seem correct to say that the Constitution is not imbued with fuedal conceptions of privilege and exemptions, but rather with the modern conceptions of the duty of the State and the recognition by it of the human rights and needs of those who are the citizens of the State, so that instead of hedging the State with privileges and immunities, the general trend is to place obligations on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems very much in point in this discussion and I have serious reservations about any immunity being provided in the Bill for the State authorities or local authorities for their failure or the failure of their employees to carry out the duties and obligations imposed on them by law in this Bill.  In the case of any private firm or concern, if their employees do some negligent act such as making a cutting in the road, and somebody falls into it and injury is sustained, then they carry the <Col N="1301" /> can, they hold the responsibility, and a private citizen injured thereby is entitled to go to the courts and recover damages at law.  I cannot see any good reason in this day and age for not extending that general provision to the State.  That was the clearcut message that came out of the Supreme Court ten years ago.  While I heard the Minister's comment that he has taken advice on it and feels that the section as now amended would be constitutional, speaking in my personal capacity as a humble solicitor, I must say I have some doubts about it, having read the judgment in that case rather carefully.</P>
    <P>Possibly I am taking the Minister short on this.  It is some days since I raised the point with him.  Unfortunately I did not advert to the section on Committee Stage or I would have raised it then.  Appreciating that the Minister has gone at least 50 per cent of the way to meet the point I made on this section, I would ask him to look at it again.  If he feels there is merit in dealing with the remaining part of the section, perhaps he could deal with it when the Bill reaches the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Taylor for highlighting this matter and drawing our attention to this section. This is the section as I introduced it in April or May.  Having listened to Deputy Taylor, and having read through the section while he was speaking, I can see great merit in the case he is making.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone half way down the road to meet the point made by Deputy Taylor in his amendment, No. 2, which was not acceptable and which suggested the deletion of section 36.  I join with Deputy Taylor in asking the Minister to look at this whole section again as he did in the case of the argument we put forward with regard to inquiries.  He brought forward a very positive amendment on Report Stage which was accepted earlier this afternoon.  I see considerable merit in the case made by Deputy Taylor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not purport to be a constitutional lawyer.  Deputy Taylor referred to himself as a humble solicitor.  He is more than a humble solicitor.  He made his case very well on the constitutionality of this <Col N="1302" /> section.  I appeal to the Minister to have another look at it before it goes to the Seanad to see if the point made by Deputy Taylor can be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor has made a very good case.  In his reply the Minister referred to a failure to carry out a duty.  I should like to know the interpretation of the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  This is getting into a very technical and legalistic area.  I will leave that to the legal people.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about the section. The Minister has gone half way down the road to meet Deputy Taylor. The constitutionality of the section may now come under scrutiny.  I am worried about the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  How does a person to whom this section applies fail in his duty?  Will the fire council say at a hearing that an official of the local authority was at fault?  This section was drafted when we were in office.  The question is whether it is constitutional.  I do not know.  This opens up a very wide technical argument.</P>

In fact the Minister went a long way towards meeting their views.  It is only right that the views of Members of the House should be taken into consideration in finalising this Bill. I cannot understand the objection by Deputy Burke and Deputy Connolly to this section because it was in Deputy Burke's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Burke is objecting to it at this stage.  That is not in accordance with the spirit of the debate on this Bill.  The matter has got a good airing.  There have been detailed discussions on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be argued that section 36, as it stands, precludes a claim for damages by a person injured in an accident with a fire engine or by a fireman injured in the course of his duty.  This was not the intention. <Col N="1303" /> The provisions of section 5(2) of the 1940 Act have presented no problems in this regard and, for that reason, it is proposed to return to the general formula used there.</P>
    <P>The objection to section 36 advanced by Deputy Taylor is based almost entirely on the question of constitutionality. Obviously this is a matter where I must be guided by the advice of legal experts. Perhaps I should point out that the Bill was drafted by an experienced senior draftsman who would have been very conscious of any possible infringement of the Constitution.  Furthermore, his draft was cleared through the office of the Attorney General.  At that stage the Attorney General agreed with a submission that the provisions of the Bill did not appear to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Taylor has raised a question specifically in relation to section 36, the Legal Adviser of my Department has been consulted.  He has looked at the judgment in the case of Byrne v. Ireland and is satisfied that section 36 is not unconstitutional.  The office of the Attorney General has also been consulted on the matter specifically and the advice given has been confirmed.  I do not think it necessary to pursue this aspect any further.</P>
    <P>I do, however, appreciate the point made by Deputy Taylor that the provisions of section 36 may be retrogressive in so far as the immunity provided in relation to the exercise of functions may be inconsistent with the trend of developments in the law.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have agreed to an amendment of the section which would bring it into line with the provisions of section 5(2) of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  I am not aware that this section ever gave rise to any difficulty in regard to recovery of damages where appropriate.</P>
    <P>The section as amended should be retained.  It ensures that no legal action may be taken against fire authorities, sanitary authorities, or the Minister for damages in respect of any injury alleged to have been caused or contributed to by the failure to exercise any function conferred <Col N="1304" /> by this Bill.  The provision needs to be considered firstly as it relates to local authorities, both fire and sanitary, and secondly as it affects the Minister.</P>
    <P>As far as fire and sanitary authorities are concerned this section is simply a reenactment of section 5 (2) of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  It is interesting to look back to the original debates as reported in volume 78, column 1745 of the official report of 21 February 1940 to see a reason quoted in support of the provision which applies equally well today:</P>
    <P>If damage caused by the outbreak of a particular fire could be made the basis of a claim against the local authority it is considered that there is a possibility that public funds might be liable to be applied towards compensation which can at present be obtained only on the basis of contractual arrangement between a private person and an insurance company.</P>
    <P>This argument is strengthened by the fact that this Bill places the primary duty for fire safety on the person having control of premises and also because section 37 gives the Minister power to make regulations as to compliance with certain fire safety requirements.</P>
    <P>It is also important to emphasise that the primary function of sanitary and fire authorities is to ensure the protection of persons and, to a lesser degree, property, from fire.  They must not be inhibited in any way in carrying out their task and it is certain they would feel more constrained if they remained under the constant threat of liability following civil actions.  They might hesitate to use their ancilliary powers during a fire and as a result lives or additional property could well be lost.  They might be much more circumspect in using their inspection powers, as inspection which was not followed by some action might be taken to imply approval of the fire safety provisions in a premises.</P>
    <P>If subsequently the building burned down they might be made liable even if they had perfectly valid reasons for taking no action.  Equally failure to inspect and enforce provisions might also make <Col N="1305" /> them liable even though there were valid reasons for not doing so, for example, an industrial dispute, inability to recruit adequate staff or perhaps the not unlimited fire prevention staff were concentrating on what they considered to be the premises presenting the most serious risk.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the Minister stem from similar principles, namely, that public funds should not generally be applied to provide compensation where insurance is available and that the Minister should not be unduly inhibited in the performance of functions assigned to him.  For example, he should be free to make or not to make regulations.  He might judge that the best results could be achieved, say, through flexible and easily understood guidelines used by fire authorities rather than mandatory requirements in regulations, written in legal language, and because of their formal nature relatively slow to be amended.  If he were liable to pay compensation he might well opt to make regulations for safety's sake, even though he took the view that an alternative approach would be more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>This illustration helps stress the point that the Minister should have discretion to act or not to act as he sees fit, subject always to scrutiny of his approach by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised at the opening comments of the Minister for State.  I acknowledged that I had introduced this legislation when I first spoke on this amendment.  The purpose of the Committee and Report Stage debate is to give Deputies time to reflect on the legislation, and if a Member comes up with a way of improving the legislation, it is mandatory on everyone to accept his good arguments.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor brought this matter to light and it has been a great help in improving this Bill. The more I listened to the Minister the more I was convinced of the validity of the case made by Deputy Mervyn Taylor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the fire authorities might be inhabited with regard to inspection of properties if we take out this section. He said they might feel they could <Col N="1306" /> not inspect a property because if they did and saw something wrong but did not put it right, they would be liable to a civil action.  In my view they should be liable to a civil action if they do nothing to improve or to condemn a potentially dangerous building.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about the inability to recruit staff.  Are we serious about this legislation?  Is the Minister aware of the implications in this legislation with regard to inspections, fire prevention and the staffing of fire authorities? In reply to amendment No. 1 the Minister of State said he was not going into the staffing question any further because his Minister had answered the points adequately on Committee Stage. I do not agree with that because they were not answered at all.  Under this section we are removing from citizens protection to which they are entitled, protection against blundering or failure at national or local fire authority level.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said if this section was removed the Minister might be constrained with regard to the type of regulations he would make and he might merely set down guidelines.  The Minister has a responsibility to govern wisely and should be liable, if he makes regulations that endanger life or property.  I do not accept the point that public funds should not be used to pay for the failure of fire authorities or the Minister, with regard to death, injury or loss of property due to negligence on the part of the fire authority, the local authority, the sanitary authority or the Minister.  In my view, the argument put forward by the Minister of State makes a case for the removal of section 36.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say I introduced this Bill and I acknowledge that, but having listened to the points raised I see a very strong case for the removal of this section.  The amendment covers the exercise of powers and should be extended to failure to carry out their duties and responsibilities as laid down in this legislation. I ask the Minister to look at this again between now and when it is discussed in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment which goes a long way towards meeting my objections to section 36.  He was making the point that his amendment brings this section more into line with the equivalent section in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.  That Act was passed 41 years ago and one would have thought that after that lapse of time one would have made some progress towards a more modern concept of removing altogether the old feudal immunities that applied to State authorities. Traditionally the immunities did not apply to local authorities yet here such an immunity is imported for a local authority as well as a State authority.</P>
      <P>There could be many situations like those I am talking about.  The functions are set out in section 10.  The fire authority is given various functions under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, the Explosives Act, 1875, the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, and the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, and other legislation. What it amounts to is that if a failure by the fire authority to comply with its obligations under any of that legislation resulted in injuries to persons or loss of property the fire authority would have immunity under section 36 as it stands.  The opening words of section 10 put the obligation on the fire authority to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in buildings and other places of all kinds in its functional area.  In my view they are given an obligation in that and it is not unreasonable that the fire authority should be expected to carry out that obligation in a proper manner, to provide adequate fire fighting appliances in the correct locations, to serve centres of population and other areas in a proper, reasonable and careful way.  If they fail to do that and it transpires that a centre of population is not adequately catered for as a result of which there are injuries, death or loss, it seems reasonable to make the case that the fire authority should compensate the person injured as a result of their neglect to comply with a function laid upon them in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought I was making the case on two separate bases.  One was on some doubt <Col N="1308" /> as to its constitutionality but, leaving that aside, on the basis of a modern concept of whether it is appropriate that immunty should be accorded to the State or local authorities, I should like an indication from the Minister that he will have a look at this aspect.  If it is considered appropriate I hope he will consider the question of a further watering-down of the immunity when the Bill is discussed in the Seanad.  I welcome the amendment the Minister has introduced.  It is a major contribution to the Bill.</P>

I have given an undertaking to Deputy Taylor that I will ask the Minister to have another look at that section but I cannot give any commitment in that regard. Deep consideration was given to the section because it is a controversial one.  My belief is that the Bill, as amended, should be retained but that does not mean that the Minister will not have another look at it.  On the question of inspections Deputy Burke seemed to indicate that there could be a reluctance on the part of local authorities to carry out inspections. I can assure the Deputy and the House that there will not be any question of a reluctance on the part of local authorities, or a reluctance on the part of the Minister in introducing the regulations, to ensure that inspections are carried out. It is clear to everybody that such inspections are necessary.  I appreciate the views expressed by the Deputies today but I believe the section, as amended, should be retained.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that I did not oppose the Minister's amendment although I asked a number of questions about it.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor has opened up a new area on this matter and put up a lot of valid points. The Minister has stated that a member or an official of a fire authority will be immune from prosecution for failure to carry out inspection, but he should bear in mind that in view of the ban on recruitment to the public service brought in by <Col N="1309" /> the Minister for Finance, corporations and county councils do not have sufficient personnel to implement the terms of this Bill.  The owner of a premises must ensure that his premises are in order but if a local authority does not carry out its duty, a prosecution will not follow.  That is not right.  Such authorities should be held responsible just as the owner is.  I have no doubt that legal arguments will follow the introduction of this legislation. It is easy for lawyers to argue about the constitutionality of a certain provision but there is a duty on the owner of a premises, either in its erection or in its purchase, to adhere to the provisions of the Bill.  It is wrong that a member of a fire authority should be immune from prosecution if he fails to inspect such a premises.  In my opinion that will not stand up.  I hope the Minister will tidy up that provision.</P>

      <P>During the course of the debate on this section I <Col N="1310" /> raised a point about the ESB and I am still awaiting a reply.  I recognise the independence of that board but at a time of high unemployment the letter I referred to amounted to a tough line for the board to be adopting when negotiations could take place with the State agencies concerned in an effort to save the jobs in the enterprise.  My contention was that a letter had been sent by the ESB to the Department of Industry and Energy, and to the State agencies, one of which is concerned in this Bill, to the effect that in the event of future receiverships or liquidations and money being due to the ESB, before power would be restored all arrears would have to be paid or arrangements made for payment of them in respect of the company that had gone into receivership.  While realising the importance to this State company of having their moneys collected, one must be concerned about their adopting such an attitude.</P>
      <P>I recall a case of receivership in my constituency some years ago in which a private concern were supplying the power needs of the company in question. When the threat to discontinue supply arose and jeopardised the continuance of a receiver and also a few hundred jobs, I intervened.  Immediately, and to the credit of the private company concerned; they withheld the threat to disconnect supplies.  Certain arrangements were made in the meantime and at the end of the day that company was saved and the whole episode worked out to the satisfaction of everyone involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of the issuing of a threatening letter of this kind one would think that the Minister, having responsibility in the areas of both energy and commerce, would take particular note of what was involved from the point of view of industry on the one hand and from the point of view of employment on the other hand.  The Minister of State who is present, and whose Department have responsibility for the agency we are talking of, should have some concern in this area, especially in the aftermath of the announcement yesterday of those frightening <Col N="1311" /> unemployment figures, figures which prove that the policies of the Government have been designed to cut back and, as we know, cutting back is one of the easiest of operations.  It is typical of hardline conservative monetarist policies. However, one might expect that from one of the parties in Government; but one can only express amazement that the Labour Party should see such policies as the cure to our country's ills during a period of recession.  I am amazed that they can agree with such policies, policies that have been blatantly proved wrong. They are wrong because of our very young population and because the growth we are experiencing in unemployment is more serious for us than it would be for any of our European counterparts. It is time the Government began to govern instead of continuing a propaganda campaign with which the public are totally browned off.  The people do not want to hear any more of it.  This is particularly true of Labour party supporters who are calling for employment, for movement and for investment, none of which this Government show any signs of providing.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have served ailing industries well.  Their successes have been remarkable; but, understandably, they have had failures too.  They are an agency of last resort who are called on only when a serious situation arises.  I am aware that in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Act there must be a prospect of viability in the foreseeable future before this rescue company will act.  In my dealings with Fóir Teoranta during my ten years in politics I have always found them sympathetic and well disposed.  I am sure that some of my colleagues will be anxious to know the outcome of the recent meetings between the Minister for Energy and Fóir Teoranta in connection with the very serious position which is affecting 470 people in Clondalkin Paper Mills, that indigenous industry which is of such important and strategic value. However, as my colleague will be raising this question, I shall not go into it further.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister of State said that his disappointment was that <Col N="1312" /> there was not a trade union representative on the board of Fóir Teoranta.  In his absence I made the point that, if he wishes to move an amendment on Committee Stage to remedy this situation, he will find us accommodating.  It is not sufficient for him now simply to support pious platitudes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I was alarmed to read this morning of such an increase in the unemployment figures. Having regard to the situation in Clondalkin Paper Mills one fears that the figure will increase further but I hope sincerely that Fóir Teoranta will endeavour to come to the rescue of this plant.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat a point that I made here before.  I said that Clondalkin Paper Mills are the only national fine paper mills.  Indeed, the paper used in this House is produced there.  I went to the trouble of asking the Minister for Finance the total value of paper purchased monthly by the Stationery Office from these paper mills from January of this year to date.  The figures are as follows: In January purchases were £60,789.48, February £62,455.85, March £72,508.42, April £29,179.91, May £165,882.67, June £191,519.85, July £192,943.85, August, £90,588.57, September £229,745.83, October £81,243, and up to 27 November £72,877.06, giving a total of £1,249,714.49.  Surely that merits some consideration from Fóir Teoranta?  It must relate to this Bill.  I again appeal, on behalf of Clondalkin Paper Mills and on behalf of the workers, that Fóir Teoranta come to the assistance of Clondalkin Paper Mills to ensure that this mill continues and to ensure that the jobs will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have covered much of the ground in our discussion on this Bill but I would like to give it a new angle, having regard to events which have caught up on the debate.  On an earlier section of the Bill and on Second Stage I made the point that in view of the specific commitment made by the Labour Party, particularly, and by the Tánaiste to a national development corporation this was a practical example where Clondalkin Paper Mills could be viewed in the <Col N="1314" /> commitment to a national development corporation and receive the appropriate help from Fóir Teoranta required to deal with what, I emphasise, are the short-term problems of the company, not the medium- or the long-term problems.  I suggested on Second Stage and also on section 2 of Committee Stage that some form of equity participation by the State or a State agency would meet the commitment of the Labour Party and the Tánaiste to a national development corporation and show bona fides in that respect in this particular instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I made that suggestion it has been followed up by the workers in Clondalkin Paper Mills and by the board of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  A specific proposition has been put to Fóir Teoranta, which up to now has apparently been rejected because of lack of Government indemnification of Fóir Teoranta in this matter.  This specifically means a lack of Government commitment to the specific share which it was felt that the State, through Fóir Teoranta or whatever other means, might put in by way of equity participation in the proposed new structure. The proposition involved 45 per cent initial capital input by Clondalkin Group Limited, 45 per cent by Fóir Teoranta and 10 per cent by the employees of the new company.  This was a tremendous commitment from the employees concerned.  This, in effect, meant that while there would be some reduction in employment from 470 to 300 people there would be an input into the new company in the region of £2 million on a 50:50 basis between the State, through Fóir Teoranta and the company and 10 per cent of that or £200,000 from the workers. With that input of approximately £2,200,000 split 90 per cent between Fóir Teoranta and the company and an input of approximately £200,000 by the workers that broad scheme of equity risk investment by the State and by the company, with their management expertise, and by the workers with a certain agreed trimming down in regard to employment but still retaining 300 skilled workers in employment, presented the broad basis on which very real consideration could be given to maintaining the company in <Col N="1315" /> the short-term and providing a bona fide investment by the State to enable the company to survive in the short-term and the undoubted medium- and long-term prospects to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is agreed on in regard to this matter is that the medium-and long-term company prospects in regard to timber and pulp processing are good not alone nationally but internationally. This section is designed to increase the funds available to Fóir Teoranta by the Minister.  If the Minister wishes by direct action to ensure that these increased funds being made available are utilised, this is the first practical example of a company requiring such funds and requiring further equity participation by the State in the utilisation of those funds.  It meets the points of view that have been put forward so often by Labour Party spokesmen.  In doing so one is investing in an industry with very real medium- and long-term prospects.</P>
    <P>One is also investing in an industry which is basic to our economy.  I want to emphasise again that it is the only such industry at the present time.  It is the only wood pulp, paper processing industry which eventually could develop further into more sophisticated areas of paper processing such as newsprint, which the company have plans to go into in the future.</P>
    <P>Clondalkin Paper Mills are the only nucleus of that type of industry existing in the country at the moment.  If one looks at the medium- and long-term and thinks in terms of an expansion in the economy in the years ahead and not a retraction, which appears to be the obsession of the Government, this is an industry which in the medium- and the long-term must be retained.  We would get over the immediate short-term difficulties because the long-term prospects are good.  The sort of money which would be involved in setting up such an industry in five or ten years' time, if this industry goes with its workers' skills, supervisory skills, trade skills and managerial skills, and if the existing plant and premises are allowed to go, would be enormous.  The costs involved would not be in the context of the £2,200,000 that I am talking about <Col N="1316" /> for the restructuring of this company at the moment but in the region of £100 million.</P>
    <P>An industry like this could be fundamental because of the absorbtion of Irish timber products in which it could engage in a few years time in a properly organised industry of this kind.  I appreciate that in Clondalkin Paper Mills there is only the nucleus and we want a fully integrated industry there, as was recommended by the study commissioned by the IDA and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands two years ago.  This very advice was given to the then Government. They said that the medium- and long-term prospects of that industry were excellent, that the Clondalkin Paper Mills only represented a nucleus and much more needed to be done in the way of the provision of sophisticated plant, further diversification and further investment. Now, to throw the whole lot out and to come back to a situation where there is no nucleus on which to expand, no skills on which to build, no management on which to build, is in my view very short-sighted business.  It is particularly short-sighted in view of the commitment to precisely this sort of State involvement and State investment in a risk-bearing way in a joint venture arrangement with a company such as the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  It would be very hard to think of a more appropriate industry for precisely this kind of joint venture risk investment by the State than the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The company have a pool of skills, in any new re-organisation they will be relying on native raw materials to some extent and they can fill a need in regard to the import of newsprint, which is not processed in this country.  The company had planned to go into this area if the economic climate had not deteriorated.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Industry and Energy is again meeting Fóir Teoranta today with regard to Clondalkin. I am concerned about getting this industry going again.  Undoubtedly there are short-term difficulties involved, but the medium- and long-term prospects are good.  On that basis and for the reasons I have mentioned the State should consider <Col N="1317" /> it a worthwhile risk investment.  I hope the discussions between the Minister and the board of the new company will be fruitful.  One of the most encouraging features has been the commitment by the workers to a 10 per cent involvement of the order of £200,000 in the proposed restructured industry.  Such a commitment deserves a response.  There has also been a commitment by the trade unions representing the workers to trim the labour force if necessary, but to have a basic force of at least 300 who would be able to operate efficiently.  I understand that agreement was reached on that.</P>
    <P>There has been agreement between the trade unions, the workers and management. All that is required here is a <i>bona fide</i> indemnification by the State in regard to Fóir Teoranta.  I understand that such bodies sometimes take a purely financial attitude with regard to possible commitment by them.  That is the kind of advice a good accountant gives to a company and the kind of advice that might have been given by Fóir Teoranta to the Government.  However, it is up to the Government to make the political decision and in this case it is my view that such a decision is all on the side of making an equity investment through Fóir Teoranta by way of Government indemnification for the necessary investment.</P>
    <P>The Government should take action on this matter.  There is not much point in passing section 3, which makes extra capital available to Fóir Teoranta, unless the Government act in a practical way.</P>
    <P>The Government should ensure that some of these extra funds are made available in the risk investment manner I have outlined and thus enable the State to participate with the company.  Even though the workers' share is only 10 per cent, the goodwill and the attitude of the workers more than matches the 45 per cent put up by the company and the 45 per cent by the State.  The workers have put a real investment into the company. They have all the necessary skills and they consider that they and their children can contribute in a new environment and in a restructured company when the prospects will be better than they are at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering Fóir Teoranta, the present state of development of the company, the moneys voted and the allowances under section 3 of this Bill, one has to review the history, the brief and the functions of the company.  We must consider what they were established to accomplish and the limitations within which they operate.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the board of the company is largely made up of businessmen who by virtue of amending statutes have been given the task of a rescue company.  They tend to look at the proposals and propositions put forward as businessmen.  They examine the situation as it is put to them and they assess the profit or loss history of the company concerned and I suppose when it comes to them it is always a loss situation rather than a profit situation.  They appear to devote themselves entirely to considering whether in their view as businessmen the failing industry in question can be bailed out, whether it can be kept afloat for a short-term period until it gets on its feet, becomes viable and eventually gets to a profit-making situation.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that a State agency should have the job of carrying out that rescue function but it appears to me they do not go far enough.  There is a limit to their range of activities, irrespective of the amount of money that is voted, such as in section 3 of this Bill.  There is a limit to the range of activities Fóir Teoranta are enabled to tackle and the considerations on which they tackle them are limited to business considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the disposition of these moneys being voted from State funds, Fóir Teoranta should take into account not only the question of the immediate business interest of a proposition coming before them and not merely the question of whether a company can be turned around from a profit situation, in the ordinary businessman's sense of that term, but whether it would make sense in the national interest that a firm in a special situation should be kept alive and made viable.  Such a situation relates to the analysis very ably made by Deputies Lenihan and Walsh and other speakers.</P>
      <P>The case of Clondalkin Paper Mills is very much a live issue because the skilled jobs of 470 people are placed on the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that Fóir Teoranta have not given adequate attention to the national importance of preserving this firm.  I am aware that discussions and negotiations are still in progress.  But Fóir Teoranta took the view, initially at least, that this plant could not be made viable in the short or medium term and that for the foreseeable future it would be a lossmaker. I would assume that this was the <Col N="1320" /> basis on which they reached the decision announced at the weekend.  Quite clearly they have not taken into account any of the matters rightly adverted to by Deputy Lenihan and the importance from a national point of view of preserving the last of our paper-producing capacities. There were six such units at one time involved in making paper &mdash; a vital product which will always be needed in very large quantities.  I hope that Fóir Teoranta will reconsider the position and take into account the national importance of maintaining and preserving these skills and this manufacturing facility.</P>
    <P>The financial considerations facing an individual company in the ordinary business sense are different from the overall financial considerations facing the State. Fóir Teoranta should remember that they are acting here not in the narrow context of an individual firm but as an agency of the State and they should take into consideration the overall interests of the State.  In reaching their decision I wonder whether they took into consideration that, if Clondalkin Paper Mills close down, the State &mdash; not Fóir Teoranta &mdash; will have to pay out very large sums of money in redundancy payments to the 470 skilled workers, will have to make continuing payments of social welfare pay-related benefit to those workers and their families and will make those payments to the men for sitting at home and doing nothing.  For the foreseeable future the State will also have an adverse balance of payments situation, because paper will have to be imported from France, Germany, Canada, North-America and other places.  This paper could be produced at home by the same employees to whom the State will be making substantial social welfare payments. I fear that Fóir Teoranta have been too intent on viewing the Clondalkin case in the narrow businessman's context without paying sufficient attention to the overall picture.  From the point of view of the State it makes good financial sense to ensure that this firm is kept intact and that the ancient skills of paper-making are preserved.  If the company go to the wall I fear that these skills will be lost forever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Of course, this cannot be a one-sided thing.  The firm themselves have major responsibilities to these workers, and one would hope that they would recognise their responsibilities to the national interest also.  I regret that speakers opposite have not referred to the responsibilities of the firm in this matter.  The Clondalkin Group is a major public company making substantial profits, but nothing has been said about their responsibilities.  It must be pointed out that the paper-making facility at Clondalkin was the origin, key and nucleus of the entire group and it was through the operation of this facility, which is now precariously poised, that the great successes of the Clondalkin Group were built up.  It is to their employees in the paper-making facility that the group owe their present success and it behoves the management to remember that fact.  Now that the paper-making end of their business has hit upon hard times, temporary hard times I hope, and the other sides of the business who had their origins in this paper-making group are doing well, it might not be unreasonable to expect that they would tide over and subsidise the paper end of the business during the current difficult times.  The Government agencies, Fóir Teoranta and the IDA, also had an input in this and it cannot be said that they have taken no steps in the matter, that they have been callous as to the fate of those jobs.  They have made an offer of a substantial amount of money, £1.5 million, to enable the firm to re-equip, to provide the new machinery and equipment that would be essential if Clondalkin is to be a viable organisation.</P>
    <P>As we have heard here many times previously, the key factor in the paper-making business is the cost of energy, and whoever would put money in there &mdash; Fóir Teoranta, the IDA or anybody else &mdash; would surely know that there would be no point in doing it and that they would be throwing that money away were it not to be used for installing in that firm the most modern machinery and equipment so that the most economic use would be made of energy in the production of paper at that mill.  I regret the decision of Fóir Teoranta in this matter. <Col N="1322" /> The proposals put forward seemed eminently good, taking all the factors into consideration.  The contribution and the participation of the workforce along with Fóir Teoranta and the Clondalkin Group are to be welcomed.  It would have meant, I presume, worker representation on the board of that new company with a representative of Fóir Teoranta &mdash; all a very desirable and progressive development. I regret deeply that Fóir Teoranta did not see fit to endorse that proposal at least sufficiently to carry on further detailed discussions that obviously would be necessary to get that project off the ground and operative.  I trust sincerely that there will be a rethink on this and that the current discussions will produce some turnabout on that score in that field.  I urge the Minister to use what leverage he has with the board of Fóir Teoranta, those businessmen who control the affairs of that body, to ensure that they have a rethink about it.  I do not know exactly what powers the Minister has with regard to Fóir Teoranta.  I confess that I have not got out the original Act which set them up, but the Minister of State mentioned here on the last occasion that he is not empowered under the legislation to issue a directive that would compel Fóir Teoranta to make any commitment of the funds that we are voting here for any particular purpose.  However, we all know the old saying that a nod is as good as a wink, and if the appropriate nudge was given to Fóir Teoranta one would suspect &mdash; I may be wrong in this, I do not know how these things work at that level &mdash; that it must carry some appreciable and considerable weight with Fóir Teoranta.</P>

In the national interest it makes financial and economic sense to the country as a whole that that facility would be preserved and kept on.  If that fails, then any other option open to the Minister should be taken up by him.  There is the possibility of assistance through the IDA or some other agency.  It is a most important matter.  I urge the Minister to use his influence with the IDA.  I understand that his influence there is rather stronger than it is with Fóir Teoranta.  I urge him to take that matter up with them and also I urge the board of that company at least to meet the Government agencies on this matter half way.  I do not say that they have not made concessions on the matter until now.  They have.  The proposal that they put previously seemed to be fair and reasonable.  Further discussions and negotiations can be carried forward with goodwill on three sides, the sides of the workers, the Government agencies and the company, wherein a sensible solution could be found and continuity provided for and preserved at Clondalkin, and I hope sincerely that that will be the outcome.</P>

      <P>The House is somewhat tied for time in considering the Bill at this stage but I want to put the picture exactly straight, exactly as it is and no other way.  The Minister for Energy met representatives of the trade unions this afternoon and there may be further developments from the company and other approaches may develop also in relation to matters as they stood this morning.  However, I am aware that this morning Fóir Teoranta did not and could not accept the approach of the company because in effect it meant that a massive effort would be made to pin the responsibility on the Government.  We got it crystal clear on this because undoubtedly, in the event of the company closing and redundancies coming into effect on 19 December, this is what would happen. This effort, which I reject utterly and totally, will be made by the managing <Col N="1324" /> director of the company no doubt and probably by a number of politicians also.</P>
      <P>The figures are threefold: an expectation on the part of the Clondalkin Group that the State would put in £6 million; that the group themselves would put forward £900,000 and that the workers in the company would put in £200,000. Deputy Lenihan referred to a new company being established, Clondalkin Group Limited, who would put in 45 per cent, Fóir Teoranta would put in 45 per cent and the employees of the new company would put in 10 per cent.  I will quantify that for the House.  The 45 per cent on the company's side would be £900,000 and their proposal would be that Fóir Teoranta would put in £900,000 and the employees £200,000.  What Deputy Lenihan did not advert to may be in the document he has in front of him which I recognise.  I am referring to the further proposal by the company that a further £3 million in preference shares would be provided by &ldquo;your goodselves&rdquo;. This is to Fóir Teoranta.  In other words, to sum up the package: the Clondalkin Group would put in £900,000, Fóir Teoranta £900,000, the employees presumably £200,000, that is to be arranged as yet: a further £3 million in preference shares to be provided by Fóir Teoranta and in addition &mdash; I quote here the proposals by Fóir Teoranta &mdash;&ldquo;we would expect substantial training grants would be available from AnCO&rdquo;.  These are not quantified but presumably they will represent some amount of money.  The IDA offer of 21 October would apply to the new company which, as we all recall from my previous contributions to the debate here, amounted to £1.5 million.  Therefore, let us add up the sum very calmly and quietly.  We have £900,000 from Clondalkin, from Fóir Teoranta an initial immediate £900,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt any Deputy.  I have no objection to the proposition put forward by Deputy Lenihan of 50-50 which he repeatedly used, but there is no equity and no prospect of this company being saved on the basis that the State must put in £6 million and the company will put in less than £1 million. That is not a proposition that has proved acceptable to Fóir Teoranta.  May I remind Deputy Lenihan that in 1972, when he was a member of the Government, they passed a Fóir Teoranta Bill through this House which laid down basic criteria for giving of State rescue package money to private companies to rescue those companies?  These criteria are quite clearly laid down.  Fóir Teoranta have considered the package from the company in the light of all the criteria and have rejected it.  I said on the last occasion, and I repeat it, that there must be a clear, unequivocal cash commitment on the part of the Clondalkin Group that they are going to put real money into maintaining the 470 jobs in the company so that there is some prospect of a contribution being made by the group and the company to maintain this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of commitment must be such that Fóir Teoranta are satisfied that there is a prospect of some viability.  Unfortunately and tragically, this level of commitment is not there.  I am aware of the circumstances surrounding this company. As a member of Dublin County Council, I had a letter on 8 September from the Clondalkin Paper Mills, as had Deputy <Col N="1326" /> Mervyn Taylor, about rezoning of land in the possession of this company in order to maintain employment.  Deputy Walsh and Deputy Harney also had letters and we were assured that this land was urgently needed.  We rezoned, there were a lot of questions about it, but the work has been done to maintain employment. I speak as a member of the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is not the responsibility of the State to rescue a company which fails to accumulate sufficient financial reserves to tide it over a major difficulty in world trading conditions.  Fourteen separate paper mills have closed down in the UK in the past 18 months and 9,000 workers in that industry have lost their jobs.  There have been massive redundancies in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of the Thatcher administration.  Surely the Minister is not following that line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of retaining this industry and of the State making a massive injection of financial aid to it.  Fóir Teoranta are a separate State-sponsored body in daily contact with Government Departments and with the IDA.  They have a statutory obligation to give the maximum possible assistance to all such companies facing financial difficulty, but there is a limit to what Fóir Teoranta can do to discharge their financial obligations.  It goes beyond the limit when a company say they want £6 million and that they will put in £900,000 before there is any prospect of continuing the company.  The figures are stark: £900,000 to be put in by the company, £900,000 to be put in by Fóir Teoranta, £200,000 by the employees, with the State taking up another £3 million in preference shares.  On top of that the IDA are to put in another £1½ million.  Frankly, the managing directors of some companies have a hell of a nerve to put forward propositions of that nature when their own group and their own company will not put in sufficient basic financial capital to keep a company going and to prevent massive redundancies.</P>

      <P>The odium for the closure of this company if it comes to pass &mdash; hopefully it will not because the company still has an opportunity of retrieving its position in this regard through negotiations &mdash; will not be accepted by the State; it rests with a company which has not put up a viable financial package to the State rescue agencies.  The money is there, including immediately the £1.5 million from the IDA.  It is up to the company to accept it.  If it does not keep the factory open and the workers in employment, it must accept the responsibility. I wonder if there is any real commitment on the part of the company to the workers and to the people in Clondalkin, which it must and can discharge if it is serious in not wanting to dismantle the company, sell it off to the nearest outside bidder and close it down.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State deliberately runs away from the basic factor that extra State involvement, over and above the immediate equity cash of £900,000 to match the £900,000 from the company, of further preference investment, which the State should rightly invest in this company anyway, covers a preference right to premises and property which, as the Minister of State knows, is worth far more than £3 million at present. One could put a value of double that which would fall to the State in the event of the preference shares being lost in the future.  If there is a rejection by the State of 400 workers, an unwillingness to put in through this agency the equivalent amount in immediate cash of the £900,000 the Clondalkin Group are willing to put in and the £200,000 which the workers in the paper mill were also willing to put in, it means that for less than £1 million of immediate injection over 400 jobs are lost &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to restore (a) the house mortgage <Col N="1329" /> subsidy to single people and (b) the eligibility of single people for local authority home loans.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want, first of all, to put this debate in the context of the decision which we made as a Government last April in the introduction of the Housing Package 1981.  At that time, as Minister for the Environment, with the agreement of the Government, I announced the introduction of a scheme of measures designed to assist prospective home owners in the first three years of the repayment of their mortgages.  The scheme involved the paying of a subsidy of £3,000, broken down into £1,500 in the first year, £1,000 in the second year and £500 in the third year. The payments were to be made six-monthly in arrears.</P>
    <P>This mortgage subsidy was available at that time to a wide range of applicants &mdash; the married, single, about to be married, tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority houses who wanted to move out from their local authority houses and purchase houses in one of the private estates, and also for potential tenants of local authority houses.  In that way we were anxious, as a Government, to assist couples who wished to house themselves but had no possibility of raising the necessary deposit, although being in a position to meet some of the repayments. We decided to include them in a mortgage subsidy, whether they bought new or second-hand houses.  The category that this resolution in my name and that of Deputy Moore particularly refers to is the single person.  Also, at that time the county council Small Dwellings Act loans were available to single people, that is the system of house purchase loans administered by the local authorities.  In the Housing Package of April we also increased the eligibility limit from £5,500 to £7,000 and the loan limit to £14,000.</P>
    <P>Through that decision in April, we have proved our commitment to the encouragement of home ownership and the encouragement of thrift.  We consciously extended the mortgage subsidy to single people because they represent 22 per cent of all first-time house buyers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> That is the percentage which is affected. The Coalition Government came into power and on 23 July, the Minister for the Environment came into the House to speak on Financial Resolutions, in effect the budget.  We had had the budget on the Tuesday, a series of increases announced on the Wednesday &mdash; ESB and others &mdash; and on Thursday, 23 July, the Minister for the Environment addressed the House.  Amongst other measures announced that day he mentioned:</P>
    <P>A very large proportion of the increase in the numbers of households in Ireland can be attributed to a change in the rate of formation of the household by the younger age groups rather than to changes in the size and structure of the population.  Information to be published by my Department later today shows that 22 per cent of new house borrowers from all agencies in 1980 were single persons not about to marry compared to 19 per cent in 1979, 19 per cent in 1978 and 20 per cent in 1977.  A high incidence of single persons not about to marry but who can afford to purchase secondhand houses is also apparent from this statistic.</P>
    <P>This development has serious implications for the Exchequer.  Clearly, some single persons could readily postpone the purchase of a house because they are adequately housed at present. In the normal course the housing needs of families must take priority.  The Government have reviewed the position and have decided that there should be no change in the position relating to the special loans and mortgage subsidies available to categories such as tenants and tenant-purchasers of local authority houses who surrender their premises to the authority and one-parent families.</P>
    <P>The following shows a pure, Victorian mentality of discrimination against single people:</P>
    <P>In future, however, in other cases, eligibility for the mortgage subsidy and ordinary local authority house purchase loans will be restricted to married <Col N="1331" /> persons and persons about to marry.  Single purchasers may obtain approval to the payment of a loan and mortgage subsidy but these payments will not be made until evidence of marriage is available.</P>
    <P>In the enlightened age in which we live, various Governments have been introducing legislation to remove discrimination from our statute books.  Here we have a classic example of discrimination against one section of the community &mdash; single persons.  That is not just my view, or the view of Fianna Fáil.  This decision made by the Minister for the Environment on 23 July resulted in the setting up of an organisation called Single Persons against Discrimination.  They wrote to me in October and enclosed, for my information, a copy of a letter sent to the Taoiseach.  I shall quote from that letter dated 13 October:</P>
    <P>Dear Dr. FitzGerald,</P>
    <P>Single Persons against Discrimination is officially launched this week. The group's formation was sparked off by your Government's decision to end the new £3,000 mortgage subsidy for single people and at the same time to exclude single people from local authority loans.  The immediate objectives of the group are in the field of housing:</P>
    <P>1.  Restoration of the housing subsidy for single people and....</P>
    <P>2.  Restoration of eligibility of single people for local authority housing loans....</P>
    <P>Discrimination against single people is endemic in Irish society.  Nonetheless it was surprising that the second class status of single people was formally acknowledged by the Government in the housing subsidies decision.</P>
    <P>That describes the decision of 23 July very well indeed.  We have heard from the Taoiseach much talk of the need for crusades to remove discrimination.  He said that discrimination was rife in this country.  Those are not his exact words but that was the implication.  Surely his bona fides have to be questioned when <Col N="1332" /> his own Government introduce such discriminatory regulations as these, the subject matter of the resolution before the House.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment, which will be moved soon, refers to &ldquo;those most in need &mdash; namely married people, those about to be married and special categories of borrowers&rdquo; such as tenant purchasers.  This amendment attempts to divide the society in which we live as to those who are married and those who are single.  We in Fianna Fáil are anxious to promote and preserve the family as a unit.  It is legitimate and necessary for any Government or party to work to promote and preserve the family but it should not be done by penalising single people.  Why should one section of the society be penalised not for the benefit for another section but merely for the convenience of the book-keeping of the Government, to which I will come back later?</P>
    <P>Through employment regulations relating to women in the workplace, regulations for family home protection and recognising the rights of both spouses, and various other reform measures, all parties in Government have attempted to remove discrimination from the Statute Book.  Yet here, in their first days in Government, the Minister for the Environment of this administration introduces this unheard of level of discrimination, the effect of which is to remove from 22 per cent of first-time house buyers the eligibility for this mortgage subsidy of £3,000.  Surely the Government should be doing all in their power to encourage home ownership by people, married or single.  They should be encouraging thrift and investment in homes.  There is a suggestion in the Minister's attitude that all single people who want to buy houses are in the 21, 22 and 23 age bracket.  Many single people who are more settled in years have been in touch with me on this issue.  They have decided, for their own reasons, that they do not intend to marry but are anxious to set up their own homes.  They have been very badly treated by this Government and they will not forget this discrimination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> I glanced at the Coalition programme on housing today to see if there was any suggestion that this Government would discriminate against single people when they got into power.  There was no such suggestion.  They said that they would assist house purchase through a variety of schemes, including a no deposit shared housing scheme for local authority tenants and those on housing lists, implementation of the £4,000 grant scheme for first-time buyers up to a house value of £40,000, pay-related mortgages of up to four times a person's income through a housing agent, top up loans to bridge the gap between the deposit and the amount saved for those getting loans from building societies, a purchase and lease back scheme for the elderly, an additional £1,000 for first-time Gaeltacht purchasers, measures to enable householders to ensure against redundancy and special aids for co-operatives and so on.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in that policy to indicate that within three weeks of forming a Government the Coalition intended to remove from single people the mortgage subsidy and their eligibility for SDA loans.  My colleagues on this side of the House will be speaking about this in greater detail so I will leave the main thrust of it to them.  I also looked through the programme to see if there was any indication of an intention to discriminate under the heading of justice and law reform.  But there was nothing there either.  I thought that there might be some question in the programme of discriminating in regard to income taxation.  The one thing that I found was mention of taxation and equity.  Where is the equity in discriminating against single people in the manner in which they have in this decision of July last?</P>
    <P>In their amendment the Government refer to the inadequate provision for the mortgage subsidy.  The reality is that the subsidy was introduced in April, it would have been May before it could have been put into operation and most of the loan applications would not have been closed until June or July.  Loan payments are made six months in arrears, so payments would be coming due only now.  Perhaps a few would have been due in November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> Therefore, to talk about inadequate provision is, to say the least of it, less than honest.  The provision for the main scheme would have to be made in 1982 and if we were in Government we would have made that provision and all of those originally included, married and single, would have been catered for.  Reference to inadequate funds for SDA purchases is something of a sick joke when it comes from a Government who between 1973 and 1977 never increased the SDA qualifying income limit.  In our time in office we increased it four or five times.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always taken the construction industry and the purchase of homes as being a very important item of Government policy.  This does not appear to be the view of the present Government and this was further confirmed in the infamous speech of 23 July when the Minister for the Environment removed the mortgage subsidy.  That Minister tonight has been speaking at the formal opening of the EBS premises in Westmoreland Street.  He referred there to the importance of housing in all its many aspects. He referred to the important role of the building societies and said he recognised that role and the efforts of the societies through loans.</P>
    <P>We in Government recognised the importance of a cash flow to the building societies.  We appreciated that they would have to increase their deposit rates to encourage the inflow of funds at a time when their competitors, the banks and other agencies, were increasing their interest rates.  We also realised that mortgage holders would have to be protected against savage repayments and for that reason we decided, when in Government, to subsidise interest rates.  But on 23 July, the Minister for the Environment removed that subsidy.  What has been the outcome?  When we left office on 30 June last, mortgage holders were paying 13.15 per cent as a result of our subsidy.  Now they are paying 16.25 per cent as a result of the decision of the Government to remove the subsidy.  That speech of 23 July totally reneged, after three weeks in office, on commitments in both the Fine Gael and the Gaiety Theatre documents.</P>
    <P>This morning a Bill was circulated to <Col N="1335" /> set up a housing finance agency.  The Bill is purely an enabling measure to set up the agency, and it waffles on without going into detail.  During the weekend a Fine Gael backbencher spoke at a meeting of the group called Single Persons Against Discrimination.  I assumed he was speaking with Government approval when he said that loans would be available for single people through this agency.  I should like to get confirmation of that from the Minister when he is speaking on his amendment.  Was everything the Deputy said correct?  If loans are to become available, and I hope they will be, it would be meeting one part of our motion in regard to SDA loans but it will not meet the other important part of our motion calling for the restoration of the housing mortgage subsidy to single people.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to hang my case on the unemployment situation and the effect it will have on the building industry or the effect the removal of the mortgage subsidy for single people must have had on the construction industry because of its effect on new house purchases.  It is no secret that the building trade are going through the worst time in their history.  It is a cliché, but it is true, that the health of the construction industry is a barometer of the health of the economy generally. Today's figures of the unemployment situation show that there are about 134,000 people out of work, many of them in the construction industry.  At such a time it is surely the responsibility of the Government to adopt the approach in this motion and not to try to hide behind their amendment which states that the Government were compelled to confine house purchase loans and the mortgage subsidy to those most in need. Why divide society?  We have enough division on this island without further dividing the married from the single.</P>
    <P>I appeal for the support of all Deputies on this issue.  Many Fine Gael Deputies have been speaking outside the House regarding discrimination, the role of single people, the protection of citizens' rights, about discrimination at all levels. I appeal to all of them to recognise by <Col N="1336" /> voting in support of this motion that the Fianna Fáil proposal is correct and appropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>In particular I appeal to the Independent Members of this House for their support for this motion.  A number of them have been vocal against discrimination of all types, and the need to remove discrimination from our society with which I heartily agree.  Tomorrow night when we have a vote on this motion, as it appears we will have because the Government have put down an amendment, I appeal to the Independent Members to walk through the lobby with Fianna Fáil and support this motion which attempts to remove discrimination from one area, the regulations of the Government.  Some of the Independent Members are noted, and even noted by themselves, for their stand against discrimination in all its forms.  Tomorrow night they will have an opportunity to show in a concrete fashion just how sincere they are in their claim to be opposed to discrimination.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on paragraph (a) of the motion which refers to the mortgage subsidy to single people.  My colleague Deputy Callanan and others will speak at greater length on the eligibility of single people for local authority home loans.  The Government's administrative decision to put together the two incomes of married couples is having a shattering effect on the construction industry and building jobs.  Every time we mention housing the Government throw around the figure of £15 million which was supposed to be the great saving in the local authority house construction sector for 1981, totally disregarding everything else done by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Government speakers have put great emphasis on this £15 million.  Rather than trotting out that old chestnut, when the Minister moves his amendment he should answer the legitimate charge of discrimination against the Government.  The Minister of State is guilty of being a junior member of a Government whose Cabinet have decided to introduce a further level of discrimination into our society.  The Government are led by a Taoiseach who parades himself and calls for crusades against discrimination in all forms.  We <Col N="1337" /> regret that the Government have introduced this new level of discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware of a letter addressed to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, Dáil Éireann, dated October 13, 1981.  I was sent a copy by the lady who signed the letter, Miss Bernadette Marsh, Chairman of Single Persons Against Discrimination. I will quote the last two paragraphs:</P>
    <P>S.P.A.D. awaits, with interest, to hear whether the recently announced pay-related mortgage scheme with an upper income limit of £9,000 will apply to single people.</P>
    <P>This is the enabling Bill about which I spoke earlier.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>The majority of single people in the country would be eligible on an income basis and the scheme would be of great assistance to them.  However, when Mr. Barry has done his sums, perhaps we will again be told that &ldquo;single people don't need housing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing what the Government plans to do for single people and would remind you that single people have votes.  At the next general election, a candidate representing the interests of single people may stand in a constituency such as your own, Dublin South-East, where there are large numbers of single people of all ages.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Government to reflect on that cautionary note as expressed by Miss Marsh on behalf of members of Single Persons Against Discrimination. The only word to describe the decision of 23 July announced by the Minister is discrimination.  I would ask the Minister to please accept our motion.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;takes note that because of the inadequate provision made for expenditure on housing by the Department of the Environment in 1981, the Government <Col N="1338" /> were compelled to confine, at this stage, house purchase loans and the mortgage subsidy to those most in need &mdash; namely married people, those about to be married and special categories of borrowers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the poverty of ideas on the benches opposite that at a time in which so many matters of national importance merit debate the Dáil should be required to spend hours discussing once again one limited area which was well covered barely three weeks ago in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department.  I find it difficult to understand the motivation behind their choice of a motion the discussion on which must highlight again the causes of the measures the movers wish to have reversed and the responsibility of their party for those measures.  Fair minded, sensible people &mdash; and these comprise the majority of the electorate &mdash; have accepted the realities of the present national crisis and have accepted also the honesty of the Government's analysis of the situation and the validity of their determination to tackle it, even taking measures which may hurt the less vulnerable sections of our community.</P>
    <P>There is no political bonus for any Government in introducing measures or restricting benefits such as the local authority house purchase loans and the mortgage subsidy, which are bound to be unpopular with sections of our people, but in a crisis situation unpopular measures are inevitable.  When we took office last July we discovered that an unprecedented financial crisis had developed and, after four years of irresponsible attitude by the previous Government and deliberate underestimation in their budget last January, urgent corrective steps were essential.</P>
    <P>It was in that context that decisions had to be made which would undoubtedly have undesirable repercussions on certain individuals while continuing to assist other persons whose needs were relatively more acute.</P>
    <P>I do not overstate the position.  As the Taoiseach spelled out for the Dáil some months ago, we found ourselves in a <Col N="1339" /> position last July in which, after 50 years of independence, the national debt amounted to £1,000 million.  But, over a mere ten years, by the end of 1980, this debt has grown to £8,000 million &mdash; in other words national borrowing had grown from a mere £20 million yearly to an annual average of £700 million.  This debt must be paid for out of our taxable resources and more than one-tenth of all the proceeds of taxation must go to foreign bankers because of the prodigality and lack of proper housekeeping by the previous Government.  Money which could otherwise have been used to promote industry, assist agriculture and provide a better living standard for all our people must now be used to service the debts they so irresponsibly created.</P>
    <P>This country needs development in many areas if our growing population is to have jobs and if unemployment is to be reduced to tolerable levels.  But, if this is to come about, if we are to bring about a situation in which the scope for national investment is to come into line with our partners in the European Community, then we have to eliminate debit trade balances; we have to reduce the inordinate level of foreign debt; we have to increase our trading competitiveness &mdash; possibly accepting lower living standards in the short term &mdash; and we must review drastically and selectively the level of financial support from public funds demanded so vociferously by many sectors of our people.  In the ultimate, the ordinary taxpayer must pick up the tab for all these financial supports and it is the job of the Government to decide on the relativities of the demands to the burdens which can fairly be placed on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>While the subject of the motion is limited I feel it necessary to set the background against which the demand for a liberalisation of certain housing loan and subsidy systems must be considered. Housing is a very emotive area, affecting families and individuals, but it is also an important part of the public capital investment programme and cannot be considered in isolation from the general capital situation which poses so many <Col N="1340" /> problems for the country &mdash; problems which must be determined by the Government in planning their overall investment programme.</P>
    <P>Having set the general background I want to deal specifically with the aspects raised by the motion and to support the amendment which has been tabled by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the movers of the motion have the nerve to try to justify it having regard to their involvement in the creation of the dire financial situation which I have briefly outlined and which forced the Government, reluctantly, to decide to restrict eligibility for the mortgage subsidy and local authority house purchase loans to married applicants and those about to marry.</P>
    <P>Deputies do not have to be informed that the major part of the finance which local authorities issue to applicants approved for house purchase loans comes from the Exchequer through the Local Loans Fund.  The necessary provision for the schemes has to be made in the Public Capital Programme each year.  The Public Capital Programme provision is approved by the Government after consideration of estimates of requirements prepared in the previous year by the Department of the amounts which are likely to be required.  These estimates are calculated by reference to existing maximum loan limits and income limits, existing overall commitments of local authorities and likely new commitments based upon the experience of local authorities with inflows of new applications and so on.  The Estimate for 1981 was prepared and considered in this way and the Department were in due course notified that the Government had approved £101 million for the service for 1981.  It is important to note that the Estimate was calculated on the basis of the income limits of eligible applicants not exceeding £5,500 a year and the maximum loan not exceeding £12,000.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, as we are aware, in May 1981, the previous Government announced their Housing Package 1981, in which it was decided to increase the local authority loan limit to £14,000 and the income limit to £7,000, to phase out <Col N="1341" /> the low rise mortgage scheme but, at the same time, while it was being phased out, to introduce a new special scheme for tenants and those on the waiting list, with a maximum loan of £18,000.  The inevitable consequence of this decision was an increase in the demand likely to arise in the current year for money over and above that which would arise on the basis of the lower limits.  The increase in the income limit from £5,000 to £7,000 made many more potential borrowers eligible while the increase in the loan limit was, of itself, of the order of 16 per cent; at the same time a new scheme with maximum loans of £18,000 for which no provision &mdash; and I emphasise no provision &mdash; had previously been made was also announced.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that the Government were aware that the effects of these proposals would require an additional £9 million in 1981 no additional provision was made.  The estimated increase required for 1982 was estimated at £26 million.  Local authorities were informed, by circular dated 8 May, of the new limits and the new schemes but no change in their original capital allocation was notified. Local authorities commenced processing applications on the new basis and incurring liabilities from that date.  The situation when the present Government took office was that already a number of local authorities were finding their monthly allocation totally inadequate and were building up backlogs of applicants seeking payment in respect of houses completed and where their contracts for purchase required immediate payment. Local authorities had on hands applications for loans totalling £153 million, compared with £138 million at the beginning of the year and a provision in the Public Capital Programme of £101 million. Yet no additional provision had been made for the new schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government were faced with yet another situation in which commitments had been entered into without provision for the day of reckoning.  In this case the commitments were growing and individual borrowers were likely to be seriously hurt financially where they obtained approval for loans and were liable to find <Col N="1342" /> that, when their loans matured for payment, the money would not be available to pay them.  The consequence would be an indefinite delay during which they would have to manage on expensive bridging finance.  In that situation the Government felt obliged to ensure that the available resources would be issued on the basis of reasonable priorities and in this case decided that those in the greatest need would be applicants who were already married or about to marry. Single applicants for whom loans had already been approved were, of course, funded as their commitments matured but it was obvious that some rather drastic measures would have to be taken to limit the demand for loans under the scheme in the remaining months of 1981. It was in this context that the Government were constrained to confine the loans for the time being to the most deserving categories of applicants.  The relative degree of hardship in the case of a married couple or family needing a house is generally more acute than that of a single person.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully aware that many single applicants have been aggrieved by the decision and accept that some have good and valid reasons to purchase their own homes, but the demand continues to be so great from applicants already married or about to marry that, regretfully, there is no possibility for the present of being able to provide the funds that would be required to enable the extension of the schemes to single applicants.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the present restriction of house purchase loans to applicants who are married or about to marry is not absolute.  Local authorities may, without regard to the marital status of an applicant, make loans of up to 98 per cent of the approved net market value of a private house up to a maximum loan of £18,000, to tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority dwellings who surrender their premises to the authority, and married couples with at least one child, and one-parent families, who have been for at least one year on approved waiting lists for rehousing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> The corresponding maximum loan in respect of a house located on certain islands is £19,000.  In the case of a person allocated a new local authority house a mortgage up to the full cost of providing the house for the applicant, exclusive of any grants, may continue to be made available in respect of the purchase of that house.</P>
    <P>Before moving from the subject of house purchase loans I must mention the impending establishment of the Houseing Finance Agency, the Bill in relation to which has now been circulated.  I do not wish to anticipate the debate on that measure, but I can say that it is the Government's intention that the agency will be empowered to advance loans to approved applicants irrespective of whether they are married or single, or without any intention of getting married in the near future.</P>
    <P>I may say too that the special categories of persons I have referred to above who qualify for 98 per cent to 100 per cent loans from local authorities are eligible also for the special mortgage subsidy.  In so far as that subsidy is concerned, the position which we found when we took office was bad.  The scheme had been introduced without any provision being made to fund it in 1981 and it was clear that this cost would escalate dramatically next year and even more so in later years. The Government could not foresee being able to finance the scheme without recourse to further foreign borrowing. They were of opinion that dependence upon this source of finance was already too great and had no alternative but to reduce the scope of the scheme by restricting eligibility to applicants who were married or about to marry and whose needs for this assistance from public funds were regarded as greater than those of single persons.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I am recommending to the Dáil criticises the inadequate provision made by the previous Government for expenditure on housing by the Department in 1981, a situation which had a direct bearing on the restriction, which the present administration felt unavoidable, of house purchase loans <Col N="1344" /> and mortgage subsidy to persons &mdash; not in the special categories I mentioned &mdash; who are married or about to marry.  I have referred to their increases in loan and income limits under the SDA scheme which generated an expanding demand for the loans.  I have mentioned their introduction of a mortgage subsidy last May.  In both cases no action was taken by the outgoing Government to have the necessary additional funds authorised to finance the schemes.  But the extent of their financial irresponsibility in relation to housing was very much wider and in other regards completely inexcusable.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite may argue that it is not without precedent to introduce a new scheme or expand an existing one during the course of the financial year and come before this House subsequently with a Supplementary Estimate.  In the case of a voted service, such as the mortgage subsidy, no payment can validly be made until that Estimate has been passed.  No such excuse can be put forward, however, in relation to the completely inadequate provision made in the Public Capital Programme in respect of local authority housing in 1981 or the deliberate reduction in the amount required to meet housing loan charges incurred by local authorities during the year.  The capital allocated to local authorities was so inadequate that within days of their taking office the present Government had to make a further £30 million available to meet commitments already due or likely to occur in the immediate future and to allow a limited programme of new housing starts to be undertaken.  But for that additional provision up to 3,000 men working on housing schemes would have had to be disemployed before the end of 1981.</P>
    <P>Their attitude in relation to housing subsidy was no less reprehensible.  It is possible to compute the probable liability of the Department in respect of subsidies very accurately before the Estimates for any year are finalised.  The present Government had to authorise a further £16.5 million in local authority housing subsidy to meet the shortfall in the 1981 provision for the purpose.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy for the Government <Col N="1345" /> to have taken the action they have taken in relation to house purchase loans and the mortgage subsidy, but in view of the dramatic nature of the financial crisis which faced us last July we felt that we must act in the best interests of the entire community and that where cuts had to be imposed they were applied to the less vulnerable sectors of the public.  Given time it is our firm resolve to get rid of the legacy of debt heaped upon more debt left to us by the previous Government whose only concern was to remain on the Government benches, whatever irresponsible spending that might involve. They did not achieve that aim even by their financial chicanery.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record that, as Minister of State responsible for housing, I appreciate the importance of the housing programme.  Deputy Raphael Burke made the case that there was discrimination against single people by this Government. As a member of a local authority, I also want to put on record that before this Government came into office single people were also discriminated against and the list of applicants for SDA loans at local authority level was getting longer as the days went by.</P>
    <P>There would be nothing to prevent the Minister tomorrow morning from including single persons as applicants for SDA loans.  If he did that people in dire need, married people with children living in very bad houses, would be put on the housing list which would get longer and longer.  I am glad Deputy Lyons, a member of Cork County Council, is present because he is aware that prior to this Government coming into office a single person who made an application for an SDA loan to Cork County Council was refused a loan and those people who were granted the loans had to wait for a very long time.</P>
    <P>I was listening to Deputy Raphael Burke's speech.  He shed crocodile tears about the exclusion of single applicants. It would be wonderful if our resources permitted the inclusion of these people and we could tell them they qualified for SDA loans.  This would encourage the building of more houses.  The building industry is a very important factor in the <Col N="1346" /> creation of much needed jobs.  This Deputy Raphael Burke, who shed such tears for those people and who decried this Government's attitude to the housing programme, is the same man who when Minister discontinued the reconstruction grants.  It was very necessary to provide people living in poor houses with an incentive to improve them, yet in February 1980, Deputy Burke, then Minister, discontinued those reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and the Government are determined to get the housing programme on its feet and to restore confidence.  Since this Government came into office in July last, £30 million were provided for local authority housing &mdash; that is no mean feat &mdash; and £15 million for housing subsidies to local authorities.  There was approximately, directly and indirectly, almost £50 million provided for the building industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Raphael Burke posed some questions, and I do not want to prejudge what will eventually emanate from the debate on the Housing Finance Agency Bill.  It is the intention of the Government, once the scheme is in operation, to include single people.  While it is true to say that single people are excluded from the SDA loan scheme at present, any person, or couple, contemplating marriage if they make a joint application will qualify for an SDA loan.  That is as far as the Minister can go at this stage having regard to our financial situation.  I can give the House an assurance that the clause referred to will not be in operation one day longer than is necessary because the Government realise the importance of the building industry and the contribution that industry can make to the creation of new jobs.  While I have no objection to a debate on this motion, I must point out that the House spent a considerable amount of time debating a Supplementary Estimate for more than £30 million. Of that figure £25 million, which was foreseeable in the January budget, was not provided.  That is one of the reasons why the Government have had to exclude single applicants.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that the <Col N="1347" /> housing record of the last Coalition Government is something they can be proud of and I can assure the House that the record of the Government at the end of Coalition of 1973-1977.  Members who are also on local authorities will accept that local authorities are always under great pressure to provide council houses and sites for people who are anxious to build their own homes.  We should encourage as many people as possible to build their own homes.  We must provide the incentive for them to do so through grants and loans.  It is also essential that in conjunction with that we should provide as attractive a grant scheme as possible for reconstruction work so that people can make their homes habitable and comfortable.  Such a scheme is essential for those who may need to repair their homes and are not in a position to buy a new house.  It must be remembered that Deputy Burke, who moaned so loudly about single people being discriminated against, removed reconstruction grants.  I am glad that the Government brought back reconstruction grants, even though it was in a restricted form.  It is also worth mentioning that many of the chimneyless houses built by Fianna Fáil will qualify for a grant to erect chimneys and install solid fuel appliances.  Many local authorities are availing of that grant to install chimneys and fire places in houses built under Fianna Fáil.  Such grants are necessary because the tenants of those houses are not a in a position to pay the huge cost of heating those houses by oil.  I am glad the Government decided to introduce those grants.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well.  I support the motion and in doing so I should like to comment on some of the statements by the Minister of State tonight in connection with the Estimates in the middle of the year and the changes which had to be made in them.  I should like to remind the Minister that since the Government came to office they did a good thing as far as <Col N="1348" /> some young people are concerned by increasing the income limit for higher education grants.  However, there was no money in the Estimate for this and the Government told local authorities to pay for the scheme.  Local authorities had to pay immediately and will have to pay again in January, but they will not get a refund from the Department until next year.  If local authorities were supposed to be as broke as the Minister said &mdash; this is what he is building his case on &mdash; and if the kitty was as empty as the Minister said, I wonder why the Government asked local authorities to fund that grant scheme.  Was it not irresponsible of the Government to ask local authorities to pay for something they introduced in the middle of the year knowing that money was not provided in the Estimate for it? The Minister also mentioned reconstruction grants.  I welcome the decision to introduce limited reconstruction grants, but that is not in accordance with the promise made by Fine Gael in the election compaign.  In my area Fine Gael campaigned strongly on the basis of introducing a £1,000 reconstruction grant.  It may be that some houses were built without chimneys, but in my area I could drive for almost 30 miles without finding one house without a chimney.  Reconstruction grants do not apply to houses that have a chimney or an existing bathroom. They do not apply to applicants who have water installed in their homes and do not require an extra room.  Consequently, if one has a house with the roof falling down and the windows in need of replacement but does not require a bathroom or an extra bathroom, one does not qualify.  I am not criticising the grants that are available but I am anxious to put it on record that the scheme is not in accordance with the promise made during the election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It surprises me that two Galway Deputies who are members of Galway County Council are not present for this debate because when the Department's circular was discussed at a meeting of the council the strongest opponents of the terms of it were members of the Minister's party. The debate at the council meeting went on for almost three hours and the Minister's <Col N="1349" /> colleagues pointed out that the terms of the circular were ridiculous and that the decision was unworkable.  I am aware that tomorrow night they will have to do as they are told, like I will have to do, but it is strange that they agreed that a resolution be sent to the Minister asking him to change the terms of the circular.</P>
    <P>In my view it is unworkable and amounts to discrimination against single people and an interference with marriage. It is compulsory marriage.  I hope the Minister for the Environment, when he is replying, will make an attempt to clarify the uncertainties in the circular. What is meant, for instance, by temporary employment?  To get an SDA loan the two incomes must be lumped together and if a couple are in receipt of any kind of an income they will be earning more than £7,000 per annum.  Up to this I used advise young people who intended getting married to get their loan before they got married and have the House well started because only his income would count.  A young man who is, as they say in the country, courting a girl may approach his father for a site on the basis of his intention to get married.  He will have to inform his father that he is doing a line with Mary Black down the road but his father may say that he will not allow Mary Black's name on the title of the site.  It must be remembered that the two names must appear on the title.  I was given that information in reply to a parliamentary question by the Minister. That is the most ridiculous thing about this.  How could one expect a young man's father to permit a girl's name to go on the title if they are not married?  The Minister, in reply to my question said the two incomes must be included and the two names had to be entered on the title.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to an area where there is further discrimination. Anyone under 21 will not be considered for a loan.  Representations were made to me recently in a couple of cases in which the boys concerned were about 23 years of age but were marrying girls who were under 20.  The girls' names could not be included because of their age. Surely that is discrimination.  If people can vote at 18 I see no reason for their <Col N="1350" /> not being considered for loans for houses. Though I am one of the oldest Deputies here, I am concerned that young people be given their rights.  If the Minister insists on the names of both the boy and the girl being included he should at least reduce the age to 18.  In addition there is the discrimination against single persons generally, some of whom may be middle-aged and wishing to provide themselves with homes.  Deputy Burke dealt with the discrimination involved in the £3,000 mortgage grant.  If we take, say, Johnny Callanan and Mary Black who, though not even married wish to get a loan for a house, they must go first to the bank for a bridging loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering what the bank manager would say to us.  Would he seriously consider giving us a bridging loan?  If we fall out after a month or so, what would happen in regard to the house?  What would be the position regarding the title?  Who would have to pay the bank?  Perhaps I would get the house but the whole thing is completely unworkable.  Those people on Galway County Council who talked most about how ridiculous the situation is were the Fine Gael members.  There were no politics involved and we decided to ask the Minister to reconsider the matter in the light of the discrimination against single people.  By acting in this way the Minister is compelling people to marry because if it transpired that relations between a couple deteriorated they would consider themselves compelled to go through what I would regard as a cod of a marriage in order to get the house.  In such circumstances it would be far better that they would discontinue the relationship than go through the sacrament of matrimony <Col N="1351" /> in the interest of the ownership of a house.  In these circumstances the Minister should give serious consideration to what he is doing.  There is no point in the Minister saying that there is not enough money to rectify the situation concerning mortgages.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for a local authority loan a couple jointly must be earning less than £7,000.  The Minister must know that if they are earning at all they are being paid more than that.  If the Minister were sincere in what he is doing he would raise this figure to £10,000.  We hear a lot about what Fianna Fáil did or did not do but during the term of office of the last Coalition the situation in regard to local authority loans was ridiculous.  First, the loans were much too small to be of any use and, secondly, the income limit was less than £4,000.  We increased that to £5,000 and, subsequently, to £7,000 while increasing the loan limit to £14,000.  Even that was not enough to build a house.  It would have been adequate only if the young people concerned had some money of their own.</P>
      <P>What I fear is that there is a phasing out of the authority of county councils.  I have not read the new Bill very carefully yet, but so far as I know the arrangement for the repayment of loans is to be based on a percentage of one's earnings at any given time.  I am sure that if one were to calculate the repayments on a loan under the scheme, he would find that a couple would pay back in a 20 to 30 year period many thousands of pounds more than what they should have to pay.  This is nothing more than a con job.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give serious consideration to the motion tabled by us this evening.  We are not saying anything more in this motion than Fine Gael have been saying.  I cannot understand how they can go to their local councils and condemn the scheme while supporting the Minister here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a very friendly fellow.  On the last occasion on which this matter was raised at a county council meeting there was complete confusion as to who might qualify for a loan.  Some members of the council said that those in temporary employment would not be considered but we might well ask for a definition of temporary employment since it is difficult today to know what is temporary or what is permanent in terms of employment.  One might have a good job in a firm but that firm could collapse tomorrow.  So far as I can see the only employment that can be considered permanent is employment within the public service.</P>
      <P>It has been said that some counties were not adhering to the terms of the circular of 23 July.  We in Galway have a habit of keeping the rules and, consequently, we have been turning down applications for loans in accordance with the decision of 23 July.  We are insisting on the two-income provision and we are excluding people who are employed, say, as clerk typists during the summer months only but we are not refusing people who are in employment that can be classed in any way as permanent and whose joint incomes are in accordance with the directive.  People under 21 are not considered either.  I was very keen to have this whole matter debated here.  I have tried on various occasions to have the situation clarified but on each of those occasions other Deputies came in on my supplementaries.  When I tried to raise the issue on the adjournment I was told that the matter concerned involved the expenditure of moneys.  Therefore, this motion was the only means of having the situation debated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to spell out who can and who cannot be considered for loans.  According to our interpretation the names of both parties must be on the title, while if either partner is under 21 or if the joint income of both exceeds £7,000 they are not eligible for consideration. <Col N="1353" /> If they are earning over £7,000 they are out.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position.  We had a lot of those cases in County Galway and eventually they had to be turned down.  If there are other counties interpreting the decision of 23 July in a different way from County Galway we are entitled to know so that we can give loans.  I was told in the House who could get loans and who could not and I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Young people cannot get loans from building societies if they have not got a few thousand pounds invested in those societies.  The only hope they have is for the Minister to bring in the new arrangement. Young people will have to pay back a percentage of their salaries in interest.  This would be a lovely arrangement if people's incomes went down but nobody believes that will happen.  As the income of young people goes up their payment goes up every year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said we were asking for something new in our motion. We are only asking the Government to continue the situation as it prevailed before the Coalition took office.  I will not accept all the talk about being short of money.  The Government increased the income for getting a higher education grant but they made no provision for that payment to be made this year.  The county councils have got to pay this money.  The Coalition talk about the previous Minister changing the income and the size of the loan in the middle of the year.  They have been saying that this was very wrong.  It is just as wrong in the middle of the year to put up the income for getting a higher education grant, send this down to the local authorities and tell them to pay it although they will have to wait 12 months to get the money from the Government.  The Minister should give serious consideration to our motion. I will watch very carefully tomorrow night to see who will walk through the lobbies in support of the Government. This is not a political matter at local level. Nobody has stood up to defend the Minister.</P>

The Government will increase the number of people looking for local authority houses.  The last time we had a Coalition Government I appealed to a <Col N="1355" /> decent man, Deputy Tully, who was then Minister for Local Government, to raise the income for getting those loans to give people a chance to build their own houses in order to take them off the local authority housing lists.  The Minister of State has no right to talk about houses without chimneys.  I can travel for 25 miles around my area and I will not find a house without a chimney.</P>

The Government have been telling the people they will give them £1,000 reconstruction grants.  They are only giving those grants for a definite purpose.

They always say to themselves: &ldquo;We are the Government&rdquo;.  The present Administration are a Government in name only.  We are paying too many economists to govern the country.

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. L. Allen Mr. L. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday, 26 November 1981 I tabled a question to the Minister for Transport regarding Rosslare Strand erosion but unfortunately he was not present.  My question asked when the Minister would instruct CIE either to carry out the necessary works or provide the necessary finance to Wexford County Council for essential protection works to alleviate coast erosion works at Rosslare Strand.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry answered on behalf of the Minister for Transport and I quote an extract from his reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> Despite protracted discussions with the parties concerned the question of responsibility for the cost of transporting the beach material to Rosslare Strand has not yet been resolved.  I am arranging that an early meeting will be held by my Department with all the interests concerned with a view to resolving this problem and, pending a decision on the question of responsibility for the costs involved, that CIE will continue to provide and transport the necessary beach material to Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council have had major involvement with Rosslare Strand for a number of years.  It is true that the building of a second berthage at Rosslare Harbour has been responsible for a further deterioration of coast protection work on the strand.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that when the National Coalition were in power the then Minister could have gone ahead with the building of a second berthage at Rosslare but, as is happening with the present administration, the then Government funked their responsibility.  It was not until Fianna Fáil came to power after the National Coalition that the then Minister with responsibility for this matter, Deputy Faulkner, authorised that the work be done.  It was a welcome development for the entire south east.  The main reason for sanctioning this work was that Rosslare was the one port in Ireland where development work was increasing each year.  There is no doubt that the work that was carried out proved a major success, certainly in regard to tourism.</P>
    <P>I understand that in granting the licence to CIE and in giving them the necessary finance it was understood that CIE would provide the necessary materials for coastal protection at Rosslare Strand. This has not happened.  Three years have passed but Rosslare Strand is eroding rapidly.  I have with me a copy of the Wallingford Report that was commissioned to examine the feasibility of a second berthage at Rosslare Harbour. The report was an investigation into the effects of harbour improvements on <Col N="1358" /> beach movement and coastline changes. The following comments were made in the report:</P>
    <P>The dumping of dredged material from Rosslare Harbour that took place on three occasions between 1964 and 1971 proved an effective form of beach replenishment building up the sand between the groynes, reducing the steepness of the beach slope and pushing the high water mark seaward...</P>
    <P>The OPW have expressed the opinion that when their defences become increasingly more exposed to the waves as the sand is washed out of the groyne-compartments the woodwork will start to break up, and the position will get steadily worse so that the southern half of the Strand could soon lose material at an increasing rate unless some early beach replenishment can be carried out.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the report there is the following comment:</P>
    <P>It would seem desirable to repeat this as soon as circumstances allow, in order to counter the normal beach &ldquo;shortfall&rdquo; of material.</P>
    <P>The report also commented:</P>
    <P>However, without such additional nourishment as was supplied in 1964-71 the material can only be removed from the existing beaches so that the present situation will deteriorate rapidly and the OPW sea defences will become progressively less effective so that the rate of erosion could build up again to the pre-1960 figure; releasing even more sand to enter Wexford Harbour and threatening the defence works at the Point itself.  Any further destruction at Warren Lower townland could only add to the risk of floods at Wexford during periods of peak tidal levels.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of money has been spent by Wexford ratepayers on coastal protection works that were started in the early 1960s.  These works are completely useless because the Minister has failed to tell CIE to provide the necessary materials, not only for the protection of Rosslare Strand but also Wexford <Col N="1359" /> town which is in danger of being flooded.</P>
    <P>The Wallingford Report states:</P>
    <P>In order to stabilise the situation on the beaches of Rosslare Bay some 27,000 m³/year of sand should be supplied; ideally to the whole length of the cliffs and the strand.  However as the strand is the more important area economically and socially the preferred dumping zone would probably be off the Coastguard Station and if the sand could be placed on the beach directly this would be the most effective operation. If this was to be too expensive then consideration could be given to the use of split-bottom barges to try to place the sand as close as possible to the groyne-compartments.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>It is recommended that beach nourishment of the Strand should continue and steps could also be taken to protect the South Bay cliffs west of Kilrane Halt.</P>
    <P>This matter has been going on for three years and Wexford County Council have been pressing the Department for some time.  It is important to highlight the situation of the ratepayers in Wexford.  In 1963 the coast protection works were completed by the Office of Public Works and it fell to Wexford County Council to pay the bill.  The maintenance cost in 1963 was £5,000 but the figures for the last five years are as follows: 1976 &mdash; £30,000; 1977 &mdash; £25,000; 1978 &mdash; £30,000; 1979 &mdash; £28,000; 1980 &mdash; £51,000; 1981 &mdash; £67,000.  In that five-year period the ratepayers of Wexford have spent £231,000 on coast protection works.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council and the Office of Public Works are not able to cater for the present situation.  A report by the county council engineer states that erosion at Rosslare Strand is proceeding at an alarming rate due to lack of nourishment and beach levels have been reduced by two to three feet in places. The cost of maintaining the present coast protection works is entirely a local charge <Col N="1360" /> and in the past few years there has been an increase of 123 per cent at a time when rate increases were limited to 32 per cent. The council are unable to meet the extra cost of beach nourishment because of rate restrictions and cannot provide the necessary material.</P>
    <P>The joint policy document on the environment published by Fine Gael and Labour states that the national environment will be protected by a comprehensive plan which will ensure that economic development does not injure the environment. I would point out to the Minister that the environment in Rosslare Strand is being very severely affected.</P>
    <P>On 27 November the Minister said that CIE would provide the necessary material and transport at Rosslare Strand. Wexford County Council had a meeting yesterday with representatives of CIE and CIE's chief civil engineer categorically denied that he knew anything about the reply the Minister gave regarding transport.  Who is to pay for the transport from Rosslare Harbour to Rosslare Strand?  The ratepayers cannot afford any more.  Further erosion at Rosslare Strand will mean that the golf club will be divided in two and there is a danger of serious flooding in Wexford town.  I want the Minister to guarantee that CIE will provide the necessary material amounting to 27,000 cubic metres of sand per annum.  I ask the Minister to stand over the guarantee given in the reply on 27 November.  CIE did not stand over it at the meeting yesterday.  Wexford County Council have provided the infrastructure, the roads and services and CIE are not providing one penny.  They are refusing to provide the necessary material to protect Rosslare Strand and Wexford town.</P>
    <P>I want a guarantee from the Minister that not alone will CIE provide the material but they will provide it on Rosslare Strand where it is required so urgently and will continue to provide it not alone this year but for the foreseeable future. Because of the development of Rosslare Harbour it seems that we will have a continuation of the erosion of Rosslare Strand, therefore I want those guarantees tonight from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of Deputy Allen's statement was to put the blame on CIE for the present position on Rosslare Strand.  In particular he alleges that the serious erosion which is taking place &mdash; this is common case between us &mdash; is due to the building of the second berthage at Rosslare Harbour.  Strictly speaking one could say that, but to understand the position we have to recall what the situation was before the second berth was built.</P>
      <P>Prior to the building of the second berth CIE, in order to maintain the then harbour in a navigable condition, had to dredge on a regular basis and the dredged sand was deposited outside the harbour at a point where natural tide action washed it on to Rosslare Strand, thereby effecting continuous nourishment of this strand and so preventing erosion from taking place.  As a result of the second berth being built the necessity for regular and continuous dredging was removed and, consequently, there was no ready supply of material to be washed naturally on to the strand.  Therefore, the strand was subject to the eroding action of the tide and, obviously, that has a serious effect on the strand, unless the strand is replenished artificially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was at pains to make what appeared to be a political point when he said that the decision to build the second berth was not taken by the last National Coalition Government and that it fell to a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party to have the necessary strength to make that decision.  I am not aware of the reasons for it not being taken by the previous National Coalition Government but, unfortunately, when the decision was taken by Deputy Faulkner it was, like so many decisions of that administration, imperfect because it failed to provide specifically and exactly any responsibility for the ecological consequences of the engineering works that were to be carried out.  It failed to provide specifically that any party would have a liability for the cost of provision and placing in position of the relevant material to protect the beach.  That is why we are in trouble now. While we are at the business of making political points I remind the Deputy, <Col N="1362" /> since he raised the issue, that that regime which he supported and in which he served as a Minister of State failed during 1978, 1979, 1980 and the first half of 1981 to cure the problem which was the result of their own faulty decisions.  It comes badly from the Deputy now to try to blame me in the short time that I have had the responsibility in this office for the unfortunate position that applies at Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the seriousness of it and it is common case between us that this is a serious matter and because it is serious I will resolve this problem in a way that will obviate the danger to this strand.  A confused legal situation exists as to liability to supply dredged material or make it available and supply nourishment to Rosslare Strand.  This confusion stems from a faulty decision taken in 1978 in connection with the giving of permission for the construction of this second berth at Rosslare Harbour.  It is not clear whether the nourishment required by the strand constitutes maintenance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that the situation as to where liability lies is confused.  Is it maintenance under the Coast Protection Act?  Is it something more than that?  Obviously, a definitive discussion must take place between the three parties involved to try to determine where the liability lies.  Is the legal position faulty and is any party or combination of parties going to accept the burden of the cost, the three parties being Wexford County Council, the OPW and CIE? I propose to arrange for urgent discussions between my Department and the three parties involved with a view to coming <Col N="1363" /> to a definitive decision on this problem. Pending that and because of the urgency of the situation, I have asked CIE, an autonomous State-sponsored body, in the language available to a Minister responsible for an autonomous State-sponsored body to provide dredged material for Rosslare Strand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On to Rosslare Strand but &mdash;I want to make it clear to Deputy Allen &mdash; that request is without prejudice as to the question of liability for paying CIE for that work.  That question will have to be decided at this meeting that I hope to arrange between the three parties I have already mentioned.  Let me emphasise that the very fact that I have asked CIE is without prejudice to the question of who is to pay for the job.  An immense amount of material is now required urgently and the logistics of loading, moving and dumping it are quite formidable.</P>
      <P>I am surprised to hear Deputy Allen's report of the meeting yesterday between Wexford County Council and a representative of CIE.  It may well be that because of the present beet campaign there is an unusually heavy demand on CIE lorries and there may be a shortage of lorries at the moment.  This is just a speculation on my part and I intend to tease out this matter because I am disappointed that the work of loading and spreading that material has not got under way before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> I am conscious of the problem.  I share the Deputy's concern as to the dimensions of it and the necessity to provide a solution.  To provide a long-term and lasting solution I am convening a meeting of the parties to whom I have referred and in the short-term I am making what arrangements I can with CIE to provide material for the strand so as to prevent any further erosion pending a definitive solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. L. Allen Mr. L. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just two straight questions.  First of all I want to clarify for the Minister that I said that CIE refused yesterday to have anything to do with the last sentence of his first reply, which was that CIE would continue to provide and transport necessary beach material to Rosslare Strand.  They have not done so and yesterday they refused to do so, but they will provide it in Rosslare Harbour if Wexford County Council will provide the transport.  The second point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Army Pensions Acts provide that where compensation is received after the award of any such pension, the award may be reviewed and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, the pension may be either terminated or reduced.  As the annual value of the compensation in this case, assessed on an <Col N="1221" /> actuarial basis, exceeded the appropriate rate of pension under the Army Pensions Acts, payment of pension has been withheld.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 May 1981 and subsequently maternity benefit in respect of a confinement expected on 5 September 1981.  On the basis of the information available at the time of her claim the maternity allowance period in her case was calculated from 29 June to 3 October 1981 and payment was made accordingly.  This period has since been revised to 27 July to 31 October 1981. The effect of this revision is that payment of disability benefit has been allowed for the period 23 May to 25 July 1981 and maternity allowance has been allowed from 27 July to 31 October 1981, after which date she resumed work.  A cheque for the full amount of the balance of benefit due has been issued to her.</P>

The rate of pension payable was however, inadvertently reduced from 11 December 1981 instead of from 11 February 1982, when one of his children attains age 18 years.  An additional pension book payable for the balance of the period has now been issued to the designated post office for collection by the claimant.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 2 March 1981.  Before payment could be authorised it was necessary to make inquiries regarding the nature and origin of the incapacity.  On completion of these inquiries his claim to injury benefit was allowed from 2 March 1981, date of accident. Payment of all injury benefit due from that date to 4 April 1981, when he was certified fit to resume work, has been issued.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 21 July 1981.  Payment was made to 11 August 1981 under the original RSI number submitted with his claim.  It subsequently transpired that this number did not refer to him and inquiries were necessary to establish the correct number before further payment could be allowed.  On completion of the inquiries all disability benefit <Col N="1236" /> due to 7 December 1981, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance refunded to the Southern Health Board, has been paid.  His entitlement to pay-related benefit is being investigated and payment, if any, due will be made on completion of the inquiries.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who is in receipt of contributory old age pension at the maximum appropriate rate attained age 80 years on 20 September 1981.  As from that date he qualified for the supplement payable to pensioners over 80 years of age.  A supplementary book containing orders up to 2 October 1981 was issued to him at that time but on the renewal of pension books in October the current pension book which was issued to him contained orders incorporating the increase.  He is therefore receiving the full rate of pension to which he is entitled.</P>

      <P>I have received no complaints about dumping of plumbing fittings.  Most of Ireland's imports of plumbing fittings are from member states of the EEC.  Under the terms of our membership of the EEC imports from these countries cannot be treated as dumping since the Community is regarded as a single market.  If there is evidence that suppliers are competing unfairly by abusing a dominant position in the market it would be open to the Irish company concerned to bring the matter to the notice of the EEC Commission which regulates competition in trade between member states of the Community.  Similarly, if there is evidence <Col N="1250" /> of dumping from countries outside the EEC it would be open to the Irish company to complain to the EEC Commission which has responsibility for dealing with this matter also.  In either case officials of my Department will be available to advise on the preparation of a case for submission to the EEC Commission.</P>
