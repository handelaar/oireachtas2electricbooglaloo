    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5a:</P>
    <P>In page 4, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;voluntary patient' means a person who, acting by himself or, in the case of a person less than sixteen years of age, by his parent or guardian, submits himself voluntarily for treatment for illness of a mental or kindred nature,&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan Monaghan):</i> This amendment proposes to amend the definition sections of the Bill. This is a very important and necessary amendment because the Bill as it stands does not define a voluntary patient, although the Bill is structured on the treatment of patients as voluntary patients rather than as committed or detained patients. I made the case fairly fully that we should have a definition of &ldquo;voluntary patient&rdquo; in the Bill. The Minister has refused to accept the amendment without giving a good reason. We last discussed this Bill on 3 March, almost a month ago. Perhaps in the intervening time the Minister has taken time away from his other problems to consider this matter and I suggest that he now accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick on the question of defining the status of a voluntary patient, this Bill does not and was not intended to provide legal definitions of what constitutes the status of a voluntary patient. It is obvious that any patient in a psychiatric centre who is not detained in accordance with the provisions of this Bill is by definition a voluntary patient. A patient is either a voluntary patient or a detained patient; there is no question of an uncertain intermediate status. The provision in this Bill essentially relates to those problematical legal situations that may arise when persons have to be detained against their will for care and treatment. The Bill seeks to resolve these matters in the light of the enlightened views now prevailing with regard to the civil rights of persons detained in psychiatric institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To define a voluntary patient in section 3 is to afford legal identity to a patient with whose admission to hospital this Bill is not concerned. I am determined that the person who voluntarily avails of the services form now on will be regarded in the same light as a voluntary patient in the general hospital setting. The preservation of this concept of the voluntary psychiatric patient is all the more essential given the increasing encouragement <Col N="648" /> of people to undergo treatment in a non-institutional setting.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will realise, psychiatric treatment is associated increasingly with normal general hospitals. We do not want to define people in any way, other than those who come under the requirements of this Bill, as requiring detention. All patients will be similar to other patients in general hospitals and they will be voluntary in the same way as any other patient is voluntary in a general hospital. That is the position as I see it and I consider it would be undesirable to make a change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is provision in the Bill for making a detention order in respect of a patient who has entered the hospital as a voluntary patient should that necessity arise. A patient who has entered a hospital for treatment as a voluntary patient would, in those circumstances, become a detained patient. Does the Minister not agree that in that case it would be necessary to define a voluntary patient and to spell out the difference between a voluntary patient and a detained patient? There is also the situation where a person's state of health deteriorates or where a patient insists on discharging himself or herself before the consultants think it wise to do so and where it is decided to make a detention order. Surely it is desirable that these two categories of patient be separated in records, in definition and in language. That is all I am asking.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will use this argument against me. There are two categories of patients involved. There is the person who goes for treatment voluntarily and there is the more seriously afflicted person who may have to be brought to the hospital under compulsory arrangements, who is detained there and who cannot leave. There is a difference between the two categories. Why not spell it out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite adamant on this point. I see no difference between a patient attending for psychiatric care and a patient attending for any other care. Does the Deputy realise that 183,000 <Col N="649" /> people are involved? He wants me to file all of them separately and to make them different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a file on everyone in the ordinary way for hospital treatment. I am not prepared to do what the Deputy has suggested and that is the end of it. It is fundamental to the Bill and to the development of our psychiatric services and that is why I feel so strongly on this point.</P>
      <P>The question of detaining a person who has entered the hospital voluntarily applies to everyone whether he or she is inside or outside the hospital. Any patient who develops a problem that requires detention can be detained in any circumstances, whether he or she is there as a voluntary patient or not. I do not see any relationship there. In the light of modern psychiatric care it is important that people who are now receiving care, as they should always have been receiving it, as normal health care, should not be stigmatised or branded in any way. I am not prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not propose to press the matter further. The Minister is not prepared to listen to arguments. He says he regards this section as fundamental to the Bill. It is a fact that as the Bill stood when it came before the House a patient could go into one of these institutions and, regardless of his condition or of his capacity to look after himself, he was at liberty to walk out at one minute's notice. However, public and medical opinion forced the Minister to yield on that. There is not much use in having a debate in this House if the Minister tells us that his mind is <Col N="650" /> closed on the matter and he is not prepared to yield an inch. I merely point out another matter on which he has had to yield because of expert opinion. In that instance he brought in an amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5b:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 28, after &ldquo;being&rdquo; to add &ldquo;save in the case of a person who has previously received treatment at a psychiatric centre who shall be regarded, where it is deemed appropriate, as being ordinarily resident there&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 4 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act, a person of no fixed residence shall be regarded as being ordinarily resident at the place where he is for the time being.</P>
      <P>This may have a bearing on the psychiatric institution a person would be admitted to if he needed psychiatric care. The section provides that where a person had recently been a patient in a psychiatric institution but who left that institution of his own accord &mdash; perhaps before he should have left it or before he was medically ready to leave it &mdash; and wandered into an adjoining health board area, he would then be brought to another psychiatric institution.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is desirable. The purpose of our amendment is to add to the section, as drafted, the following: &ldquo;...save in the case of a person who has previously received treatment at a psychiatric centre who shall be regarded, where it is deemed appropriate, as being ordinarily resident there.&rdquo; I think that is a helpful amendment and one that would mean that a person would then be treated in the institution where he or she was last treated. It improves the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with a person of no fixed residence. It deems that person, <Col N="651" /> for the purposes of the Bill, to be ordinarily resident at the place where they are for the time being. I do not accept the amendment and do not think it would effect an improvement in the Bill. It would be far too complicated to administer. Further it has implications &mdash; presumably not intended by the Deputy &mdash; of requiring that a person of no fixed abode should disclose where he or she had last been treated. Such people are often secretive by disposition and through force of circumstances and may not readily disclose such information. Apart from that, there is no time limit envisaged. If such a person was treated in a psychiatric hospital 20 years ago there would be little point in applying this requirement to him.</P>
      <P>The real danger in this amendment is that one would be making the itinerant or traveller a citizen of the last psychiatric centre he or she had attended. Certainly, I would not like to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> With respect, I suggest that the Minister is going from one extreme to the other. It may well be that our amendment, as drafted, could be tightened up. I am not a parliamentary draftsman, neither is the Minister. First of all, regarding the Minister's argument that we would be making a person disclose, if you would not mind, that he or she has been in a psychiatric institution, surely there will be some records in the institution that the patient had been there. Surely he or she will not go in as a number and disappear as a number without there being any record of any description. As the Bill is drafted if, say, a person is a patient in St. Davnet's Hospital in Monaghan &mdash; suppose he happens to come from the Carrickmacross area of County Monaghan &mdash; and wanders out of the hospital, as he would be entitled to do, going back to his own locality, crosses into County Louth and it is then found that he requires further psychiatric treatment, he will then be brought off to the hospital in Ardee instead of being brought back to the hospital where he had been probably a week earlier. I do not think that is in the best <Col N="652" /> interests of the patient. I do not think it is commonsense.</P>
      <P>If the Minister thinks about it again he can tighten up our amendment if he thinks it goes back too far. If he wants to include the word &ldquo;recently&rdquo;, or indeed &ldquo;in the last 12 months&rdquo;, let him to so. But here the Minister took an extreme example and I have taken another one, that is, that the patient who has been in Monaghan, perhaps for quite a long time, is found, within a week of leaving, to be in need of further psychiatric treatment. But he happens to be in County Louth and is then brought off to another institution.</P>
      <P>Then the Minister had the other bright suggestion that I was making such a person a citizen of the psychiatric hospital. I am doing no such thing. We are talking about this Bill only; we are not talking about citizenship, residential qualifications or anything else. We are talking about his place of residence for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about persons of no fixed abode. We are talking also about the rights of persons of no fixed abode. I think the rights of such persons are similar to those of other people. Of course considerable administrative difficulty can arise. I appreciate that. For instance, especially if such persons are to be referred to the last psychiatric centre at which they received treatment, they may well change their name at that stage in order to avoid that association. I do not see any difficulty in treating people where they take ill. We do that for the population generally. Where people take ill they are treated within that catchment area. If it is necessary that they be moved to a regional hospital or in order to receive other specialist services, then such arrangements are made in their interest. The provision whereby a person of no fixed residence will be regarded for administrative purposes as being resident at the place where he or she is for the time being is the most suitable one all round.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Obviously, I am not going to get <Col N="653" /> anywhere with the Minister on this amendment and, it would appear, on any other. That is regrettable. The argument I am advancing here is in favour of the patient, in ease of the patient. The patient about whom I am speaking may have spent quite a time in one hospital and may have left it before he was ready to leave. Probably he has got to know the staff in that hospital, the hospital surroundings. In my opinion treatment there probably would be much better than bringing him off to another institution. The Minister is merely complicating the issue although he thinks he is simplifying it. This is a small country. If a person of no fixed address is found wandering and in need of special care, the designated officers of the health service will know perfectly well that the individual in question was in some institution a sort time ago. I venture to suggest that if that person needs further treatment it is in his or her interest to be treated in that hospital. Of course, that might mean that somebody would have to think. Under the section, as drafted, one does not have to think as long as one has a map. All that is needed is a map where one will see that the person is found at such a place within a catchment area of a certain institution and one puts him in there. One need not think anything about him. Treat him as a person with no fixed abode; treat him as an itinerant. One does not have to think at all. One just consults the map, picks him up and puts him down like a tree; that is where he was found and this is where he goes. He is picked up off the map and put down there, without any thought that he may have been being treated by a GP, as well as by the staff of the institution which he has left. The Minister is not in good humour this morning. He should have another thought about this. According to any standard his attitude to this simple amendment does not make sense.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would certainly not be in good humour if I were to register itinerants as citizens of their last psychiatric centre. The problems which he raises are not real. Under section 29, <Col N="654" /> a patient may, in his own interests, be transferred to another psychiatric centre. As the Deputy says, this is a small country and if someone had been receiving treatment and was under particular care, there would be no problem, under this Bill, in providing for such transfer. I am happy that that provision is at present in the Bill and see no problem in effecting such a transfer, if necessary or desirable in the interests of the patient. What would happen to this person under the Bill as it stands would happen to anybody else, other than a person of no fixed abode.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am glad the Minister is changing his argument and that he does appreciate the substance and force of what I am saying. With respect, the Minister is now admitting that there are certain circumstances where it might be in the patient's interests to be treated where he was before &mdash; it almost invariably would be. We are not complicating matters. We know where he was being treated but bring him to a new place and when he is there for some time he will be uprooted and brought to another place. The sensible thing would be, in the first instance, to bring the patient to the hospital where he was previously treated and may have been getting on reasonably well. If he was discharged from there, he must have been getting on reasonably well, unless he left of his own accord. Would the Minister have a look at this matter between now and Report Stage, although it does not appear as if he will?</P>

      <P>A point which must be borne in mind is that while the person concerned may have been well when he left the psychiatric centre any length of time before, the fact that he requires attention must mean that he is particularly unwell at that stage and needs to be detained. We are talking here about detained. He would need to be detained in a psychiatric centre which is reasonably nearby. Subsequently, the normal course of care and treatment provided under section 29 can then come into play. In that way, both aspects are covered.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 5 provides that the Minister may make regulations in relation to any matter or thing referred to as prescribed or to be prescribed or as being the subject of regulations. Some of these are quite serious.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides that regulations shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and if they are revoked by resolution within 21 sitting days, the regulations shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know perfectly well that this section appears in many Acts. Another type of annulling procedure or validating procedure in respect of regulations is that they do not become law until they have been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The converse applies here. These regulations become law when made by the Minister and are valid unless annulled. If annulled, they are annulled without prejudice to anything done under the regulations between the date on <Col N="656" /> which they were made and the date on which they were annulled. In this Bill the Minister should provide that the regulations will not become law until resolutions by the Dáil and Seanad have been passed approving of them.</P>

      <P>The provision here&mdash;as, indeed, applies in most Bills of this sort&mdash;that the regulations may be annulled within the next 21 sitting days of the House, gives more than ample cover in relation to any regulations that may be made by any Minister in the future. The Members would be exceptionally remiss if they did not pay attention to any such regulations which were laid before the House. There is every opportunity under this arrangement which, as I say, applies in most Bills of this sort. There is a further opportunity of challenging a regulation and having it fully debated and annulled if necessary. Certainly, one can run into very long delays otherwise, because one then depends on the time and business of the House and is subject to all stances adopted by both sides of the House in relation to the distribution of time within the House. That procedure would not be desirable in a case like this. There is more than adequate safeguard in 21 sitting days.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister makes the point that my suggestion would mean that it might take a long time to have the regulations approved by resolution of the House. That is not so. The Government have control of the time of the House and could order business in such a way that a Motion to approve the regulations would come before the House virtually as they think fit. The Minister is quite right in that it could take a long time to annual the regulations, because of two things. First, 21 sitting days is quite a long time&mdash;as the Minister knows when he is waiting for an increase in salary and must wait until it lies before the Dáil for 21 sitting days. Second, in so far as an order annulling the regulations is concerned, time for that must be found in Private Members' time. Since this Dáil was elected, there have been cases where the Government <Col N="657" /> refused to provide Government time, which is very wrong. The Government will not provide time and that means the matter of annulling these regulations must be taken in Private Members' time. That is most reprehensible. The Minister's argument that this would take up time unnecessarily does not really hold water because the Government orders business. The Taoiseach announces the order at the beginning of each day and there is nothing to prevent the Government ordering this particular business as and when required. It is, of course, the Opposition who would want to annual but it is not good enough that, because it is the Opposition, the work must be done in Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>Furthermore they would be annulled without prejudice. Going through the Bill one finds quite serious things being done by regulation. I am against that in principle and I suggest the Minister introduces an amendment on Report Stage to cope with this situation.</P>

It also repeals the Mental Treatment Act, 1953, which contains six sections and two Mental Treatment Acts of 1961 one of which contains 16 sections and a Schedule and the other two sections. It is obvious we are making major alterations in our mental health treatment services by replacing a huge volume of legislation by a Bill containing 49 sections and a Schedule. I would not expect the Minister to detail the contents of the four measures being repealed but perhaps he would give us a synopsis of the <Col N="658" /> differences between the 1945 Act, which he is repealing, and this measure.

That is the reason why there is need now to replace existing legislation so that regard can be had to modern developments.

      <P>My Second Stage speech went into all that in fair detail and, if the Deputy wishes, I will read that speech for him. On the other hand, he could read it for himself. That might save him some difficulty. I said:</P>
      <P>The impact of the various Health Acts upon the administration of the psychiatric services has been significant in the process of integrating psychiatric and general medicine, as indeed, was acknowledged in the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness in 1966.</P>
      <P>The provisions made in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, in regard to the reception and treatment of patients remain basically the same as when they were introduced. I should, however, make it clear that the provisions of this Act were enlightened for their time&mdash;in particular the provision made for the reception of persons for treatment on medical certification, without the intervention of a judicial authority, was a most advanced change which has subsequently become the accepted procedure in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the 35 years since the introduction of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, there have been many changes in the theory and practice of psychiatric medicine. Such changes have come about in part by new therapies which have been made possible by the various chemo-therapeutical discoveries made and also by a deeper understanding of the aetiology of psychiatric illness and the needs of the mentally ill. The emphasis in treatment has shifted significantly, one might almost say dramatically, from segregation and long term detention towards a modern concept of treatment and speedy rehabilitation in informal settings which are as free and <Col N="660" /> unrestricted as individual circumstances permit. Many patients are now being treated successfully while living at home. Community services such as out-patient clinics, day hospitals, hostels, family care and domiciliary consultation have been provided and developed. In addition, the psychiatric services have the capacity to provide intensive in-patient treatment, in many cases in short-term acute units in, or in association with general hospitals.</P>
    <P>I can only refer the Deputy to various passages of the Second Stage speech.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (4), line 22, after &ldquo;12 (5)&rdquo;, to insert, &ldquo;18&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> This is the section which deals with offences and penalties for offences. The amendment is to subsection (4) which deals with summary offences as distinct from subsection (1) which deals with indictable offences. Subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>A person who does anything which is declared by section 10 (1), 12(1), 17 (1) or 44 (2) to be unlawful shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (3) is as follows:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the person maintaining a registered psychiatric centre to ensure that any directions issued or conditions prescribed by the Minister are complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (5) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the person maintaining a psychiatric home to allow it to be inspected by a designated officer of the health board and to afford that officer such facilities and information as are required by him for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 36 (3) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the person maintaining a centre or home to afford to the person making the inspection such facilities and information as he requires for the purposes of his inspection.</P>
    <P>As the subsections stand, those are summary offences which expose the person who is guilty of a breach of the subsection to conviction in the District Court and a fine of £500. Deputy Boland's amendment proposes that in addition a person who fails to comply with sections 18 and 45 should also be guilty of an offence. Section 18 is a short section which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Where, after refusal of an application, a further application for a recommendation for reception is made in relation to the same person within a period of 3 months after the date of the previous application, the applicant, so far as he is aware of the facts relating to the previous application and its <Col N="663" /> refusal, shall state these facts to the registered medical practitioner to whom the application is made.</P>
    <P>The applicant may not be the patient &mdash; it could be one of a variety of other people who are mentioned. Section 45 imposes a duty to report certain matters to the Minister and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Immediately upon the occurrence in a district, special or registered psychiatric centre of any of the following matters the medical officer in charge of the centre shall give a report thereon to the Minister and to the chief executive officer of the health board for the area where the centre is situated&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) an injury, other than a minor injury, to a person undergoing care and treatment in the centre or the death of any such person otherwise than from natural causes,</P>
    <P>(b) an alleged assault upon any such person,</P>
    <P>(c) any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see any difference between sections 45, 10 (3) and 12 (5). Section 12 (5) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the person maintaining a psychiatric home to allow it to be inspected by a designated officer of the health board and to afford that officer such facilities and information as are required by him for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As I said, the object of Deputy Boland's amendment is to include the directions in sections 18 and 45 and to declare that failure to comply with them shall be an offence carrying the same penalties as are laid down in section 8 (4).</P>

      <P>The effect of the Deputy's proposed amendment is to equate an applicant for a recommendation for reception, who in most instances would be a member of the public, with a professional person of standing in the services and on whom a penalty would be imposed for neglect of duty. We do not want to put a member of the public who makes an application in the same position as a professional person in relation to the penalties. <Col N="664" /> I would be reluctant to do so, given the difficult emotional circumstances and practical circumstances which can surround such an application in the first instance. The application is often made by a person who has the interest of the patient in mind and is only involved in the short term and has no further involvement beyond making the application. If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment it would have the effect of making it a duty on the public as well as on professional people involved to comply with the conditions and this would automatically make them liable to a penalty if they do not do so. I want to avoid this and that is why I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is necessary to correct an oversight in drafting. As the Bill stands, it would not be an offence to fail to report certain matters to the Minister and the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. These matters are specified in section 45 of the Bill. They are obviously ones in which it is necessary to make it an offence if there is failure to report matters like alleged assaults on patients.</P>

Is it usual to create criminal offences like this in regard to civil servants, members of health boards or semi-State bodies for failing to do their duty? I can see it applying to the Official Secrets Act and a breach of that Act should be properly dealt with. I should like to know if there is a precedent for this?

      <P>Essentially this was in the <Col N="666" /> old Act in any event. The section replaces section 272 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Immediately upon the occurrence in a mental institution of any of the following matters, a report thereon shall be given to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an injury to a patient in the institution (including an injury existing on reception),</P>
      <P>(b) an assault or alleged assault upon a patient in the institution by a member of the staff,</P>
      <P>(c) an outbreak of infectious or epidemic disease in the institution, whether affecting patients only, staff only, or both,</P>
      <P>(d) an outbreak of fire in the institution,</P>
      <P>(e) any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of the patients.</P>
      <P>The new provisions say that a report of the matter must be sent to the chief executive officer of the health board in addition to the Minister for Health. Existing injuries on reception and minor injuries to the person while undergoing treatment are not required to be reported. Deaths, other than from natural causes, must be notified. Existing legislation requires that assaults or alleged assaults on a patient by a member of the staff be notified. The new provisions are more generalised in that respect. The requirement that the outbreaks of infectious or epidemic disease be reported has been dropped as this is covered by the law on infectious diseases.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Lest I am accused of blowing hot and cold, my amendment simply proposed to apply section 8 to everything that was in the Act and was appropriate to be applied to it or not have it there at all. I have the greatest reservations about creating criminal offences of this sort. I can simply and clearly understand section 8 (1) because it simply creates the offences of running unregistered psychiatric <Col N="667" /> institutions. I call them that for want of a better word. That is quite right and should be done. These places should be controlled and the Minister is perfectly right to do so. He says that anybody who runs a psychiatric centre without the approval of the Minister or anybody who runs a registered psychiatric home without a licence from the Minister or anybody who runs a place of detention for psychiatric patients in contravention of section 17 shall be guilty of an indictable offence, which is a very serious offence. It involves trial by judge and jury and is liable to a fine of £10,000. I agree with that but I have the greatest reservations about including the type of matter which is in section 8 (4) and relates, for instance, to section 10 (3), which says it shall be the duty of the person maintaining a registered psychiatric centre to ensure that any directions issued or conditions prescribed by the Minister are complied with.</P>
      <P>The Minister will prescribe dozens of regulations and the persons who will be responsible for carrying them out will be employees of the health boards in many, if not all, cases. Is it reasonable to make the failure to comply with those regulations a criminal offence, punishable by a fine of £500? Surely the way to deal with that is through the internal administration of the institution, to hold a departmental inquiry or, if the matter is very serious, another inquiry. Unless there is criminal negligence, there should not be a criminal prosecution. I do not have the regulations here, but if I had I am convinced I could show an absurdity where an employee of the health board could be brought before the court, prosecuted for failure to carry out a regulation and fined £500 &mdash; section 10 (3). Section 12 (5) says:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the person maintaining a psychiatric home to allow it to be inspected by a designated inspector of the health board ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be something in favour of that because it applies to the person in charge of the psychiatric home. If he obstructs the inspection, that is a different thing. <Col N="668" /> Section 10 (3) seems to be quite different and section 36 (3) also deals with inspections. Section 45 imposes a duty as follows:</P>
    <P>Immediately upon the occurrence in a district, special or registered psychiatric centre of any of the following matters the medical officer in charge of the centre shall give a report thereon to the Minister and to the chief executive officer of the health board for the area where the centre is situated&mdash;</P>
    <P>I agree that if there is an alleged assault upon any patient in the institution it should be reported to the chief executive officer of the health board and to the Minister. I am not questioning that for a second, but what is an &ldquo;alleged assault&rdquo;? If the medical officer in charge of the institution does not report the alleged assault or any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of the patient &mdash; and that is a discretionary matter, too&mdash;to the chief executive officer and to the Minister, he will be guilty of a criminal offence, may be brought before the criminal court and subjected to a fine of £500. In this day and age that is not reasonable. That should be dealt with by internal administration. This is very near to saying that if a surgeon does not carry out his professional duties properly he will be brought before the District Court, prosecuted and fined. That is going too far.</P>
    <P>The Minister has inspectors who may investigate these matters, but to bring this into the realm of criminal law is wrong unless an inquiry discloses a criminal offence. Take the Whiddy disaster or the Stardust disaster. Inquiries are being held and if, in the course of those inquiries, acts involving a breach of the criminal law are disclosed then criminal prosecutions will be brought. Here all that has to happen is that somebody is assaulted and, if a report is not made to the chief executive officer and to the Minister for Health, that is a criminal offence. The doctor in charge will be prosecuted and brought before the court, the same as he would for drunken driving, larceny or any other criminal offence.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has appreciated <Col N="669" /> up to now the importance of this point. As he pointed out, section 272 gives a litany of things which must be done and presumably other sections of this vast Act, about which I was unsuccessfully trying to get information, make omission an offence. The Minister took considerable pride in scrapping this Act, saying it was out of date and should be got rid of. I respectfully suggest he get rid of that particular section where through an oversight, a person could be subject to criminal law. Perhaps such a person could be removed from office or demoted, but he certainly should not be subject to criminal law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For making false statements. In general this kind of provision is not unusual in legislation. Especially in the area of psychiatric illness and the control and management of a psychiatric centre where there has to be special power in the hands of those who control the centre, it is absolutely essential that <Col N="670" /> the Minister be well informed and he can then decide what line should be taken. The Minister must know what is happening and the public would be ill at ease if he were not so informed. Normally there is no problem in this case. It is taken as a normal regulation which must be complied with and, to our knowledge, it is complied with. We are informed on any occasions, which are rare, when it is not complied with. It is essential that the Minister is informed and, consequently, I am proposing this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister relies on certain provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act and that is deliberate. The Minister also relies on provisions of the Health Acts in relation to the making of false statements for the purpose of getting benefit under those Acts and I can understand that. However, the Minister is invoking the criminal law to enforce conditions of employment. Over the years we have had inquiries held into the discharge of duties by various people. There are two types of inquiry, a public inquiry which is an elaborate affair and is not necessary in most cases and a departmental inquiry which is held pretty often into the failure of public servants or health board employees to carry out their duties. I do not think it is reasonable to include the amendment suggested by the Minister. Indeed, it is not reasonable to transfer section 272 into this Bill. Has section 272 ever been invoked? It is antiquated. It should not be included because it is calculated to be mischievous and to make employees and professional people unhappy. Section 45 states that the medical officer in charge shall make such reports and if he does not he shall be brought before the courts. If found guilty that person will be convicted and fined. The proper way to deal with a serious matter is to hold an inquiry and the person in question, if found to be at fault, should be removed from office but that person should certainly not be subjected to the criminal law as is proposed in section 8.</P>

I have a duty to protect the people in our psychiatric institutions. On other occasions the Deputy, and his colleagues, would be pressing me to protect the rights of such defenceless people. This protection existed and I am proposing a minor drafting amendment. My amendment seeks to ensure that the protection continues. It is a necessary provision to protect the rights of individuals who cannot protect themselves.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Every person who goes to hospital, certainly to a surgical hospital, is, to a certain extent, a helpless individual. Every person who is put under an anaesthetic is as helpless as if he or she did not know what is going on. Is the Minister arguing that the criminal law should be extended to cover activities in all hospital theatres? I do not believe it should. It is not in keeping with the dignity of the patient or the professional people who look after patients. I do not suggest that those who do not discharge their duties properly or do not carry out regulations should be permitted to continue to hold positions of responsibility or importance. They should be removed from office. Only when they are guilty of a breach of the criminal law should they be brought before the courts. A person who misjudges the seriousness of an alleged assault or an injury or is guilty of a vague offence under section 45 (c) should not be charged. That subsection states:</P>
      <P>any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons.</P>
      <P>That is a gloriously vague statement. It is not reasonable to include that in the criminal code. I do not wish to be misrepresented in this regard because I have absolute regard for the rights of patients in all hospitals. I have regard for the responsibilities of professional people towards their patients but I do not believe that the way to enforce those duties and responsibilities is to invoke the criminal law, making criminals out of such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> The Minister may say that it is not the intention to do that or that it has not been done. I accept that it has not been invoked but it is possible that the Department did not realise such a provision existed.</P>
    <P>It is right that such reports should be made and that inspections be carried out. It is right that there should be proper visiting committees. If, in the course of their visits, they gain information regarding an assault on a patient or regarding a patient being injured or any matter of serious importance to the welfare of the patient they should bring that to the attention of the Minister and the CEO of the health board concerned. If a person is found guilty of a dereliction of duty that person should be sacked. However, it is another matter to create criminal offences as proposed under the section. It is not in the interest of anybody to do that. We should not include this precious bit of nonsense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland's amendment No. 6b proposes to add a new subsection. I have just <Col N="675" /> read section 10 (1) and the amendment proposes to add a new subsection, to be known as subsection (2), which reads:</P>

    <P>Deputy Boland thinks, and I agree with him, and indeed it would appear from discussions we have had to date, that it is necessary that the area to be served by the centre should be specified and Deputy Boland's subsection (2) does that.

The amendment allows for flexibility in approving the areas to be served by particular private psychiatric hospitals in that they can be approved for the treatment of persons from particular areas or from the entire country as the circumstances require.

      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person other than a health board to carry on in the functional area of the health board a home (in this Part referred to as a psychiatric home) for the care and treatment of persons suffering from mental disorder not being a psychiatric centre or to describe or hold out any such place as such a home unless it is approved and registered by the health board in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under this section.</P>
      <P>I accept that. The health board may refuse to register or may cancel a registration. I also agree with that. It is also provided that the health board shall give reasons for the refusal to register. In this case the person is given the right of appeal not to the court but to the Minister, as far as I can see. Subsection (6) provides:</P>
      <P>The person maintaining or proposing to maintain a psychiatric home may appeal to the Minister from&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the removal of the home from the register, or</P>
      <P>(b) in a case to which subsection (2) applies, a refusal to register the home,</P>
      <P>and the Minister may, if he so thinks proper, direct the health board to restore the home to the register or register the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know why we draw a distinction between the provision in section 11 which gives the aggrieved person the right of appeal to the High Court, and the provision in section 12 where the aggrieved person is given the right of appeal to the Minister. I would suggest that, if a person wishes to take an appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Minister, he should have that right. The appeal might go straight from the health board to the Minister. I would be quite satisfied with section 12 as it stands <Col N="678" /> with the addition that the aggrieved person has the right of appeal to the court.</P>

      <P>The differences is that, in the case of a psychiatric centre, the first appeal is directly to the Minister and to have recourse beyond that brings you to the court. In this case the first appeal is to the health board and the appeal beyond that is to the Minister. This applies generally in relation to homes and works fairly satisfactorily. Normally the Minister will give every consideration to the homes and to their complying with the existing regulations. The individual has the right to appeal directly to the Minister. First, there will be an appeal to the health board and then beyond that to the Minister. I think that is adequate.</P>

The Minister would be advised to a large extent by the health board. The health board would already have make up their minds about the case. They would be seeking to sustain the decision already taken. A much more satisfactory method of disposing of it would be to have the appeal to the High Court as in the case of section 11.</P>

The Minister expressed himself as being familiar with the operation of regulations in relation to food and health hygiene. I am not so familiar with them, but I cannot understand how the Minister for Health could suggest that an officer of the health board carrying out an inspection with a view to recommending to his board whether or not a home should be registered would have his decision appealed against. That does not happen in practice and it is not provided for under this section. The appeal is against the health board's decision. It is rather strange that the Minister is distinguishing between the decision of the health board officer and the decision of the health board. The Minister should clarify that. On subsection (5) I should like to ask the Minister to explain to the House what is meant by &ldquo;a designated officer of the health board&rdquo;?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Did the Minister say he will be defining &ldquo;designated&rdquo; in his regulations? It is doubtful if he can do that. Surely he would not have power, unless it is specifically given by regulations, to define expressions in the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things here. The Minister has refused to explain to the House what the circumstances will be where a designated officer under section 12 (5) will be different from an approved officer as referred to in the definition section. I find it quite extraordinary that the Minister should announce to the House that he is not prepared to say what the difference is. There must be some <Col N="681" /> purpose in the Bill in having the different title for this officer. There must be a reason why one officer is an authorised officer and another is a designated officer.</P>
      <P>The Minister is being less than courteous to the House if, in response to a legitimately posed question, he merely says that he is not prepared to explain what the difference is. I urge him to make that explanation as, otherwise, we could be on the section for quite a long time. He cannot very well expect the House to go on dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill and have discussions in relation to the activities of authorised or designated officers if he is not prepared to point out what the reason for the distinction between them is. It appears, in relation to regulations under section 12 (1), which the Minister is giving himself power to make, that they are regulations in relation to the registration of the home and are not regulation in relation to the definition of a designated officer which the Minister seems to be suggesting he will have the power to give himself under that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>In order to register a home in the first instance it will have to be inspected. If it is inspected it will have to be inspected in relation to the conditions in the home. It is in this context that the designated officer arises. The authorised officer arises principally in relation to the admission of a patient.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister should seriously consider having as few different descriptions for people as possible. He should amend section 5 by describing an authorised officer instead of a designated officer. We are prepared to give it to him.</P>

      <P>Will the designated officer be defined in the regulations to be made under section 12, as the Minister suggested earlier, or will he not have any definition given to him? My reason for <Col N="682" /> asking this question in the first place was in an effort to ascertion if this officer will be an officer with medical qualifications, an officer with medical qualifications with particular relevance to the practice of psychiatry, or will be be some other officer with administrative qualifications or an officer merely concerned with ensuring the proper physical standards of the buildings concerned? I am rather taken aback at the explosive nature of the Minister's reaction when I tried to find out what type of an officer would be carrying out this work. Could he give us some indication of the type of person he has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is to provide flexibility for the inspections. It would be quite normal that it would be a medical officer but that is not always the case. This is why an officer will be defined by regulations which will have to define the officer for those specific circumstances. The Bill will provide for such regulations and they can be looked at subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to define this officer in a different way to the other definitions two things arise. It is pointless to have section 3 as a definition section. He should define all of these people in the regulations under each of those sections as they come up, but that would be a very ridiculous way to tackle legislation. That is why we have a definition section. If you have a definition section and you decide to distinguish between different officers, persons or animals, you define it in the definition section. You do not confuse the issue entirely by having a definition section, leave some of the personnel involved out of that section and say you will define them in regulations under certain sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that section 12 (1) gives the Minister the power to define that officer under those regulations, because they just appear to allow him to make regulations in relation to the standards necessary for a home. It does not indicate that the Minister will have the power to define what his designated officer's qualifications ought to be. It does <Col N="683" /> not define if he should be somebody with medical qualifications, somebody with knowledge and practical experience in psychiatry, somebody with experience in the minimum physical standards of the building or a person with experience in the minimum standards of fire precautions and fire safety in the home.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this officer has clearly defined qualifications. Will he be a doctor who will say that the home cannot operate because it does not meet medical standards? Will he be a psychiatrist who will say the home cannot operate because the personnel involved do not appear to be equipped to provide proper psychiatric care? Will he be an administrative officer who says that the home does not qualify to operate because there are not sufficient minimum standards of comfort and ease of administrative operations? Will he be an officer trained and equipped to say if the home can operate safely within existing fire standards, precautions and fire prevention methods? If the Minister refuses to define what qualifications this officer is to have, the House must be very suspicious why he is refusing to give that definition or express that definition in the definition section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that to try, in the definition section, to specify all the designated officer's requirements would be somewhat impractical. Perhaps that is why he has not put down an amendment in the first instance. There is only one such home in the whole country and this situation puts the problem into perspective. However, the purpose here is to provide that a designated officer can be provided under the regulations and that the regulations can define that designated officer. This is very satisfactory.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is grave doubt as to whether section 12, subsection (1) gives the Minister authority to define words appearing in other subsections of this section. Subsection (1) of section 12 provides that a home shall not be operated unless it is approved and registered by <Col N="684" /> the health board in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under this section. That sets out the standards that would be required in respect of accommodation and so on but subsection (5) which is the inspection section provides that:</P>
      <P>It shall be the duty of the person maintaining a psychiatric home to allow it to be inspected by a designated officer of the health board ...</P>
      <P>If that becomes an issue, it will be a keenly contested issue. In most cases it will not be contested but if someone takes the attitude of relying on his rights and of not allowing a designated person to enter the premises, the matter would be likely to end up in the courts for the purpose of determining whether the designated officer has the right to enter the premises. If a designated officer insists on entering the premises but if the occupier objects, the officer's right of entry would have to be established. I am often amazed at the number of people who regard themselves as being infallible but who find later that they are mistaken. I suppose such people, after being challenged in the High Court, would take the line that the judge was wrong. In the meantime, the judge is the boss and he is the one to make the decision. Why not put the whole thing beyond doubt at this stage? Is this not what committee work is all about? There may be a major political principle about the Bill in general but there is no major political issue involved. The next general election will not be either lost or won on the basis of whether either the words &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; or &ldquo;designated&rdquo; are inserted here, but it is unfortunate that Ministers take the view that once they are given a brief, they cannot deviate in any way from it and that the people who give the advice like to stand over it and to pretend that they did not let the Minister down.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 13, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13. &mdash;(1) Every health board shall keep in a prescribed form a register of registered psychiatric centres approved and registered under section 10 and which operate within the board's administrative area and shall make it available for inspection by any member of the public during office hours.</P>
      <P>(2) Every health board shall keep in a prescribed form a register of registered psychiatric homes approved and registered by the board under section 12 and shall make it available for inspection by any member of the public during office hours.</P>
      <P>(3) To enable the health board to maintain the register referred to in subsection (1) the Minister shall notify the board of all decisions made by him under section 10 and under regulations made under that section and of all decisions made by him, or by the High Court as the case may be, under section 11.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment becomes somewhat more clear in the light of the discussion we have just had on sections 10, 11 and 12 which provide for the methods of registration of psychiatric centres, for the cancellation of registrations and for the registration of psychiatric homes. In particular, as provided for in section 12, the inspection for registration purposes is to be carried out by this ill-defined or undefined designated person of a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the health boards comprise the personnel <Col N="686" /> who operate the health centres at regional level, it was considered proper that each health board should maintain an up-to-date register in the form of a complete list of all psychiatric centres &mdash; those operated by the health board, those operated voluntarily, usually by religious bodies, and those operated by private individuals. It is being provided that such a register should be kept up to date and be available for inspection by the public during reasonable hours. In section 9 there is the provision that the health boards keep in prescribed form a register of the district psychiatric centres operated and maintained by the boards. From that point of view it appears to be a useful adjunct to this provision that the health board should keep also an up-to-date register of those centres and homes not operated by them but which come within their administrative area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment. Deputy Boland is confusing the respective functions of the Minister and of the health boards. The boards have no function in relation to the registration process envisaged in sections 10 and 11 which deal with private psychiatric hospitals. It would be an unnecessary duplication to have the boards do as the Deputy suggests in regard to registered psychiatric centres. However, they have functions in respect of the registration of psychiatric homes and they will carry out these functions in accordance with regulations made by the Minister and which will provide for a register of such homes and for their inspection.</P>

But for some reason the Minister is not prepared to accept the principle <Col N="687" /> that a register should be kept at local level of those psychiatric hospitals that are not operated by the health boards. There are quite a number of such hospitals. Therefore, I do not understand the reason for the reluctance on the part of the Minister to ensure that there is kept at health board level an up-to-date register of those psychiatric homes within the board's administrative area but which are not operated by the boards.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7b:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 13, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" />&ldquo;14. &mdash; Where a person is ordinarily resident in a health board area and requires, by reason of his upset state of mind, any care or treatment, maintenance, advice or service, whether by way of hospital in-patient or out-patient or community medical facilities, it shall be the duty of that health board to provide such facilities to that person, subject to the provisions of the Health Acts as to eligibility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to include at the commencement of this part of the Bill which sets out the procedure in relation to admissions, discharges, appeals, reviews, compulsory detention and so on, a restatement of the responsibility which is on the State to provide adequate psychiatric services for people who are in need of treatment. One of the complaints made both by practitioners in the field of psychiatry and by interested bodies involved in the provision of psychiatric services is that the State does not anywhere in legislation appear to assume its responsibility to provide a comprehensive level of care, treatment and maintenance for patients. I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that we choose the words &ldquo;upset state of mind&rdquo; so as to indicate a degree of comprehension and compassion on the part of the State towards anybody who needs treatment of this nature. One of the difficulties in relation to psychiatry has been that the stigma of psychaitric illness has been such that people are generally not prepared to say that they have been for psychiatric treatment. For that reason there should be a clear statement at the commencement of the section enunciating the duty of the State to provide care treatment, maintenance and advice for people who by reason of their upset of mind needed hospital treatment, whether in-patient or out-patient. This section as a preamble to Part III places the onus on behalf of the State on the relevant health boards to provide this service. This section would be an important addition to the Bill because it would indicate that the State was accepting its obligation to provide this service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> One of the big criticisms of the Bill is that it deals almost exclusively with procedures in relation to compulsory detention of patients in need of psychiatric treatment. Those people amount to possibly less than 5 per cent and not more than 10 per cent of the entire psychiatric patients in the country. The Bill has in many areas been represented as being merely draconian or repressive legislation dealing only with elements of compulsory detention. It is a pity that that image has gone abroad. From that point of view it is important that the obligation be on the State to provide a full comprehensive range of medical services for all people with an upset state of mind whether they were looking for treatment voluntarily or otherwise, especially emphasising that over 90 per cent of the people who get treatment get it on a voluntary basis. That obligation on the State should be clearly set out in the first section of Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is entirely unnecessary. As I made clear in the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the Health (Mental Services) Bill must be read in conjunction with the Health Acts. The obligations on the health boards are laid down in those Acts and to do as the Deputy suggests would be a duplication of, for example, sections 52 and 56 of the Health Act, 1970. I do not propose to accept this amendment. Section 52 of the Health Act, 1970 deals with the provision of in-patient services and section 56 deals with the provision of out-patient services. This Bill deals only with the detained patients and the whole purpose of the Bill is to make the vast majority of people who receive treatment similar to those who receive treatment under the Health Acts generally. Indeed the whole administration and organisation of the services goes in that direction. Our newer hospitals have psychiatric services built in as part of their normal services and that is the way in which the service will continue. The obligation is there under the Health Acts and it is clearly being met in the new facilities which are being provided. The Deputy raised the question of not wanting to separate people with mental <Col N="690" /> illness. The whole purpose of the Bill is to leave them to be treated as having an illness similar to most other illnesses in a way in which other illnesses are treated except when their condition is such that they must be detained. It is only in that small percentage of cases that the legal provisions and the rights must be protected.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am sorry that the Minister does not see his way to accepting this amendment because it is a suitable preamble to Part III of the Bill. It is clear from what the Minister says that it is his intention to have a full and adequate hospital service for the mentally ill where it is required but that the emphasis should be on community care. We agree with that. The Minister says that to accept Deputy Boland's amendment would be to duplicate some other sections of the Health Acts which already ensure adequate hospital facilities where required and guarantee necessary out-patient treatment. Those facilities are just not available at the moment. For example, the people in urgent need of dental care cannot get it. They have to wait for years and if they are in certain categories and cannot afford it they do not get it at all. This applies to a lesser extent where people require glasses and so on. I would not like to depend on the sections of the Health Act to which the Minister referred to guarantee the sort of comprehensive health services that the Minister agrees are necessary and says that this Bill will provide. It would be much better to accept Deputy Boland's amendment.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some sort of fine distinction between mental handicap and mental illness. Does the Minister suggest for one moment that there is adequate mental service for all the unfortunate children who badly need to be institutionalised? There is no question of keeping these children at home because they are so badly afflicted. They need the help and care of constant nursing in an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister suggesting that that facility is available? My experience as a <Col N="691" /> politician, meeting parents of these children and hearing their stories, convinced me long ago that no such facility is available, although it is badly needed. It may be that the Minister is afraid that by accepting Deputy Boland's amendment it would impose too serious an obligation on the State. If that is what he means he should say so. I was alarmed when I heard him relying on section 52 of the 1970 Health Act to guarantee hospitalisation facilities where necessary and also to guarantee community care where necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between legislation and the provisions set out in the Act. The requirements are met under the existing Health Acts. The question of provision of services in general and the level and quality of such services is a matter of money and administration. In that respect I am doing all I can to upgrade the services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred in particular to the mentally handicapped. I have allocated £8 million in the capital budget this year for new facilities for the mentally handicapped, as compared with £6 million last year. The Deputy should accept that this is an attempt in the present circumstances to make the necessary provision. Most of what is now required for the mentally handicapped is adult residential places and workshops. It arises out of the success of the work of my predecessors during the years in relation to the mentally handicapped and it also arises because of the successful work carried out by health boards and those involved in health services. The mentally handicapped are living much longer and healthier lives and there is a need to provide services at that level. At the beginning of this week we gave the goahead for new facilities for the mentally handicapped at Drumcar, in the Deputy's health board area. The provision of the money is a separate question, but as far as the Act is concerned the requirement is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A large element of what the Minister has said is utter crass rubbish. It is well known that during the <Col N="692" /> years the health boards have been remiss to the point of being recalcitrant in not providing services for the mentally handicapped and for the Minister to suggest as he has just done that any improvement in this area is due to the activities of the boards is misleading and false. The work done for the mentally handicapped has been undertaken almost exclusively by the voluntary agencies. The part played by the State has been unforgivably low key and it is ridiculous and misleading for the Minister to suggest otherwise. It comes back to the Minister's total failure to grasp the distinction between the mentally handicapped and the psychiatrically ill. That failure ran through his entire contribution on Second Stage and has been carried through this discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the activities of the voluntary agencies &mdash; usually the religious organisations &mdash; there is no way that services for the psychiatrically ill or mentally handicapped would have existed during the years. If those voluntary agencies were to close their doors this evening the State would be unable to provide the necessary services. The State has sat back and expected the agencies to provide the services, often in such a way as virtually to abrogate its own responsibilities. The inclusion of amendment No. 7b would copperfasten the obligation of the State to provide the necessary services. It would place the onus on the health board to provide for the patient. The amendment refers to a person who is in an upset state of mind. In how many health board areas does the situation exist that there are not the necessary facilities for the proper treatment, maintenance, care and advice for such people? The simple fact is that the State has been relying on the vocational nature of the religious orders who have provided these services during the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is entitled the Health (Mental Services) Bill but the Minister is not prepared to include the section that accepts the State's responsibility to provide both hospital in-patient and out-patient services. It is indicative of the way the State has abrogated its responsibilities over the years and has sat back and expected the <Col N="693" /> voluntary agencies to do the work. The Minister's attitude is indicative of the narrow, blinkered approach of the Government on this matter and of the way they have sought to deal with only a tiny proportion of people whom it is necessary to detain in psychiatric institutions. They have not attempted to deal with the 90 per cent who need psychiatric care and who want that care as voluntary patients. It indicates their narrow-minded, stultified approach towards this whole matter.</P>

      <P>The contrary is the case. The Deputy has taken a narrow view of the development of the health services. I have tried to impress on him the changes that have taken and are taking place and which this Bill will assist. The Deputy referred to the work of the voluntary groups. I welcome the participation of the voluntary groups and the contribution they have made. However, I do not want to create a situation where there is any kind of State takeover &mdash; I would not like to see that happening. I am happy with the mix of the voluntary organisations and the State and wish to place on record my appreciation of the work done by them. Of course they are almost totally funded on a current basis by the State. They receive substantial grants and collect considerable funds towards the development of new facilities. As Minister I am very happy to co-operate with them in that way. In that sense they provide a good blend as part of our total services. I have a very happy working relationship with them and I have no desire to have any State takeover.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;for mentally handicapped children or young adults, I want to deny that straightaway. Even if the Minister wants to give the impression that such facilities are around the corner, I want to say that that is not so either. There is a great shortage of beds for severely handicapped children. There is an even worse condition prevailing, that these children have been institutionalised from the age of seven or eight up to 17 and are then discharged and there is no place for them. They are not suited to living in the community at all. There is no question of making a virtue out of community care and keeping them at home. I am speaking about young adults who are not suitable for community care at home. It is nothing short of an absolute disgrace that they are discharged from various institutions, where they were looked after from the age of perhaps six, seven or eight up to 17, with no suitable place being provided for them.</P>
      <P>I do not want to reduce this debate to a political discussion, but the Minister had been doing that. The Minister has given the impression that he has been providing facilities over the last few weeks on a grand scale. Over the past few weeks the Minister has been giving the impression that he will build this, that and the other when he knows perfectly well that the money was not provided in the capital budget this year to meet the commitments he is giving the impression he is entering into. The amount of money provided in the capital budget is £40 million. The Minister gave the impression that he spent far more &mdash; perhaps he would like to clarify the position and say that he did not &mdash; between the west and other parts of the country. The Minister should come clean. This is not a suitable forum for that type of discussion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Deputy Boland introduced this very meaningful amendment and made an excellent case in support of it. When the Minister rose he reached immediately for the Health Act of 1970 and began to quote <i>ad lib</i> from that in regard to two sections in support of his contention that this was not necessary. Of course it is necessary for us to say that, if he is relying on the Health Act as proving that there are adequate general health services available, we must say that this is not so. If he asks us to accept that as a guarantee <Col N="696" /> that adequate health services will be provided here, we must also say that that is not so. That is the turn the debate has taken. Deputy Boland's amendment, which proposed to give a charter to a mentally ill patient, is a very desirable and laudable one, something that should be written into a mental health code, as this is supposed to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Will the Minister say what part of this amendment he does not agree with? The amendment suggests that, if a person by reason of his or her upset state of mind requires care or treatment, maintenance, advice or service, whether by way of hospital in-patient or out-patient or community medical facilities, the onus should be on the health board to provide those facilities. Can the Minister say with what part of that proposed new section he disagrees? If he does not disagree with any part thereof, can he say why he is not prepared to accept it and have it enshrined in legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely on the grounds that it is unnecessary. I have explained that already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that this is provided for already in the Health Act, 1970. If that were the case would I not be a fool to be tabling this amendment? Also would the officials of the House not be rather silly to have allowed this amendment to be put forward for discussion if the facilities are already provided in existing legislation? This amendment was accepted by the officials of the Ceann Comhairle's office. Presumably they did not think this amendment was covered already by legislation and hence the House has been discussing it. Therefore it would appear that, apart from any case I might make, <Col N="697" /> the staff in the House, in the Ceann Comhairle's office, appear to feel that what is provided in this proposed new section has not already been provided for comprehensively in the legislation of 1970.</P>
      <P>I can recall that Bill going through the House. I can recall the Committee Stage discussion in 1969, quite a long time before the Minister became a Member of the House. Therefore he may not be as familiar with the nuances of that Act as those of us who were around at that time. I can recall the undertakings given by the Minister's predecessor at that time in relation to the type of services that the Act would ensure and would insist by law were to be provided. Quite a number of those services still have not been provided, as was alluded to by Deputy Fitzpatrick. Is the Minister suggesting that in all of the new general hospitals the State is taking on its responsibility to the psychiatric services by providing psychiatric wings and beds? Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication, in relation to those new general hospitals being built at present, how many psychiatric beds will be provided in each? For instance, how big will be the psychiatric wing in the new Beaumont Hospital?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This takes me to virtually all of the reservations I have had about the Bill. The Bill consists of 50 sections, 49 of which deal with the people who have to be compulsorily detained in psychiatric hospitals, or to put it in crude terms, the people who need to be forcibly restrained, the people who need to be locked up. That is what 49 of the sections of this Bill deal with. Of the people who receive psychiatric care in hospitals in this country at present, something like 97 per cent receive it in a voluntary capacity. They realise that their state of mind is upset and that they need treatment. They seek it voluntarily and receive it.</P>
      <P>This is 97 per cent of the patients. The other 3 per cent, those who must be compulsorily detained, are, apparently, the subject of 49 or 50 sections of this Bill. The 97 per cent receiving psychiatric treatment voluntarily at this moment in our hospitals are catered for by two lines and two words in this Bill. That is the modern, comprehensive, compassionate legislation about which the Minister and his predecessor have spoken for a year and a half. All that is provided for that 97 per cent of voluntary psychiatric patients is section 13, which goes as follows: &ldquo;Nothing in this Part shall be read as preventing or discouraging a person from being admitted voluntarily for care and treatment in a psychiatric centre.&rdquo; Full stop, forget about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not an adequate method of dealing with the vast bulk of the many thousands who annually require psychiatric treatment and who receive it on a voluntary basis. That is part of the reason for my last amendment and for my next amendment, which will be discussed. I needed to make this point in relation to section 13, to explain why we felt it necessary to enter amendment No. 7c and the other references to voluntary patients. In this one respect the Minister must be exempted. I accept that this Bill was not his creation, that he inherited it <Col N="699" /> when he inherited the Department. Nonetheless, whoever conceived this Bill started from a false premise, that there was a need to produce a major piece of legislation to deal with a minor problem&mdash;the premise that the vast majority of people who require psychiatric care should be virtually ignored in modern legislation. This is wrong and that is the reason for my two amendments. This section does not adequately deal with the very real problem of providing psychiatric care, treatment and maintenance in hospitals in an in-patient and out-patient basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 13 is a very tell-tale section. It certainly recognises the impression given by the remainder of the Bill. It is a very small section, which has been read out by Deputy Boland. It is saying that, unless we clarify the position, it will be thought that this Bill deals exclusively with detained persons and excludes voluntary treatment. If it means anything, it means that. The legislators have to put a signpost on this Bill to say that it is not outlawing or excluding voluntary treatment, otherwise anybody reading the Bill would think that it did not provide for voluntary treatment. What else does it mean? This small section rears its head and says &ldquo;We do treat voluntary patients.&rdquo; As Deputy Boland has said, it leaves voluntary treatment to be worked out in some obscure way. I tried this morning to ascertain the position. I suppose I should have gone through the 1945 Act, section by section. Certainly, we are dumping 284 sections of the 1945 Bill and Schedule and three other Bills of 1953 and 1961. We are replacing all this by about 30 sections of the present Bill, practically all of which, as Deputy Boland says, deal with detained persons and persons who need to be compulsorily detained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be argued, and seems officially to be argued, that perhaps that was the aim of the Minister's predecessor and his officials when they set out to prepare this legislation. If that was their aim, they fell at the first hurdle. The Minister argues that this Bill suggests that the people who need to be compulsorily detained for psychiatric treatment should be represented as receiving part of the general health care. It could equally be argued that because 49 or 50 sections of this Bill deal with those who have to be locked up, the 97 per cent receiving psychiatric care voluntarily will now be regarded and represented to the general public as if they were the same as the 3 per cent needing to be locked up.</P>
      <P>The outcome of this legislation may be to give the impression that all who go for psychiatric care need to be compulsorily detained and that they may be a danger to themselves or others. If that is what happens the entire effect created by this legislation will be regressive. It will lend an even greater stigma or taint to the image of psychiatric treatment. That is why it was so unfortunate that greater attention was not given to the provision of services for voluntary patients and to procedures for admittance and so forth in relation to them. The corollary of the Minister's argument is what is more likely to happen. That is not my suggestion, or my reaction. That is the reaction of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, of the group of psychiatrists who form part of the Irish Medical Association, the reaction of the experts, the practitioners in the field. Their fear about this legislation is that there will be a taint on all who obtain psychiatric care&mdash;the vast bulk of them in a voluntary way. That is why I was making my point, which the Minister does not appear to grasp. If he understands it, he does not appear to recognise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together, as the subject matters are, in fact, intimately linked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council agreement of 30 May 1980 provided for reductions to the British contribution to the Community Budget during the years 1980 and 1981. At the same time the Community pledged themselves to resolve the problem for 1982 by means of structural changes and, to this end, the Commission were mandated to carry out an examination of the development of Community policies, without calling into question the common financial responsibility for these policies, which are financed from the Community's own resources, nor the basic principles of the common agricultural policy. Taking account of the situations and interests of all member states, this examination will aim to prevent the recurrence of unacceptable situations for any of them. Detailed discussions of the issue will not begin until the results of the Commission's examination have been presented to the Council in June 1981. For this reason the item was not on the agenda of the recent Foreign Affairs Council and is unlikely to be discussed in <Col N="713" /> any detail, until the Commission report has been presented to the Council.</P>
    <P>However, it is nonetheless the case that the matter is the subject of ongoing study and discussion within the Community. I have recently held bilateral meetings to discuss this question with the Foreign Ministers of Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany, and similar meetings will take place in the near future with the Foreign Ministers of Italy and Greece.</P>
    <P>At these meetings I have taken the opportunity of outlining the Government's views on the future development of the Community. In our view the forthcoming debate should not focus on exclusively budgetary issues. Instead, the Community and all its policies must be looked at as a whole and, as required by the agreement of 30 May, the situation and interest of all member states must be taken into account in order to prevent the recurrence of unacceptable situations for any of them. If the restructuring called for in the mandate of 30 May is to be in accord with the fundamental objectives of our Community, what is required now is for the Community to move forward by building on their achievements. To do this, it is imperative that the present artificial restraint on potential Community revenue be removed, through the raising of the legal limit on that revenue represented by the ceiling of 1 per cent VAT. That is the view which I, on behalf of the Government, have been conveying, and will continue to convey, to our Community partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like clarification because I want to be sure that I understood the Minister correctly. Is the Minister saying it is his view and that of his Government that the most appropriate solution to the budgetary difficulty would be to increase the ceiling of 1 per cent VAT to something above that? In particular, does the Minister accept that it would be most undesirable to return to a system in which the Community budget would be financed by individual national contributions which would have to obtain the political will of individual Governments and individual Parliaments in each year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the thrust of Deputy Ryan's question and, indeed, that was the thrust of my reply. If the Community want to retain their Community philosophy and programme of action, the obvious manner in which it should be financed is through their own resource, the 1 per cent, as it is at the moment. This ceiling can be raised if there is the political will to raise it. There is no other way in which the Community can be self-financing.</P>

      <P>The Government are of course, seriously concerned at the dangers for humanity as a whole which may arise from world tensions and conflicts, especially those involving the larger powers and from the high level of armaments, both nuclear and conventional, in many parts of the world.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="716" /> Foreign Affairs the present sum owed to this country by the United Nations in respect of services by our Defence Forces; and the steps being taken to recoup the outstanding amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount outstanding from the United Nations on 31 December 1980 in respect of claims made and of certain troop costs, for which specific claims are not required, arising from Ireland's participation in United Nations peace-keeping forces is estimated at approximately £3.4 million. Approximately £0.5 million of this amount refers to Ireland's participation in peace-keeping operations other than the UN Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL. The remaining £2.9 million arises out of participation in UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>Some of the expenses of peace-keeping operations, such as recoupment of certain pension awards, may not arise for some time after we have ceased participating in a particular operation. These expenses, in fact, account for the greater part of the sum owing from peace-keeping operations other than UNIFIL and we are in constant touch with the United Nations about them.</P>
      <P>As regards the amount outstanding in the case of UNIFIL, the Deputy will be aware from previous discussion of this subject that, because of the withholding by certain member states of their assessed contributions, there is a deficit of some 22 per cent in the UNIFIL account. This has resulted in countries which contribute troops to UNIFIL not being reimbursed their full entitlements under the UNIFIL financial arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the extra cost actually incurred by the State over and above regular expenses such as ordinary pay, in providing a contingent for service with UNIFIL, is less than our entitlement under the reimbursement arrangements. It is estimated that for the period from May 1978 to December 1980, this extra cost did not exceed £8.3 million. On the basis that only £7 million of this amount would be reimbursed by the UN, because of the withholding of contributions, the net extra cost to the State of providing a <Col N="717" /> contingent to UNIFIL for the period in question would be £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>Since the situation concerning UNIFIL finances first came to light two years ago, we have urgently pursued the matter with the United Nations in New York in conjunction with the UN Secretariat and other troop-contributing countries. The Irish delegation to the General Assembly both in 1979 and in 1980 was deeply involved in the drafting and presentation of the resolutions dealing with the financing of UNIFIL. In addition to some minor adjustments, the major improvement brought about over this period and finalised some months ago at the General Assembly, has been a revision of the basic amount that troop-contributors are to be paid per man per month. Since December 1980 this has been increased from $680 to $950. This increase should result in a substantial improvement in the reimbursements under this heading where to date the shortfall in the UNIFIL account has been particularly evident.</P>
    <P>I am of course keeping this whole question under review and shall continue to take any action open to me to try to improve the finances of the force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the United Nation's efforts to recoup this money have not been successful. I should like to ask if the Irish Government have made any effort to get the countries who are defaulting to pay their share? Have they made any diplomatic approaches to these countries and could the Minister name the countries who are in arrears?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be frank about it. We are talking about Soviet Russia and most of the countries of the Eastern European <i>bloc</i> who are not contributors. There is very little that can be done in regard to them because of their attitude. We have been engaged in trying to increase the amount per man, as it were, to get a revision of the basic amount which we are to be paid per man per month. By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the troop contributors. We got an agreement on this to raise it from 680 dollars to 950 dollars, which is a substantial improvement and <Col N="718" /> will go a long way to meet the shortfall. That is the realistic approach we have taken to the matter, rather than engaging in polemics where we know polemics will not succeed.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the document to which the Deputy refers entitled &ldquo;UNIFIL in the Lebanese Cauldron&rdquo; and which was issued by the Information Department of the Embassy of Israel in London on 12 March 1981.</P>
      <P>The document contains many interpretations of UNIFIL policy and activities which would not accord with the United Nations assessment of the situation of the force. I can tell the Deputy that the United Nations, under whose command the force operates, are aware of the document, regard it as inaccurate and have made efforts to correct it and similar statements. I would regard such matters concerning the overall operation of the force as being for the UN Secretary-General to deal with as he sees fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without apportioning blame or having a discussion on whether the document is totally true, will the Minister not agree that the position in the Lebanon indicates that the mandate originally given to UNIFIL was to a large extent unrealistic and that the situation in what is called &ldquo;the cauldron&rdquo; in Southern Lebanon indicates that the Lebanese Army is about as effective there as the British Army is in Crossmaglen? Would the Minister not accept, having regard to the fact that there are hostile activities there &mdash; we need not have a discussion as to who is responsible but one hostile action provokes another &mdash; that now is the time to raise the matter again in the United Nations with a view to altering the mandate so that it will deal with the actual situation there rather than the hopeful one?</P>

I agree with Deputy Ryan that the whole nature of the mandate and the exercise of it is a cause for concern. The new Irish commander of the UNIFIL force there has made that aspect quite clear so there is no question as far as the UNIFIL force or the United Nations are concerned. The thrust of Deputy Ryan's point &mdash; we would like it also &mdash; is that all the troop contributing countries should come together in some sort of agreement to intensify his point, otherwise the whole presence of UNIFIL must be called into question. If it reaches a stage where it is not effective in any way it comes to a very dangerous stage. We have to watch that aspect also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before addressing the substance of the Deputy's question, I should perhaps first point out that the mandate of UNIFIL as first set out in Security Council Resolution 425 of 19 March 1978 comprises three essential elements. UNIFIL is to (a) confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon; (b) restore international peace and security; and (c) assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area. These three elements are commonly referred to as the three parts of the mandate of UNIFIL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further document drawn up by the UN Secretary-General on the operation of the force was approved by the Security Council in Resolution 426 also on 19 <Col N="721" /> March 1978. This document listed a series of what were called terms of reference of the force and one of these terms of reference was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Force will use its best efforts to prevent the recurrence of fighting and ensure that its area of operation is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind.</P>
    <P>I would point out, therefore, that, if one were to quote from the original UN document, the phrase &ldquo;use its best efforts&rdquo; would be included in the Deputy's question before the phrase &ldquo;to ensure that its area of operations is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind&rdquo;. I can assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that the force is using its best efforts to try to achieve this end.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the conditions under which UNIFIL is operating, the Deputy will be aware that these are extremely difficult. To the south of the UNIFIL area of operations the <i>de facto</i> forces continue to hold a strip of territory with the financial and military support of Israel. They harass the force and impede it from carrying out its tasks. The force has also continued to be faced by attempts by Palestinian and radical Lebanese and other groups to infiltrate its area of operations from the north. This is clearly not a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>Despite all these disadvantages the Secretary-General in his most recent comprehensive report nonetheless expressed the view that, UNIFIL &ldquo;is performing an indispensable service to peace not only in South Lebanon, but with regard to the Middle East situation in general&rdquo;. The Government are prepared to accept this assessment of the Secretary-General and in this context will continue to do whatever they can to assist the UN in its efforts to improve the conditions under which the force operates. In this regard, we are in continual contact through diplomatic channels with the UN, the other troop contributors and countries which have an interest in the area.</P>

      <P>The basic factor to remember is that if it were not for the presence of UNIFIL in that area undoubtedly there would have been very serious trouble up to now. One must obviously, moving from there, support any continuing presence in that area. One then comes to the final situation where if the United Nations decide that no useful purpose is being served by being there any more then other decisions have to be made. At the moment the United Nations are satisfied that it is important for us to be there and for UNIFIL to be there.</P>

Is there any view as to what the short-term and medium-term future will be there and how long they are likely to have to remain there? Are there any further steps, based on such analysis, which could now be taken, which would lead towards eventual peace in the area and restoration of the Government in the Lebanon?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he has held any discussions with UN representatives on the likely duration of the participation of Irish troops in the UNIFIL force in the Lebanon; whether any approach has been made to the United Nations authorities on the matter; if he expects any improvement in the behaviour of the Christian militia; and if he will give details of any consultations he had on the matter prior to the recent meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister.</P>

      <P>No discussions have been held by me with the United Nations on the likely duration of the participation of Irish troops with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon. The United Nations has not informed me as to whether it has had an approach from any other source on this matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the <i>de facto</i> forces in Southern Lebanon, to which the Deputy refers as the Christian militia, I would naturally hope that there would be an improvement in the attitude of these forces who consistently harass UNIFIL and have prevented it from taking over control of all the territory entrusted to it by the Security Council. The Deputy will know that these forces are supported financially and militarily by Israel. I cannot say that recent events such as the killing of two Nigerian soldiers on 16 March would encourage expectations of improvement in the behaviour of these forces towards UNIFIL. However, the United Nations works continually to improve the situation of the Force and we are of course in constant touch with the UN and seek to be of assistance wherever possible in helping to bring about better conditions for UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy in the last part of his question is referring to the meeting in Jerusalem on 23 March between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence was at the time on a visit to Irish troops serving with UN peacekeeping missions in the Middle East and paid a courtesy call on the Israeli Prime Minister in Mr. Begin's capacity as Minister for Defence of Israel. I was of course in contact with the Minister for Defence before his recent visit to the Middle East</P>

      <P>Quite apart from the meeting in Oslo, to which the Minister referred in the previous question of countries contributing forces to the Lebanon at this time, would the Minister agree that probably the time has come for some bilateral initiative on his part with the UN authorities to come to some conclusions about the value or otherwise of the operation in the Lebanon? Factors <Col N="724" /> beyond our control operate in that area which make it very difficult indeed to foresee any successful outcome to the present operation. I agree that these factors are outside our control and relate more to the general Lebanese conflict. There does not appear to be, in the foreseeable future any possibility of a successful outcome to our participation. At least that would suggest that the Minister should be discussing, unilaterally at this point with the UN, the future of this operation.</P>

I am surprised that the Minister has not been discussing recently with UN representatives the likely duration of our participation in the operation in question. There are factors outside our control involved in this situation. The rules of the game do not appear to be operating and there is serious loss of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a similar question on 15 May 1980, it would be inappropriate and contrary to international practice to speculate publicly on the exchange of resident ambassadors between Ireland and Israel or indeed any other country where we do not already maintain a resident embassy as this would be a matter for discussion between the Irish Government and the other Governments concerned.</P>
      <P>The exchange of resident embassies with other countries is a matter which is kept under constant review in the light of our international interests and the availability of the necessary resources. We already have diplomatic relations with Israel on a non-residential basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the exchanges that have taken place in respect of earlier questions, would the Minister not agree that, first, we have a very real need for constant contact in this city with representatives of the State of Israel and that, secondly, the State of Israel has, effectively, given up requesting a residential embassy in this city on the grounds apparently that the Government have refused their requests up to now? Would the Minister either confirm or deny that the reason we are denying the request of the Israelis is based on the spurious grounds of security?</P>

      <P>We have representation both in Ireland and from Ireland to a number of Arab countries on an accredited basis and with the great majority of the Arab nations the representation is on this basis. The same goes for Israel. There is a simple matter of cost involved in this whole question. The only country from that general region that has direct accredition here is Egypt. We have relations with Israel from Athens while Israel have relations with us through London.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that since 15 May 1980 he has altered the sensitive balance in the relationship between this country and Israel and between this country and Israel's neighbours by reason of espousing the PLO? Having regard to the fact that unease is generated in our relations with Israel by virtue of that stance, would the Minister not consider it appropriate now to establish what has long since been sought by the Israelis, that is, an exchange of ambassadors on a residential basis? Should the Minister not consider also the odd relationship which exists between the political party of which he is a member and the state of Syria, which again is something that gives rise to a certain amount of unease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the espousal of the PLO there is one matter I must emphasise and that is, as I have said in the House previously, that Gaston Thorn, as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, held an official meeting with Yasser Arafat on 4 August 1980. I have here a long list of French, Greek, Belgian, Italian and UK representatives in the form of Foreign Ministers and Prime Ministers who have met Mr. Kaddoumi and Mr. Arafat as well as other members of the PLO. Anything we are doing in this respect in the way of talking to these people is entirely in the context of the Venice Declaration, which was agreed to by the then nine members of the Community and which was subscribed to by Greece, subsequently with a view to devising a formula which would achieve some peace in the Middle East. That formula must recognise the integrity and the security of the State of Israel as well as recognising some formula for the Palestinian people and for peace generally in that whole region.</P>

      <P>Arising out of my first question, would the Minister indicate the reason for our not having acceded yet to the request of the Israelis for representation <Col N="728" /> on a residential status? Is the reason one of cost or is it one of security <i>vis-à-vis</i> ourselves and the State of Israel?</P>

      <P>Strictly, it is a matter of practicality. We find that our existing relations with middle-eastern countries generally, whether Israel or any other, are being satisfactorily conducted within the resources at our disposal and to that extent there is finance involved.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Relations between the European Economic Community and Cyprus are governed by the 1972 agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus, which came into effect on 1 June 1973. The association agreement provided for two successive stages of association. The first, providing for development projects and tariff concessions, was to last until 30 June 1977.</P>
      <P>Following the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in 1974, after a coup on the island supported by the then Greek colonels regime, the Turkish Cypriots declared Northern Cyprus to be the &ldquo;Turkish Federated State of Cyprus&rdquo;, which however is officially recognised only by Turkey. The Government of Cyprus administers the larger southern part of the island and is recognised by Ireland and its Community partners as the sole legitimate government on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the political situation on the island during this period it was not possible to introduce the second stage of the association agreement, providing for transition to a customs union and consequently the first stage was extended by protocol first until 31 December 1979 and then until 1980. The political situation on Cyprus has improved somewhat with the 1980 inter-communal talks organised by the United Nations. Partly as a result of these talks the EEC&mdash;Cyprus Association Council adopted a decision on 24 November 1980 on the process into the second stage of the association agreement. The first part of this process was agreed in a protocol signed on 18 March 1981 and the aim is to extend until the end of 1981 the arrangements applied in <Col N="731" /> 1980 to EEC-Cyprus relations. In the field of trade, this means that the concessions made by the Community to Cyprus will not be altered and that no additional tariff reduction will be requested of Cyprus during the application of the new protocol.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Association decision, negotiations will now take place to work out the trade arrangements to apply in 1982 and 1983. In 1982 both parties will begin negotiations on the conditions and procedures leading to the customs union.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the EEC-Cyprus Association Agreement will now develop as was originally intended. The Community has made it clear that it seeks to ensure that the benefits arising from the agreement should reach both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. This position has been accepted by both sides in Cyprus.</P>

It is as a result of that that whatever preference potatoes have <i>vis-à-vis</i> Cyprus and the Community operate, but it has nothing to do with Greek membership of the Community.

As far as we are concerned there is no question of recording diplomatic status or giving official recognition or permission to any such office. It is entirely a matter for a private organisation to establish an office if they wish. That is their business. It is as straightforward as that.

In view of the fact that one of the reasons reported to be connected with the refusal of the request of the State of Israel to establish a residential embassy here was related to the security consideration, would the Minister not agree that any proposal to establish an office of the PLO, private or otherwise, carries the same security risk that an Israeli residential embassy would carry?

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move amendment No. 7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> In page 7, before section 14 to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;17. &mdash;(1) Where an applicant under section 16 is being treated in a psychiatric centre as a voluntary patient he may, at any time, give notice of his intention to leave the psychiatric centre not earlier than seventy-two hours thereafter and he shall be so entitled to discharge himself at any time after the expiration of such period.</P>
    <P>(2) Where the applicant is the person himself the medical officer in charge of the centre shall, where practicable, notify the relatives of the applicant of his intention to discharge himself immediately upon receiving notice of the person's intention to do so.</P>
    <P>(3) The Minister may, by regulation, vary the period of seventy-two hours as set out in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(4) Where it is proposed to make a regulation under this section, a draft of the regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>That is what I wanted the Minister to do in regard to another regulation earlier on. The Bill as it stands enables a voluntary patient to discharge himself without notice. It is true that, following a public demand and no doubt specialist demand, the Minister changed his mind and has put down amendment No. 25.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Amendment No. 25 in the name of the Minister proposes to improve the position somewhat. It proposes that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A person who is under care in a psychiatric centre otherwise than as a detained patient may give written notice to the medical officer in charge <Col N="764" /> of the centre that he wishes to leave the centre not earlier than twenty-four hours after giving the notice and he shall be entitled and shall be allowed to leave the centre at any time after the expiration of the said twenty-four hours.</P>
    <P>Were it not for these two amendments a voluntary patient would be entitled to discharge himself without notice. I am all in favour of treating patients afflicted with mental trouble in a kind and humane manner without putting a stigma on them, but at the same time we must have regard to the fact that many such patients are incapable of coming to reasoned decisions and are incapable of looking after themselves. In quite a number of cases they suffer from depression and they might damage themselves. We have had experiences where patients have caused fatal damage to themselves and some of us know of dreadful cases where patients who had discharged themselves or who had absented themselves from institutions have caused fatal injuries to near and dear relatives.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to see that patients are taken care of when they need care. It is necessary that we should see to it that patients are looked after in such a way that they are not the cause of injury to other people. We all know that when a patient finds himself in a mental institution, even if he has been brought in on a voluntary basis or has been encouraged to come in, he often resents being there and develops a grievance against some person whom he thinks has put him there. There is always a risk that this unfortunate sick person might inflict injury on the person whom he thinks is responsible for his being there. Such people suffer from all sorts of obsessions and delusions. In my professional lifetime I have had knowledge of a fatal and dreadful case where some patient was given a certain amount of freedom, took more freedom than was allowed and actually got back to his place of domicile with fatal results before the Garda caught him. We have to have regard to this sort of thing. The Bill as initiated, with the right for patients to discharge themselves without notice, <Col N="765" /> was very deficient. The Minister tells us that the whole object of this Bill and of his approach to mental illness is to care for sick people in the community where that is possible and to treat them in the same way as any other patient in a hospital. That means that the Minister will encourage people to admit themselves to psychiatric institutions on a voluntary basis. In the interests of the patients and their relatives it is essential that they be cared for in a kind and humane way. However, it is not too much to ask that the patient should have to give 72 hours' notice before leaving the hospital. That is all we are asking.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced the Minister did not want any provision regarding notice. He wanted to have the situation that the patient could go when he or she liked. Now the Minister is introducing an amendment providing for 24 hours' notice. Deputy Boland's amendment which I support requires 72 hours' notice. I do not think that is unreasonable. If at the end of 72 hours the patient is still in the same frame of mind he can simply leave and go to his place of residence. However, in a percentage of the cases the chief psychiatrist of the institution may be convinced that the person is not in a fit state to leave and in other cases he might have grave doubts. In those circumstances the status of the patient would switch from being a voluntary patient &mdash; which the Minister does not recognise &mdash; to the status of a detained patient.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing is reasonable. The only difference of opinion between the Minister and myself on this matter is the length of notice. A period of 24 hours' notice is a short time to enable the chief psychiatrist to communicate with relatives, perhaps to get a second opinion or to observe the patient. This is a serious consideration. He may wish to observe how the patient reacts to a different drug or to observe how he reacts without any drugs. The patient would be under medication or sedation in the institution and there is no guarantee he would continue to take the prescribed medicine at home. I have a layman's approach to this matter. <Col N="766" /> It might be necessary for the chief consultant to observe the patient over a period of 72 hours to see how he reacts to different medication.</P>
    <P>We are adopting a reasonable, cautious approach. It is not a draconian approach. A person would not be in an institution in the first instance unless he needed medical attention for a condition, one that might prevent him coming to a reasoned, balance judgment about himself, his actions and other people. I urge the Minister to fall into line with the views of the best medical opinion in the country and to come down on the side of caution. If something undesirable should happen it will be too late to be cautious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly all of the submissions received on the Bill, particularly those from the various medical and nursing interests, expressed unease about a situation that possibly could arise where a voluntary patient who is in an excited or overwrought state insists on discharging himself or herself from a psychiatric centre although the medical staff may think the patient to be totally unfit for discharge.</P>
      <P>Initially I was opposed to imposing any restrictions whatever on the rights of a voluntary patient to take his discharge since my concern was essentially to ensure that psychiatric illness was treated in precisely the same way as any other illness. However in view of the submissions made and the depth of concern expressed, I introduced the amendment. I want to stress the fact that I am reluctant to concede on this because I know that in practice the 72 hours is rarely used. From discussions I have had with professional people I know that is the case. Nevertheless they are concerned that there should be some provision in the event of an exceptional case arising and it was for this reason I introduced the amendment providing for 24 hours' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was submitted that voluntary <Col N="767" /> patients should be required to give notice of their intention to discharge themselves. Under the existing legislation voluntary patients are required to give 72 hours' notice prior to discharge. The giving of a period of notice would, it was argued, allow medical staff to calm a patient, to persuade him to remain in the centre or, in the most extreme cases, to effect the usual procedures leading to formal detention where such a course was considered necessary. The amendment now proposed specifies that a voluntary patient must give 24 hours' notice of intention to discharge himself. I consider this period meets the objections raised in a practical and sensible way.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that we do not prevent people from entering an institution in a voluntary way in order to get treatment. The 72 hours' notice is known to have a discouraging effect so far as people entering an institution are concerned. I am not prepared to go any further on this. Neither am I prepared to impose on a doctor in charge of a psychiatric hospital the statutory obligation to instantly notify relatives about what may turn out to be a transient whim. I ask the Deputy to consider that the voluntary patient might be fully recovered, might be single and might not like his immediate relatives to know anything about his illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Again, I am disappointed with the Minister's approach to this matter. It is difficult to understand the last argument he put forward. He seems to assume that relatives would not know the person was in an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases that would be so. The Deputy is thinking of extreme cases but if we base legislation on extreme cases it becomes draconian in relation to the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It might happen in Dublin city where people are living away from home but it certainly would not happen in rural Ireland where people are in close tough <Col N="768" /> with their relatives. The fact that a person admits himself or herself to a psychiatric institution and then wants to leave within hours of entering the institution is proof positive that that person is unsettled, unstable and is not capable of coming to a rational decision. I admit a person might be in an institution for 6 or 12 months before he wants to leave. Some forms of illness make the afflicted people quite cunning. It could be that they would go in on a whim. and want to leave again very quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been advised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists as follows:</P>
      <P>Where an &ldquo;informal patient&rdquo; insists on discharging himself, although deemed not fit to do so by the Medical Director of the hospital or his designated deputy, either of these persons should be empowered to make a detention order for 72 hours. This would allow time for the relatives of the patient to be contacted so that the patient could be discharged to the care of these relatives or, alternatively, arrangements might have to be made to have the patient detained on a compulsory basis.</P>
      <P>That is the advice the Minister has received from the most responsible body of psychiatrists in the country, people whose profession it is to make themselves acquainted in the best possible way with the method of caring for and curing these people.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I spoke to some of them quite recently and I have no reason to believe that that advice has changed. If one applies common sense to most things, if one applies common sense to most branches of the law, one comes up with the right answers. If one applies common sense to what we are talking about now, one can come up with the right answers. The approach of most laymen to this would be that a person who is sufficiently ill to find herself or himself in a mental <Col N="769" /> institution needs care and that if the doctor in that place believes that the person should not be allowed out for a few days he should have the power to keep that person there. That is no more than common sense. The Minister has arrived at certain conclusions about this Bill and nothing will change his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> But some time or other when there is a disaster, a tragedy, then there will be great concern shown &mdash; I do not want to get into extravagent language &mdash; then there will be a demand to change the law, the regulations. Then there will be an inquiry set up to inquire into this, that and the other thing. I say that common sense demands that 24 hours is not sufficient time in which to observe somebody about whom the chief psychiatrist has a doubt. Twenty four hours is not sufficient time in which to change the drugs a patient may be on to see how he reacts, or indeed reacts without drugs. What is the rush? People go into these hospitals to be cured; sometimes they go in for protection. Saying that they must give 72 hours notice before leaving will not prevent them from going in. I feel strongly about this and about the necessity for insisting on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said that he has been speaking to the Royal College of Psychiatrists recently might I ask him have they changed their minds? Have they told him that they are happy about 24 hours? Have they told him that 24 hours is sufficient and that they think it is unreasonable to keep somebody in for 72 hours? I doubt it very much. I have quoted from their written recommendation to the Minister. I wonder have they said positively to the Minister that they are now satisfied that they were wrong, that they have revised their advice to the Minister and are now quite happy about 24 hours because nothing less than happiness on the part of the medical advisers in this field is adequate here. This is something about which we cannot take chances or risks. One could continue to reiterate this. There is a positive possibility <Col N="770" /> of danger to the patient and very many instances of fatal consequences. There is also a possible risk of danger to others and again plenty of instances of fatal consequences. Why should we take chances especially when medical opinion not so very long ago said that there should be 72 hours in which to observe, make up one's mind and act in the best interests of the patient and of the community?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We did meet the members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and had discussions with them. We discussed the amendment I would be prepared to make. They expressed themselves as happy in that this would go some of the way to meeting what they saw as an important area. They expressed themselves happy with that. I subsequently sent that amendment to them and they have not expressed any other view since that time. Apart from that I must ask the Deputy one thing: if it was felt by the Deputy's neighbours, friends or by somebody else that it was time for him to go in and have a little psychiatric treatment, would he not be concerned at the fact that he would have to give 72 hours notice to discharge himself? I must take that into consideration. In 1945, or whenever that other Act was drafted, 72 hours notice was seen to be necessary. I know the medical profession have progressed to the extent that that length of time is not now necessary, that length of time is not used. With modern treatment and observation methods I do not see a problem arising in this area. I am providing the 24 hours for that reason. I am very anxious that people feel free to go and have treatment and not feel trapped if and when they do so.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister has stated that following the submission of the memorandum from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Irish Division, to him, he has had an opportunity of seeing them, that he told them about his proposed amendment. According to himself they stated that was going some of the way to allaying their fears, to meet their advice. <Col N="771" /> I want to say to the Minister that I think some of the way is not far enough.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is not what the Minister said &mdash; he is improving his hand &mdash; he said that that went some of the way. In regard to the question the Minister put to me about a visit to a hospital myself, because my relatives or neighbours thought that a little rest would be good for me, I will put it to the Minister this way: some of us have, from time to time, been in hospital, not necessarily for psychiatric treatment, though some of our neighbours may think that would not do us any harm. Some of us have gone into general hospitals for observation, intending to stay there a week. The consultant, however, says &ldquo;I would like you to stay until the end of another week. I have some more tests to do on you and would like to make up my mind about your case&rdquo;. At that stage I am in good mental health and although I might want to come out to attend in the Dáil, go for a holiday, attend business, I am in a reasonably rational state of mind and will accept the consultant's advice. I will stay in the hospital for another week, although I do not want to stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the person who is a voluntary patient in a psychiatric hospital is at a disadvantage. The chief psychiatrist will say &ldquo;You are coming on nicely now but I would like a few more days to see whether we will leave you on these tablets or place you on others. I would be happy if you would stay here until the end of next week, until I am completely happy.&rdquo; I am not so well mentally at this stage and I say &ldquo;Oh no, I am away like a shot and I am not going to stay with you&rdquo;. That is the difference between the two cases. That is why I am asking the Minister to treat them differently. Not alone would the chief psychiatrist in the latter case like more time to assess the psychiatric patient, but he has doubts as to the <Col N="772" /> safety of discharging that patient. I do not know what major principle is involved. A person would not be absolutely all right in the first instance if he wanted to go in and become a patient, felt bad enough, or looked bad enough and was acting queerly enough.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is the danger. The Minister has mentioned the relatives. The man may feel bad enough to go in of his own volition, not being in the best of form, or he may be behaving badly enough for his relatives to encourage him to go in. The Minister may be sure that the public never know the symptoms which these patients who suffer from mental trouble display. These symptoms are very often confined to the notice of the wives, families and people living in the house with these people, who do not talk about them, except to doctors. Notwithstanding all that the Minister says about this being a delicate field, he will not accept the advice of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He has told me that he has spoken to them again and I accept that. He did say without qualification, in reply to this first appeal, that they said 24 hours went some way. That would be a rational thing for them to say. Twenty-four hours is better than nothing, but is not as good as 72 hours. It is likely that they would say that.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (2) (b), lines 5 and 6, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;being so resident and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the same section reads:</P>
      <P>(2) An application for a recommendation for reception of a person may be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) by a parent or guardian of that person,</P>
      <P>(b) by the spouse of that person ordinarily resident with that person, or by a brother or sister of that person being so resident and being over 18 years of age,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words that I object to there are &ldquo;being so resident&rdquo;. They are unnecessary <Col N="779" /> and unhelpful. A near relative may be living alone, may have nobody living with him and, unfortunately, these are the sort of people who usually are more inclined to need psychiatric help than people living with other people. A person could have a relative living on his or her own and the relative would know from the neighbours that all was not well and that the person would need help, and a neighbour would be the last person to sign anybody in or make a recommendation. A neighbour would not want to do that. It is the business of the relative. The neighbour will communicate with the relative and tell the relative what is going on and the relative then will make a recommendation. The deletion from the section of &ldquo;being so resident and&rdquo; would improve subsection (2) (b) enormously and immensely in a practical way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider it necessary to provide as the Deputy proposes since a brother or sister who is not ordinarily resident with the person may request an authorised officer under the provisions of subsection (2) (b) to make an application for a recommendation for reception. It is only reasonable that the person authorised to make a recommendation in this case should be a person who is living with the spouse or the brother or sister or someone else living in the house ordinarily, being so resident. The Deputy leaves the residence qualification in for the spouse for the obvious reason that husbands and wives who live apart are not always in harmony with each other. Experience suggests that the relationship between brothers and sisters, particularly when they live away, is not always cordial and close and, indeed, brothers and sisters can be a good distance away. In any event the brother or sister who is not so resident has the option of making application to an authorised officer or person.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister is beginning to have doubts about that and it is clear that the brother or sister who is not resident cannot <Col N="780" /> request an authorised officer because the subsection says: &ldquo;(d) at the request of any such parent, guardian, spouse, brother or sister&rdquo;. &ldquo;Such&rdquo; there implies that he is residing with him and if he is not residing with him he cannot call on the authorised officer. The list of people who can make application for a recommendation are &ldquo;(a) the parent or guardian of that person who need not be living with him, (b) the spouse of that person ordinarily resident with that person, (c) any brother or sister of that person being so resident and being over 18, or (d) the son or daughter of that person being over 18 years of age&rdquo;. I would argue in any case that &ldquo;brother or sister&rdquo; there when read in conjunction with subsection (2) (b) means that a brother or sister must be resident there. If a sick person is living on his own and all he has in the world is a brother or sister not living with him he is then going to be at the mercy of the authorised officer.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not want to say very much about it. I think the Minister was right to accept the amendment to section 15(1) and I am of the opinion that he should accept my amendment to section 15(2)(b) because the process of applying for a recommendation for reception only sets the machinery in motion and it does not mean that that person is really going to have a say in whether the person can be received. All it means is that he is saying to a doctor &ldquo;Would you have a look at this person and see how he is going on because my information is that he is behaving in a very queer way?&rdquo; That is all that is being done there.</P>
      <P>I would say that a brother or sister should be included. I agree with the Minister's argument that a brother or sister might act in bad faith, but so might a parent or a guardian if a daughter was getting married to somebody they did not like. Perhaps I am going back a bit too far, but they could apply for a recommendation in regard to her. The argument the Minister made could be made about others in that category. No major principal is involved here. The Minister should have another look at subsection (2)(b). I would not be surprised if he came to the conclusion that he should delete &ldquo;being so resident and&rdquo;. I strongly recommend that he should do that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;a person is suffering from mental disorder of such a degree that he should, in the interest of his own health or safety&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially this amendment arises because it was necessary after consultation to amend the criteria for recommending the detention of a patient which were set out in subsection (5) of section 19, amendment No. 16. When the Bill was originally drafted it was decided to link the necessity for the detention and unwillingness or unsuitability to accept treatment with severe mental disorder as criteria for the recommendation. Severe mental disorder was not defined because of the difficulty of getting an agreed definition. This difficulty is accepted to exist worldwide.</P>
      <P>In the consultation process which I initiated upon the circulation of the Bill I recognised that this was an area in which there would be considerable input from the medical profession and the amendment which I now propose largely follows the advice given to me by the organised medical profession and by psychiatrists who were particularly concerned in this respect that the connotation of &ldquo;severe mental disorder&rdquo; in the context of a medical recommendation should not hamper the full assimilation of a person who suffers from a condition requiring detention and treatment into society upon his discharge from hospital. The amended criteria are in accordance with contemporary thinking in psychiatry.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 33, after &ldquo;sections&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;16.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland proposes to insert &ldquo;section 16&rdquo; before sections 29 and 31 in the first line of subsection (1). Section 29 deals with transfers to hospitals and section 31 deals with transfers to psychiatric centres. Section 16 is the section under which the Garda is entitled to arrest the person for the safety of the patient or other people or property. Deputy Boland wants the subsection to read: &ldquo;Subject to sections 16, 29 and 31 it shall not be lawful to detain a person under this Act elsewhere than in a psychiatric centre designated for the area in which he ordinarily resides.&rdquo; Section 16 gives power to the Garda to take a person into custody and remove him to a Garda station. Subsection (2) provides:</P>
      <P>(2) Where a member of the Garda Síochána removes a person under this section, he shall apply forthwith in the prescribed form to a registered medical practitioner for a recommendation for reception of the person in a psychiatric centre.</P>
      <P>It is probably safer to insert section 16 into the first line of section 17(1) to take away to some extent the general right to bring a person to a psychiatric centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The placing of a potentially <Col N="786" /> dangerous and deranged person under Garda custody, as a crisis intervention measure, pending full medical examination with a view to procuring the necessary recommendation for reception, is not to be confused with the actual process of reception and subsequent legal detention in a psychiatric centre. In brief, a Garda station is not a place where psychiatrically ill persons are detained for treatment. A dangerous person is held in Garda custody for a matter of hours only as a means of protecting either the person himself or herself or the general public, pending the initiation of the reception procedure.</P>
      <P>Under section 16, as the Deputy recognised when he read through it, the Garda must apply forthwith to a doctor. Where a member of the Garda removes a person under subsection (2), he shall apply forthwith in the prescribed form to a registered medical practitioner for recommendation for reception of the person in a psychiatric centre. That covers the point that there is no question of the person being detained unduly in a Garda station. In effect, there is no particular desire on the part of the Garda in any event to detain the person.</P>

    <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 3, after &ldquo;practitioners&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(or, in a case <Col N="789" /> to which subsection (1) (b) applies, one registered medical practitioner)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The requirement that two doctors should sign the recommendation for the reception of a person in all cases proved to be a contentious provision. Nearly all of the submissions which we received on the Bill expressed unease and anxiety about the practical application of the requirements laid down in the section. The situation obtaining in some of the more sparsely populated rural areas was stressed in this regard.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, any major universal amendment to this &ldquo;two doctors provision&rdquo; would seriously undermine the position concerning safeguarding of the individual's rights with respect to the possibility of unwarranted detention in a psychiatric centre. The two doctor requirement has worked satisfactorily so far in relation to the detention of a private patient. A major amendment is, therefore, clearly undesirable. However, in order to go some way towards meeting the concern underlying the criticisms made, a highly specific amendment to the section is proposed.</P>
    <P>This amendment will simply provide the Minister with enabling powers allowing him to direct that the written recommendation of one doctor will suffice for the reception of a person into a psychiatric centre when circumstances are, in the Minister's opinion, such as to warrant such a procedure. A more general unrestricted amendment to the section would provide universal access to the one doctor procedure, and, unfortunately, as human nature tends to take the line of least resistance, one could anticipate that the ready availability of the one doctor procedure would be abused, with the one doctor situation tending to become the norm.</P>
    <P>The enabling powers in respect of the one doctor procedure could be invoked if the provisions of section 19, as drafted, were found to be causing insurmountable difficulties on the ground, in regard to either a particular category of psychiatric illness or in respect of certain areas in the country. At the same time, the body of <Col N="790" /> the section as drafted is being left intact, reflecting my determination that two doctors should sign the recommendation for reception in all but the most exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland has put down a similar amendment, No. 16e to this section. I think that Deputy Boland will, if he reflects, agree that, while I accept the intent of his amendment, expressing it statutorily in the terms he proposes would ensure that what he proposes to do, that is, to meet the abnormal situation, in the natural order of things becomes the normal and would defeat the essential purpose of certification which is to protect the individual from unnecessary detention.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I propose will permit the Minister to make regulations specifying areas or circumstances in which the recommendation of one doctor will suffice and I think that is a better course to follow.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There is no doubt but that there is a problem here. The Bill provides that a person cannot be recommended for detention unless he is certified by two doctors; but, simply and solely because there may be only one doctor easily or readily available in some areas, the Minister proposes to have different laws for different places. Obviously, that is highly undesirable. It means that if I am living in one part of Cavan I cannot be detained without a recommendation from two doctors, but if I am living in another part of the county I can be detained on the recommendation of one doctor. I do not imagine that these committals arise very often and I should like the Minister to give us the number of recommendations and the number of detention orders that are signed in any 12-month period in respect of an average mental hospital. I cannot visualise any case in which it would not be possible to obtain the opinion of a second doctor. There is no part of the country so remote as that. Mental institutions are always situated in large towns where there would be plenty of doctors so that a patient, having seen the doctor in his area, could be either taken to see another doctor en route to the mental institution or could see one in the town in which that institution is located. I am very much against the concept of different laws for different areas, especially on a topic so delicate as the one we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland's amendment is much more acceptable than the one proposed by the Minister, in which he applies subsection (1) and says that one medical practitioner will suffice.</P>
      <P>My solution would be to leave the matter to two medical practitioners and, if necessary, to find a second one on the way to the mental hospital with the patient. In no case would there be likely to be a distance of more than 20 miles within which a doctor could not be found. Deputy Boland's amendment reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9, between lines 41 and 42, <Col N="792" /> to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) Where a registered medical practitioner, being the first such registered medical practitioner to do so, signs a recommendation for reception and states in such recommendation that he is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that because of the person's state of mind it is particularly urgent that he should be transferred forthwith to a psychiatric centre, and</P>
    <P>(b) that because of the delay which would be occasioned before a second registered medical practitioner could examine the person such delay would be detrimental to the health and safety of the person or of other persons,</P>
    <P>such recommendation shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have the same effect, for a period of seventy-two hours as if it had been signed by two registered medical practitioners.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland is endeavouring to provide for detention on the basis of one medical recommendation for a period of 72 hours, whereas the Minister is going the whole way and dispensing with the second medical opinion.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the difficulty that has been highlighted is one that cannot be overcome. In any area it should be possible to get a second medical opinion within hours. Deputy Boland's amendment is well drafted and it would overcome the difficulty that has been highlighted, that is, if there is such difficulty.</P>

      <P>I agree that it is highly undesirable that there should be reference to one doctor only and that is why my amendment proposes to leave the legislation as it is and simply to make provision for a subsequent regulation if it is shown in practice that such is necessary in some circumstances. It simply means that there will be an enabling provision within the Bill but that the two-doctor recommendation should apply across the board. That situation can be considered in the light of practice subsequently. In that sense I am not dispensing with the two-doctor requirement but I <Col N="793" /> am providing a measure which will enable the Minister by regulation to designate an area or circumstances in which the requirement may be dispensed with.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am sorry. I should have noted amendment No. 13. But it is clear now that what the Minister is doing is amending section 19 by putting in a new paragraph in subsection (1) which will read:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations designate an area or prescribe the circumstancess in which the written recommendation of one registered medical practitioner shall be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, he will be saying that, if an area is sparsely populated and has only one doctor, he may say that one doctor is sufficient. If this were not such a serious matter, and to some extend such a pathetic one, it could be said that what the Minister is really doing is creating second class citizens in a very delicate area. He is saying that in one part of the country, say east Cavan, people cannot be brought to a psychiatric institution unless a recommendation is signed by two doctors, but in west Cavan a person may be brought to such an institution if <Col N="794" /> the same recommendation is signed by only one doctor.</P>
    <P>I do not think the difficulty is so great as to necessitate this discrimination. That is a word I hate to use but it is what I mean. If a patient from west Cavan were being brought to Monaghan on the recommendation of one doctor &mdash; if it were a remote part of west Cavan I agree there would have to be some travelling done to get another doctor &mdash; surely he would pass through the towns of Ballyconnel, Belturbet and other towns where there are doctors. We are not so completely isolated as all that. It might be that the person would be brought home again from the half-way house instead of being brought on, but would that not be a good thing if it were necessary? We are not that isolated in the country.</P>
    <P>That would be my solution but, under any circumstances, I would not accept the Minister's way out, which says we will leave the general situation as it is. There must be two doctors, but if it is not easy to get the second doctor the Minister will make geographical and circumstantial exceptions and do with one doctor. That is the least desirable. Deputy Boland suggests that if this crisis arises we will detain the person for 72 hours on one doctor's recommendation and after that we must get a second doctor. My personal proposal would be to leave the situation as it is. I would accept Deputy Boland's suggestion but I do not find the Minister's proposal acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am largely in agreement with the Deputy in leaving the position as it is, but because of the various representations made I am providing the means whereby if that problem appears to be a serious problem as time goes on &mdash; as several Deputies have suggested in the House and as medical people have suggested &mdash; at least within the Act there would be provision now without having to go and re-enact the measure to introduce regulations relating to that situation specifically. These could be either the circumstances or an area. Circumstances would probably cover the point made by Deputy Boland in his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept the Minister's solution, doubly so because I believe the Minister does not personally agree with that solution himself. He suggests that he is putting it forward because of representations made to him by medical and other interests. I find it difficult to see how the Minister will be able to prescribe circumstances where the recommendation of one practitioner will be sufficient because the sort of circumstances and examples that have been envisaged vary from case to case and place to place. I do not think a regulation made by a Minister will be able to cover the variety of circumstances where, because of the urgency of the situation and the danger to the health and safety of the person involved or of other people, a second doctor cannot be obtained. It is difficult to envisage that any Minister by regulation could manage to prescribe all the circumstances where that might occur. What is more likely to happen is to have a set of circumstances prescribed where in certain cases it will not be necessary at all that there should only be a single doctor and in other cases where the necessity to use a single doctor and get the person into hospital quickly will not have been covered in the regulations. It will make it very difficult for doctors &mdash; and in this case we are talking about GPs &mdash; to determine where their power lies in this matter. Realistically, I do not think you could expect every GP in the country &mdash; they are not accustomed on a day to day basis to dealing with circumstances like this &mdash; to know whether they were in a situation where their recommendation and signature alone would suffice for reception or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that the suggestion I put forward later in amendment No. 16e is a better one, where in an emergency situation a practitioner signs <Col N="796" /> a certificate because he is satisfied that the person's state of mind is such that it is particularly urgent that he should be transferred to a psychiatric centre and the doctor himself signs a statement suggesting that the delay that might be occasioned if he had to look for a second doctor might be detrimental to the health or safety of the person or of other persons and that that order would have effect for 72 hours. The suggestion contained in that amendment is that permission would be given to doctors, who I think are generally accepted as being a responsible body of people, to make temporary emergency recommendations for reception orders where they felt it urgently necessary that the person should be got to a psychiatric hospital quickly and where it was not possible to get the advice of a second doctor.</P>
    <P>I do not think this situation I envisage might occur only in remote parts of the country. You could have &mdash; it is regrettable, but it is true &mdash; especially at weekends and at night time even in urban centres a situation where a person could become violently deranged and would be a danger to himself and to the safety of other people. It could be virtually impossible at 4 o'clock in the morning during the weekend even in an urban situation to get a second GP to sign a recommendation for a reception order. In those circumstances the signing of an order by a single doctor ought to suffice so as to get the person quickly into the environment in which his condition can be best dealt with. When such a person is brought to the psychiatric centre the psychiatrist in charge of the centre has to adjudicate within a reasonable length of time on whether the person ought to be detained. I would be the last person to suggest that we should allow a situation where a doctor could sign away a person's freedom for an indefinite time.</P>
    <P>In general I agree with the principle that two doctors should be used for referral purposes. However, it should be simple for GPs to know that, if there is an emergency situation, they can sign an order to have the person referred. GPs will not abuse this. They are not the type of people who would want to use this <Col N="797" /> power and they would use it only in unusual and urgent circumstances. I have genuine reservations on how the Minister would adequately prescribe the circumstances where only one doctor would need to sign an order. With more success a Minister might be able to designate remote areas where it was likely that there would only be one doctor. But in urban areas late at night and at the weekend it may be just as difficult to get a second GP. I gather from the Minister's references that his intention to designate areas does not refer to urban areas but to remote rural areas. The Minister cannot prescribe all the circumstances, and it would be plainer to set out that in emergency circumstances, where the GP was making the signed statement that he felt the situation was an emergency and that he could not get a second doctor, one doctor could sign the temporary emergency recommendation for reception.</P>
    <P>None of the solutions is perfect, neither the Minister's nor mine. We are talking about a very sensitive area when we talk about making a person an involuntary patient. It is not a task that would be taken lightly by any individual or group of individuals, but the solution put forward in my amendment is one that a responsible medical practitioner would find more workable than having to make himself familiar with a set of regulations drafted by the Minister, a set of regulations which would have to be vague and fairly tatty at the edges and which could leave GPs in a considerable amount of doubt as to whether they were in circumstances prescribed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has prescribed several sets of circumstances, like temporary emergencies, weekend emergencies and various other examples. They can be prescribed under the regulations if they are seen to be necessary. That is why we said &ldquo;areas or circumstances&rdquo;. It is quite widely embracing. We could end up with a measure which provided in certain circumstances for that kind of reference, but one would have to specify them. I would have to have it proved to me that this was necessary. Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I am very much in favour of two doctors signing. At this stage I am providing this measure to meet the suggestions that were put during the Second Stage and by the medical profession. If it can be shown subsequently that there are circumstances, there is a measure there which will enable the Minister of the day to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my fear of the Minister prescribing circumstances. Once the Minister prescribes ten sets of circumstances that means that he excludes the eleventh, the twelfth and so on. No human being could prescribe every conceivable circumstance in which it might be necessary for only one doctor to sign the order. Once the Minister tries to make regulations which prescribe circumstances he will eliminate certain circumstances by not including them in the regulations. There is no way in which any Minister with advice from the best experts can possible prescribe the circumstances in which a doctor might find himself unable to get a second signature when he knows in his heart and soul and because of his experience and training that the person urgently needs to be brought into a psychiatric centre. That is why the suggestion of the Minister making regulations will be unworkable. I am suggesting not just a personal viewpoint but the view of people whose daily occupation is the practice of psychiatry in a number of our most eminent psychiatric centres. If they do not believe that the situation outlined by the Minister will be entirely workable there ought to have been more heed paid to their representations than there appears to have been.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because I am advised that there are seriously disturbing psychiatric conditions involving danger to patients and families in which it would be unwise to accept the patient's own word that he would undergo treatment voluntarily.

In many cases such patients are no sooner in hospital than they are looking to get out, thus interrupting treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the practitioner making a recommendation for a person to become an involuntary patient. In the recommendation for reception the practitioner would have to certify that the person was suffering from severe mental disorder; secondly, that his detention and treatment were necessary in the interests of the person's health or safety; and thirdly, that the person was not prepared to accept treatment &mdash; in other words, that the person was not prepared to accept voluntary treatment. If the practitioner by virtue of subsection (5) (b) (ii) certifies he is satisfied that the detention and treatment of a patient is necessary he should not have to certify again, as set out in subsection. (5) (b) (iii), that the person is not suitable for treatment as a voluntary patient because he has already done this. It appears to be unnecessary and questionable as to why it is inserted in subsection (5) (b) (iii) that the practioner should have to make the same statement as was made in the preceding sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the medical profession have reservations on this point. If a GP has to sign an order stating that a person is not suitable for treatment as a voluntary patient, this may prove a deterrent so far as some doctors are concerned. I give as an example a situation of a GP who has been a medical doctor in a small <Col N="802" /> community for many years or the case of a practitioner who has been the family doctor for the patient concerned. We know that doctors will be loathe to sign such orders because they will be forced to certify certain matters &mdash; that the patient is suffering from severe mental disorder and needs to be detained and treated. It has been represented to me that a GP will baulk at the idea of being forced to put on a certificate that the fact that he now certifies his neighbour is not suitable for treatment as a voluntary patient. The provision appears to be superfluous and it could cause administrative and other difficulties for doctors in the context of dealing with their patients in the local community.</P>

The fact that the patient is not prepared to accept treatment is covered by subsection (5) (b) (iii) and that provision would still exist if my amendment were accepted. In other words, the doctor has to certify that the patient is not prepared to accept treatment. The suggestion is the doctor will not be prepared to certify that the patient is not suitable for treatment as a voluntary patient. It is an odious enough task to ask a doctor to sign an order stating that a patient needs to be detained for treatment, but it has been represented to me that a doctor will not be prepared to sign a statement stating that the patient is not suitable for treatment.</P>

      <P>It is only where the doctor recognises the patient is not suitable for treatment in the first place that that will arise. Otherwise he does not have to put that down.

Subsection (6) states that the doctor should notify the person concerned of his intention to make a recommendation.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17a.</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 49, to delete &ldquo;the medical officer in charge of the centre&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the chief executive officer of the health board in whose area that centre is&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section, as it stands, leaves the onus on the medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre to provide an escort for a patient to bring him into the centre if he himself does not co-operate in being brought in after a recommendation for reception has been signed. The situation will be that where two doctors sign a recommendation for reception, two doctors in the community say: we think this person is in need of treatment in a psychiatric centre, and where one of those doctors says: we think this person is in <Col N="806" /> such a state that he may be a danger to himself or possibly to other people, we think that he needs to be escorted from his home, or wherever he may be, to the centre, the onus will be on the doctor in charge of that hospital to find an escort, send that escort out to collect the patient and bring him into the hospital. It has been suggested to me that in practice this will be unworkable. We all know the situation obtaining in relation to gardaí and all the rest is fairly unhappy even as it is. The feeling is that the onus should not be on a medical man in charge of a centre to have to arrange these escorts.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my two amendments is to place the burden of arranging for the escort on the senior public official of the health board in that area, in other words, the chief executive officer of that health board. That is the purpose of each of those amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to accept this amendment. The escort will be provided by the hospital. In my view the medical officer in charge of the hospital is the appropriate person to initiate this procedure. Apart from anything else the medical officer would have the clinical judgment to initiate procedures. To provide as the Deputy requires would be to interfere with the long established lines of authority and responsibility obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to miss the point. The medical officer in charge having the clinical judgment does not arise under the Minister's section, as drafted; the clinical judgment of the medical officer in charge does not enter into it. If one of the general practitioners out in the field who signs the recommendation for a reception order says that, in his opinion, an escort is necessary, that is it. The clinical judgment of the doctor in the hospital does not enter into it. It is the professional judgment of the general practitioner out in the field perhaps some 30 miles away &mdash; and this is one of the reasons that the doctors in charge of the hospitals find this type of suggestion so repugnant, because they are talking about a patient whom they have not seen, about whom they know nothing. They <Col N="807" /> are merely notified that some doctor out there, whom they may never have met, has certified that an escort is necessary for some patient way out there. The clinical judgment of the doctor in the hospital does not come into it. That doctor in the hospital may not even know the general practitioner out in the field, never mind the patient. But the onus is on him to find an escort for that patient, collect him and bring him in. The suggestion is that, because there is no medical, clinical judgment involved, it is a question of administration, that the burden should be on the administrative personnel of the health board rather than on the clinical directors of the psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical officer is the chief person in charge in the hospital and is the person who would be most competent to judge who should be sent, what will be necessary when an escort is sent, what level of escort is necessary, what sort of people should go to take care of the patient. The medical officer would be in a better position to judge any of these elements, especially since the potential patient is coming to his institution, rather than bring in somebody who could be described as an administrator and who would certainly be much further removed from the scene in that respect.</P>

      <P>Obviously I think the suggestion in my amendment, administratively, would be better. I went to the trouble, before tabling these amendments, of discussing this with personnel with experience of the operation of the present system. The view I have put forward is not merely mine but that of the personnel in the field, including the medical directors of a number of these hospitals. They feel that it would be better for the executive officer of the health board to carry out this task rather than themselves. As the Minister has told us earlier, the representatives of the psychiatrists also had discussions with the Minister. I presume that they put their points of view to him and that he apparently did not accept them.</P>

        <Col N="808" /> It would appear that the chief medical officer of the institution which have been asked to accept the patient would not know anything about the patient until he actually arrives there. He will take over when the patient is delivered to him. Deputy Boland is probably correct that it should be a matter for the health board of the area to get the patient into the institution and then hand him over to the chief medical officer.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy. It is not as simple as that.

There does not appear to be any onus upon the Garda to provide an escort, except under section 21 (3) where it says that the Garda Síochána shall, if so requested, arrange for the escort. It was suggested that the onus should be clearly placed upon the Garda by the substitution of the word &ldquo;provide&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;arrange&rdquo; in section 21 (3).</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Subsection (3) is badly drafted, anyway. I have never heard, or seen, it <Col N="809" /> stated that the Garda Síochána would arrange something or the Garda Síochána would do something. The usual thing to say is that something shall be provided by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or a Superintendent of the Garda Síochána, in whose district the patient resides. &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; is a very loose term. I have never seen that kind of loose description when we are trying to say that some member of the Garda Síochána will be responsible for something. Invariably, the rank in question is specified and it should be specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at that point. As far as amendment No. 17c is concerned, the word &ldquo;arrange&rdquo; was deliberately chosen to impose a clear obligation on the Garda Síochána to make all the arrangements necessary to escort the person concerned to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In clarification, there may have been a mistake, probably on my part, in the submission of the amendment. The amendment ought to have provided for the deletion of the words &ldquo;arrange for&rdquo; and their substitution by the word &ldquo;provide&rdquo;. The subsection would now read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána, shall, if so requested, provide the escort.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not provide for the escort. If you take subsections (2) and (3) together, it would appear that in a certain case where the doctor in a hospital says &ldquo;I think we need the guards to bring this patient into the hospital&rdquo;, and the section says that he may, if he thinks it necessary, request assistance of the Garda in arranging an escort and the next subsection says that the Garda shall arrange for the escort, the purpose of the two subsections could be thwarted if the Garda in a particular case said that this was a rather repugnant task which was being given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two subsections will not place the onus on the Garda to provide a Garda escort. They probably intend to do that, but they do not. They put an onus on the Garda Síochána to arrange for the escort. If the Garda do not, for any reason, want <Col N="810" /> to provide an escort &mdash; and I am given to understand that, quite understandably, the Garda very often at present are very loathe to provide escorts in these cases &mdash; this is one of the difficulties which can arise when a potentially violent patient needs to be transferred urgently to hospital. The effect of the amendment if it had appeared in the list of amendments in the way I originally intended, would have been that subsection (3) would clearly make the Garda Síochána provide the escort and a member of the Garda Síochána be the escort, rather than at present the Garda being obliged to arrange for the escort, which might not necessarily be a member of the Garda Síochána at all.</P>
    <P>Obviously, subsection (21) (2) envisages that the doctor in charge of the hospital will ask for a Garda escort and will presumably expect that a Garda would be the escort. Subsection (21) (3) as it stands does not, in effect, implement that. That was the reason for the amendment. Perhaps the Minister would, in the light of what I have said, consider that aspect?</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (4), line 8, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and the registered medical practitioners who signed the recommendation for reception and the nearest living relative of the person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Up to this, we have been dealing with the GPs making recommendations for reception orders. This is the vehicle which should be used to have the involuntary patient brought into the hospital for assessment. Section 24 sets out the form of the reception order, that is the order which would be made by the doctor within the hospital which would provide for the person to be held in the hospital for a period not exceeding 28 days from the date of his or her admission.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) says:</P>
      <P>Where a reception order or extension order is made in respect of a person in any centre the medical officer in charge of the centre shall forthwith inform the person and the applicant for the reception of the person of that fact, of the reason for the extension and of his right to a review under section 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is interesting in the light of the earlier amendment which the Minister has accepted, that in this subsection the person involved is to be informed and, reasonably enough, the person who originally applied to have the patient referred to hospital is also to be informed of the fact that the reception order has been <Col N="812" /> made or the reason for the extension order, and, indeed, of the patient's right to a review, which is a very important right, by the Tribunal of the detention order under section 38, which we will come to later.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment would be to notify also the two GPs who signed the recommendation for reception. This patient could not come into the hospital in the first case unless these two doctors out in the community signed an order referring the patient to the hospital for assessment and possible detention over a long time within the hospital. It is reasonable that not only should the patient be notified that he is now going to be held in the hospital for a month, or that an order has been made for his detention in the hospital for some longer period and that the applicant who went to the GP in the community in the first place and asked that the patient be referred to the hospital should be notified; also the two GPs signing the order, because it is a very onerous obligation on any doctor from the point of view of signing a recommendation in the first instance to send a patient in in a voluntary capacity. If the hospital decides to detain the patient and lock him up for a month or a longer period then the two GPs who signed the initial order should also be informed. They should also be informed if the patient is later on discharged. It could be that a patient might harbour feelings of resentment against those who had been involved in the distasteful process of having the patient referred and forcibly detained. Not only should the applicant for reception be informed but so also should the two doctors involved in signing the certificate putting the machinery into operation. Likewise the nearest living relative of the patient should be informed.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following new subsection: &ldquo;(3) The boarding out of a person shall only take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) when it has been recommended by the authorised medical practitioner caring for and treating such person,</P>
      <P>(b) when the authorised medical practitioner certifies that the person does not require in-patient services in the psychiatric centre and is not a danger to the health and safety of himself or of other persons.</P>
      <P>(c) if such a person is a person in respect of whom a reception or extension order is in force, after the applicant for reception and the registered medical practitioners who signed the recommendation for reception and the nearest living relative of the person have been notified&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a patient is to be boarded out the doctor in charge of the hospital should sign a certificate saying that the person does not require continuous in-patient treatment and will not be a danger either to the health and safety of himself or to others in the community. This boarding out process was also provided in the 1945 Act. It is a very desirable process because it is designed to reinstate the patient in the community but there must be some <Col N="815" /> safeguards. Two doctors sign a recommendation for a reception order and the patient goes perhaps under some protest into hospital, is examined there within 48 hours and two other doctors, qualified consultant psychiatrists, have to sign an order to keep him in hospital for 28 days. In the case of boarded-out patients we can assume that before the 28 days expires two other doctors or the same two doctors will sign the extension order. In most cases patients have been detained in care at least a number of months before they were boarded out. A lot of legal safeguards and steps are provided in the different sections of this Bill and if it comes to the stage &mdash; although a reception order is still in force in relation to him, in other words two consultant psychiatrists have said that this patient needs to be detained in hospital in their opinion &mdash; that that patient then is let out into the community, you need first of all a qualified consultant psychiatrist to say that it will not be a danger to the health or safety of this patient or of his neighbours and the people he associates with if he goes out into the community. That is the reason for parts (a) and (b) of my amendment.</P>
    <P>The reason for part (c) is that the doctors who originally signed the recommendation for reception are going to be notified that the patient is being held in hospital and so also will the applicant who originally went to those doctors. For some reason a lot of examples have been given around the county of Cavan here today. If the local GP from, say, Arva is strolling down the main street in Cavan town and discovers suddenly some client for whom he signed a recommendation for reception order about two months earlier coming down the street, serving him in a shop and so forth, it is going to be a fair surprise for that GP, and also the applicant and the relations. Therefore, it seems fairly sensible that if the stage is going to be reached in the treatment of a patient where he will be allowed to be boarded out, the people who originally participated in the process of boarding him in permanently should be told of the situation.</P>

      <P>Section 26 provides for the making of regulations governing the boarding out of persons undergoing care in the psychiatric centres. Of course, not all of these would be detained patients. The provisions which the Deputy seeks to make are more appropriate for inclusion in the regulations and I will bear them in mind in drawing up such regulations.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This idea of boarding out mentally ill people is a comparatively recent innovation which I think is a move in the right direction towards rehabilitation of people in the community. I agree with it fully, but I suggest that when selecting houses &mdash; usually houses are taken over by the health boards and people go and reside in them &mdash; health boards should be careful in selecting these houses where they select them. They should not select them in local authority housing estates because, first of all, there is a great demand for houses among the local community and there are usually a number of applicants for every house that is built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not really accept that this is more appropriate to regulations than to legislation. I accept what the Minister says. In fact, he justifies a point that I made earlier on Second Stage, that the vast bulk of people receiving psychiatric treatment are being treated in a voluntary capacity. The Minister may say, &ldquo;OK, this section in relation to boarding out will apply in the main to people who are there in a voluntary capacity&rdquo; but if they are there in a voluntary capacity you do not have to put a section into the Bill saying that they can be boarded out. They boarded themselves in voluntarily, so they can just agree to participate in the boarding-out arrangements. You do not put in a section to say that power will be given to the health boards to make <Col N="817" /> boarding-out arrangements. If the people are in the hospitals in a voluntary capacity then they themselves can voluntarily enter into an arrangement with their doctor and the health board to be boarded out into the community.</P>
      <P>The real reason for a section like section 26 is so that you can board out those who otherwise are locked up. Consequently, you need to define clearly in section 26 that a person who is locked up on foot of a reception or extension order is to be allowed out into the community. It is not good enough to provide for it in regulations because under the rest of this Bill that patient is legally obliged to be detained in a psychiatric centre on foot of the extension or reception order in force at that time signed by the authorised medical practitioners. If you want to envisage any situation where that patient who legally should be within that hospital confines is to be out in the community, that needs to be defined in the legislation also. It is not appropriate to try to define it in regulations. Anyone picking up this Bill afterwards and reading it is going to ask himself the question that I ask, how can somebody be boarded out and be free to participate in the life of the community if at the same time a consultant psychiatrist has signed an order saying that in his opinion that person should be detained within a hospital? If you want to do it in the way that the Minister suggests, then the consultant psychiatrist needs to sign an order saying that the reception or extension order no longer needs to be in force. You cannot have it two ways. You cannot have an order in existence signed by a qualified consultant psychiatrist which says that the person in his own interest needs to be locked up in hospital while at the same time the person is out walking the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable to say that over the years we will get at least one incident where somebody who is boarded out will behave irresponsibly and possibly will do something injurious to himself or to others. On the law of averages that is bound to happen even with the maximum care possible and possibly the situation will be ambiguous. If an order signed by a consultant <Col N="818" /> psychiatrist is in force at that time that means that this person should be locked up, and yet the person is out in the community. For instance, supposing a patient in respect of whom an order says he should, in his own interest, be locked up in a psychiatric hospital to receive treatment, steps out underneath a bus and is killed, are his relations not entitled to ask what he was doing out there anyway, when there is a certificate in existence which says that he should be detained in hospital? There is nothing in this Bill that will explain how it is that he is out in the community. The Minister on behalf of his successors as well as himself is taking on far too much in regulations under section 26 to suggest that the cancellation of the reception order would be provided for under ministerial regulations, or if not, that, the orders made by the consultant psychiatrist would be temporarily placed in cold storage.</P>
    <P>My amendment spells out quite reasonably that the boarding out will only take place when it has been recommended by the authorised medical practitioner caring for and treating the person, and when the authorised medical practitioner certifies that the person does not require in-patient services in the psychiatric centre and is not a danger to the health and safety of himself or of any other person.</P>
    <P>It is entirely reasonable that that should be enshrined in the legislation to make the situation crystal clear for the consultant psychiatrists, for the staff of the hospital, and for the staff in the homes to which the patients might be boarded out. It does not suffice to provide for that in regulations. It needs very definitely to be enshrined in the legislation that the doctors who originally signed the order referring the person into the hospital for examination should be notified if that person is being discharged, even on a temporary basis, back into the community. It is especially reasonable when you think of instances where people were discharged from psychiatric hospitals and their relatives and those involved in having them referred to the hospital were not aware of it. When such people arrive home suddenly and unexpectedly <Col N="819" /> that could lead to unhappy and tragic consequences. For that reason the legislation and not the regulations should spell out clearly what needs to be done.</P>

      <P>Section 28 provides for permitted absences. The medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre and the authorised medical practitioner with specific responsibility for the care of a particular person detained in the centre may permit the person to be absent from the centre for a period or an extended period amounting to less than the unexpired number of days provided for in the current detention order. This is a matter for the judgment of the medical officers in charge. That is covered within the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>Under the existing legislation a health board may board out a patient detained in one of their institutions. In practice very few patients are boarded out, but it is considered desirable to continue to give power to the health board to do so. The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Illness recommended that there should be a properly supervised system of what is called family care for the mentally ill. The provision in this section provides a broad statutory basis to enable the boarding out of any suitable mentally ill or mentally handicapped person. It is considered that the details of the boarding out procedures and safeguards would be more appropriately dealt with by regulations.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree with rehabilitating people in the community rather than in institutions when they are suitable for boarding out. Health boards should be careful in selecting houses in which to board out these patients. I do not think it is desirable that they should be boarded out in a house acquired in a local authority housing estate. There is great demand for these houses by local people. Usually there are three or four applicants for <Col N="820" /> every house. Resentment is created against the health board and the occupants for the time being.</P>
      <P>These houses are occupied by patients who are boarded out for some months and then they are vacant for another few months. That continues the local resentment. The health boards should be more selective about where they choose these boarding out houses. The community in general should accept these patients into their localities as boarded out patients.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where any person&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii) is absent, as permitted by section 28, from a psychiatric centre.</P>
    <P>(iii) has been removed from a psychiatric centre for treatment or for the benefit of his health,</P>
    <P>to escape or leave the place where he is maintained while boarded-out, absent as permitted by section 28, being treated or for the benefit of his health or</P>
    <P>(c) harbours or conceals a person who has so escaped</P>
    <P>such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the Court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 28 is the section which permits absence by a patient from hospital with the consent of the officers in charge of the hospital. It says that he may be brought back if he exceeds his parole. The amendment proposes to make it an offence for anybody to assist or encourage a patient to absent himself from the institution. If the patient may be apprehended and brought back, it is obvious that anybody who encourages him to stay away or assists him to stay away is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>In the new section being proposed a special psychiatric centre is mentioned. I understand that the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is such a psychiatric centre.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not yet an accepatance in rural Ireland of psychiatric hospitals as everyday institutions but we are well on the way to their being accepted as such. It is still something of a traumatic experience in rural Ireland to find that it is necessary to send a relative to a psychiatric institution. <Col N="826" /> If, instead of treating a patient at place A it is decided that he is to be treated at place B which may be 25 miles away, the least his relatives might expect would be a notification to that effect from the hospital. Without provision for such notification, the first a relative might know of a patient's transfer would be when he had been seen by someone miles away form the institution at which he was detained in the first place. In such circumstances the relative would be forgiven for thinking that the patient had escaped.

A problem arises in that relatives generally, as we know from recorded facts and from surveys, do not visit patients in such institutions. I hope that we are fast approaching the time when this situation will be changed.

There are exceptions and there are long-stay patients who have gradually lost touch with their people but by and large near relatives keep in touch with their mentally-ill relatives in hospitals and visit them frequently. I wish that the Minister would acquaint himself more with the situation. It is not right that it should go out from here that nobody visits mentally-ill patients.</P>

    <P>It would not be a very big job to send a letter to the next-of-kin of a patient informing them of his transfer. In the event of the death of a patient, the next-of-kin would be notified. It could hardly be regarded as imposing too great an administrative task on the staff of hospitals to draft a simple form to the effect <Col N="827" /> that So-and-So was being allowed out of hospital and would be residing at such a place until further notice. I have witnessed uproar in this House and among the community about people being detained by the Garda without their relatives being informed of where they were being detained. The Minister's reaction to this reasonable suggestion of ours makes one despair of democracy and of improving legislation even in a simple way in this House. In the event of a patient being transferred or being allowed out into the community for rehabilitation purposes his next-of-kin should be so notified. It would suffice if, say, a relative visited the patient some days prior to the change and was so notified but in other cases relatives should be notified by post.</P>

    <P>Instead of the words &ldquo;nearest living relative&rdquo; I would prefer to use the words &ldquo;the next-of-kin&rdquo; as notified to the institution. I would not be too particular regarding the medical practitioner in this sense. However, I despair of the Minister accepting this reasonable request just as I despair of his giving us any rational reason for not accepting it. Surely relatives are entitled to know where their sick relations are. If a person is in a county hospital in provincial Ireland and is being transferred to Dublin, if it is in an acute hospital in the country, he will be told. Why have a change here? Really what we are doing is handing these patients into the custody of the chief medical officer or chief psychiatrist and leaving everything to his mercy. We are prescribing many things here. Why not prescribe that?</P>

      <P>The section makes it clear that where a patient is being transferred to a psychiatric centre it will be because it is considered to be in his own interest. This is another instance where we must assume that the psychiatrist concerned will consider all the circumstances including the views and attitudes of relatives and any others closely concerned with his welfare. I should not like unduly to impede him in his judgment or actions in this respect. As it stands, the applicant will be consulted. Certainly, I would be prepared to consider an amendment for the Report Stage including the two registered medical practitioners &mdash; taking that part in &mdash;&ldquo;the applicant and the registered medical practitioners who signed the recommendation for reception&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(a) the applicant for the reception of the person in the district or psychiatric centre,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section provides for the transfer of patients to special psychiatric centres, in other words to Dundrum. Deputy Boland's amendment proposes to delete section 31 (3) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>the applicant for the recommendation for reception in pursuance of which he is detained, where the application was made under paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (g) of section 15 (2)</P>
      <P>and to substitute</P>

      <P>It reads at the moment that before the person is transferred, the review board shall give at least seven days' notice of its direction to that person and to the applicant for the recommendation for reception in pursuance of which he is detained.

I do not deem it necessary to notify them and for this reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.

      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where the medical officer in charge of the centre in which the person is detained makes a recommendation under subsection (1) of this section and further states in such recommendation that he is satisfied &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that because of the person's state of mind it is particularly urgent that he should be transferred without delay to a special psychiatric centre and</P>
      <P>(b) that because of the delay which would be occasioned through the provisions of subsections (2) to (5) of this section such delay would be detrimental to the health and safety of the person or of other persons,</P>
      <P>the review board shall forthwith arrange for the examination of that person by two independent authorised medical practitioners, to be selected from a panel to be nominated for such purpose from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, following examination by the authorised medical practitioners, such practitioners sign a certificate concurring with the views of the medical officer <Col N="834" /> in charge the person shall forthwith be temporarily transferred to a special psychiatric centre on foot of such certificate but only for such period as is necessary to allow the provisions of subsections (2) to (5) to occur.</P>
    <P>(7) The certificate authorising the temporary transfer and signed by the two authorised medical practitioners shall be known as the &lsquo;emergency temporary transfer order&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(8) Immediately upon the review board arranging for the examination of the person under subsection (6) of this section the board shall notify &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the applicant for reception,</P>

    <P>(c) the nearest living relative of the person</P>
    <P>and such persons shall have the same rights under this subsection as under subsection (5).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious that when a person is being transferred to a special psychiatric centre it is because he has become difficult to handle, to put it mildly, difficult to control and possibly dangerous to himself and others. The purpose of Deputy Boland's amendment is to facilitate the speedy transfer of the person without the necessity of going through the provisions laid down in subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) as a temporary measure only. If it was a matter of extreme necessity and the advice of three consultants had not been obtained, it would be the two authorised medical practitioners and the medical officer in charge of the board. This is a practical and well thought out amendment. It is a facilitating amendment and it could do a lot of good.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael fully support the independent wholesalers and retailers in their fight to prevent an even greater proportion of the nation's food distributing industry falling into the hands of a few companies. We are very concerned at recent trends in the food retailing trade, trends which if they are allowed to continue unchecked will lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few companies. Let there be no mistake about it. The law of the jungle, where the strong kill the weak, has been operating, is operating and will continue to operate in the Irish food retailing sector unless corrective action of the type recommended in this Bill is taken.</P>
      <P>The law of the jungle is operating in this area. We have seen the advent of powerful multinational combines, backed by unlimited finance, entering the Irish retail market. These multinational operators are prepared to invest a considerable amount of money at the initial stage and they engage in all kinds of shady practices such as low-cost selling and so on in order to get a foothold in the market. They are prepared to lose money, and can afford to do so, while they are penetrating the market. At the same time they are putting out of business or are putting at risk many thousands of independent retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be a cause of concern to anyone interested in the economic and social life of the country that 8,000 independent grocers have been forced to close in the past decade. This figure represents 50 per cent of the number of independent grocers a decade ago. Unless remedial action is taken on the lines set out in this Bill, it is clear that the independent grocers will be completely wiped out in another decade. I want to make it clear that Fine Gael are determined to prevent that happening. We are convinced there must be some restriction on the unbridled expansion of multiple outlets, particularly the multinationals. Strict measures will have to be taken if we are to prevent further <Col N="839" /> catastrophic losses of jobs and the livelihood of many people.</P>
    <P>In addition to the closure of small businesses there are other implications. The trend in the grocery trade has serious implications for the Irish food processing and manufacturing sector. We must face facts. The growth of multinationals inevitably will lead to an increase in food imports and recent figures available indicate a frightening increase in the food products being imported. From the evidence available to me and from reports I have read, I have no doubt that the multinational multiples are contributing to a significant degree to the increase in food imports. Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, did not agree that the growth of the multinational multiples had a significant bearing on the increase in food imports but I totally disagree with him. There is ample evidence that the growth in the multiples has led to an increase in food imports, with consequent disastrous results for the Irish food processing industry.</P>
    <P>We are not seeking a total prohibition on the opening of new grocery outlets or the extension of existing outlets. We are seeking to ensure that before any such developments take place criteria are laid down that will take account of the common good and the likely effects on existing outlets. Those criteria are spelled out in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to subsection (4) (a), the Minister shall, in prescribing the conditions to be specified in a licence, in relation to a 20 mile radius of the location of the proposed retail outlet, having regard to the following:</P>
    <P>(a) the distribution of population;</P>
    <P>(b) the adequacy of existing retail grocery outlets to service the community;</P>
    <P>(c) the likely effect on the trade of the existing retail grocery outlets;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(d) the likely effect on employment in that area.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill we are merely bringing Ireland into line with many of <Col N="840" /> our EEC partner countries, France, Italy, Germany and Holland, who have all recognised the need, in the interests of the common good, to keep a close check on the growth of large scale grocery outlets.</P>
    <P>For example, in relation to the situation in Britain, in 1977 the British Government, through their Department of the Environment, published a Development Control Policy Note No. 13 on the subject of Large New Stores. That note set out the current ministerial policy and aimed at giving general guidelines to all those concerned in the operation of planning control. The policy note was published because of the Department's concern at the uncontrolled growth of supermarket development and the consequent effect on the environment and on existing shopping facilities.</P>
    <P>Planning Development in France is controlled by the Commission in Charge of Commercial Town Planning. That commission lays down rules, regulations and criteria, somewhat similar to the criteria laid down in Deputy O'Toole's Bill, to ensure ordinary growth and development and to avoid the type of cut-throat competition and the law of the jungle that has been operating in this country.</P>
    <P>In Italy, the opening of grocery stores is controlled by licence and in recent years very few licences have been issued. In this Bill Deputy O'Toole is proposing a licensing system.</P>
    <P>In Germany applications for planning permission for developments exceeding 1,500 square meters is required under a special law there, which law is administered by the local chambers of commerce. As is the case in Holland and elsewhere, the commercial implications of the development, the community implications of any proposed new developments, the existing services and facilities, are all taken into account. In Holland authorisation for superstore development must be obtained according to the general law on opening stores. That law is administered locally and permission is granted only in areas specifically zoned for supermarket development.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that many of our European partners have recognised <Col N="841" /> the need, in the interest of the common good, to keep a close check on the growth of large grocery outlets. In this country we have not done so yet. We in the Fine Gael Party have been most concerned about this situation. Indeed it was after careful examination of the situation and of all its implications that it was felt timely that a Bill of the kind Deputy O'Toole has introduced be brought forth urgently.</P>
    <P>I greatly deplore the totally unrealistic response of the Government to this Bill. The response to which I refer is that revealed in the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in the House last evening. I believe that speech clearly reflects the lack of understanding and the amazing, inflexibility of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, on this whole question. The speech of the Minister of State last evening was remarkable for its prevarications and double-thinking. First of all, the Minister of State did admit that a problem existed but he endeavoured to convey that it was not as great as we on this side of the House seemed to think. Finally, he resorted to the typical ministerial evasive subterfuge, in that he said he had decided to have the problem properly examined. It is a wonder he did not announce he was engaging McKinsey to carry out this examination.</P>
    <P>Whatever examination is carried out the end result will be exactly the same. The case for a Bill of the kind we have before the House will be clearly established. The Minister knows this as well as I do, so why waste more time on unnecessary examination of what is a factual situation? The Minister should have the courage to admit that the only answer to the problems of the Irish grocery trade is the forming of legislation to ensure the orderly control of the growth and development of the grocery trade and, most important of all, in the context of this small country, with galloping inflation and appalling unemployment, it must be legislation ensuring the survival of the 9,000 independent businesses daily being placed in greater jeopardy by the uncontrolled growth and development of the powerful multinationals. Many of our EEC partners have recognised the need, <Col N="842" /> in the interests of the common good, to keep a close check on the growth of large-scale grocery outlets. It is high time the Irish Government did likewise.</P>
    <P>With due respect to the Minister, I believe he has made a grave mistake in rejecting out of hand the proposals contained in Deputy O'Toole's Bill. I believe this Bill will stand the test of time. This Bill has been carefully framed and can be defended by reference to similar legislation in most of our EEC partner countries. The views of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, are well known, as is his inflexibility on this and many other matters. I believe that whatever examination the Government carry out it will reveal the validity of and the need for the Bill put before the House by Deputy O'Toole. I ask the Minister in all sincerity, before the conclusion of this debate, to have a re-think, and to accept the validity of and the need for a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>Last week when we had some visitors to the Dáil representing the suffering parties we were all very impressed by their case and sympathised with the problems they are experiencing. From the comments of the Minister of State last evening, it would appear that he does accept a problem obtains. The last speaker put this across very vociferously; that is his job in Opposition, and it probably highlights the difference between having to look at both sides of the coin or just one side without caring about the other. While the small retailers have a problem which must be dealt with there also happens to be many consumers who probable have not enough money to pay for it. The last speaker, and some other last evening, seemed to ignore totally that there happened to be consumers who must pay for these things. It is the responsibility of government to think of both sides while it is the job of Opposition, in advancing an argument, to put forward one side. As far as that goes the last speaker was very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem did not commence last week or last year. The figures given by the Minister of State last evening illustrated the massive decline there was in 1966-67, part of the time when the parties <Col N="843" /> opposite were in power and when perhaps the same problems existed. Price cutting went on in the fifties, sixties and seventies, during the period when the first Commission on Restrictive Trade Practices was established to examine the problem. This did not happen just last week, as some people listening to the debate may think and it will not stop next week. To say that the reason for so many retail shops closing down around the country is strong competition is to give only part of the story. Times have changed in every way, and so have consumers and the industry generally &mdash; probably because of pre-packaging and the fact that people like big shops, big pubs, big halls, everything big &mdash; so the small shops went out of business for a lot of these reasons.</P>
    <P>In the part of Dublin which I represent, those shops which changed with the times, extending their premises, have survived. That has not happened in all cases, but some have managed to hold their own alongside some of the bigger supermarkets. They may have to open earlier, close later and open at weekends, but they have matched the competition from the larger outlets in some way. Many reviews under the Fair Trade and the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts over the years have looked at all the problems and the reasons for these things happening. They have continually changed the various Acts to suit the times. The Minister accepts that there is a problem. He said that there would be an inquiry, the terms of reference of which have to be set, to again look into all aspects of supply and distribution in the grocery trade. Surely this is better than taking a hurried action which might be regretted in the long run?</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's speech last night, the people in 1955 said that the report of the Fair Trade Commission concluded that price competition at retail level would be beneficial to the public and recommended that individual and collective action designed to ensure the maintenance of retail prices should therefore be prohibited. In Deputy O'Toole's Bill, it is the other way around. It wants <Col N="844" /> to prohibit open competition. Perhaps the people in 1955 were wrong and perhaps Deputy O'Toole was wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that if there is price cutting now on one aspect according to Deputy O'Toole that causes a big problem. What people in the shops say is that they see one or two items below cost but the overall cost of the goods is not changing very much. In a lot of cases under-price selling does not exist at all. That it exists in some cases, but not to the extent put forward, is what consumers are continually saying. Deputy O'Toole knows, as well as all of us, that consumers are concerned about the cost of goods. If they can get one or two items below cost which they use in great bulk in their homes, they will go to those shops. That seems to be a fair practice, which Deputy O'Toole may accept.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough. There is and has been over the years control under the current legislation. Manufacturers can block or refuse to supply to multinational companies or large concerns if they sell under the invoice price. This does not rule out totally under-invoice price selling, but goes part of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why try to curtail only the five large <Col N="845" /> supermarkets, perhaps unnecessarily? Perhaps, as other countries have found, it will be necessary in future to bring in extra curtailment on them. The Minister has not ruled this out altogether. He wants to have all the aspects examined and not to hurry into anything.</P>
    <P>Recently, in Galway, the Minister for the Environment was looking at the position in relation to one of the large companies opening new premises there. There was a consumers' revolt, at the idea that this shop should not be allowed to open. I agree as much as anyone that multinationals and monopolies should not be allowed in future years to join together, crucifying the consumer. If I thought that that would happen and that further necessary regulations would not come into effect, I would agree with Deputy O'Toole, but I do not think that that is the position. There are controls which can be and have been implemented. The Minister has said that these controls will again be looked into and that an inquiry will take place to see what has to be done now.</P>
    <P>At present, five shops in Dublin have about 70 per cent of the trade and to try to limit these at this stage would seem almost impossible. Even if one can do that under the monopolies legislation, it is not what the consumers want. Nobody wants to see the small retail shops being totally eliminated and we must accept that a number have closed down for different reasons. The consumers have been responsible, with their various changes in attitudes, for closing down many of the shops. Some people may have retired or have gone out of the business voluntarily, but a lot want to continue to provide a good service. Everyone accepts that the small retail shops around the city and in rural Ireland provide an excellent service. Protection must be given to the 10,000 &mdash; or 9,000 as somebody said &mdash; of these shops. The Minister has said that in the inquiry this will be looked at again.</P>
    <P>The Opposition must do their duty and the Government must do theirs. There are points on both sides. It is the Government's job to set up the inquiry and see that it is carried on in a proper manner, <Col N="846" /> as has been done in the last 20 or 25 years. Some Deputies said last week, and again this week, that consumers would be in favour of RGDATA and the other groups. However, the only statement which I have seen was from the Irish Housewives' Association, who did not agree with any legislation which would have a restrictive effect on fair and open competition. They appeared to support the idea of the big supermarkets but there must be controls to ensure that there is not a short-term gain.</P>
    <P>The banks were more competitive before they all joined together under the one umbrella and had their own standing committees looking into their dealings with their customers. Legislation could learn from that, that once these big concerns get together and the small people say that this is a great thing, they turn around and close doors and make it almost prohibitive to have a bank account. Supermarkets should not be allowed to act similarly. Other countries have faced this problem. The Fair Trade Commission have been acting for 25 years and must have learned a lot about the grocery trade. There have been numerous inquiries since their foundation and there is a lot of experience within the Department. When the Commission meet again, having gone over the subject thoroughly and knowing what is going on in other countries and, in particular, across the water in the UK, they can bring in or change legislation to keep ahead of the times. There is a great to-do about a situation which is not all that bad.</P>
    <P>In support of Deputy O'Toole's view, because I do not totally disagree with him, the terms of inquiry should be set out immediately and the Commission must do whatever they consider necessary. Anyone who wishes can put in a submission and in that way ensure open and public debate and that the best interests of the small retailer and the consumers will be considered in the ensuing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Labour Party have discussed the general situation on three separate occasions. We had the advance copy of Deputy <Col N="847" /> O'Toole's Private Members' Bill. We carefully considered the situation and decided that, on balance, the Bill was worthy of support. The reason I use the term &ldquo;on balance&rdquo; is because many of our Labour Party local authority members questioned whether or not it would have been better to have planning development legislation amended by introducing new commercial criteria, particularly with regard to zoning. On the other hand, there was the contention that it should perhaps be done at ministerial level. That was the main ground of discussion rather than anything inhibiting support of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We came down in favour of the Minister exercising his power. I shared that view as a member of a local authority, currently chairman of the largest local authority in the country, an authority catering for a population of roughly 450,000 people, namely, Dublin county. It would be extraordinarily difficult at a county council meeting to decide whether or not the particular criteria in a licence application met all the requisite planning and development criteria. It is true that local authorities have specific zoned areas and planning applications can legitimately be refused on grounds of density, change of use, inadequacy or otherwise of the road network, over-intensification of use and so on. Nevertheless local authorities would have great difficulty in trying to assess matters of a quasi-judicial statutory nature, such as whether or not existing retail grocery outlets adequately serve the community. We concluded that there should be a separate section in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism which would deal with the granting of trading licences. The possibility is that the Department might inevitably have to consult with local authorities but it was our view that responsibility should rest with the Minister under statute because of the scale of development. There would not be in any one year a multiplicity of licence applications coming before the Department. In the case of the grocery trade licensing would arise only where the area exceeds 5,000 square feet. On balance, then, we came down in <Col N="848" /> favour of the Minister having devolved on him that particular responsibility. For that reason we regard the Bill as warranted.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of argument down the years on the question of development, be it housing development, industrial development, grocery trade development or any other development. There has to be planning and we have to have criteria governing that planning in order to ensure a balance. There is great difficulty sometimes in achieving a proper balance from the point of view of the freedom of the individual, his freedom to trade, freedom to own property, freedom to move from one area to another without injuring his neighbour, his community or the community at large in terms of the State itself. That balance is a very difficult balance to keep but it is a balance we have always favoured. That is why our authority consistently calls for the introduction of planning and development legislation and other socially advantageous legislation in the national interest. We believe in the need for controls and we favour their introduction, be they in relation to wholesaling, retailing, licensed premises, sale of petrol, or any thing else. We see the need for these controls and the community will have to face the fact that controls in the retail grocery trade would be in the common good. They would be warranted. There may be a jaundiced bureaucratic reaction in the Department to the effect that this is a residue of what was known as the special position in the Constitution or in legislation. There is a great element of special pleading in the arguments put forward. This was the pattern in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s and now at the commencement of the 1980s but the whole structure of what I might call the retail culture has changed quite dramatically and this type of Bill is warranted now in the common good.</P>
    <P>The President of RGDATA, Mr. Foster, gave adequate notice to the Minister on 4 February last when he spoke about the unchecked growth of the multiple chains, and in particular the multinationals, and the extravagant claims of a number of very transient entrepreneurs which <Col N="849" /> had led to a series of detrimental malpractices not in the interests of the common good. That was a reasonable observation, and the pressures will be on this Government and the next &mdash; whatever complexion the next Government will have we do not know yet &mdash; to take these what Mr. Foster correctly called corrective measures operating in other countries which would shape the control of the growth of the multiple chains in the State. That is a logical and reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>I have read the unrevised verbatim report of the detailed contributions last evening and reading the Minister's contribution, particularly the reference to the prospect of a further inquiry, I must confess that I am totally jaundiced at such a prospect. We have had order after order in the past 25 years without achieving a successful or effective framework for competition in this sector. It is no wonder that the grocery suppliers and most of the distributive trade at this stage have very little confidence, I regret to say, in either the examiner or the RPC or, for that matter, in the Minister. I see no useful purpose whatsoever being served by a decision to hold yet a further inquiry. Yesterday I complained very strongly in the House that it took three years to produce the inquiry on motor spirits, and God forbid that one should have to speculate on how long it would take to complete a new inquiry looking presumably at all aspects of the grocery trade, especially the unequal power relationships that exist within it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not have made that announcement. It was provocative and it has come as no surprise to me at least that RGDATA, the independent retailers' representative body, and IADT who represent grocery wholesalers and their customers, have stated today that both of these organisations have decided not to participate in the forthcoming public inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission on the problems in the grocery trade. I think it was reasonable comment on their part although it was stated in extreme terms by the representative organisations. As I know well, having worked in that area for nearly 15 years, <Col N="850" /> representative organisations invariably state their cases in trenchant terms, but the statement issued today by the spokesmen for both organisations said that the proposed inquiry was a sham and an attempt to sidetrack the real issues in the grocery trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take note of the fact that this statement went on to say that they are not prepared to waste their time and money on yet another public inquiry into the grocery trade, that all the information required by the Minister to make an informed decision on the problems of the trade are well known to him and yet he is insisting on going ahead with another costly and time-wasting public inquiry. Therefore, this is a serious statement on the part of these organisations and in it they have indicated also that they do not intend to make submissions. Naturally, we all appreciate that any organisation called before a public inquiry can be subpoenaed to attend and have no option but to attend, but they are not necessarily obliged to present witnesses formally, to have counsel representing them at that stage or to make written submissions unless formally subpoenaed to present such evidence, as I remember from some inquiries. I gather this is the general intention of the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have to say to the Minister that this is an understandable and extreme reaction because there is always the argument that, no matter what a Government do, one should keep plugging away. However, undoubtedly there can come a time when, to use the classic phrase, no further useful purpose can be served by indulging in that form of inquiry. Therefore, the Minister should take very careful note of the decision of these organisations not to so participate.</P>
    <P>I found it rather ironic that yesterday afternoon we spent several hours here with the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, debating the role of the retail petrol outlets and proposing the order in the Bill which was debated here at considerable length in detail. It is ironic that this Bill endorsed very closely the recommendations in the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission about <Col N="851" /> which I complained so bitterly. I wonder what the hell the Restrictive Practices Commission were up to for the three years that they did not require to come up with the earth-shattering conclusion that there should be a restriction in the public interest in relation to outlets for retail petrol. Anyway, at long last they did come up with that and, as Deputy O'Toole said rightly last evening, the report did indicate that the restriction was in the public interest because &ldquo;the overall share of the retail market held by the petrol companies would be much greater with the undesirable result of increased rigidity in the market and the danger of restrictive or discriminatory practices&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The general principles are there and there is nothing ideologically difficult for the Minister to so debate and introduce amended legislation. Such legislation would need to be drafted very carefully. The longer I am in this House the more I see that legislation being present can be riddled with constitutional difficulties, particularly since we have a Constitution which enshrines in such great strength the freedom of the individual. While I share the view that the individual's freedom should have absolute constitutional protection, the sections of our Constitution which allude to trading relationships and the right to trade in commodities on a free and independent basis, there would need to be great care in the drafting of such legislation so that half a dozen constitutional actions would not be launched against it and the legislation brought into disrepute. It is well within the competence of the parliamentary draftsman and the Restrictive Practices Commission &mdash; not that I would give them the responsibility for drafting the legislation &mdash; to devise an effective Bill.</P>
    <P>I have been in Holland, Italy, France and Britain. Only last week I was in the Hague. I spent two or three days there. I chatted with various parliamentary colleagues in the Dutch Parliament. I saw several retailing controls in operation. I have seen them in operation in France, particularly in the Alsace region. I have not got much knowledge about other <Col N="852" /> areas in France. In the past seven years I went to that region five or six times as an Irish delegate to the Council of Europe and I had the opportunity to see what happens there. Lest my fellow Deputies should think that I indulge in undue travelling, I can assure them that I do not. I was in Britain quite recently. My trip had nothing to do with retailing controls. It had to do with methods of refuse disposal. My county council colleagues and I went to Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. We saw the policy guidelines from the Department in operation in those areas.</P>
    <P>There are 100 members of the South Yorkshire County Council which covers a catchment area of over one million people. I felt a particular affinity with them because there are something like 82 Labour members out of the 100 councillors. The chairman of the environment committee and other committees were able to tell me that these controls and criteria are in operation and, by and large, they work for the common good. There is no proliferation of multinational stores in those areas. There is adequate legislation available to the Minister on which he could draft a Bill, provided that he wants to introduce his own Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains the prohibition on selling below net invoice price. I am glad to see that. I am also glad to see the RPC report. The Minister's decision on below cost selling was made on 3 March 1981. I do not know what the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, was doing during the Christmas holidays. He has had this report since last November. I am sure it did not comprise the best part of his Christmas reading. However, he should have dealt with the report earlier on.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on the State-Sponsored Bodies and in the past couple of years we have produced 17 reports. We work on a part-time basis. We have a staff of four. We have not got Departments at our disposal. We sit in Leinster House and we are able to get through that kind of work. The RPC and the Minister decided to do nothing to change the regulations governing competition in the grocery trade and they <Col N="853" /> decided not to ban below cost selling. A decision to hold an inquiry was taken in July 1979.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 of the report makes it clear that the problem of unequal power relationship, that is, the very high concentration in the retailing sector with just a few multiples in operation, was well known. It is difficult to understand why the RPC should take 18 months to decide to do nothing. It is harder to fathom why the Minister should now decide to have a new inquiry into features of the trade which were common knowledge when the previous inquiry was set up.</P>
    <P>It took three years for the motor spirits inquiry to be completed and, judging by that fact, it is unlikely that this completely unnecessary new inquiry will be completed before the late eighties. The RPC said they have been studying the grocery trade and producing order after order for the past 25 years without achieving a successful or effective framework for competition. It is no wonder that everyone is jaundiced.</P>
    <P>The question in relation to below cost selling is the significance of its impact. I regret to say that the RPC report is very uneven. Much time was devoted to consideration of the impact of cut-throat pricing on the reduction in the total number of independent grocery outlets. The opinions of those knowledgeable in the trade by and large were rejected in the report. On the other hand, below cost selling and its effects on the consumer are handled very briefly in the report. It is a very unbalanced report.</P>
    <P>There was an acceptance of the view of the Irish Housewives Association, although that view is the exact opposite to the view the IHA put before the previous grocery inquiry. I say that with great deference to my colleagues in the IHA whom I have known over the years. More striking is the fact that the effect of below cost selling on the multiples was handled in just one brief paragraph in the report. The inquiry revealed that a minority only of the multiples favoured below-cost selling. Apparently the majority did not like the practice but were forced into using it in order to keep <Col N="854" /> pace with the few who chose to indulge in it. That highly significant fact is not discussed at all in the report.</P>
    <P>I do not know how it could take from July 1979 to date to do that. I suppose it is related in some way to the fact that there are now only five or six major multiples in the country and that the levels of profitability in the grocery trade have diminished alarmingly, especially in the food sector where they are extremely low. Below cost selling has ensured that a number of companies will lose. I said this before and I was hit over the head by one multiple. If this type of nonsense goes on the multiples will lose; the consumer will lose; the retail independent grocers will not just go out of business; they will be hanged, drawn and quartered and put out of business and the consumer will lose quite considerably.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that my comments might not be very acceptable to some people but nevertheless I support this aspect of the Bill. I do not know who the editor is of the paper I have here, but it is suggested in one of those publications that I have jumped on this particular bandwagon. There were some derogatory comments about the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy. This is a reprint of a Fine Gael newspaper. I received the late Mr. MacGowan from Blackrock in this House in 1970. I had many a garrulous, fruitful, interesting and very long discussion over the years with him. This is not a bandwagon I am interested in jumping on but one which at the moment is rolling in the direction of a cliff.</P>
    <P>The Government should give this Bill very careful consideration. Between now and next Tuesday the Government should consider putting down some amendments. I would even go so far as to say that I would be prepared to sit down, despite the pressure, on an all-party committee to discuss this subject. I would even concede that the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, should take the chair. We could receive evidence from different people as a Select Committee of the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, covered a lot of ground last night and no doubt most of it was controversial. The Minister's authority seems to run right across Deputy O'Tooles Bill. It runs right across many of the things contained in the Planning Acts. It puts an added burden on many people who want to set up in business. It was agreed by all parties that An Bord Pleanála would be the authority in relation to all planning applications, but in this Bill introduced by Deputy O'Toole the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; seems to be the determining factor in everything. Whether one wants to set up an outlet in a rural area or in an urban area, it is the Minister who at all times would have a say in it. That is a great weakness in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We have been discussing this matter on and off for many years. Many people have tried to get a complete all-round solution but they have not been able to do so. Governments have come and governments have gone and this has been with us for the last 20 years. It flares up, it dies down and it flares up again. The Minister of State last night covered a matter which is often referred to, that it would be against the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign to accept this Bill.</P>
      <P>Many people have been worried that the so-called price war would lead to an increased volume of imported food products, but investigations have shown that has not really occurred. It has been noticed of late that the relationship between the manufacturers and the importers has greatly improved. That will please everybody because we all know that once the chips are down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will be seen that there is ample scope for action to deal with the problem of imports without resorting to the introduction of controls over the operation of types of retail outlets who are accused of being largely responsible for the high level of imports. As regards the implications which often have been mentioned of foreign ownership of some multiples, there has been a suggestion that the controls proposed in the Bill are necessary to curtail development by those companies. It is suggested that this is possible only because of the availability of external finance which allows either subsidisation of price cutting campaigns to enhance the success of developments, or direct subsidisation of expansion.</P>
      <P>In this connection it is interesting to recall the comments of the Restrictive Practices Commission in the recently published report on below cost selling. The people on that commission are of standing and experience. They stated in relation to one of those multiples that they found nothing in that company's accounts to suggest any element of subsidisation from outside the Irish operation. That was a very strong statement to make and it refutes any suggestions made otherwise. In the case of the second company, they rejected a suggestion that their pricing policy was subsidised from funds from abroad and stated that their stores had throughout attained a trading profit. If any Deputy on the other side has anything to say to the contrary he knows where to telephone his information and where to make his submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, it is not considered that the present circumstances of the manufacturing and distributive sectors are such as to warrant, without the most exhaustive investigations to determine the interests of the common good, the types of controls <Col N="857" /> envisaged in the Bill. The main objectives of the Bill appear to be that no group of enterprises between three and five in number should have an aggregate market share in excess of 45 per cent and no enterprise should have more than a 20 per cent share of the grocery market in any one year. The Bill states that the Minister should use his powers under section 2 of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies Control Act, 1978, to break up an enterprise whose market share exceeds 20 per cent in any year. The Bill also provides that all retail grocery outlets whose area exceeds 5,000 square feet should be licensed and that all outlets owned by an enterprise which has a market share of 5 per cent, irrespective of size, should be licensed, and below cost selling should be prohibited.</P>

      <P>It has been said that this Bill must be regarded as being very radical. <Col N="862" /> We see its implications for everybody, for retailers and consumers alike. So far as retailers are concerned their ability to develop and expand to meet a consumer demand would be seriously impaired by the proposed legislation. There is nothing in the Bill to indicate how the Minister would deal with the matter. Is it envisaged that he would set up a commission or a group of inspectors for the purpose of the legislation? Legislation of the type proposed could affect adversely the competitiveness of the retailer by interfering with his ability to increase through-put and, consequently, to effect cost savings. While the controls would affect adversely the multinationals in the main, they would apply also to the independent sector. Given the market share in sections 2 and 5, the greatest impact would be on the multiple chains.</P>
      <P>Regarding the consumer interest, particularly in the provinces, it would appear that the proposal would have a significant impact. By and large, these consumers do not seem to have benefited to the same extent as the consumer in our main cities who have had the advantage of benefiting from the larger units. Such advantages would include access to parking facilities convenient to one-stop parking, access to a larger range of goods and benefits derived from economies achieved by the larger units and resulting in lower prices. It would seem that the rural consumer would have grounds for claiming that he was unfairly discriminated against as compared with his fellow consumer who would continue to enjoy the advantages he has at present in this regard. We have recently seen firm evidence to this effect in Galway &mdash; surely Deputies know what I am talking about &mdash; where a strong consumer lobby objected quite strenuously to efforts by other interested parties to have a proposed shopping complex prohibited. This was highlighted in the papers and the margins for and against were reported and showed the trend in people's thinking.</P>

This action could only be justified if there was evidence that the common good was gravely at risk. Such evidence does not appear to exist and in its absence I would not agree with the imposition of the control proposed. Naturally, Fine Gael are doing their best to gain whatever advantage they can at this time but the Bill they have brought in has many loopholes in it. We have been pointing them out one by one. I note that section 2 (1) provides that no three or more enterprises not exceeding five shall have more than a 45 per cent control ... in the retail grocery market in any year. The Bill does not provide what would happen if this figure is exceeded.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (1) which enables the Minister to break up an enterprise applies only where an enterprise has more than 20 per cent of the market. It may be that it is envisaged that some formula would be included as a condition in the licence to be issued by the Minister under section 4(2), that it is a condition of the licence that it would be revoked if sales from the outlet in question contribute towards an aggregate figure including returns from other enterprises which would constitute a breach of another section, section 2(1). There is no point in going over all of these and making points on them. If such were the case it would be difficult to decide which licence of which enterprise should be revoked. Such circumstances must surely be regarded as constituting intolerable conditions under which enterprises might be expected to operate.</P>
      <P>Likewise it is difficult to see how the Minister might exercise his powers under section 3(1)(b) if an enterprise had a market share just short of the 20 per cent allowed by section 2(2) and it is proposed to open a new outlet and a licence is sought. The Minister does not appear to be enabled to refuse to grant such a licence. In fact he would be required to grant a licence and yet the licence, it would appear, must contain such conditions as would render the enterprise unable to operate the new outlet.</P>

The main control would appear therefore to be contained in the conditions attached to a licence, but there is no indication of the type of conditions envisaged.

      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, to provide in effect that an order under section 8 of that Act should be made within three months of the relevant report by the commission. That is something I could not accept. This presumably is an implied criticism of the delay in making the recent Restrictive Practices Grocery Order, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is absolutely correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be noted in this connection that the delay involved in that case was not very much more than the three-month period now proposed. Notwithstanding this it must be recognised that most, if not all reports of inquiries furnished by the commission to the Minister are not of a type which allow of immediate action and decision by the Minister. As the House is aware, the Minister is required by the Act not alone to consider the report but also to satisfy himself that if it is proposed to make an order it is warranted by the exigencies of the common good. Such requirement necessitates that the most exhaustive <Col N="866" /> examination of the report is effected to ensure that as far as possible the proper decision is taken. That is for the common good; I think everybody is worried about that. If a Minister found that the three-month period were shortly to expire, he might find himself forced into making a decision because of this constraint which in more favourable circumstances might not have been taken.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the drafting of orders can be a difficult matter &mdash; nobody knows more about that than parliamentarians &mdash; and may, on occasion, give rise to considerations of constitutionality. An order could be ruled by the courts to be unconstitutional and declared invalid because of some defect which arose from the time constraint. Not alone would such a situation be undesirable but it would seem that because a valid order was not made within the three-month period specified, the Minister would be unable to make a proper order without requiring the commission to hold a further inquiry and submit a further report on the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposal in section 7 of the Bill that the selling of grocery goods below cost should be prohibited immediately, the Minister has already indicated and I indicated in a statement in the past week, the reasons why it should not be prohibited. There seems to be no reason why that view should be altered at present and accordingly the Bill is being opposed.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, we are opposed to the proposals in the Bill and regard it as constituting such an interference with long-held belief in freedom to trade as being justifiable only if it is clearly demonstrated that there is at present grave danger to the common good which could only at best be remedied by action of the type proposed. This has not been so demonstrated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1977 a scheme existed for the recruitment of Air Corps cadets for training as pilots. At present suitable junior Army officers are selected for training as pilots on being commissioned. Three officers are expected to qualify as pilots under this scheme later this year and it is also intended to commence the training <Col N="739" /> of additional officers as pilots shortly. I consider that this is the best method for the recruitment and training of pilots for the particular requirements of the Air Corps. It is not intended to recruit direct entry pilots for the Corps.</P>
    <P>As I stated on 19 February last in reply to another question from the Deputy, crews for the helicopters which it is proposed to acquire for operation from the new design fishery surveillance vessels will be drawn from the Air Corps. I am satisfied that there will be sufficient trained Air Corps personnel available to operate the helicopters when they enter service.</P>
    <P>I consider that the pay and conditions of officers in the Air Corps are sufficiently attractive to encourage recruitment and retention of pilots.</P>
    <P>There are 56 pilots in the Air Corps at present. There were 49 pilots in the Air Corps on 1 June 1977 and 15 cadets or officers were undergoing training as pilots on the same date. A further 24 cadets or officers have commenced training since then. Of the intake of 39 trainee pilots, 23 qualified as pilots and three more are expected to qualify later this year. Sixteen pilots left the Air Corps since 1 June 1977.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 February 1976 and was paid from 21 February 1976, <Col N="747" /> fourth day of incapacity, to 14 January 1980. Payment was refused after that date following his examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He appealed against the decision to disallow payment, and, in this connection, was again examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. The decision to disallow payment was upheld by an appeals officer on 22 May 1980.</P>
      <P>He continued to furnish medical evidence of incapacity to my Department after that date but the disallowance of payment was continued. He appealed against the decision to disallow payment and was examined on 13 August 1980 and was found to be incapable of work from that date. His claim was accordingly admitted for payment from 13 August 1980 and he has been paid regularly each week to date.</P>
      <P>He subsequently requested that the period 14 January 1980 to 12 August 1980, for which payment had been disallowed, be again referred to an appeals officer for determination. An oral hearing of the case was held on 11 December 1980 and the appeals officer subsequently decided on the evidence before him that he was not incapable of work for the period concerned and that he was not entitled to be paid disability benefit. There are, therefore, no arrears of benefit due to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are encouraged to provide developed private sites which qualify for subsidy and which are primarily intended for tenants of local authority houses, applicants on approved housing lists, co-operative societies etc., who are given every incentive to acquire these sites. While, I understand that the provision of such sites forms an integral part of Donegal County Council's housing programme, they have no current proposals to provide these developments in seaside districts as the high cost of land is proving prohibitive at present. In recent years, two schemes of private site development at Stranorlar and Ballyshannon comprising 49 and 68 sites respectively have been completed while schemes of about 140 additional sites at Donegal Town, Lifford, Raphoe and Killybegs are at present at planning stage.</P>
