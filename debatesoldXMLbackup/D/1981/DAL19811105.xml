  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited Bill," RHead="1981: Second and Subsequent Stages">
    <Title>Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited Bill, 1981    [Seanad]:    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited were set up by my predecessor under the Companies Acts in April 1981. They have an authorised share capital of 100 shares of £1 each of which two £1 shares are fully paid and which are held in trust for the Minister for Finance.  The primary function of the company is to obtain funds from the private sector, either by borrowing or leasing, to help finance telecommunications development. This is in furtherance of the policy of encouraging private participation in investment in infrastructural services with a view to reducing the central Government borrowing requirement.  The company are expected to obtain up to £100 million of the £221.8 million required for the telecommunications development programme in 1981.  The intention is that the money will be invested in assets required for the approved telecommunications development programme, the assets being leased back to the Department by Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd.  The raising of money by the company depends on any borrowing or leasing arrangements they propose to enter into being guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance may issue such guarantees only if he is statutorily empowered to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide the necessary enabling power for <Col N="1350" /> the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing or leasing by the company as no such statutory authority exists in the case of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited at present.  The existing company are in law an ordinary private company with a share capital of £100.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Bill at a very early date is necessary if Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. are to complete negotiations for the raising of almost £100 million in sufficient time to help finance the 1981 telecommunications development programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one.  Virtually all of the provisions in it appear in other legislation dealing with State-sponsored companies. Sections 6 and 7 provide statutory authority for the Minister for Finance to guarantee approved borrowing and leasing by the company and provide that borrowing and leasing by the company will require the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Posts and Telegraphs. There is nothing novel in this.  In the case of the vast majority of State-sponsored bodies there are legislative provisions of this kind.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is standard.  It deals with definitions of terms used in the Bill.  The Minister for Finance may take up shares in the company, under section 2; dispose of shares as he thinks fit, under section 3; exercise the normal rights of a shareholder, under section 4; and he must pay any dividends received into the Exchequer in accordance with section 5. The company are prohibited under section 9 from issuing shares in the company except with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Posts and Telegraphs. These are standard features in legislation dealing with a State-sponsored company where the Minister for Finance holds shares in the company.  There is no intention of selling shares in the company to private interests.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that any alteration in the memorandum and articles of association is subject to ministerial consent. This is also a standard provision.  It provides a statutory backing for the existing provision in the company's memorandum of association that a change requires ministerial consent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> Section 10 requires the submission of audited annual accounts and a report by the company which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Section 11 contains the usual prohibition on Members of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities from being directors of the company or working for the company while they are Members.  In order to preclude any Exchequer subvention for the company section 12 requires the company to meet their costs from operations.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 13 provides for exemption from stamp duty in the case of property vested in the company.  Section 14 provides that the costs of administering the Bill will be borne by the Exchequer and section 15 contains the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Irish Telecommunications Investment Ltd. will operate as an independent entity under this Bill as enacted until a State-sponsored body for telecommunications are set up under legislation, the draft of which I expect to introduce in the Oireachtas during this session.  This draft legislation will provide that the ownership of Irish Telecommunications Investment Ltd. will be vested in Bord Telecom Éireann &mdash; the new telecommunications company.  The intention is that this will also be a wholly State-owned company. They will take over all the assets and liabilities of the investment company. Bord Telecom Éireann will then be responsible for arranging the financing of the development of telecommunications services.  The board may decide that Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. should retain their separate identity as a wholly-owned subsidiary or that they should be would up and the work performed directly by the board.  However, this would be a matter primarily for decision by the board.</P>
    <P>In any event, the draft legislation setting up Bord Telecom Éireann will provide for repeal of this Bill, if enacted. The legislation dealing with the setting up of Bord Telecom Éireann will also apply to any subsidiaries of the board. Accordingly, whether Irish Telecommunications <Col N="1352" /> Investments Ltd. are retained as a subsidiary of Bord Telecom Éireann or are wound up, the financial activities of the board will be subject to the legislation dealing with the reorganisation of the telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is essential that this Bill should be enacted at a very early date so that Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. will be able to complete their negotiations in sufficient time to enable them to help finance the continuation of the 1981 telecommunications development programme.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to inhibit the scope of this debate, I would be greatful if Deputies would agree to leave over until another time general issues related to the telecommunications service.  The service was considered in detail when the Telecommunications Capital Bill, 1981 was before the Dáil earlier in the year.  A further opportunity to debate policy and development plans for telecommunications will be available when the Bill dealing with reorganisation of the postal and telecommunications services is introduced later during the current session.  I commend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial reaction to this Bill, when circulated, was one of surprise in that I am quite sure the Minister is fully aware of and has encouraged the same legal arguments and had the same sort of discussion as I had as to its necessity in the first place.  Indeed the same sort of discussion arose at the time of the setting up of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited in April of this year.  The important thing is that we ensure that we take the speediest road possible.  There is the old saying that doctors differ and patients die.  I am sure there has been eminent legal advice advanced on both sides of the argument just as we had in April last.  However, it is important to ensure that the patient of telecommunications in Ireland does not die.  I shall not go into the other arguments in any great detail here today because I did so in April.  However, a different view prevailed at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Government and Minister <Col N="1353" /> feel it necessary to bring this Bill before the House they can be assured of our full support on its speedy passage. Time is now of the essence.  I am fully appreciative of the urgent necessity for this Bill for the financing of the development programme of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I shall not go into the arguments as to why the Bill should or should not be introduced now; they have been debated many times before.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that this Bill, if enacted, will be repealed when the major legislation being prepared comes before the House.  We have precedents for this kind of operation in Irish Steel and the national oil corporation, for instance.  It is important that this Bill be passed speedily in order that there can be this £100 million injection by way of private investment.  A private company was set up last April in pursuance of Fianna Fáil policy to encourage private sector investment in the national development of our infrastructure, mainly roads and telecommunications.  I am delighted to see that the Government so far have been pursuing that policy, though I clearly recall that when it was mooted here Deputies from the opposite side, some of them now Cabinet members, did not express any great faith in this type of policy.  Deputy Kelly, particularly thought it was purely a fraudulent approach and he suggested a sum of only £20 million being available from the private sector.</P>
    <P>This policy was based on the knowledge of the previous Government that there was room for private sector investment in infrastructural development. Such a programme requires all the investment possible and this is a sensible way to do it.  Heretofore the Department responsible for telecommunications could work on a year-to-year basis only and therefore their planning was restricted.  The Department suffered many times from the strong hand of the Department of Finance.  Financial stringency was the order of the day at that time.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil then proposed a five-year plan and I am glad to see that this is being <Col N="1354" /> followed up by the Government.  Side by side with programme planning for development there must be financial planning and it must not be strictly on a year-to-year basis because without proper financial planning we cannot go out and acquire the 550 sites that are required for this programme, we cannot plan for the execution of the programme, there cannot be pre-ordering of stores and the erection of the required exchanges cannot be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>That type of planning was not possible heretofore.  I have always believed that in this field particularly there is scope for investment diversification.  Financial people throughout the country used to say that if money for telecommunications were taken from the private sector it would be depriving other sectors of investment.  I am sure that most if not all of the £100 million needed for this programme is there, awaiting the passing of this Bill.  That money was available when I left office and I do not think matters have changed drastically since.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why it is sensible to pursue policies of this kind.  Since we joined the EMS and become subject to exchange controls there is more money here for investment.  Of course we would be naive if we thought that all the money made here is invested here.  Some Irish money turns up abroad, but with the introduction of exchange control more money became available here and the setting up of the telecommunications body earlier this year provided an opening for this investment.  The Bill enables the Minister for Finance to give a State guarantee for such investment, whether the money will be made available through borrowing or leasing.  This is the right course to pursue and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <P>There are people who argue we should not be going along this road.  It is clear that the Bill before us is only an interim measure, a temporary vehicle by which a development programme can be got under way so that we will not have to await the budget every year to ensure that finances will be available.  We appreciate that there are financial and economic problems and that they will be <Col N="1355" /> here for some time.  We are witnessing a total restructuring of national economies because of the two oil crises: the wealth of the western world has been transferred to eastern countries and in this atmosphere it is right that we should use the opportunity we have to develop our infrastructure so that we will eradicate all the inadequacies from which we have been suffering.</P>
    <P>We could debate the subject of telecommunications for months but we on this side do not propose to do so.  For the reasons I have been giving, we want to see this Bill get a speedy passage because in these days telecommunications are not only of economic but of social benefit to our people.  Telephones have become part of our lives.  Families with members in America, England and elsewhere like to keep in touch with them and consequently the domestic demand for telephones continues.  We have had an imbalance in regional development because some regions have inadequate communications systems, which renders them less competitive.  Industrialists are reluctant to move into remote parts of the country until the communications services are improved in them.  It is vital for anybody setting up industries, particularly industries manufacturing export goods, to have proper telecommunications. We live by our exports and therefore it has become vital that the faults and the gaps in our system be corrected rapidly.  The stop-go policy has been pursued for too long and without a long-term commitment to finance, long-term planning cannot be done.  I am not pointing the finger of blame in any direction because I was there and know for myself. The country will owe a deep debt of gratitude to those involved when this programme is finished.  The intense efforts and real commitment to the job which I experienced in my short time as Minister are a real credit to those in the Department. I know the co-ordination and planning that went on.  I know the bureaucratic problems there were with trying to overlap one Department with another. However, those problems were overcome <Col N="1356" /> in relation to this programme with monthly meetings and full reporting procedures. The staff are to be complimented on the way they set targets and the way they have been kept.  At the end of 1984 hopefully this country will be able to boast of a telecommunications services up to and surpassing many such services in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The programme and the money injected into the economy as a result of it creates considerable spin-offs throughout the economy.  It is clear from the Central Bank report that had public capital investment not been at the level it was the growth rate would have been considerably less and there would have been less activity in the economy.  I can never accept putting parts of a programme back, because it is wasting the initial investment and not bringing it forward on time, which is bad business.  The Department of Finance put no cost on time.  They say they will carry parts of a programme over until the next year not realising that the cost may have escalated by 20 per cent and that the completion of the programme will be delayed.  That is a foolish argument especially in the area of telecommunications where there is a big market and customers are knocking on the door with their money in their hands for a telephone, telex and so on.  It makes good sense to get the programme done as quickly as possible.  It is important to introduce new technology as quickly as possible because with that comes a range of services which the public and business sector demand.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the computerisation of directory inquiries would have been on stream at this stage.  I know it was affected by an industrial dispute in the summer but hopefully we will have it soon so as to give relief to distraught operators trying to operate an ineffective service with old and outdated equipment and who are in the front line carrying the brunt of the public's outrage when they cannot get calls to the remoter parts of the country.  When we look at France and see what they did from 1974 to 1981 using the same technology as we have it will be realised that this job can be done and if the motivation and momentum that was <Col N="1357" /> built up in the Department is continued it will be done.  It is a major challenge to the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister is committed to having legislation to split up the Department. I know the legislation will be expensive but it is a step in the right direction.  We will be taking out of the civil service the operation of a commercial venture which will be remunerative in years to come and satisfy the demands of industry, commerce and the social demands of the people.  It will be a great plus in the marketing strategy of the IDA as they try to bring more foreign investment here.</P>
    <P>This programme made its impact on the job situation.  We held exhibitions informing manufacturers of the opportunity it held out for them.  We are all interested in seeing that most of the money is spent in Ireland.  It is a massive amount of money by any standards.  No other country is spending £221 million on telephone development this year.  I know it will cost more next year but that is the peak point in the programme and it will taper off then.</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests to ensure that there is the same commitment from this Government as we had because this is one way we can contribute to the serious balance of payments deficit.  It will open up job opportunities for young people. Training centres should be developed.  I know that arrangements were made to train people abroad.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will let me know when the new digital exchange in his own town will be opened.  I do not want to see Kells, County Meath, getting ahead of Longford-Westmeath in the digital race. It is a milestone in the telecommunications system here.  I am surprised the exchange has not been opened and if it is delayed for much longer Kells might beat us to it.</P>
    <P>There is nothing contentious about the Bill.  There is a provision about the memorandum and articles not being changed without the consent of the Minister.  At first glance I thought this was unnecessary but when one realises we are dealing with public funds and so on, if it was felt it was necessary there is no harm in having it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> I hope when the State give guarantees about borrowing or leasing money it will not give double security.  Financial institutions are greedy and love to be secured two or three times over.  I hope we will not give them mortgages or debentures on our buildings or exchanges.  There is a State guarantee and, if that is not good enough for them, then they should be told clearly that that is as far as it can go. Recently financial houses and institutions have been looking for double and treble security on their pound of flesh.  This is a State company and I would have thought that in those circumstances financial institutions would not ask for a guarantee. Apparently they have done so.  If it were a case of foreign investment I could understand the request for a State guarantee but I cannot understand it in the case of domestic financial institutions.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect that worries me. There have been reports in the newspapers and elsewhere with regard to cutbacks in the Department.  Surely there is some contradiction here.  We have an investment of £21 million in development this year.  I sincerely hope long-term planning in this particular sphere will not be affected by cutbacks.  Are building contracts being pushed back?  Is it true there will be cuts of some 20 or 30 per cent in these contracts?  I hope the Minister will allay my fears in this regard.  I listened attentively to the Minister for Finance last July when he talked about a ban on recruitment in the public service.  I understood such a ban would not apply in the productive sector.  I hope that is still the situation and that there will be no cheeseparing on staff in the productive sector. One could understand a ban on recruitment in the non-productive sector.  There is at the moment a shortage of jointing staff in the productive sector.  It is a problem this year and it will be a problem next year.  I was very well aware of the shortage of staff in certain areas.  This is staff where time is of the essence from the point of view of training and I hope the Minister will allay my fears about cutbacks in such staff.</P>
    <P>If public finance cannot be made available then investment companies should be invited to do the job.  Remember, <Col N="1359" /> when financial strictures were applied in the past there were situations in which the equipment was available but not the exchange.  There were situations in which both the equipment and the exchanges were available but there was no money to do the necessary cabling.  The result was that nobody benefited from the initial investment.  I hope that situation will not arise again.  There are problems.  There always will be but this Department is not similar to other Departments where one can have cutbacks in finance and recruitment. The situation in this Department is not as simple as it may be in other Departments and the bureaucratic pen must not be permitted to make cuts in regard to this Department.  It can cut its £50 million off this and £20 million off that in other less important non-productive Departments.  If cuts are made in this Department in one particular area they will create problems in some other areas. The situation must be looked at as a whole.  Telex exchanges necessitate capital expenditure and so they should be included in the capital programme. Actually I put that right when I was Minister. If there must be stringency let that stringency be applied in administrative areas and not in areas where it will affect a major development programme because, if it is applied, there will then be adverse repercussions on industrial development.  Above all, do not turn back the clock.  We must be realistic. Stores pruchased from abroad are naturally influenced by currency fluctuations. Allowances must be made for that type of fluctuation.  Other Departments do not have to contend with it but the area we are dealing with is a special area and one that must be given the proper treatment that it needs as well as the necessary finances to allow the Department go ahead with their programme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister takes this opportunity of telling me that there are no cutbacks and that there will continue to be the job opportunities that are there now.  It is my earnest hope that this programme will continue in the manner in which it was started, that it will continue through this year, next year and the year <Col N="1360" /> after and that at the end of the day we will have a telecommunications network that we can be proud of, that we will have available the most modern technology which in turn will provide an offshoot of services.  In this way we will be removing one of the greatest obstacles to national development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for his contribution and for his co-operation in ensuring a speedy passage for this Bill. I am satisfied that in legal terms there is a need for the Bill.  As the Deputy has said there was a legal debate as to the necessity for formal guarantee powers in relation to this matter.  After further debate the better opinion is that specific legal powers of guarantee are necessary in order to enable the Minister to guarantee the borrowings here.  The company involved in the borrowing are an ordinary private company with a share capital of £100 of which £2 worth are issued though it would not matter if all of the shares were issued.  The company have no assets but they are proposing to borrow £100 million.  Clearly, then, there must be somebody behind them.  I take the point made by Deputy Reynolds that it should be clear to bankers that this is a State borrowing but, naturally, bankers are properly cautious since it is not their own money they are lending.  Some of the money may be obtained abroad but it will be necessary to assure the lenders that the money is properly secured.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has his personal capacity as well as his corporate capacity but regardless of how strong he may be in his personal capacity I do not think it would be acceptable as collateral for £100 million.  In his corporate capacity he is a creature of statute and can only do what statute allows him to do.  The argument is whether he has a general overriding power as Minister.  I doubt that he has.  The better opinion is that he needs this specific power and, consequently, that is the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new State-sponsored board are set up there will be a different legal situation because that board will have their own life, their own commercial <Col N="1361" /> structures and will be in a position to make whatever borrowing arrangements they wish either through themselves or by retaining this company, Irish Telecommunications Investment Limited, as a separate entity and by way of a borrowing arm.</P>
    <P>There is no ideological hostility on this side of the House to the concept of private-sector participation.  Some Members may have expressed reservations about how effective and how real this will be put in so far as this exercise is being held up as an example of private-sector participation, people who expressed doubts about it being a new development could say with some justification that it is not really a new development because of the fact that a formal guarantee by the Minister for Finance has to be arranged. That effectively prevents this money from being excluded from the public sector borrowing area.  To that extent the private nature of the borrowing is more or less subsumed.  But that is not to say that in future when the board will be borrowing in their own right there cannot be private-sector borrowing.  Clearly, there can be such borrowing.  The telecommunications industry offers a very attractive investment opportunity to people with money to lend.  That attraction will be enhanced by reason of the State investment situation and having regard to the fact that so much investment has been made already in order to guarantee the technical and commercial success of the entire development in this industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds asked whether the borrowing is ready.  It is ready and has been ready for some weeks, hence the urgency of putting the Bill through.  The Deputy asked also whether this takes from the general pool of money available for credit.  It does but it provides a diversification and while essentially there is only one pool, the people controlling that pool may divert the money into different streams.  Without this method we might not be able to pursue any particular stream.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy about the urgency of continuing the development <Col N="1362" /> of our telecommunications services. Competition for new industry to locate in this country is intensifying.  Other countries are competing with us and our competitive edge has been blunted perhaps to some extent in recent years.  The general recession means that the number of companies seeking new investment opportunities here is not as large as might otherwise be the case.  The number is possibly diminishing.  In that more competitive scene it is obvious that we must have an attractive infrastructure and one of the most important infrastructures is the area of telecommunications.  Consequently, I share with Deputy Reynolds his concern for the need to continue the impetus of the development programme. I assure him that that impetus will be continued and will not be allowed to run down.  Whatever cash resources are necessary to continue on those lines will be made available.</P>
    <P>It is right, also, that recognition should be given to the fact that this huge investment of £221.8 million is producing, and will continue to produce, industrial development because many of the products that are needed for the development of the telecommunications sector are now being produced in new industries that have been established for that purpose but which have the capacity also to diversify into other areas in the electronic and allied fields.  This investment has been a catalyst to the very rapid and one might say quite extraordinary expansion of that sector of Irish industry.  All the money being invested in telephones is not merely to provide telephones in people's homes.  It is also providing permanent industrial employment.</P>
    <P>So far as the security for this loan is concerned, all that will be made available to the banks in this instance will be the State guarantee.  There will be no question of any other form of collateral being required or being made available.  Whatever security will be required when the board come into being will be a matter for negotiation between the board, their subsidiary and the lenders.  I expect that much of the borrowing in that regard will be on a sale-and-lease back arrangement <Col N="1363" /> and that will be where the security will be.</P>
    <P>The last question and a pertinent one for both of us relates to when the new digital exchange in Athlone will be opened.  It will be in operation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1981. - Vote 23: Office of the Minister for Justice.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,215,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981 for the salaries and expenses of the <Col N="1364" /> Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and of the Public Record Office, and of the Keeper of State Papers and for the purchase of historical documents, etc., and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I would propose to discuss the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána and Prisons together on this Vote.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice is required to meet additional expenditure on seven subheads of the Vote &mdash; salaries, wages and allowances, travelling and incidental expenses, office machinery and other office supplies, Post Office services, commissions and special inquiries, criminal legal aid and compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.</P>
    <P>The total estimated additional expenditure amounts to £1,314,000 but £99,000 approximately of this can be met from savings elsewhere on the Vote.  The net additional sum now sought in this Supplementary Estimate is accordingly £1,125,000.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £134,000 is required in respect of Subhead A.1. &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Expenses.  The additional amount required is almost entirely due to pay increases authorised since the 1981 Estimates were approved.</P>
    <P>A sum of £92,000 is required in respect of Subhead B.1. &mdash; Travelling and Incidental Expenses.  Most of this amount arises on travelling expenses because of increases in travelling and subsistence costs and to some extent because insufficient provision was made for the travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>There will be additional expenditure of £4,000 in respect of Subhead B.2. &mdash; Office machinery and other office supplies. The additional amount required is due to increased costs.</P>
    <P>An additional expenditure of £38,000 is likely to be incurred in respect of Subhead C. &mdash; Post Office Services, because of the increases in telephone and teleprinter charges from 1 April 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> An additional £2,000 is required in respect of Subhead E. &mdash;Commissions and Special Inquiries &mdash; in the light of current expenditure levels on this heading. The bulk of this expenditure is in respect of fees paid to members of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal for cases decided by them.  It is not possible to predict what claims will be received or dealt with in any year but the indications are that the number of cases which will be disposed of this year will be higher than average.</P>
    <P>The original provision under Subhead F.1. &mdash; Legal Aid (Criminal) was £770,000.  The additional amount now estimated to be required is £160,000. Deputies will be aware that the criminal legal aid scheme has developed considerably over the years since it was introduced in 1965.  Initially there was some dissatisfaction with the way in which it was operating and, in 1975, a committee was established by the then Minister for Justice under the chairmanship of District Justice Tormey with the task or reviewing the operation of the scheme and making recommendations as to the manner in which it might be improved.</P>
    <P>The implementations of recommendations made by the Tormey Committee in their first and second interim reports has resulted in improvements in the operation of the scheme.  There has, however, been a very sizeable increase in the cost of criminal legal aid which has arisen from £54,000 in 1975 to £773,000 in 1980 and now to an estimated £930,000 in 1981.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of this scheme is that I have very little effective control over the principal determinants of expenditure on criminal legal aid.  These are, first, the decision by the court to grant legal aid and second, the cost arising from the grant of it in any particular case.  Deputies will be aware that the courts alone have discretion to grant criminal legal aid and it would simply not be feasible to limit that discretion without changing the statutory &mdash; perhaps even the constitutional &mdash; position.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the increased recourse to legal aid in this and recent years was the Supreme Court judgment <Col N="1366" /> of 1976 in the case of the State (Healy) v. Donoghue.  Very briefly, the effect of this judgments is that accused persons have a constitutional right to legal aid in certain criminal cases and that, in addition, this right must be brought to an accused person's notice by the district justice before whom he appears initially.</P>
    <P>A number of factors have contributed to the high rate of expenditure this year. These include increased recourse generally to legal aid by the courts in disposing of criminal business coming before them and the speedier processing of claims submitted to solicitors and counsel under the scheme.  There have also been additional sittings of the Central Criminal Court to deal with a build-up of cases this year which has resulted in an increase in the granting of legal aid by that court in particular. There has also been an increase this year in the fees payable to solicitors for criminal legal aid work in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Because of the escalating cost of providing criminal legal aid the Criminal Legal Aid Review Committee, in their final report which was published in September this year, have among their recommendations some suggestions for controlling costs or for providing legal aid through less expensive methods &mdash; for example, through the possible introduction of a limited duty solicitor scheme in the busiest District Court areas.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the report are currently under examination in my Department but it has to be mentioned that negotiations and discussions with other interested parties will be necessary before these suggestions can be evaluated and &mdash; if warranted &mdash; concrete proposals made for amendment of the law.</P>
    <P>The original estimate for Subhead G. &mdash; Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted was £940,000.  This amount has now been expended and from an examination of the claims on hand it is obvious that a further sum of approximately £810,000 will be required before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Claims are processed by an independent tribunal and my Department have no control over the number of applications, the number of cases decided by the tribunal <Col N="1367" /> or the amounts of awards made.  A further factor is that the size of awards is directly related to awards made in civil cases in the courts and that the size of these awards is constantly increasing.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Supplementary Estimate on the Vote of the Garda Síochána. In summary, a net additional sum of £31,311,000 is needed to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31 December 1981 for the salaries and other expenses of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>At the outset, as there are a number of new Deputies in the House, I would like to explain that it is traditional and in accordance with Standing Orders relating to the business of the House, to confine discussion of a supplementary estimate to the items constituting the Estimate.  I mention this at this point to explain why it is that the statement I am about to make does not include any general policy statements in relation to the Garda Síochána.  However, I expect to avail myself of the opportunity to cover general policy matters when I introduce the Garda Estimates for 1982.</P>
    <P>The additional funds required this year are needed to meet extra expenditure arising on the Garda Vote over and above the funds provided in the original Estimate. Before giving the House a detailed break-down of the additional funds required I have first of all to explain that the original Estimate for the Garda Síochána in 1981 was, in one respect at least, not adequate to meet commitments this year.</P>
    <P>The public is aware that one of the first takes of the present Government was to conduct an urgent examinations of the country's finances.  Following that, the public was told, by means of the Taoiseach's broadcasts on television and radio and by other pronouncements, of the extremely serious condition in which the finances of the State had been left by the outgoing Government.  In case some people may not have grasped the full significance of what was happening, I would like just to focus on one aspect of the financial position which I have found in my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> One of the principal responsibilities of the Minister for Justice is to make the necessary financial provision to maintain the Garda Síochána and, under that heading, the first and most obvious need is to make the provision necessary to pay the salaries and allowances of the force. I found that realistic estimates which had been prepared of the cost of maintaining the Garda Síochána had been cut and cut again by direction of the then Government until the stage was reached where the money provided was simply not sufficient to meet expected expenditure.  I realise that it is easy, in all good faith, to make an error or misjudgment in estimating what will be needed to meet outgoings under various headings but that is not what happened here.  What happened was that the figures in the Estimate were not enough to pay the salaries and allowances of the numbers already on the payroll, even on the basis of the pay rates obtaining at the time.  The shortfall amounted to over £4 million.  It must be remembered that this decision not to provide enough money to pay current salaries was made after an announcement had been made that the numbers on the payroll were to be increased by another 2,000.  Far from making any provision to pay for any increase in numbers, the Estimate was, quite simply not enough to cover the basic pay and allowances of the numbers already serving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be exposed for cooking the books.  I was left in a position that the choices left to me were as follows: (1) Not to pay the Garda their basic wages for the last few weeks of the year; or (2) Sack a huge number of gardaí so as to reduce the basic payroll to that provided in January or (3) Introduce this Supplementary Estimate.  The choice, notwithstanding the financial crisis left by the last Government was obvious.</P>
      <P>The real significance of all this is that the publication of Estimates that were known to be inadequate meant that, at budget time, the then Minister for Finance was able to evade the responsibility of increasing taxes to meet the bills that he knew would be coming in.  This did not of course stop the bills coming in and I now have to ask the House to make supplementary funds available, totalling approximately £31 million to meet the cost of the Garda Síochána this year.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the financial abyss to which this country was led by the last Government, I have got authority from my Government to increase expenditure on the Garda under several headings.</P>
      <P>Apart from the required basic pay and as a firm indication of this Government's commitment to security and defeating crime among the increased provisions are the following: First, the January 1981 provision for Garda overtime is to be increased by approximately 75 per cent to £21.5 million.  I sincerely hope and expect that this high level of overtime will be considerably reduced in 1982 consequent on the recruitment of additional gardaí.  The present level of overtime is also of concern to me because continuous overtime of this level is generally acknowledged to be detrimental to the welfare and indeed efficiency of the personnel concerned.</P>
      <P>The expenditure of an additional £300,000 for anti-vandalism patrols in the Dublin Metropolitan Area has been authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the word go out from this House that the Government will take every step to stop criminals in their tracks because we are conscious that for many thousands <Col N="1370" /> of decent people, especially in parts of Dublin, life has become intolerable.</P>
    <P>In summary, the additional funds required are as follows: £26.911 million for salaries, wages and allowances, including overtime; £1.987 million to meet increased costs under the heading of travelling and incidental expenses; £492,000 for Post Office services; £360,000 for clothing; £294,000 for station services; £215,000 for transport; £87,000 for equipment and £1.2 million for superannuation.  these extra sums add up to a total of £31.546 million but the net amount required is only £31.311 million as there are anticipated savings of £94,000 on office equipment and an expected increase of £141,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid, in the form of contributions by members towards the Garda Síochána widows' and children's pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of salaries, wages and allowances, the main increases involved are increases in basic pay granted with effect from 1 April 1981, in accordance with agreements reached under the Garda Síochána Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  The cost of these increases in the present year is £11,342,000.</P>
    <P>Increases were also granted in uniform, plain clothes, boot and rent allowances. In the case of the uniform, plain clothes and boot allowances, the increases were effective from 1 April 1981, and the cost in the present year is £975,000.  In the case of the rent allowances, the increase was effective from 1 March 1981, and the cost this year is £958,000.</P>
    <P>As I have said, included in the additional amount required for salaries and allowances, is a sum of £9.04 million for overtime.  This provision is made so that the Garda have available to them as many men as possible to defeat subversion and crime.  This very high amount of overtime is necessary this year because the Garda recruitment process, under way for several months, is not expected to be completed until early in 1982 due to the huge number of applicants.  However, again notwithstanding the severe financial crisis which we have inherited, the Government <Col N="1371" /> have decided to recruit 300 new gardaí&mdash;the maximum number possible that the Templemore Training Centre can cope with&mdash;as soon as possible after the Civil Service Commissioners provide me with their completed list of successful applicants.  This list is now expected in January next and actually training is expected to commence in February.</P>
    <P>The additional funds for travelling and incidental expenses are required to meet a shortfall in the original allocation under this heading, increases in travelling and subsistence rates granted to the Garda Síochána in common with other public servants and compensation awards under the Garda Síochána Compensation Acts in excess of the provision made in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>The additional sum under the heading of Post Office services is required to meet the increases in telephone and teleprinter charges which came into effect on 1 April 1981 and a higher level of expenditure generally than was anticipated when the Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>The original allocation for the purchase of clothing and accessories was not sufficient and the additional amount now being sought is required to meet accounts for uniform cloth, the making up of uniforms and the purchase of accessories that are expected to fall due for payment this year.</P>
    <P>The sum required under the heading of station services is to provide for higher expenditure than was anticipated at the beginning of the year on the purchase of such items as furniture and bedding and to meet substantial increases in the cost of cleaning, fuel, light and water.</P>
    <P>The expected shortfall under the heading of transport is attributable to the substantial increase in the price of petrol since the original Estimate was prepared. Extra funds are required for equipment because it was necessary to purchase additional it protective equipment for the Garda Síochána, the cost of which could not be met from the original allocation.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of superannuation, additional funds are required to meet consequential increases in pensions and gratuities arising from the special pay <Col N="1372" /> increase granted to serving members of the force from 1 April 1981 and increases in the garda widow's ordinary pension to bring it into line with increases in social welfare benefits granted in both the January and July budgets this year.</P>
    <P>I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.  In doing so, I am sure all Deputies would wish to join with me in thanking the members of the Garda Síochána for the loyal and efficient manner in which they continue to serve the community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Supplementary Estimate on the Prisons Vote an additional sum of £3,622,000 will be required during the year ending on 31 December 1981 for the salaries and expenses of the prison service.</P>
    <P>The greater proportion &mdash;£2,946,000 &mdash; of the total excess in the Prisons' Vote is required to service salaries, wages and allowances and, in particular, overtime. £758,000 of the excess relates to salaries and £2,188,000 to overtime.</P>
    <P>A provision of £14,290,000 in respect of salaries of prison service personnel was made in the 1981 Estimate.  An additional £203,000 is required to meet the cost of pay increases which had not come into effect when the Estimates were being finalised.  The remaining £555,000 of the excess in salaries is the consequence of a series of cuts which were made in the pay provision prior to finalising the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the 1981 Estimates for expenditure of £4,182,000 on overtime in the prison service during the year.  This provision is inadequate, as total expenditure on overtime will be £6,370,000, an excess of £2,188,000.</P>
    <P>This excess contains £1,183,000 for overtime worked in providing manning for post which, because of the small intake of recruit prison officers during the year, would otherwise remain vacant. Because of the nature of the service being provided, there is a need to ensure that security posts are manned as required, on an overtime basis if necessary, and this is done by recalling officers who are on rest days to man the vacant posts.  The total number of staff serving in prison service grades is 1,491, an increase of 47 <Col N="1373" /> on the number serving on 31 December last.  Seventy four officers were recruited during the year.</P>
    <P>The excess also contains £621,000 which is the cost of recalling staff on an overtime basis in place of staff whose sick absences in the course of the year exceeded the level which was anticipated when the Estimate was being framed.</P>
    <P>It became necessary in May of this year to provide accommodation at Limerick Prison for a number of male subversive prisoners.  The overtime cost in 1981 of providing the higher level of security required to contain this category of prisoners is £219,000.</P>
    <P>Payment of arrears of overtime arising from pay settlements will cost the prison service £468,000 during 1981.  This is £131,000 greater than the sum provided for in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In the course of the year it was necessary on various occasions to deal with problems which arose and which had implications for the security of the prisons and for the welfare of the staff and the inmates.  These problems include periods of heightened tension which occurred during parts of June and July last at Mountjoy Prison, special security measures required from time to time at Portlaoise Prison and the fire which destroyed the administration block at Portlaoise on the night of 25 July last. The additional cost of dealing with these and similar problems during 1981 was £34,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my gratitude to the staff of Portlaoise Prison for the way in which they respond to the alert on the night of the fire and for the effective and courageous manner in which they dealt with the blaze.  I have no doubt that but for their efforts, the damage caused by the fire would have been much greater.  I would also wish to express my appreciation of the successful manner in which the staff of Portlaoise Prison are coping with the containment of subversive prisoners.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £235,000 is required for subhead B.1. which covers the cost of escorting prisoners, both by the Garda and by prison officers, to and <Col N="1374" /> from courts, hospitals etc., and from prison to prison.  It also covers other travelling and subsistence costs of prison officers, for example temporary transfers, and staff training, uniforms and other incidental expenses.</P>
    <P>On subhead C. &mdash; Post Office Services &mdash; an additional sum of £35,000 is required due to insufficient provision having been made for telephones in the original Estimate &mdash; £30,000 &mdash; and increased telephone charges &mdash; £5,000 &mdash; with effect from 1 April 1981.</P>
    <P>For subhead E.&mdash;Prison Services&mdash;I am seeking an additional sum of £410,000.  Of this amount, £90,000 is required to pay for clothing and furniture supplied by the Post Office Store and the Office of Public Works in 1980 and for which invoices were not received until 1981.</P>
    <P>A further £245,000 is required to meet the cost of fuel, light and cleaning in the prisons.  This increase is due mainly to the increase in energy prices since the original Estimate was prepared in mid-1980 &mdash; approximately 30 per cent.  Only 5 per cent was allowed in the Estimate to cover expected price increases.</P>
    <P>An additional £10,000 on subhead G.&mdash; Probation and Welfare services &mdash; is required.  This subhead mainly covers the payment of grants to voluntary bodies who, in association with the probation and welfare service operate hostels, workshops or day centres for persons on probation or on release from custody.</P>
    <P>The additional sum is necessary because of a special grant of £10,000 to Sarsfield House, Ballyfermot, in order to alleviate its financial difficulties.  This centre provides a very valuable service and caters for a large number of boys on probation who require accommodation and it has become clear to me that the existing system of funding by payment of capitation grants is no longer suitable. My Department are at present discussing with the hostel committee an alternative system of meeting their financial needs.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £65,000 will be required because of an expected deficiency on Subhead I. &mdash;Appropriations-in-aid. This subhead covers receipts for <Col N="1375" /> goods manufactured in prisons and other miscellaneous receipts.  An expected shortfall of £95,000 will arise on manufacturing receipts, mainly because industrial relations problems caused a reduction in the production of goods during part of the year.  This shortfall is offset by an increase of £30,000 in miscellaneous receipts.</P>
    <P>In summary, the funds required are as follows: £2,946,000 for salaries, wages and allowances, including overtime; £235,000 for travelling and incidental expenses; £35,000 for Post Office services; £401,000 for prison services and £10,000 for probation and welfare services. There is also an expected deficiency of £65,000 in respect of Appropriations-in-aid. These extra sums add up to a total of £3,692,000 but the net amount required is only £3,622,000 as there are anticipated savings of £60,000 on equipment and materials for the manufacturing department and farm and £10,000 on equipment and materials for educational services.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the comments of Deputies on this Supplementary Estimate.  As it is a Supplementary Estimate the debate will inevitably be confined to issues in it but I promise to give a comprehensive reply to all the points raised.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Collins that as the first speaker for the main Opposition group he has a time limit of one hour and 30 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister for justice to the Dáil on the occasion of his moving this Supplementary Estimate.  It is the first opportunity I have had in the House since his appointment to wish him good luck in his Ministry.  I should like to tell him that any help or assistance my party feel we should give him to fulfil the very difficult and onerous task he has we will give willingly. Having been in charge of that Ministry for a number of years I have a certain amount of sympathy for him, a sympathy <Col N="1376" /> which is justified because it is probably one of the most difficult Ministries in Government.  I hope the Minister does well; I am sure he will.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in charge of a very small Department in numbers on which to lean on for help and advice.  He has extremely dedicated and able officials and I hope the effort and energy they put into advising and helping me when I was Minister will be maintained and, if necessary, improved on with him.  I have often felt that perhaps more would have been achieved by me if I had more advisers of the calibre I had in the Department. If the Minister inquires he will learn that I was able to convince the Department of the Public Service&mdash; that took some convincing&mdash;that there was a need for a greater number of personnel at the appropriate level to do the many things which were expected of us and for which we had responsibility.  I hope the Minister will continue on that line because in the Department of Justice it is seemingly one crisis after another, day by day and, perhaps, hour by hour.  With a very small number of senior officials it is easy to lose out on some of the matters that one should not lose out on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped to be able to provide a deputy secretary in the Department because there was need for such an official and the Minister, having examined the situation, may make some progress in this area, if he considers it appropriate. I am slighly perturbed that there is a vacancy at a very senior level, the level of assistant secretary, in the Department and that this position has been vacant since last July.  Unfortunately, because of the embargo on public service promotions brought in by the Government this vacancy has not been filled.  I am sure the Minister would like to agree with me, if he could, when I say that it is a great pity that this situation exists.  It is sad that the people who form part of his senior team are so over-stretched that they can ill-afford the loss of one of their colleagues who retired.  I hope the Minister &mdash; I am sure he is interested in maintaining a high level of efficiency in the Department because so many things depend on it, the security front and the relations between <Col N="1377" /> the staff of the Department &mdash; will do his utmost to have the vacancy filled.  The post was involved in the area of staff relations and personnel and that is of such importance that the Minister might make a special case to the Government that the embargo be removed in this instance.  If he did so he would be doing something very valuable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House with his Supplementary Estimate but I should like to inform him that it is not the first time we have had a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice. I can recall that this time last year I was delayed in the House for up to six weeks by the Minister's colleagues, particularly those in the Fine Gael Party, when I introduced a Supplementary Estimate for that Department.  The reason for the delay of six weeks was none other than that every time there was a robbery of a bank, a post office or a payroll hike his party, if the Minister can recall &mdash; he did not have any particular interest in the Department of Justice at that time &mdash; held me personally responsible for the breakdowns that were happening at the time.  We had a Supplementary Estimate last year and if I am wrong in saying that the Minister's advisers will inform him. There is nothing new in Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Justice. The reason I make that point is because listening to the Minister one would think that this was the first time a Supplementary Estimate was required in the Department of Justice.  There had been a shortfall in Estimates before today.  Seemingly we did not always forecast accurately the amounts required under the different headings and sub-headings in the Votes for the Department.  Having said that, the Minister will understand why there is a certain amount of regret on my part at the political content of his speech.  It is something we could have done without. The Minister should leave discussion on the nation's finances to those who have specific responsibility in Government and Opposition to deal with that matter.  The Minister is trying to get the impression across that there was a shortfall of £31 million in the Department.  This is grossly untrue.  Indeed, the Minister when he <Col N="1378" /> had the opportunity &mdash; I am not saying that I blame him for this &mdash; managed to slip in an extra £10,000 for Sarsfield House in Ballyfermot which is in his constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy who approved of that when he was Minister and I cannot claim it.  I was going to give the Deputy credit for it in my speech but I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister all the time he likes to reply.  I am not holding that against the Minister but I hold it against him from a political angle that he said he was left a shortfall of £31 million.  That is wrong and the Minister knows it.  If he still believes it I suggest he discuss the matter with his advisers because they know &mdash; I know they know &mdash; that is wrong.  With regard to the allegation by the Minister that the books were cooked I will leave that for what it is, a political allegation; I will not even bother to deal with it.  The Minister is starting off in an exceptionally difficult Ministry and if he is asking for advice &mdash; I know he is not &mdash; I would tell him that if he starts to play political football in his Department he will be in a very serious difficulty in a very short time.  I resisted the temptation to do it, but what the Minister does is his own business.  He will get all the help he needs at all times from this side of the House in dealing with the problems he will have to deal with, and he has had a fairly rough passage since he was appointed and has been exceptionally busy.  But he will get every help from this side of the House, particularly in dealing with subversives and those engaged in crime.  If at times it is necessary to comment on what the Minister is doing, it will only be in an effort to put him on the right road.  The Minister should clearly understand that.  But if he starts to play political football in this Department, he will still get the help that has been promised but he will have to be taken on head front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister and the Government are providing an extra £9 million for Garda overtime.  I am subject to correction but I understand that the <Col N="1379" /> figure provided in the Estimates for the current year is £12 million.  I know that overtime in the Garda is running at about £1 million per month.  That is a lot of money and it was because of this that I was able to persuade the Government to train many more gardaí to take up the fight against crime and that the Government agreed to introduce a new ranks order which allowed the Minister for Justice to increase the strength of the Garda by 2,000.  As a result of that I immediately got under way a scheme to send 1,000 additional young people to the training college in Templemore.  The Minister referred to that and said that no money had been provided for it.  That is a very weak political point that does not warrant much attention from me because the forecast given to me at the time by the officials in the Department, by the Garda Commissioner and his advisers and by the Civil Service Commission who are also involved was that there would not be recruits ready until October or early November and that they would just be going into the training college four to six weeks before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I am slightly perturbed to hear from the Minister that nobody from the batch recruited last May will be in the training college until next February.  That is a very long time.  If the Minister is doing this for political reasons to push expenditure from this year over to next year that is fair enough and I accept that.  But if the reason is that the Civil Service Commission and all those involved in the processing of the applicants have to take eight months to decide who is eligible for admission to the training college in Templemore then something will have to be done about it.  We have heard criticisms on various occasions that the Civil Service Commission are very slow and ponderous.  Perhaps there is reason for this.  I would not like to see it taking short cuts that might harm the system because it is seen to be extremely fair and above board.  But the House and the general public would agree with me that, if it requires nine months to process applicants for admission to Templomore, something needs to be done about it. <Col N="1380" /> quickly because, if the day ever came when we needed additional manpower in the force, I do not know how we would do it if we had to wait nine months and then wait for 22 weeks for training before we had people on the street.  I am somewhat taken aback by the extra delay of four or five months because the advice given to me by the various people involved in this campaign was that we would have people available by October and early November.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that he is going ahead with the recruitment of 300 gardaí.  The recent competition was to have 1,000 applicants ready to go to Templomore to train so that when the first 300 were trained the next batch could be trained immediately. Perhaps that is what the Minister still proposes to do.  If it is not I would like to comment on it when he is replying to this Estimate.  He says Templemore can cater for only 300.  That is so, despite my efforts to increase the facilities by trying to get from the Army the last remaining piece of property which they have in Templemore.  But, despite many meetings and much talk, I did not succeed in getting the Army to hand over this property.  The services the Army are providing from Templemore could still be provided because there is another small building there which could easily be adopted for their use.</P>
    <P>I mention that because of the question of overtime.  The Minister says he hopes that when the additional 3000 recruits are trained there will be a decrease in overtime. I know the Minister is not right in that, because if the additional 3000 recruits all came into Dublin there would be only one-fifth of that number on duty at any particular time because of the three eight-hour shifts system that operates.  In other words, only 60 additional gardaí would be on the street at any one time and that is only a fraction of the beat tolerances that we want.  We all want a higher beat tolerance to combat vandals and to protect innocent people and their property, particularly old people.  I am not taking the Minister to task in any way.  I am just pointing out the reality of the situation to him.  Even with 1,000 extra gardaí, which I hope are still to be <Col N="1381" /> trained, the position would still need improving because those additional gardaí were all promised for the Dublin metropolitan area where 57 per cent of the crime reported in the Commissioner's report happened.  I hope the decision to allocate those extra 1,000 gardaí to Dublin still stands.  I know there will be pressure on the Minister from all over the country to send additional gardaí to other areas.  I hope the Minister will resist the temptation to try to be all things to all men and see to it that that number of 1,000 additional gardaí are brought to Dublin straight away and allocated to the areas where they are needed.  It is a fact that 57 per cent of the crime committed has been committed in the greater Dublin area.  If one looks at the crime scene in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford one can see that a staggering total of 70 per cent of all crime committed occurred in those areas.  This shows the increase in urban crime and the problem which this Minister, the previous Minister and the next Minister has in providing enough manpower for the Garda to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>There are interesting statistics to be studied in the commission's report.  The report shows that the Roscommon and east Galway divisions had the lowest level of crime in the country.  It is encouraging to see that as a result of improved Garda presence on the beat in the Dún Laoghaire division which is quite a big one &mdash; the centre of Dún Laoghaire has always been extremely difficult to police from a Garda point of view &mdash; that the 1980 report shows a great improvement in the situation there.  This shows the value of increased Garda presence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an extra £9 million for overtime which is a lot of money.  I believe it will do a lot of good and I congratulate the Minister on getting it.  A sum of £12 million was already budgeted for in the Estimate.  I do not know how much of that money was eaten up in providing the police presence for all the H Block protests during May and June. The figure was not available to me in the Department because the accounts were not in.  The claims had not been made for overtime, travel and subsistence.  The <Col N="1382" /> public should know what those protests cost the taxpayers.  We know that gardaí had to be brought to Dublin and other centres from as far away as Donegal, Kerry and Wexford.  We should be told how much of the extra £9 million has to be provided to maintain the level of police presence which has to be maintained as a result of the H Block protests which took place.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying on radio about a fortnight ago that the increased Garda activity which had to take place as a result of the Ben Dunne kidnapping cost the taxpayers £500,000. I do not know where the Minister got that figure but I accept that somebody in authority advised him of the amount involved.  Thank God that activity turned out so well and the man's life was spared. I understand that investigation is still continuing into the case and I hope the Garda can bring someone to justice for it.  If that particular activity over a short time and in a very limited area cost £500,000 it would be interesting to see what the cost of the other incidents I have already mentioned is.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task in trying with limited resources to give as good a coverage as he can through the Garda Commissioner of Garda activities in different places.  The Minister has asked in this Supplementary Estimate for an additional £300,000 to maintain the street patrols which were in operation for the last 12 months and which have been very effective.  The patrols, district by district, by the Garda officers in those areas, were very successful.  The Minister is looking for more money to maintain and improve those patrols.  He only mentioned Dublin.  I know the high level of crime is in Dublin but I am sure the Minister will not forget that there are other areas where there is a high level of crime.  There are enough Deputies in his party from the other centres where those patrols have been operating successfully, to remind him of how successful they have been.  The Minister should not forget that it was also necessary to introduce those patrols into Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  He should have a look at the situation and if he is satisfied <Col N="1383" /> that enough is being done.  I will accept that.  If enough is not being done there are people who will be able to comment on it and bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  This has worked well during the past year and I hope it will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The July budget with the increases in VAT, the increase in the price of petrol and the increase in the price of goods generally has a bearing on the expenditure in the Department of Justice whether it is petrol, furniture or bedding. I see a heading in relation to bedding. Will the Minister please tell me where he is buying the beds for because it is in the Garda Vote rather than the Prison Vote. A lot of the money the Minister has asked for today has to be provided for supperannuation. In the Garda Vote this is £1.2 million.  I understand the need for equipment is because of a decision by the Commissioner that the type of defensive equipment which the Garda have to use during riots is not good enough and they have to get better equipment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of transport we all know that cars cost more and the Minister and his party had a lot to do with that when they brought in the budget last July.  The price of petrol and cars were increased.  The Minister is asking for an extra £1.9 million for travelling and salaries, wages and allowances add up to the remainder of the money he is asking for.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister sees merit in what I was trying to do before I left the Department of Justice and he might take an interest in the particular matter as I did. I refer to the frightening increase in the drug scene in Dublin and other cities.  I am sure the Minister knows, after four months in the Department of Justice, what frustrations are like.  One particular frustration I had was that I could not get an exact picture of the extent of the drug scene in the country.  The Department of Justice, the Garda, the Department of Health or the hospitals could not give me an exact picture.  There was nobody I could go to or the present Minister can go to and say: &ldquo;Let us see the extent of the drug problem as it exists at the <Col N="1384" /> moment&rdquo;.  I had many discussions with the people involved at the Garda level about how we could be more efficient and how we could deal more competently with the drug situation because of the immense damage it is doing.  I know this did not start when this Minister for Justice came into office.</P>
    <P>From early 1980 all the indications are that the usage of drugs, and heroin in particular, has grown at an alarming rate. Some sort of glamour appears to be attached to the use of heroin by some of our younger people.  Anybody who does not believe that the usage of heroin is growing has his head in the sand.  Some time ago the drug squad in Dublin was strengthened.  I suggested that the squad should be doubled, and I wondered at the time would doubling it be sufficient. About last January a special drug unit was set up in Limerick and the one in Cork was strengthened.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that the commissioner has allocated an additional six men to the drug squad in Dublin.  There are two Ban-Ghardaí in the squad.  Up to five or six years ago there were two in it but they were taken out of it for some reason.  It was felt that the presence of a Ban-Gharda was not appropriate.  That has now been proved to be wrong.  There are 19 garda in the squad and four sergeants. Unfortunately there are only two at the moment because appointments are being held up due to the promotion embargo.  There is one detective inspector. That gives us a total of 26 people in a city with a population of one million plus to try to handle the drug scene.</P>
    <P>We must look at the realities.  This was the recommendations of the Garda Commissioner but having regard, as he always does, to the resources available to him. There should be many more people in the drug squad.  It can be augmented by ordinary members of the force who have been given more intensive training in recent times on the drug problem.  This is a good and effective course.  I hope it will be very successful.  We need more than 26 people in a drug squad which has to provide round the clock coverage to cope with those involved in the drug scene.  We have to divide the membership. <Col N="1385" /> of the squad by four because of shift work, and we have about six people available at any one time to deal with drug offences and drug abuse.  That is not enough.  I am not trying to score any point against the Minister when I say I am convinced it is not enough.  I ask him to take a personal interest in it and to try to do something more about it.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account the fact that one, two or three members of a working shift might be required in the courts.  This morning an important case on the drug scene is before one of our courts.  A lady is being charged with possession of 17 grammes of pure heroin. When broken down, that would provide enough fixes for 1,000 people.  That quantity of heroin can be purchased for £600. It can be broken down and sold on the street in small packages at £10 a fix and will show a profit of £9,400 on an investment of £600.  The profit margin for criminals in this area is so great that many are now being attracted into it.</P>
    <P>There has been a series of newspaper articles, reports and speeches, and concern has been shown by many people. There is a graph in the Medical Monthly produced by Dr. Michael G. Kelly, the medical director of the Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre in Jervis Street Hospital, which shows that within the past 12 months the number of patients abusing heroin and cocaine went out through the roof.  We must come to grips with this problem.  There is no disagreement between us in the House in that regard.  We must have a strong united effort if we are to protect our young people.  We must do something different from what we have been doing to date. I mean that quite sincerely.</P>
    <P>Before we can do anything about it, we must know the extent of the problem.  At present we do not know that.  If the Minister asked his advisers the extent of the problem they would have to tell him they do not know it.  That information was not available up to a couple of months ago. I should like the Minister and the Government to consider the establishment of a judicial committee or a committee of this House to collate all the information available on drug abuse.  Then we could <Col N="1386" /> decide what we should do to solve the problem and deal with it effectively.</P>
    <P>Large numbers of people care about this matter.  Parents are worried.  Parents have approached Deputies to ask what can be done about it.  Concern was expressed as a result of a series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Mr. Murtagh who did investigative reporting into this scene.  He proved that a family in this city have become multi-millionaires based on the misery and suffering they have caused for unfortunate people.  I hope the Garda will be able to deal with those people. Changes in legislation may be necessary to help the Garda.  Recently I spoke to a garda who is involved in this area and he told me he went to a house where he knew there were drugs.  There were so many bolts on the doors and so many peepholes that, by the time he got into the house, the drugs had been flushed down the toilet.  That was a fair comment by him.  That can be done.  Nothing was found when the building was searched. Perhaps changes in our laws are necessary and perhaps new methods can be found to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The use of cannabis has been the order of the day for some time amongst our youth particularly in the Dublin area. That is sad.  I hope that if pressures to legalise it are brought to bear on the Minister by any group he will resist that pressure and tell people thinking along those lines that we will not give them any help or encouragement.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a big educational programme to educate parents on the extent of the drug problem.  We would then hope that the parents would educate the young people.  I spoke to a parent recently, a Dublin man in his late forties. He has seven children and the eldest is still a teenager.  I asked him if he ever discussed the usage of drugs with his children and he said he did not.  I was shocked.  It appears that the young people know far more about the drug scene than the parents.</P>
    <P>We are dependent on the information available to us from the Jervis Street Hospital Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre as to what the extent of the problem is.  That is not an accurate picture. <Col N="1387" /> Doctors in Jervis Street will tell you there is an influx of patients looking for treatment after a big drugs haul and the supply of hard drugs is cut off.  At Jervis Street Hospital they could not have an accurate picture of people who are abusing heroin unless those people came to them, and they do not all come to them.  We must set up some mechanism to monitor the problem and see how bad it is and what it is necessary to do about it.  Incidentally, the size of a packet costing ten pounds of heroin is very small.  This is being offered quite openly on the streets of Dublin.  I am not blaming the Minister for that but it is a problem that must be dealt with.  I do not believe that the resources of the State are properly geared to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>There was a haul of drugs in Dublin recently and the newspapers valued the drugs at £5 million.  All of us were very pleased that the Garda Síochána were successful in recovering the drugs.  A few years ago there was a drugs haul on the Naas Road and I remember that none of us could believe the decision of the court in that case.  The value of the drugs in that haul was estimated in the region of £2 million to £3 million.  In Knocklong, County Limerick, there was a huge find of drugs.  The haul was so enormous that the Garda Síochána could not give a proper estimate but the value was estimated between £3 million and £9 million.</P>
    <P>We know about the drugs the police capture but we know nothing about the drugs that are not detected.  I should like to see an efficient police unit dealing solely with this problem.  Having heard the breakdown I have given to the House of the availability of persons on a full-time basis to deal with this matter, the House will agree that the problem is very great.  Prosecuting those involved in the drug trade will not put them out of business. An educational programme would be most effective if we had full-time officers available to talk to children, parents and teachers in the schools.  In this instance prevention is better than cure. The cure is locking people away and putting them out of circulation for a period. I do not think that is good enough.  All of <Col N="1388" /> us resent the fact that people in the crime world who are known as big spenders were able, according to a journalist in <i>The Irish Times</i>, to order between 20 and 30 bottles of champagne at £20 or £30 a bottle on a night out in a restaurant in Baggot Street.  If champagne should burn certainly that champagne should burn and I do not think anybody would feel sorry for the people involved.</P>
    <P>When the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice was before the House last year 80 or 90 per cent of the contributions made by colleagues of the Minister dealt with bank robberies and armed robberies.  All of us are pleased that for the early part of the year there was a sharp decrease in successful armed robberies and attempted robberies.  I wish to make clear that I do not claim credit for that decrease.  It would be wrong to do so.  Equally, it was wrong for those people to castigate me last year for the increase in crime.  I do not want credit for the decrease in successful armed robberies. It was a job for the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána to deal with that area of operations.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say anything in a personal way to the Minister for Justice regarding the increase in armed robberies in the past three months.  I put down a question to him for information, certainly not to score any political points, asking him the number of armed robberies that had taken place in the past three months and asking also for details.  The Minister told us that in the three months to 30 September there were 85 armed robberies. There were quite a few during the month of October, including one robbery in Limerick yesterday where a pregnant woman was tied up and left in that condition during the night without any regard for what might happen to her, while her husband was thrown out of a car on the side of the road in County Clare.  If there were 85 robberies in three months and if we multiply that number by four, the total will be more than 300 armed robberies on an annual basis.  That assumption may be incorrect and I hope it will be.</P>
    <P>My point is that I would not like the Minister or the Government to think that <Col N="1389" /> armed robberies are not still the main source of supply particularly for paramilitaries and subversives and ordinary criminals.  Every effort must be made by the Garda Commissioner and his force to ensure that there is no slacking off by them or by anybody else in carrying the fight to the armed criminal at all times. The value of property taken was approximately £300,000 but unfortunately the amount recovered is always very small. Of the 85 armed robberies, 70 took place in the Dublin metropolitan area.  That goes to show the need for a stronger police presence in Dublin.  Seemingly the criminal prefers to operate here.  There is a greater chance for him to escape in that he can easily dodge about streets and traffic and make good his escape.  I am satisfied the Garda are doing everything they can to deal with the situation.  If they come up with new methods or approaches I am confident the Minister will help them.</P>
    <P>There was considerable progress made by members of the Garda Síochána, by officials of the Department of Justice and by others in trying to put together a modern and sophisticated radio network system for the Garda Síochána.  It was hoped that part of that system would be operational last July or August.  I accept that things can go wrong, particularly when we are dealing with a highly technical matter, but I hope that the progress made in this area will be maintained and improved.  It is accepted that it is vital for the Garda to have this new radio network system.  Nowadays criminals are extremely sophisticated, frequently well educated, intelligent and are trying to outwit the Garda Síochána all the time. Members of this House would be most anxious to ensure that the large sums of money obtained in armed robberies would not be used for subversive purposes. I am quite sure that Members would not condone that in any way.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the drugs situation.  I want to mention what is known as the recent £5 million drugs haul in Dublin.  There was a great deal of publicity given to this find, with the result that a great deal of public interest was aroused.  Like a bolt from the blue we <Col N="1390" /> heard that no charges were preferred.  I know the Minister has no responsibility for preferring charges and did not have the responsibility to answer a question I put down recently as to why no prosecutions had taken place because it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether there was a case against those people.  Those people were caught in the act, with the goods and, as the countryman would say, with pictures to prove it.  When nothing happened it is only natural that a lot of questions remain to be answered.  It was alleged that nothing happened because of a lack of professionalism by the Garda.  I cannot say if that is true, but I hope it is not.  The public had their appetites whetted by the media as to the real significance of the find and somebody in authority should have been informed why there were no prosecutions.</P>
    <P>One question is being left unanswered which I think is damaging to the Garda Síochána.  It is alleged that because so much money was involved there may have been some sleight of hand.  I accept nothing could be further from the truth and reject the insinuation, but when there is a vacuum and questions are left unanswered, people will wonder.  We often have off-the-cuff briefings for people in the media and sometimes they report things they should not report and it might be necessary to take corrective action later.  Even if the Minister does not have responsibility to the House for what happens the general public have a right to know what happened.</P>
    <P>Crime is one of our biggest problems and unfortunately it is increasing.  There is no short answer to it.  It is important that the Garda be given the additional men they are looking for.  Right now they need a further 2,000.  I hope they are given those numbers and if it is necessary that they need an extra 3,000 I hope the Minister will approve those extra men.  I do not believe the taxpayers would object.  If it is necessary we should change our laws to help the police do their jobs properly.  A certain amount of progress was made in this area by the Minister's predecessor.</P>

      <P>I was thinking of what stopped it coming to fruition.  Two Supreme Court decisions blew everything sky high.  A lot of very valuable work had gone into it.  Despite the fact that the Minister is short-staffed as a result of a Government decision, the resources available to him should be working more in this area rather than bringing forth legislation for which there is no demand.  I am talking about a Bill we hope to see here within the next two or three weeks.</P>
      <P>I might be forgiven if I score a political point here, although I do not want to score in a personal way off the Minister, but in my view the public would prefer to see the efforts and energies of public servants being channelled into producing legislation which would help the police to do their difficult job rather than having those energies channelled into dealing with matters for which there is no great demand&mdash;perhaps giving into political blackmail because thumbs are being screwed by Members of this House, Deputy Kemmy and Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a very grave responsibility for prisons.  I know he did not mean to single out the staff of one prison only and forget the others.  All prison staffs do a very good job.  I know many of the staff at Mountjoy Prison personally. They do great work but so do the staffs in other prisons.  In case anybody outside the House might read something into the Ministers omission, I am deliberately drawing his attention to this so that in his reply he will have an opportunity of putting the record right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management in prisons, other than Portlaoise, have their difficulties compounded because they have to do without the facilities which were available for the ordinary prison population up to the time Portlaoise was set aside for subversive and paramilitary prisoners.  In Mountjoy we have a very overcrowded situation. One senior official in the Department used to say it was bursting at the seams. He would be pleased if another prison <Col N="1392" /> was available to which to transfer some of those prisoners.  Management, staffs and prisoners too, would be happy if other facilities were available to ease the overcrowded situation</P>
    <P>Because Portlaoise has so many long-term prisoners many of them still have the greater part of their sentences to serve and space there is very scarce.  Last April or May a decision had to be made to try to accommodate a number of Portlaoise prisoners somewhere else.  Ten Official IRA prisoners were brought to a particular wing in Limerick Prison.  Portlaoise is still overcrowded.  In a way this is a good thing because it shows the Garda are catching people engaged in subversive activities and bringing them to the courts.  This shows the success of the Garda.  One of the problems about their success is that facilities have to be provided for prisoners.</P>
    <P>Recently there were a number of press reports about more prisoners being shifted to Limerick.  If the Minister has to do that, that will be all right because that decision has to be made and I will do my best to help him effect that change.</P>
    <P>These are high risk prisoners and must be contained.  It will give rise to problems. There are ten prisoners there for about three months and it is costing £219,000 in additional overtime.  This is due to additional surveillance of these prisoners.  It shows taxpayers the cost of containing people in high security prisons. Many prisoners in Limerick prison which caters for 110 or 115 ordinary prisoners, are to be transferred if what we read in the newspapers is correct.  I do not know where the Minister will put them.  The Minister should comment on this because of the amount of speculation in the newspapers.  If 80 or 90 prisoners in Limerick are to be brought to Mountjoy what will happen in Mountjoy?  Does the Minister propose, to use a departmental phrase, to shed a large number of prisoners, that means release them before they have completed their terms in prison?  I am sure the Minister will be glad of an opportunity to say what he proposes to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> I read with interest a few weeks ago that a junior Minister, one of the lucky ones who was brought to the front on her first day in the House, made great virtue out of the fact that Loughan House would be closed when the detention centre at Lusk was opened.  Of course it will be. That was always the intention.  Somebody should fill her in and tell her what was arranged and agreed.  The only regret we have is that it has taken so long to build the centre.  The problems which arose between builders, architects, the Board of Works and so on slowed it down.  I was advised that it would have been provided in three years.  I know that this is not the Minister's area of responsibility but rather that of the Minister for Education. However, the Minister might tell us how far we are from this coming into being.</P>
    <P>The Minister is under political pressure to stop the building of the new prison complex in Wheatfield, Clondalkin.  This complex would provide a new detention centre which would replace the St. Patrick's institution in the Mountjoy complex for 100 or more young offenders.  It would also provide a new female prison for the type of person we have to accommodate in the female wing, which is a basement in Mountjoy at present. I appreciate the pressures he is under because the same pressures were on me. I had many a group on my back trying to prevent the building of this new prison. The Minister knows that he has a grave responsibility to go ahead with the provision of proper prison facilities for those committed to prison by the courts.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to get money for prison building because it is always something that can be left over until the next year.  The Minister's three immediate predecessors, Deputies Collins, Cooney and O'Malley, fought very successfully at Government tables to remind different Governments of their responsibilities with regard to the provision of proper prison facilities and a prison building programme was put under way.  This must be continued.  I do not care where the pressure comes from, the Minister's first responsibility is dealing with prisoners. They must be provided for and must be given humane and decent facilities. <Col N="1394" /> That is what my predecessors and I set about doing.  I know that is what the staff of the Department will advise the Minister to do.  The Minister should be strong enough to resist the pressures put on him whether from his own constituents or others.  There should be no reneging in this area.  If there is we will have to have much discussion about it.  I do not say that to threaten the Minister or intimidate him because that is not my form.  It is a serious matter that I feel deeply about.</P>
    <P>For too long we were content to forget the conditions under which our prisoners lived.  The Minister should allow nothing to come in his way that would impede progress on building the new high security prison in Portlaoise.  That prison is intended to take the prisoners who are currently in the Curragh prison so that it can be returned to the Army and civilian prisoners no longer kept there.  That is the reason why I was able to go to our Government and, despite the fact that money was scarce, get money from them to strengthen the building programme which was started before my time.</P>
    <P>There are a group who argue that we should not have prisons at all.  Good luck to them.  There is need for prisons.  Perhaps we should have more open prisons such as those in operation at Shelton Abbey and Shanganagh Castle.  I pay tribute to my predecessors for helping to develop this open prison system and also to the forward thinking of officials in the Department who helped me to go along with this concept.  It is extremely successful and humane.  It is dignified.  None of us, Minister or not &mdash; I will be across in that seat soon again &mdash; has the right to interfere with the dignity of a person who has lost his freedom as a result of a court decision.  Open prisons cost more than closed prisons.  The Minister will have my support in maintaining the impetus of the prison building programme.  However, he will have a lot of discussion here and elsewhere if he fails to maintain the momentum which was built up over nine or ten years by those of us who were Ministers at that time to get where we are at present.</P>
    <P>In June a Government White Paper <Col N="1395" /> was authorised in regard to community service orders.  I would like the Minister to interest himself personally in this area. It had to do with the welfare of prisoners. We invited comment on this from interested persons and we asked for the comments on the proposed scheme by the end of August.  I trust people were sufficiently interested to comment.  There are many demands on the Minister but I would appeal to him to make this a priority and get this community service order under way.  A great deal of good could emanate from it.  I know how happy prisoners were building a scout hall out in Tallaght.  I know how happy they were building a centre for old folk out in Dun Laoghaire.  This is something we should encourage.  We must, of course, hasten slowly.  Naturally mistakes will be made and the Minister runs the risk of flak from certain people but I can assure him that 90 per cent of the people will be behind him.  They may not be vocal but they will be with him.  This scheme would relieve overcrowding.  That is very important. We have a very dedicated prison staff and a wonderful management.  I had many disagreements with them over the years but I appreciate the fact that they are very fine people, an extremely dedicated people.  There will always be some who kick over the traces now and again but, if they are pulled back on to the right road, there will be no problems.</P>
    <P>The legal aid board is operating successfully, though not apparently to the satisfaction of some who want a different kind of scheme.  The Minister and his party are on record as saying they would change the scheme and introduce a scheme of their own.  Does the Minister propose to make any fundamental changes?  I doubt that he does so propose. I am not trying to score off the Minister but I was convinced, as were those advising me, that the scheme we introduced was operating satisfactorily.  It was planned to extend the scheme.  Is there a proposed extension and is it intended to provide more centres?  There is the problem of lack of finance but I would ask the Minister to ensure that this scheme is extended.  One of the best ways to defeat <Col N="1396" /> the scheme would be to prevent its extension and there are some who would welcome that defeat but the result would be that control would be taken out of the hands of the Minister.  If the Minister does not extend the scheme he will run the risk of wrecking it and so he has an obligation to extend the scheme.  Or is it intended to change the scheme and make it a free for all, something which was advocated by the Minister's party in opposition to ensure the right solicitor would be available at all times.  I trust the Minister appreciates the danger and will take whatever action is necessary to avoid it.</P>
    <P>Shortly we will be discussing a Bill which is in the Seanad at the moment in regard to the provision of additional High Court judges.  Is an embargo being placed on the provision of staff in the courts? There have been reports that vacancies have not been filled.  I would like the Minister to give us in detail the present situation.  I mention these matters in the hope that the Minister will follow them up and that some progress will be made in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister has the best interests of the Garda Síochána at heart.  I hope he has and that consequently he will do everything possible to help them in regard to the many new schemes and to the various ideas they have.  Some of these schemes are so new that we do not have available to us within the Government service sufficient expertise to advise us on the merits or otherwise of any situation. In saying this I am thinking in particular of the work that went into trying to reach a decision about what was necessary for the Garda in order to make them more mobile and more agile in dealing with criminals.  I am thinking in particular of helicopters and light aircraft. There are some who believe that all the work should be done by helicopters but there are others who think differently. However, I am confident that a mix of the two would be helpful.  I found it confusing on visiting places outside the country to find that while the chief of police in one city considered the use of a small plane to be as good as the use of a helicopter in a number of instances, the chief <Col N="1397" /> of police in another city was completely opposed to that kind of thinking.</P>
    <P>There is no professional expertise in the Department of Justice to advise on such matters but it is the responsibility of the Minister to find the expertise and to bring the scheme in question to fruition with the least possible delay.  A chief superintendent was appointed specifically to head a Garda investigating unit in this area with the purpose of deciding finally on this matter.  While I was Minister I realised that I was not in a position to make a decision on the use of a specific type of aircraft.  A lay man is not in a position to make such a decision though I made whatever input I could into the scheme.  The decision must not be delayed further.</P>
    <P>I should hope also that the college which was opened some time ago at Templemore for the purpose of providing refresher courses for senior members of the Garda will have the full support of the Minister.  I had a deep commitment to that project.  Perhaps it will be found possible to replace the temporary college there with a more permanent one in the not too distant future.  There were plans on those lines and, while there was a certain amount of agreement, some problems arose when some people wanted changes in the plans.  That has put the project back somewhat.  Unfortunately, I did not have enough time in which to have the whole matter signed and sealed before leaving office.  There is no political reason why we should not agree on this matter.  The service being provided is very valuable.  It is essential.  It provides senior members of the force with an opportunity to meet and to discuss the various problems that affect them.  In addition they are brought up to date on changes in the law, on techniques and so on.  One superintendent who completed a course there told me that he was pleasantly surprised with the value he got from it.  The college is regarded as temporary because of its being located in a temporary building but the intention was that these refresher courses would be on a permanent basis and that the college would form part of the whole training college complex at Templemore.  I hope <Col N="1398" /> there will not be any question of changing that decision.</P>
    <P>I understand that another member of my party will be talking during the debate about the whole area of law reform.  This is the area with which the Minister of State, Deputy Spring is involved.  There is a strong need for more activity in the area of law reform despite the fact that we have achieved much in this sphere. However, we had hoped for more.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment.  He was one of the lucky ones, another favourite who, on his first day here was given his stripes so to speak. I wish him well and I have no doubt that as a southerner he will do well.  Incidentally, I am not sure that the Harvey Smith sign which I am getting from Deputy Kemmy in the gallery is appropriate to the House.  Perhaps at an opportune time somebody would explain the courtesies of the House to the Deputy but I regret that he finds it necessary to try to interrupt me in this way.  However, I shall ignore the matter and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>There are very difficult problems to be solved in the area of law reform.  One area in which the former Minister of State in this Department was involved was the area of the licensing laws.  Deputy Doherty had brought the preparation of legislation to an advanced stage but there remained many decision to be made.  We shall welcome any proposals that emanate from that section of the Department and shall help the Minister to put whatever reforms are considered necessary through the House.</P>
    <P>Again, on a personal note, I wish the Minister every success in his office.  So far as I am concerned I assure him that I will refrain from engaging in politics in respect of any of the issues with which he must deal.  He shall have nothing but help and encouragement from this side of the House in regard to his work especially on the question of supporting the forces of law and order.  We will help him in every way possible in regard to whatever help he considers it necessary to give to the Garda or to members of the prison service in the extremely difficult area in which they must work.</P>
    <P>Ambitious programmes had commenced <Col N="1399" /> in the Department before my time as Minister.  Indeed, they had commenced before the time of my predecessor there so it is hardly necessary for me to assure the Minister of our support in bringing these programmes to fruition. One such programme that comes to mind relates to the prison system.  If that programme were to be interrupted now it would put us back 30 or 40 years so far as that area is concerned.  I was concerned recently on hearing that one of the architects involved in the work told one of the builders involved to slow down and to start tidying up his operations.  If this is true we will have a lot more to say about it here.  I wish the Minister the best of luck for whatever length of time he remains in office.</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to refer to is the comment made by the previous speaker regarding the pressures which he understands have been building up on the Minister for Justice about the proposed new prison in Clondalkin, County Dublin.  I want to add to those pressures and to urge on the Minister that he discontinue the building of that project.  I do not think that too much pressure will be required on the Minister towards that end.  He himself said in this House on 13 June 1980 as recorded in the Official Report of that date, column 659, volume 322; referring to that prison in Clondalkin:</P>
      <P>How can the Minister justify the building of that prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Literature was circulated by a member of the Minister's party before the last election indicating that commitment had been given that the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, would abandon the building of that prison in the event of Fine Gael being returned to office, which has happened.  That prison is not required at all in that area.  There are other means for the rehabilitation of prisoners who are in mind for that institute.  It is not wanted and a commitment was given not to proceed with it by the Minister himself. I urge the Department strongly to abandon that project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a few brief remarks on the legal aid question.  The criminal legal aid system as it has been operating over the last few years operates reasonably well.  It provides a valuable service to persons accused of crime at different levels. However, the cost of it has escalated by reason of increase in legal fees and various other considerations, and some regard will have to be had to arrangements to improve the system and to achieve better value for money for the State in the provision of that service.  In particular the report of the Criminal Legal Aid Review Committee makes reference to a number of suggested improvements at least some of which I <Col N="1402" /> urge should be looked at favourably in the Department of Justice and by the Minister.  There is an incredible waste of time on the part of practitioners, solicitors, barristers and gardaí which also relates to what we are talking about here today.  In many of the district courts in the country at 10.30 in the morning one can find 15, 20 or even more solicitors and a courtroom full of gardaí the majority of whom are compelled to wait there until two, three or four o'clock in the afternoon and very often the matter for which they have come will not be raised at all.  It would appear that their entire day would have been wasted and they are compelled at public expense, in the case of legal people on the legal aid panel, and at the expense of the Department in the case of the Gardaí, to come back another day for the same purpose.  Enough attention has not been given to the allocation of time in the courts and to the division of types of work in the courts that could be fixed at varying hours instead of listing all matters for 10.30 a.m. or whatever time applies.  I know that there would be difficulties in doing that and that it is difficult to forecast exactly how long any one case will take, but inquiries can be made and there is room for work in that regard.  Any improvement that would be achieved there would represent a tremendous saving.  The people who staff the criminal legal aid system are providing a very valuable service and contribution.</P>
    <P>I am not at all happy, however, about the civil side of legal aid.  The position is totally unsatisfactory and inadequate.  It is quite likely that unless substantial alterations and improvements are achieved in the civil legal aid scheme this country will find itself once again in the humiliating position in which it found itself following and as a result of the decision of the Human Rights Commission in the Airey case which, as we know, decided that constitutional and basic human rights were not being maintained for members of the public.  Therefore, the Government of the day were compelled, as it were, to bring in legislation providing for some measure of civil legal aid, which they did.  In the event, the number of centres is entirely inadequate.  The new <Col N="1403" /> towns in particular are very large centres of population and no centres are provided there, although this is the kind of location where the primary need for that kind of service would be.  The tendency seems to be to locate the centres in the inner-city areas, places which have become increasingly bereft of population, from where the population have moved to the outlying areas.  It is in those new towns in the outlying areas that those centres or additional centres ought to be located.  In any case, even the centres which are there find themselves now at this early stage of their establishment quite unable to cope with the burden of work coming their way.  My information is that in many cases a member of the public seeking assistance has to wait for a considerable time, months in some cases, before being granted the facility of even a preliminary appointment or interview for the purpose of obtaining necessary advice.  The extent of the scheme is inadequate too, not only by reason of the number of centres but also because of the limited type of cases which the centres are prepared to undertake.  They confine themselves to family law problems and while that is a very important measure on which spouses require legal aid it is far from the only subject requiring attention.</P>
    <P>People of insufficient means who wish to undertake legal proceedings in the High Court, which description would apply to the overwhelmingly majority of people, who are involved in road accidents or injured at work on building sites, factories and so on &mdash; and these accidents are increasing &mdash; find themselves in a very difficult position when they set about trying to get compensation for injuries which they have sustained.  The problems involved in undertaking a law case against one's employer for negligence or against negligent drivers and so on requires a degree of expertise not only by lawyers but also by general practitioners, specialists, surgeons, engineers, surveyors, architects, planners and people in many other specialised fields.  Without being able to call on those experts a person can be, and many are, deprived of justice.  The cost of those experts is very <Col N="1404" /> expensive.  All too often it has been left to the haphazard, voluntary and, in many cases, charitable efforts of experts in these various fields to determine whether an injured party has a remedy or not. That is as much a denial of a basic human right as that suffered by Mrs. Airey.</P>
    <P>The opposing side in claims of this nature are the insurance companies. They can call upon all the degrees of expertise they require, and they do.  They know the tricks of the trade and they play cat and mouse with unfortunate members of the public who are not in a position to have the very expensive expertise needed to prosecute many of these claims.  With regard to accidents at work involving defects in very complex machinery and equipment, without the services of an engineer who is an expert in that field a person has little hope of success in a dispute claim with a large factory owner backed by and conducted by the insurance company.</P>
    <P>The law centres as at present constituted would not be able to cope with the volume of work that would be required to service the members of the public in their needs for a free legal aid scheme. At present I can see no way out of this, but a comprehensive free legal aid scheme using solicitors in private practice should be set up.  I suppose I should declare my interest as a solicitor in private practice.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the services of that group will be required in the initial stages at least unless and until a widely based and staffed number of centres can be provided with the expertise backup that is required to give them the teeth they need in complicated legal actions.  A scheme of that nature was advocated and called for in the Pringle Report in 1977.  It called for a comprehensive legal aid scheme covering all civil legal problems and it was described at that time as being of urgent necessity.  The urgency of that necessity has not decreased since 1977. On the contrary, it has very much increased.  The need for legal aid and advice is not confined to matters of cases in courts.  The rights, liabilities and status of people is very much affected in modern society by the decisions of other tribunals <Col N="1405" /> which are not courts &mdash; the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the various social welfare tribunals and An Bord Pleanála. Legal aid and assistance to those in need is required and should be provided by the State as a matter of basic human rights for people who have to go before tribunals of that nature.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on some of the institutions, for want of a better word, which come under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  The Land Registry is one of them and the workings of the Land Registry in recent times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that there is nothing specific in this Supplementary Estimate relative to the Land Registry.  Accordingly, will you make a very brief comment on it but do not set a headline which would allow other people to stray too far from the present debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can because Item A.1. on the Supplementary Estimate refers to salaries, wages and allowances in the Department.  I was about to say that the degree of service being provided in the Land Registry in one respect, namely, the completion of papers and dealings that are lodged there, leaves a lot to be desired.  In many cases delays in that office are running to three, six, nine or even 12 months.  I do not know if that unacceptable situation is due to the deployment of staff, the adjustment of staff, the need for additional staff or some other reason.  As this comes under the <Col N="1406" /> aegis of the Minister's Department he should have a look at the situation.</P>
      <P>Unacceptable delays are taking place in very many courts.  The old saying goes: &ldquo;Justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo;.  In the High Court, particularly, the situation is quite incredible, with time lags of from two to four years occurring from the time of a case being got under way to the actual hearing.  That is entirely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The premises of the Registry of Deeds in Henrietta Street also come within the Minister's ambit, forming as they do part of the King's Inns premises.  The procedure adopted in the Registry of Deeds are so antiquated that it is high time that the administration of that Department was reviewed.  The present system was brought in by an Act passed in the reign of Queen Anne, if I remember rightly, and the procedures followed there have changed very little since.  Some slight improvements have been introduced by permitting the memorials of the documents filed there to be typed rather than handwritten, but very many major improvements could be provided with the use of modern techniques.  The Minister might look at the question of permitting photocopies of documents <i>in lieu</i> of preparing a separate memorial document for lodgment there.  The premises themselves leave much to be desired.  They are very old, incommodious and inadequate. I wonder that the staff working there have not complained bitterly about their conditions; perhaps they have.  It is desirable that the Registry of Deeds should move inwards somewhere towards the Four Courts building and that a more modern building be provided in place of the present draughty, old and inadequate building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, in his absence, on his appointment and wish him every success in his post which, as the former Minister pointed out, is a very difficult one.  We on this side of the House will try to be contructive in every respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were dealing this morning with the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  Those of us <Col N="1407" /> who have been previously in the House are aware that Supplementary Estimates are not unusual.  I think I am correct in saying that practically every Department submits Supplementary Estimates around this time of the year.  The Minister tried to make some capital out of the fact that he felt it necessary to introduce now a Supplementary Estimate and alleged that the previous Government had not estimated correctly or accurately and had completely under-financed the Department. As we all know, that is not so.  It is, however, relevant to make this point and to remind the Minister of it.</P>
    <P>Recently, we were circularised with a report on crime for the year 1980.  The facts which emerged from that report make very distasteful reading.  The serious rise in crime in this country and particularly in Dublin city engenders many fears and anxieties.  Late last year and early in 1981 the number of armed robberies, for instance, had decreased but these are once more on the increase.  The figures for the past three months were given here this morning and must cause concern to all those involved, the Department of Justice, the garda and, particularly, the public.</P>
    <P>During 1970, for example, according to figures released some time ago, there were approximately 31,000 indictable offences but in ten years that figure has increased to 73,000&mdash;a staggering increase of something like of 135 per cent to 140 per cent.  During the same period the number of murder offences increased by a further 122 per cent.  These figures can only make staggering reading and cause us tremendous concern.  This report indicates a reduction in the detection rate.  In 1970 the detection rate was 50 per cent and in 1980 that dropped to 40 per cent.  In calculating percentages one must take into consideration the very large increase in the number of offences between 1970 and 1980.  While the number of offences detected during that period increased very sharply, unfortunatley the percentage for the overall figure decreased.</P>
    <P>During the period from 1977 to 1981, the strength of the Garda force increased <Col N="1408" /> from something in the region of 8,000 to 10,500.  There is not a Member in this House who will not concede that a very substantial further increase is absolutely necessary, by reason of the rise in crime about which we read daily in the newspapers and which we see happening on our streets.  It is obvious that if the forces of law and order are to combat crime with any degree of success, the number of Gardaí must be increased substantially. Financial considerations are very important but should be secondary as far as keeping law and order is concerned.</P>
    <P>The previous Government gave a very serious commitment to increase the manpower of the Garda Síochána.  I hope the new Government will keep that commitment.  It would be a very shortsighted measure to do otherwise.  It is therefore rather disappointing to note from the Minister's speech today that the Government have decided to recruit only 300 new gardaí.  We gave a commitment to increase the force by up to 2,000 members, 1,000 within a very short time with a total of 2,000 over a longer period.  I am sorry to note that the Minister has decided that an urgent increase of 1,000 members is not necessary.  Statistics should convince him otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is a Dublin Deputy, should be well aware of the high rate of crime in this city and the shortage of gardaí in many areas.  We have only to pick up the evening newspapers any day to see what is happening.  The <i>Evening Press</i> yesterday evening had several headings on the front page such as &ldquo;Man Hurt In City Payroll Van Robbery&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mother-to-be tied-up In Raid.&rdquo;  Inside the same paper there is a headline &ldquo;Garda Overtime Cut Urged.&rdquo;  The article under this heading indicates that the garda have been informed that due to the economic measures taken by the Government certain cutbacks will have to take place in the Garda Síochána.  It also states that in some city districts individual officers have already implemented cutbacks in overtime and some rank and file members have alleged that the crime detection rate has suffered.  The new Government do not seem to appreciate that it is absolutely <Col N="1409" /> vital to give the Garda every support to ensure that the level of crime is reduced substantially.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us today about a slowing down in the training process at the Templemore centre.  Apparently it will not be possible to take in new people for training until next February.  There is very little excuse for such a long delay. People engaged in any type of administration know that it does not take up to six months to recruit new people for training in the Garda force or elsewhere. When we were in Government it took a much shorter time to bring 300 recruits into Templemore.</P>
    <P>Dublin is particularly bad as far as crime and law-breaking are concerned. In 1980, 58 per cent of the crimes committed took place in the Dublin area.  The number of assaults on gardaí is rising each year.  It is unfortunate that the courts do not support the Garda when serious crimes like this come before them.  The public are very concerned about the growth in the number of assaults on gardaí</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made this morning to the drug problem.  This is a very serious situation.  The statistics for 1979-80 show that there has been an increase of 67 per cent in the number of charges in relation to drugs.  The previous Minister for Justice referred today to the fact that we have only 25 members in the Drug Squad.  This is the total number involved over a 24-hour period.  When we make allowance for the fact that those people operate on a shift basis and that during the day members of the squad must be present in the courts to give evidence in the case of drug offences we realise how few are left on the streets.  If we divide 25 by three we get eight plus one and after we make allowance for the matters I have mentioned this reduces the squad to about three members on duty at a particular time.  This is not adequate and does not indicate that the drug problem is being taken seriously by the authorities.</P>
    <P>War should be declared on drug abuse and drug crimes especially in Dublin where the problem has escalated in recent years.  Drug abuse has spread all <Col N="1410" /> around us in colleges, schools, clubs and on the streets.  If a person goes down particular streets in Dublin between 7 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. any night pushers can be seen quite openly pushing drugs. What is happening?  Our young people who are victims of this type of traffic do not see any member of the Drug Squad because the squad is inadequate to deal with the problem.  The population of Dublin is almost one million people. People in their right senses understand that it is totally unrealistic to expect that the small number of Gardaí who are specialising in drugs can curtail or control the problem to any significant degree.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give priority to this problem.  As Deputy Birmingham will agree, we discussed this matter very recently at a Dublin Corporation city council meeting.  Some of the experiences related to members of the council by experts at that meeting showed in depth how serious the problem is.  Unless some strong definite action is taken, not in the near future but now, we will have a problem on our hands which we will not be able to solve.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem is the absence of any knowledge on the part of many adults, and parents in particular, about drugs.  An education programme is required.  Perhaps it could be organised by the Drugs Squad through schools and colleges for the pupils and through residential associations for parents and adults, or through parents' groups in schools.  It is vital for parents to understand exactly the difference between different types of drugs.  The terms &ldquo;hard drugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft drugs&rdquo; are used very frequently.  To many adults these are only words.  They have not the remotest idea of the difference between one drug and another.  I am not suggesting that any drug is better than another.  I condemn totally the use of all drugs.  Education is vitally necessary for parents so that they will be able to communicate with their teenage children, understand how serious the problem can be, and talk to their offspring about drug abuse.  In that way it might be easier to find some solution in some cases in a family context.</P>
    <P>I should like to see greater security in <Col N="1411" /> regard to the smuggling of drugs at our seaports and airports.  The checking procedures are not strong enough.  There are no visible signs of any thorough check at the ports.  As we all know, it is very simple for people to carry a very large volume of valuable drugs on their persons.  We must find some more sophisticated means of detecting persons carrying any type of drugs.  I advocated previously that we should look at the experience in some of the continental countries where they use sniffer dogs for this purpose.  The authorities must look at some new methods of detection.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious that drug peddling between countries is now a major form of traffic.  Ireland is no exception.  We will not escape from this type of dealing.  We are new to the market for many dealers. They look upon us as a growing market, and a market in which they have become very interested.  That is precisely what is happening today.  As a country we can never spend too much money to protect our young people against drugs.  Anybody who has witnessed the effects and the traumatic experience of those who have taken drugs, and of the parents of children who have been involved, will agree that no matter how tight our financial resources might be, this is an area in which we should not cut back in any way. We should invest as much as possible for the good of our community and our young people.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes a specified amount for protective equipment for the Garda.  Recent events have shown us how important it is that the right type of equipment and clothing should be used by the Garda, particularly during riots and civil commotion.  During the most recent and serious riots in Ballsbridge some months ago, we saw that the batons used by the Garda to defend themselves were totally inadequate against the weapons of the rioters.  Subsequently I saw a report that longer batons were being purchased for the Garda to use in such circumstances. Obviously this is just one aspect of what is badly required in the context of proper equipment and clothing for our forces.</P>
    <P>There has been greater experience of <Col N="1412" /> civil riots in other countries including one not very far from here.  We should learn from the experience of the forces of those countries.  For example, the RUC in Northern Ireland have discarded certain types of equipment which they used initially in the early parts of the seventies. They found this equipment dangerous and cumbersome and inclined to make the forces using it immobile in certain circumstances.  Therefore they were in greater danger in riots and so on.</P>
    <P>Fire proof clothing is an absolute necessity in the times we are living in.  I know the Minister will be pursuing this line and looking at all the possibilities to ensure that our Garda are adequately protected in the event of future civil commotion arising.  Naturally we all have a tremendous pride in our police force. They have served the country extremely well over the years.  They have acted very impartially in every respect.  The ordinary citizen has a very high respect and a very high regard for the members of our Garda.  Therefore it is disappointing &mdash; perhaps it is an Irish trait &mdash; that a garda may find himself in difficulties in a street brawl or something like that and members of the public ignore what is taking place, pass on and mind their own business. That is happening much more frequently now in attacks on ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>Inner city violence is one of our major problems.  Daily we have muggings.  We have an increasing number of assaults and robberies in our own city.  There are not enough garda on duty on the beat.  It is very difficult for any sophisticated methods to equal the effect of gardaí walking about.  In other countries they are now reverting to putting more and more of their police on the beat.  This can be much more effective.  It instils greater confidence in citizens and in the event of a robbery or assault it is easier for the Garda to apprehend the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>In this city there are a number of districts that have been described as &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas.  We should not tolerate this kind of situation in any circumstances.  It is absolutely vital that we take steps to end it and no effort should be spared.  If these <Col N="1413" />&ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas were to spread throughout the city we would have a serious problem on our hands and it would make life unbearable for the citizens who must go about their daily business.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in the number of road accidents and we know that a major cause is excessive alcohol.  We have many laws regarding the drunken driver, the condition of vehicles and the wearing of seat belts about which legislation was enacted not long ago.  Yet, many of our laws are being broken day after day.  For example, how many times have we seen motorists practically footless getting into cars outside pubs and lounges and driving away?  This kind of crime is as bad as that of the persons who goes out deliberately to cause injury to another party.  I do not think sufficient control is being exercised with regard to drunken drivers.  There is the breathalyser but its use in many areas is more exceptional than normal.  I should like greater efforts to be made in this area and greater vigilance exercised by the Garda so far as drunken driving is concerned. It is a major contributory factor to most road accidents that occur, particularly at weekends.  One has only to take up the newspapers on Sunday to read of the many accidents that occurred on the previous night, usually between 11.00 p.m. and 3.00 a.m.  Most of these accidents involved persons who were under the influence of alcohol.</P>
    <P>In the debate this morning Deputy Mervyn Taylor referred to free legal aid. Legislation was passed some time ago with regard to this matter but the position is not completely satisfactory.  The service must be extended considerably.  In my constituency there is the Coolock Legal Aid Centre.  The centre has been doing excellent work for a number of years but it has financial problems at the moment. I know the people concerned have been in consultation with the Minister and his officials and that representations have been made by local Deputies.  I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister to give serious consideration to their application for a grant.</P>

      <P>I thought it relevant to make a passing reference to the centre without getting involved in any political point.  I am sure that in future circumstances Deputy Birmingham and I will combine our efforts very successfully.</P>
      <P>I regard the figure of 300 new gardaí as totally inadequate and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  In Dublin city we need many more than that.  I presume the number involved will be for the purpose of filling vacancies throughout the country but we need more than that in Dublin.  The figure proposed by the previous Government was much closer to requirements.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision.</P>
      <P>I should like to make particular reference to the question of equipment and clothing.  Obviously the budget has affected that matter considerably, particularly with regard to VAT.  The cost of transport has been increased substantially. In this instance the Garda Sióchána are no exception.  It will cost the Department of Justice much more to furnish the Garda with the equipment that is so badly needed to continue the fight against crime in this city and in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of transport, unfortunately there have been a number of accidents involving Garda cars.  I refer to the problem that exists when gardaí chase a car thief.  There are mixed feelings about what should be done in those circumstances. <Col N="1415" /> The garda on the spot is faced with the decision whether to pursue the thief or vandal.  If he decides to take positive action, this will place citizens in a certain amount of jeopardy.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at this figure of £2.8 million because the officials of one health board &mdash; and I had broadly similar figures from other health boards &mdash; indicate the total will be around £12 million.  For instance one board gave me a figure of £9 million and if we take the voluntary hospitals into account we will get the figure I mentioned.  I note increased ESB charges are not included in the Minister's list and I take it that the increases applied by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism have not been taken into account.</P>

Is her philosophy in line with that of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly, who decried this whole attitude in this House yesterday of the poor in institutions seeking a payment of more than £4 or £5 a week?  As a socialist Minister and a member of the Labour Party, will she dissociate herself from the statement of the right winger here, the Minister for rising prices, who is responsible for people having difficulty in buying certain things out of £4 or £5 a week?

      <P>I am aware that delays can be experienced in obtaining refunds of the cost of prescribed drugs and appliances. Health boards have been asked to make arrangements to minimise delays in the payment of refunds of the cost of very expensive drugs.  Delays could also be minimised if claims for refunds were submitted as early as possible following the month in respect of which a claim is made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 more than 415,000 claims for refunds were made at a cost of more than £7 million.  The average number of claims per month was 34,600 while the average delay in payment of refunds from the date of application was five-and-a-half weeks.  It has been suggested <Col N="1432" /> that the hardship which can be caused by delays in payments of refunds could be eliminated if patients had to pay only a limited amount to pharmacists in respect of any one prescription, the balance being claimed by the pharmacists from the health boards.  While this happens on an individual basis at present, pharmacists are unlikely to accept such a generalised procedure since it would entail extending substantial credit to health boards.  If pharmacists were to be compensated for delays in payment in order to have their acceptance for this procedure the cost of the scheme would increase substantially.</P>

This situation is particularly severe having regard to the £500,000 which, as we learned yesterday, is being taken from this area in the latter part of this year.  This means that costs will be higher for the individual.  What period of delay is expected to occur in the last quarter of this year?</P>

This is grossly overcrowded due to the massive increase in attendance there and the directors of the centre have indicated that the treatment facilities at present are totally inadequate <Col N="1436" /> for the number of people attending who are suffering from the abuse of drugs.</P>

The question of whether ill-health exists in high rise accommodation is not in doubt, it is merely the degree to which it exists.  Does the Minister think that his Department have been irresponsible in the past ten years in not setting up some form of commission to investigate the degree of ill-health considering that the high rise flat complex in this city has the biggest concentration in Europe of young children and unmarried mothers?  Medical research papers from the UK and many other European countries indicate that ill-health co-exists with living in high rise flats.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for eligibility for medical cards are set down in section 45 of the Health Act, 1970.  Responsibility for applying these criteria in deciding on applications for medical cards rests with the chief executive officers of the health boards.  To assist them in making such decisions, the chief executive officers have drawn up income guidelines. These guidelines have been revised periodically to compensate for inflation. I understand that a review of the guidelines will shortly be undertaken by the chief executive officers.</P>

How can the Minister expect the private dentists to co-operate if they are operating on a stop-go basis?

      <P>Before moving the adjournment of this debate, I had covered various aspects relating to the serious increase in crime in our cities, particularly Dublin city, and the growing and wanton destruction of property, vandalism and all these areas in which crime unfortunately has been increasing over the past number of years.  It would be well to reflect also that during the past ten years the value of property stolen has increased by 1,200 per cent&mdash; a considerable increase even allowing for the rate of inflation during those years.  In 1970 the value of stolen property amounted to £1¼ million as against £14½ million in 1980. All Members will agree that this situation certainly requires immediate and urgent attention.  I am not overlooking the excellent work of the Department of Justice and the Garda in recent years, but an additional urgent effort must now be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us back to the numerical strength of the Garda and the assurances which they must receive from the Minister that he will continue the commitment given to them by the Department and the former Minister for Justice in relation to <Col N="1449" /> strengthening the number of the Garda force by about 2,000 over a period.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt in some detail with the drug problem and with drug pushers. Allowing for charity, most people will recognise that drug pushers can be described as worse than murderers, because they destroy and murder young lives and family life all around them.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will urge the officials concerned to put every means at the disposal of the Garda, and particularly the Drug Squad, to strengthen their efforts in their battle against this hideous crime.  Nobody in this House would argue with that description.</P>
    <P>I again pay tribute to the Garda for their tremendous work over the years and urge that every support be given to their efforts.  In this respect it is rather unfortunate that on the Minister's appointment, the morale of the Garda may have been damaged by the appointment of a former Commissioner to advise the Minister on Garda activity.  I make this point rather carefully.  We should all be aware of the beneficial effect to the community over the years of our very fair-minded Garda force.  They should be supported as the upholders of law and order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Vote to give further moneys to works which emanate from the Office of the Minister for Justice. What I have to say refers to that section of the additional sums being voted for the management and control of prisons.  My remarks are influenced as much by the speeches I have heard, which have been very concerned ones, as by the fact that for nearly 14 years I have been interested in research and teaching in the area of deviants in our lower society. That is an appropriate point at which to begin.  As I listened to the speeches and read reports from the Department of Justice in different administrations, I have been struck by the paucity of resources allocated to research.  This is reflected in the approaches and opinions which we hold concerning crime and criminality. Probably there is no other area which <Col N="1450" /> would have yielded as quickly positive results of a social policy kind, had we had the forward thinking and the commitment to try to understand the behaviour which is deviant behaviour and that portion of it which ends up as the crime of our society.</P>
      <P>In this Supplementary Estimate there is no figure which will enable any serious contribution to be made to this omission. It is interesting that people are willing to address themselves in their concerned and well meant speeches to the problem of the reactions to crime but they are not, of themselves, addressed to the nature of crime or to finding out how crime comes to manifest itself in our society.  This is a very serious omission.  What these people are speaking about are, in fact, bits and pieces and they are ignoring the source of the problem.</P>
      <P>For example, with the limited resources to do all that the previous Deputies have spoken about, is it not of concern to us that we spend a great deal of these scarce resources in the pursuit of petty crime?  We make decisions that we will concentrate on the pursuit of petty offenders for the most part.  I want to have a certain logical structure to what I have to say in this regard.  In the different reports which have emanated throughout the years I question the utility of the figures presented to us as a true indication of the crime rate.  No self-respecting sociologist in the area of criminal behaviour, or criminologist, or lawyer interested in the criminological background of legal offences would be willing to accept that these figures are anything but a very crude indicator of what is happening in society.  These do not include, for example, great corporate crimes which visit immense misery on people.  It is disturbing to look at the annual report to the Minister for Justice of the commissioner and see those who might take vast sums out of a company, forcing that company into liquidation, thereby, if the stamps have not been paid, visiting immense misery on people who will have to drag their way to seek the means to live.  Corporate crime is not represented very accurately and indeed it is not a concern of people who speak about crime in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> There are other forms of such crime which are not represented either.  Those are the crimes which have a low visibility on society.  We find represented and, in fact, over-emphasised, the regular crimes of people from deprived backgrounds, people who are involved again and again with the law.  There is an immense responsibility to be carried by the responsible sections of the media who have run a campaign to suggest that there is almost a natural relationship between low income and crime.  People who live in deprived circumstances in the Dublin area have regularly to put up with badly researched, inaccurate and offensive allegations against working class areas and low income areas about the crime rate.</P>
    <P>Let me place on the record of the House that there is not a bit of evidence to suggest that there is a neat relationship between urban living and crime. Researchers have issued publications in the last few years showing the expansion of criminality into the rural areas but yet the analysis suggests that Dublin is, of its nature, a place that is naturally impelled towards crime and that the rural areas are somewhat immune from crime.  This is an example of the distance between scholarship and policy in this area.  I find it appalling in 1981 that we have, as a substitute for consideration about crime, its causes and its effects, a series of whimiscal bits and pieces of prejudice patched together and not only an omission in relation to substantial research but I might say, as somebody who has sought permission to conduct research from the Department of Justice and from Deputy Collins when he was Minister for Justice, no co-operation.  I have had the spectacle of my research students being told they could not visit the prisons or prisoners. As the longest teaching and practising research sociologist in crime in this island I have had nothing but hostility in relation to my approaches for co-operation in relation to research.</P>
    <P>I got the impression over the years that it is not only that we want to blind ourselves in relation to what is happening in the area of research in relation to criminology but that we want to obstruct <Col N="1452" /> research.  The popular version of this is to suggest that people like myself who are interested in the nature of the prison system, alternatives to prison or moving towards more humane alternatives to prison are somehow soft on crime and soft on criminals and we represent some liberal tradition which must somehow or other be slapped down or it will pose a threat to the structure of an otherwise safe society.</P>
    <P>Our present approach can be summarised in a sentence.  It is rather as if we had decided to concentrate the whole thrust of our energies into trying to understand the nature of fire extinguishers and not trying to understand the nature of fire. That is a summary of what we have produced from different versions of the Department of Justice and different Ministers in this area.  It has no regard to the general point of the omission of a commitment to research into the social policy areas about attitudes towards crime and justice.  There is the annual report I have referred to of the Commissioner of the Garda to the Minister, a well-meant document but practically useless for research purposes, enabling us to answer questions about the total volume of property stolen and recovered but not able to tell us anything about the incidence of crime by district, county, social class or sex, or to give any useful information we might need to make a proper policy decision. Over the years the format of the report remains the same.</P>
    <P>I want to make a positive suggestion about this.  The Minister of State should address himself as a matter of urgency to changing the nature of the presentation of the report and perhaps prepare a methodological appendix to the report indicating the source of the figures and how they have been arrived at so that students in this area can go on to make some suggestions about future research because we have not even begun yet. There is another <i>caveat</i> I want to enter in relation to the question of crime.  In those Estimates people frequently speak about the spending of money towards the containment of crime but society often finds itself involved in a tautology when it <Col N="1453" /> comes to the incidence of crime.  Society finds crime where it looks for it.  If you do not dispose of your resources in different parts of society you will find, lo and behold, a low conviction rate, whereas, if you concentrate your resources on low income areas, on areas where you believe, by a myth you manage to carry with you in relation to locations of crime, that the crime rate is high you will find that it is so.  It is time we got behind those crude assumptions so that we might evolve a policy and can spend our scarce resources in a more accurate, fruitful and rewarding way.</P>
    <P>My criticisms in relation to the Department of Justice are of the institutions of the Department rather than of the people in the Department.  If I have had obstruction in research I have had individual relationships with members from time to time whom I have met at seminars over the years and I have found them to be understanding and humane people.  They have an immense task because they are not handed the resources with which they might do many of the things I am referring to but they find themselves performing within a range of prejudices in society without having the resources or the opportunities to look at the alternatives which are now being practised in other more considerate, more humane societies.</P>
    <P>In the Vote we have today about the additional money to help run the prisons the Minister for Justice is looking for money to handle the consequences of failure in relation to expenditure in social welfare and health.  When we look at the background of the people who are in prisons we find again and again that they are people from deprived backgrounds, people who had no opportunity in life and whose parents have not had the experience of full-time employment for a great number of years.  When neither parent works for two or three years, when recreational facilities and employment opportunities are very few, those people having the benefit of a bad address they know that the police will be regularly around looking for information, and on that vigilance on behalf of the property committed society these people are supposed <Col N="1454" /> suddenly to develop a value system that will lift them out of all this and make them as good as anyone of the property-orientated middle class.</P>
    <P>We have tried to control such areas in the interests of people who do not care about justice but who care about property and we have not sufficiently tried to understand the nature of those areas in terms of the opportunities that are available to the young children and the blighted social existence forced on their parents.  Is it any wonder then that the concentration of our concern is about money and spending more?  Are we going to get more?  If one went on like that to extend it to its logical conclusion one would have a vast police force and one would never ask a question about the structure of the society to which one was addressing one's concern or vigilance.</P>
    <P>I mentioned one summary statement earlier.  If there is another one that can be made at this stage about the Irish approach towards justice it is that we have been interested in controlling our society, rather than understanding it, and in controlling it in the interests of prevailing values of property.  We have omitted to try to understand it in terms of the life prospects of the people who are in trouble in our society.  The result is clear in the prison statistics.</P>
    <P>By and large people in Ireland do not go to prison: By and large in Ireland very few people commit acts of violence.  They are not in prison for that.  They are involved in crimes against property.  How absurd in the month of November 1981 to be addressing ourselves to whether we are spending enough money on managing the prisons, and ignoring the question as to why unfortunate people are pushed into involvement in crimes against property, ignoring the questions of scarcity and deprivation.</P>
    <P>I must say frankly that I was appalled at the reaction of Deputy Collins and the people who advised him to the published report of a commission on which I sat, the Commission of Inquiry into the Irish Prison System in 1980.  The people who sat on that Commission were asked to investigate the Irish penal system and to <Col N="1455" /> come up with suggestions on the basis of information which might be available to us either in submissions or our own research training.  We were described as a self-appointed committee.  That is the co-operation we got.</P>
    <P>We were refused co-operation. Repeated letters from the chairman, Dr. Sean McBride, met an obdurate refusal of co-operation.  We pressed ahead.  We paid our own expenses for the 51 meetings we held.   We paid our own money to publish the report which contains a number of suggestions.  I urge the Minister of State to take that report and use some of the positive proposals, and not do the cheap thing his predecessor did on this matter, which was to take a figure we had included for prison services for education and say the one figure we had wrong within the report absolved them from considering the general principles in the report.  There was the little seedy suggestion: &ldquo;They got a figure about education wrong.  They cannot be trusted.&rdquo;  The entire report was thrown out on the basis of a quibble about a figure.  These were voluntary people, scholars, doing a job in the interest of society and they were regarded with contumely by people who should care about reforming the penal system.</P>
    <P>That is our record.  When everybody has stopped congratulating everybody else this afternoon, it is time to face up to some positive suggestions about the prison system and how we are spending money within it.  I have been saying that we have the record of obdurate refusal to seek to understand the social setting in which people find themselves who will be later represented in the crime rate.  Of course behaviour which is criminal reflects something about our society.  I listened to the concerned, passionate pleas from people interested in drug abuse among our young population. People are very sincere about that.  How can you divorce the question of drug abuse from the fatalistic tendency of our culture and society and our general commitment to escapism reflected in the expenditure level for alcohol and cigarettes?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> People are evasive in their response to society and look for the first drug that is available.  That kind of social expenditure is linked to the drugs question.  It is not that the drug question is something like the 'flu and you can discover a vaccine and start dishing it out and it will suddenly stop.  The abuse of drugs is a social phenomenon which exists in society in circumstances which can be understood. We are ill-equipped to understand it with our consistency in the matter of ignoring research and concentrating on tactical responses: have we enough people on the streets?  Have we enough people doing this, that and the other?</P>
    <P>Of course we need to give more money to the Drug Squad.  I agree with that in many ways, but that is not the end of the matter.  Our approach is to suggest that there are people who consume drugs and then there are the moral community who do not.  The moral community are a drug-prone community spending the highest proporation of their income in Europe on trying to get rid of the fact that it is a society with people filling themselves with alcohol and tobacco in proportion to their income.  This community is setting itself up to judge people who are using other forms of drugs.</P>
    <P>I would urge the House to be cautious about accepting the glib statements being made to try to suggest that one kind of drug is the same as another.  People who sell heroin, for example, are commiting a most incredible, monstrous crime against people who might be potential addicts.  As every sane person knows, there is a difference between the attitude adopted to cannabis and that adopted to heroin.  I cannot develop this point very much more, because we would have a short-term cheap construction of my remarks that somehow or another I was in favour of one thing and not of the other.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of an understanding of the social setting in which drug consumption takes place.  I suppose I have an advantage.  About 16 years ago I worked in the same department with Professor Lindesmith of the United States when he was looking at the question of the drug problem in the United States society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Some of his work later was to develop a social response to it.  In Ireland there is ignorance on these questions and a commitment to stop research and not to conduct research.  I am making a plea for money to be provided in this Estimate for research in this area so that we can know more about the people about whom we are pontificating moralistically in a property ridden society.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we should be discussing what is in the Estimate rather than what is not in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My assumption was that the presence of some things in the Estimate precluded the presence of other things, and that one thing had driven the other thing out.  Perhaps that was idealistic of me.  I will turn to what is in the Estimate.  I should like to talk about the probation and welfare service under subhead G for which we are voting money. You cannot discuss the adequacy of the probation and welfare service and the appropriate expenditure without understanding the prison population towards which that expenditure is addressed.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Collins, in a speech in which he congratulated his successor, Deputy Mitchell, referred more than once to lobbies which had developed and would develop in relation to the provision of additional expenditure on prisons, or the provision of a new prison.  I count myself among those who are unequivocally of the opinion that to spend money in this decade on the provision of further prison facilities for women is insanity.  It is part of a general rejection of findings from all over Europe and the United States.  Prison is limited in what it achieves.  If you were to say, for example, that its purpose was to punish you might argue that prison has been successful.  If you were to say its purpose was to rehabilitate, the evidence from every society is that it is costing millions and is an expensive failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcomed before now, and I do so again, the publication of the White Paper <i>Community Service Orders</i> which began <Col N="1458" /> a discussion on alternatives to prisons. This was a step in the right direction.  On the question of the money which might be spent to administer prisons in which women may find themselves, I want to say that women are a very tiny proportion of the prison population.  People are not usually aware of the fact that there was a tremendous decline in the rate of conviction applicable to women between the twenties and now.  In 1979 women represented 6.7 per cent of the criminal population despite being 50 per cent of the population.  For that 6.7 per cent it is suggested that we proceed with the building of a new prison for women.  Let us look at the 6.7 per cent.  For what crimes were women sent to prison?  In the year 1979 to which I referred 26 women went to prison for drunkenness, 57 for larceny, six for soliciting and two for begging. Thirty-one women were convicted of offences involving violence such as assault or malicious damage to prison.  In 1978, of the 137 women sent to prison the daily average in Mountjoy was 15 and in Limerick prison it was nine.</P>
    <P>If there are such small numbers of women involved in crime, why waste resources in a custodial measure which the whole of Europe is saying is limited in terms of its efficacy generally and rehabilitation and which in the case of women is so wasteful in relation to what it can achieve?  The crimes I mentioned, drunkenness, vagrancy, prostitution are all socially derived crimes and intervention in the area of social welfare or in better economic provision would eliminate the need for such crimes.  Of course there is always less than half a dozen people &mdash; never more &mdash; who need secure custodial care.  I want to dispose of another criticism usually offered against people who represent views as I do.  It is that if one is against the expenditure of considerable resources for, say, prison buildings one is somehow or other contributing to the bad conditions in which prisoners now find themselves.  Everyone wants to improve the physical setting of people who are deprived of their freedom for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>There are practical measures which I <Col N="1459" /> ask the Minister of State to urge on the Minister for Justice that relate to some of the points raised in the debate.  I will make one practical suggestion.  Why not arrange for the Department of Justice to invite the universities to co-operate with them in the establishment of an institute of criminology?  We all know of the considerable sums that are necessary for attendance at conferences and so on. Why not have an entirely new generous era of co-operation between the Department of Justice and those of us who are involved in research on crime and delinquency?</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that everything is negative.  I have said already that there are people who produced proposals which I welcomes on the document dealing with community service orders.  They are part of an approach towards alternatives to prison.  Unfortunately the Department of Justice have to deal with people who are consequences of failed economic policies and of failure to intervene at the level of social welfare and health.  They are operating in an atmosphere in which people are concerned about custodial solutions rather than alternatives.  In many ways it is not the prisoners we need to educate, it is the population.</P>
    <P>In a country such as Holland people realise how offensive it is in very deprived areas to drive large cars through such areas as an example of ostentatious wealth.  Unattended property may also be an example of such ostentatious wealth, and we wonder why people who have been deprived of everything in life commit crimes of theft.  That attitude in some European countries is to decriminalise certain crimes: in other words, people are asked to behave responsibly in the way they brandish their portable property in the face of the deprived.  That is something we might look at.  Why waste resources in going after the youngster who breaks into a car?  We bring him before a process, that was described accurately by Deputy Mervyn Taylor, that clearly and carefully establishes an identity of criminality.  The person who has been before the courts will tell one of <Col N="1460" /> the merits and demerits of the various justices.  He will know how to commit crime again.  At that point society is well on the way to schooling the next generation of criminals and their crimes establish the morality of the property majority in society.  Then, we can have further debates here about the efficacy of the resources to protect our property from the people who represent a threat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins, in urging the Minister to press ahead with new buildings, was revealing a dreadful misunderstanding of the nature of crime in our society.  I have been urging the Minister to forge a new understanding of the nature of crime.  It is not buildings we need.  It is a better mind towards the incidence of crime and the background to that crime.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the efficacy of expenditure in relation to other matters that are non-custodial, for example, the treatment of people outside prisons. I wonder when the Dáil and the Seanad were concerned about the way in which the prisons function and the aims of the prisons?  During the years I have read reports of Dáil debates on the matter of crime I have never heard anybody make a case, for example, that the aim was to rehabilitate exclusively, or that it was to punish exclusively.  Governments of the day received excellent proposals from people who worked in prisons but they failed to implement them.</P>
    <P>There are those who operate on the tacit philosophy that the purpose of the prison system is to punish.  It is time we had a explicit statement that this is not so.  If the aim is to rehabilitate, I urge the Minister to seek the resources for adequate rehabilitation, for adequate vocational and educational training within the system and for the linked community schemes.  There should be an attempt to understand the dilemma of the prison population.  For example, do we think that people who were in prison for years were helped by being released from prison at a weekend, perhaps when there was a bank holiday, only to find every social agency closed, with no place to go to get assistance?  Those people could stay out for four days but they had no place to go.  Then we were surprised that <Col N="1461" /> people who had been in prison originally for stealing were driven to stealing once again.  There is also the situation where people on leaving prison went to one employer after another only to find that when their recent address was made known they were not wanted.</P>
    <P>Of course, now there are good services, and I commend the people who began this consultation with prisoners about employment, prospects before their release from prison.  However, it is not enough.  There was a concern in the trade union movement in the forties and the fifties that needs to be strengthened now. The trade unions have an important contribution to make here in seeking to help rehabilitate people whose employment prospects are diminished following their release from prison.  Our attitude should be a caring one.</P>
    <P>There are other procedures we should use before a person gets to prison.  When young people are detained is it not more useful&mdash;something that does not happen&mdash;to remove them to some kind of hostel where they can have directed towards them assessment, counselling and help rather than to leave them in a Garda station overnight?  Is it better to create the image of prison containment in the minds of young people rather than offering them some kind of concern?  Lest I be accused in the usual reply to statements like those I am making, of being soft on violence, the violence I am addressing myself tois an institutional violence, an uncaring society that perpetrates the violence of not seeking to understand the deprivation that produces the crime rate, the violence of institutional structures that seek to punish rather than rehabilitate, the violence of a hypocrisy that seeks to protect property at any cost and takes glib examples of threats to property as a substitute for analysis, the violence of the newspapers which castigate the deprived from poorer areas and fail to seek understanding.</P>
    <P>I endorse the many useful suggestions made in this debate.  I urge the Minister to put an end to the absurdity constituted by the Curragh prison, the only prison in Europe administered by military personnel.  The report of the visiting <Col N="1462" /> committee in 1977 said when discussing the Curragh military unit that there was a requirement for workshops or some facilities, and a lack of facilities for the rehabilitative training of prisoners in military custody.  The committee were aware that in a prison with a population of between 22 and 27 prisoners the provision of such facilities might be disproportionately costly and not get full usage. The visiting committee were to be frustreated in most of their suggestions.</P>
    <P>On the question of expenditure, might I direct a question to the Minister?  Is he satisfied that the visiting committee structure will provide him with suggestions for improving prison conditions?  I suspect it is deficient for a number of reasons.  The well-meaning people who find themselves on these committees feel they are involved in a tokenism and have often been frustrated by what they felt was their inability to seriously influence things.</P>
    <P>On the question of prison services, I welcome any expenditure that can improve the lot of those in prison or those who have to look after prisoners.</P>
    <P>On the question of salaries, every criticism I have made so far has been of social attitudes in relation to crime and prison.  If the justice system has to deal with the neglect in the economic, social and health area, equally the people who run the prisons find themselves operating with inadequate resources.  If the Minister says he is going to move qualitatively away from a philosophy of containment and punishment to one of rehabilitation and care, he will have to give the resources often asked for by different prison officers' associations.  They need the opportunity for training and preparing themselves to deal with people in great difficulties.  Because of an insufficiency of numbers the best intentions of these people can be frustrated.  The Minister should make provisions for that.</P>
    <P>The point that keeps occurring to me is the manner in which we discuss expenditure for the Department of Justice in a society that is completely committed to a backward view of crime.  We were in favour of crime historically when it meant we could get property.  We nodded and <Col N="1463" /> winked at a rural criminality that often perpetrated violence against people and animals in the cruellest sense.  Today, when we are faced with the petty crime of the city areas, our attitude is the opposite&mdash;to turn on defenceless youngsters, and impoverished families from the neglected areas.  If we offered compassion for rural violence historically we now have the opposite attitude to crime in the urban areas.  Our attitude towards urban crime betrays ignorance, with people learning their social philosophy from the <i>Evening Herald</i> rather than from any serious attempt to try to understand the nature of the distribution of crime in our society.</P>
    <P>I said prisons in terms of their efficacy were limited in what they could do in the area of rehabilitation.  This was borne out in the Canadian report, all the European reports, the Scandinavian report and two years ago by an interparliamentary report in Britain.  I ask the Minister to take the community service order as a small beginning in his approach to developing alternatives to prison.  The Minister has in his Department, even though it arrived uninvited, the report of the commission into the penal inquiry system on which I sat. I place on record my apology to officials who detected an inaccuracy in it in relation to total sums for education.</P>
    <P>I ask the officials to urge on the new incumbent of the office of Minister for Justice a more generous response that an inaccuracy should not be sufficient to dismiss the report altogether.  That report contains valuable suggestions for restructuring the Department of Justice and the prison system.  It made suggestions about the treatment of offenders and the setting up of a treatment of offenders board to look into the whole question of rehabilitation, custodial care and prevention. One unit of expenditure on intervention saves us from waste of resources in building vast custodial places which serve no great purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to promise the Minister co-operation on this, as somebody who works in an academic institution.  If we are invited we will respond and help him to develop all his other custodial services <Col N="1464" /> by committing ourselves personally and institutionally to the conduct of research. For far too long and at too high a price a gap has grown between the modern findings of research in the area of crime and actual policy response.</P>
    <P>I recommend that we be imaginative, particularly in the area of the young people who find themselves in difficulty with the law.  It is fascinating that, quietly and unobtrusively, many gardaí in their middle and older years are acting as unofficial councillors to young people in difficulties.  We need to formalise that.</P>
    <P>Let us take the one official source of figures we have: the annual report of the Garda Commissioner to the Minister for Justice.  He tells us how much property has been stolen and how much has been recovered, how many crimes have been perpetrated and how many proceedings have been initiated and proceeded with. That simple research statement gives it all away; we are a society concerned about our property and less concerned about the life prospects of our society.  If we balance the logical equation that comes from that it is that the population is in difficulty and our property at risk.  It is high time we addressed ourselves to the anti-social attitudes based on a property philosophy which provoke incredible difficulties in lower income areas.  We should look at the whole gamut of our response and expenditure in the area of justice to try to redress the balance in favour of the deprived and their children.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their appointment to what is a difficult Ministry and wish them well in their efforts there.  Crime and vandalism are something every part of the country is subjected to at present.  Private and public property, even schools and churches, are vandalised.  The number of cars stolen and burned in the Dublin area is increasing every week.  The number of <Col N="1465" /> robberies, especially those with violence, have increased.  In his speech Deputy Collins said that 85 bank robberies took place in the last three months.  Out of that number 70 were in the city of Dublin. Old people have been beaten up and robbed and this year a priest on his way to say Mass was murdered.</P>
      <P>In my constituency I am informed that people who are concerned about vandalism of churches and schools have formed vigilante groups.  These people do not get any pleasure from doing this work but because of the serious understrength of the Garda in the area they have no option.  In the Ballymun Garda station they operate a four-shift system.  There are only two sergeants and four gardaí on any of these shifts.  On days when some of them have to attend court the station sergeant has to operate the station on his own and deal with phone calls and attend to people who call to the desk.  I am also informed that the garda who was allocated to look after the school attendance duties had to be withdrawn because of the shortage of staff.  At any given time there is only one garda available to do patrol duty in an area which takes in the whole flat complex, the new housing schemes of Poppintree, Santry Avenue and part of the Glasnevin area.  Since the Garda station was opened in Ballymun some years ago this whole area, due to the housing developments at Poppintree and Santry Avenue, has increased threefold, yet the number of gardaí employed at the station has decreased. There is great credit due to the Garda for the services they provide in the area in view of the serious strains they are subjected to because of insufficient staff.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, was very aware of the need to strengthen the number of gardaí in the Dublin area and gave a commitment to recruit 1,000 extra gardaí to be trained for areas in Dublin where they were understaffed and where crime was on the increase.  As the Minister said in his statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.... the Government have decided to recruit 300 new gardaí&mdash;the maximum number possible that the Templemore <Col N="1466" /> Training Center can cope with&mdash;as soon as possible after the Civil Service Commissioners provide me with their complete list of successful applicants. This list is now expected in January next and actual training is expected to commence in February.</P>
    <P>When will they be available to do duty on the streets?  It will be at least next May or June.  The setting up of the Special Task Force was a special tribute to Deputy Collins.  Deputy Collins gave no credit to himself but to the officers operating the force.  In the early part of this year there was a decrease in the number of bank robberies.</P>
    <P>There is doubt in the minds of people who are concerned about crime whether the present Government are concerned when only 300 extra gardaí are to be recruited.  I am informed that the adviser to the Department is the former commissioner. We can look back to the time when he was commissioner, to the one-man squad cars.  When requests were made to gardaí to go to the scene of a crime the reply was that they had squad cars and motor bikes parked outside the stations but no one to operate them.  The recent announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare that it is the intention of the Government to close Loughan House have com-how little they know about crime.  Young criminals in Laughan House have committed serious crimes.  Otherwise they would not be there.  They are now to be let loose or transferred to what can be described as a first-class luxury hotel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins spoke about what they do in European countries.  We are concerned with what should be done here. Many of these criminals do not come from deprived areas.  Many of them come from well-to-do areas.  When they are released from Loughan House the Government should have some schemes whereby these offenders could be made work in areas destroyed by vandals. Some of the existing law in regard to crime and vandalism is over 100 years old.  When the Garda apprehend criminals and bring them before the courts the criminals are very often let off or put on <Col N="1467" /> probation and many of them go on committing crimes.</P>
    <P>There are, I suppose, many reasons why young people become involved in crime.  One may be the lack of sufficient recreational facilities.  Today young people are better fed.  They have more leisure time.  They have more energy compared with their counterparts of 20 or 30 years ago.  Today there are no chores or duties assigned to boys and girls when they come home from school and they need something to help them get rid of their energy.  Recreational facilities would help them to get rid of their energy and, if there are no such facilities, they will resort to vandalism.  Those of us who travelled with Dublin Corporation to Belfast last year saw the recreational facilities available to young people there.</P>
    <P>Another cause of vandalism is the availability of alcohol to young people. They can buy drink in off-licence premises and supermarkets.  Provided drink is not in a corked receptable and is not consumed on the premises they are not dreatking the law.  In most cases the management and staff of off-licence premises and supermarkets feel very strongly about selling drink to young people, but they have no option.  If they refuse they are subjected to abuse.  My colleague, Deputy Seán Doherty, when he was Minister of State in the Department of Justice was preparing legislation designed to correct the present unhappy situation.  I trust this Government will not delay in updating legislation in relation to teenage drinking.</P>
    <P>One problem which contributes to the existing situation is the ease with which extensions are obtained.  To these extensions can be attributed the increasing number of fatal and serious accidents on our roads.  It was established in a survey carried out by Jervis Street Hospital some time age that the majority of those involved in road accidents had a far higher level of alcohol in their blood than that permitted by law.  It was also established that the majority of serious accidents take place in the early hours of the morning after the pubs close.</P>
    <P>The increase in drug-taking by young <Col N="1468" /> people is a problem to which many Deputies have referred.  There has been an increase of six in the Drug Squad recently.  The Minister should consider seriously further increasing the number. There should be no penny-pinching and no cutbacks.  Crime and vandalism will have to be curbed and any money spent to achieve that object will be money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate and I apologise for not being here during the entire debate&mdash;I was here for the greater part of it&mdash;but my absence was due to the fact that another debate in the other House also affected my Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett, to take the last speaker first, seemed to suggest there was some type of ex-commissioner advising my Department.  I do not know how he reached that conclusion.  There is no ex-commissioner advising my Department in any capacity.  He mentioned that only 300 were being recruited to the Garda Síochána.  The fact that there is no recruitment at the moment cannot possibly be a criticism of my Department.  It can only be a criticism of the previous Government.  The chronology is that recruitment did not start until May-June of this year when advertisements were placed.  There were over 6,000 applicants. More than half of those were exempt from the entrance examination because they held the requisite standard in the leaving certificate.  About half of those who sat for the examination got it which means that well over 4,000 have to be interviewed.  Because of the number of successful applicants the interviewing process is taking longer than expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister said he was given to understand these interviews would be completed towards the end of October or early November and that was the information given to me when I became Minister. Unfortunately the interviewing process is taking much longer than excepted.  This is a matter completely outside my control because the Civil Service Commissioners are absolutely independent in the discharge of their <Col N="1469" /> functions.  I understand the earliest the list can be concluded is January and recruitment will commence in February. It would be quite unfair to start recruiting from a partial list because we would be filling vacancies with people who might not necessarily be at the top of the list at all and so we have to wait until the list is completed.  If there is any criticism then it is a criticism of the Deputy's own party for not proceeding with recruitment much earlier, the more so as this sort of delay could reasonably have been envisaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said we are recruiting only 300.  That is not so.  We are recruiting 300 immediately.  That is the maximum number that can be catered for in Templemore.  That is not to say that when their training is complete, there will be no further recruits in training.  Of course, there will.  I said we will not recruit until the list is complete.  I have agreed that one class of recruits, numbering 25, will be recruited from the middle of this month and that they will being training within the next couple of weeks.  I have done this because of there being a spare capacity in Templemore.  The 25 will consist of applicants from the last list who had not been recruited and none from the new list, which is not yet complete.</P>
    <P>In order that the House will have the precise numbers in respect of applications I have with me a note which shows that this year the number of applications received was 6,521, that of these, 2,663, were exempt from the entrance examination. The number of applicants who sat for the examination was 3,849.  That examination was held on 30 July and there were 1,568 successful candidates. This leaves 4,231 candidates to be interviewed but I am sure Deputies will appreciate the length of time that this process will take having regard to the sheer physical exercise involved.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much the good wishes extended both to the Minister of State and to myself by those Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  I am greatful in particular for the offer of help from the former Minister.  Having been in charge of this Department for four-and-a-half years, Deputy Collins is well <Col N="1470" /> aware of the onerous task that is involved.  I shall endeavour to answer the various points raised in as much details as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Collins in paying tribute to the staff of the Department.  Compared with other Departments the headquarters staff is quite small but when we include all the personnel of the Department, Garda, members of the prison service and so on, we are talking of about 16,000 people.  We are fortunate in having such an efficient, concerned and forward-looking staff in the Department.  Not only are they concerned about the welfare of the people generally for whom I have responsibility but they are concerned also for the welfare of prisoners.  That is a message that should be understood generally by Deputies.</P>
    <P>In general Deputy Collin's speech was gracious and helpful but he was fit to take me to task for what he considered to be a political point.  He said that the Department of Justice was not an area in which we should engage in politics.  It was not my intention to make a political point but it would be unforgivable of me if, on coming into the House to seek approval for a very substantial Supplementary Estimate, I failed to say what led to the necessity for the different components of this Estimate.  I referred to the fact that in the Estimate for Garda pay alone there was a shortfall of the order of £4.3 million. There were shortfalls in respect of other areas also.  It was known in January that another £4.3 million would be needed to pay the Garda having regard to the basic rates which applied then. That was not an error of judgment.  The files in the Department show clearly the process that was engaged in.  A shortage of money was arranged deliberately.  On December 22 last there was a Government decision to cut the Garda Estimate by 5 per cent.  On foot of ministerial directions there were further cuts in the Garda Vote on 13 and 14 January.  The first direction was to cut the Vote by £6.608 million while in the second instance the cut was in the amount of £2.43 million.  The net effect of those cuts was that no new posts were created and <Col N="1471" /> there was a shortfall of £4.36 million in the provision for the basic pay of the serving strength.  I note that in his speech Deputy Collins did not go into detail in this regard though when I was referring to the matter he interrupted me to say that I was indulging in rubbish.  I repeat that the story I gave is the true story and I am willing to have an independent assessment of the files in my Department to prove what I am saying.</P>
    <P>These cutbacks occurred at a time when it was announced that 2,000 extra gardaí would be recruited.  That sounded fine but subsequently it was announced that 1,000 gardaí would be recruited. That was open to the interpretation of being a further 1,000 but on examination it transpired that it meant 1,000 of the 2,000 announced originally.  What was not conveyed was the news that the recruitment would take a long time and that to increase the strength of the Garda by 1,000 takes about three years.  This is because the greatest number that can be trained in any six months is 300.  Allowing for natural wastage of 150, the biggest increase in any one year is therefore 450. That represents 900 in two years so that in order to recruit 1,000 we are talking in terms of going into the third year.  Therefore, the statement made by the last Government about recruitment was wrong and misleading.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins accused me of trying to convey the impression that the £31 million being asked for in this instance is due entirely to decisions made by him.  I did not at any stage try to convey any such impression.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked for the cost of the H-Block matches and so on.  The estimated cost over and above the normal policing by the Garda Commissioner was £3.5 million for the current year for the policing of the H-Block marches.  It is a huge sum.  If we had not had to spend that significant sum look at the things that we could do with it.  Think of the number of jobs we could create and the improvements we could bring about in some of our prisons about which some people have complained.  It is a very large sum to be spent on just one set of marches at <Col N="1472" /> a time of deep financial crisis.  I take this opportunity to appeal to the people who have engaged in these marches&mdash;which, I am thankful, appear to be over&mdash;and to people who might think in terms of organising protest marches of this kind to reflect on the cost of those marches to the State and the damage they are doing to the economy in diverting scarce resources from areas of priority where they should be spent, such as job creation.</P>
    <P>I was greatly impresed by Deputy Collin's Comments on the drug situation. As I said earlier, I did not get into a very wide-ranging speech on this because I had been advised that I was required to stick to the matters raised in the Supplementary Estimate.  However, some Opposition Deputies have taken up this point. Deputy Brady was critical of me because there were only 25 members of the Drug Squad in Dublin.  I tell him that his criticism is misdirected.  Since I came to office the Drug Squad have been increased very significantly.  Also, Deputy Brady seems to be blissfully unaware that his party colleague was Minister for Justice up to only four months ago.  Having said that, there is no doubt that the drug situation in this country is now of alarming proportions. I am satisfied that it is at the base of many serious crimes.  It is at the base of widespread human misery and that misery is not confined merely to the drug addicts but spreads to their families, parents, wives, husbands, children and friends.  The explosion in Drug-taking is one of the most awful developments in our society for many a generation.  This affects my Department only to the extent that my Department are responsible for crime prevention and crime detection. The Misuse of Drugs Act which regulates the drug situation is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I am happy to tell the House that very soon after taking office I had a very lengthy discussion with the Assistant Commissioner for the Dublin Metropolitan area, the inspector in charge of the Drug Squad and one of the chief superintendents in the DMA on this very chronic problem.</P>
    <P>I asked for a quick report, a broad outline of the extent of the problem.  I am happy to say that I received this recently and <Col N="1473" /> now I have asked for a more detailed report on the drug situation and what measures we might take to reduce it.  Of course, it is not an easy matter to tackle. The drug situation in Ireland is but part of a massive international problem.  I was in Geneva recently at a meeting of Ministers of Justice of the Council of Europe and there I took the opportunity to discuss with my colleagues the whole drugs question.  I am happy to say that there is growing international co-operation which is not confined to Europe but is also in many of the source countries, Africa, the Middle East and South America, trying to prevent the trail of human misery and deprivation.  The House can be assured that I, as Minister for Justice, see attention to this terrible problem as one of my top priorities.  I will do everything I can to help the Garda reduce the problem and bring those people who import drugs and those who push them to justice.</P>

      <P>In passing I have to say that it has been expressed to me that the penalties for drug pushers should be much more severe than they are.  I am prepared to contemplate that.  It has also been said to me that perhaps the courts are too lenient in this regard, and that is As matter for the courts to reflect upon. As far as I am concerned no penalty would be too severe for people pushing drugs and thereby peddling human misery.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the time left to me to reply is very short.  I apologise to Deputies that I will not be in a position to reply in detail to the points they made.  On prisons, it was mentioned by Deputy Collins that there was exceptional crowding in Mountjoy.  It is no more crowded now than it was four months ago.  He raised the point of whether I was pursuing a policy of shedding prisoners.  All I can say is that I am continuing the policy which I inherited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points have been raised about the prisons at Clondalkin with Deputy Collins strongly advocating and some Deputies, <Col N="1474" /> notably Deputy Taylor and Deputy Higgins, strongly opposed especially to the women's prison there.  Deputy Taylor cited the Official Report when I, in Opposition, opposed the siting of the prison at its present location.  That is true, and the record speaks for itself.  The question now arises as to whether I, as Minister for Justice having inherited a situation where so much work has been done already and so much public money spent, could in conscience reverse that situation. The Department are committed contractually to work which will keep going until June or July, maybe August or September of next year.  That is something over which I have no control.  I will be reflecting very carefully on the subject and I will be very interested in it because it concerns my constituency.  Deputies can be assured that I will make whatever decision I consider to be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I regret that I was not here for Deputy Higgin's speech.  I heard a bit of it.  I know of his very long-established interest in the whole area of criminology and all I can say to him is that I will be reading his contribution in the Official Report with great interest.  If he is interested in getting help in any aspect of research in the area of criminology he can be assured of my fullest co-operation.</P>
