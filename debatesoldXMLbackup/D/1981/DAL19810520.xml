      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I raised the Turf Development Bill with the Tánaiste last week.  I see now that it has been given a very low priority today.  As I explained previously, the introduction of this Bill has very much prejudiced existing bog development grants which are cancelled pending the passing of this Bill.  It is on the Order Paper now for months and grants that were available last year are not available this year.  It seems to me to be a device for saving money.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the jurisdiction of the courts which we dealt with fairly comprehensively in the context of the Courts Bill.  What appears to be the approach to the business of the lower courts is less than satisfactory.  I do not grasp the reason why claims exceeding £15,000 should be dealt with in the higher courts and why the only criterion that applies in relation to jurisdiction is one of finance.  I can envisage circumstances <Col N="3245" /> where jurisdiction could mean not merely monetary values but the nature of the case and gravity of the issues involved.  The only jurisdictional cut-off point, not just in this Bill but generally speaking in the courts, relates to finance. I question that.  The implication is that sums of money less than in this case £15,000 are <i>per se</i> of less gravity.  That may or may not be the case.  The whole point of the money being claimed in this case would have to be seen in the context of the solvency or wealth of the parties involved.  I wonder if our simplistic and traditional attitude to jurisdiction which exclusively relates to monetary values is worthy of comment and if we should review it.  We should consider a different type of jurisdiction, one which would say that certain types of cases by their nature need the kind of superior deliberation that the higher courts can give.  There is a degree of dissatisfaction about a cut-off point as outlined in section 8(1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Keating in relation to jurisdiction would be more appropriate for legislation dealing with proposed changes in jurisdiction.  The general practice and the practice envisaged in the Courts Bill, 1980, now the Courts Act, 1981, is being continued where the Family Law Bill before us is concerned.  The right to have claims of over £15,000 heard in the Circuit Court is possible by consent of both parties.  Without that consent claims of £15,000 and more will be heard in the High Court.  There is nothing extraordinary about sections 6 or 7, which we have already dealt with.  It is a question of property that is involved and property has monetary value.  Costs and expenses incurred also have a monetary value. What is proposed under section 8 is appropriate and correct in the context of what we are dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Can that jurisdiction be changed by ministerial order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my fundamental <Col N="3246" /> objection to inserting into legislation monetary values that cannot be changed except by the introduction of new legislation, because they build in injustices. They do not allow the Minister of the day or the courts to take appropriate cognisance of inflation of values in the context of the day on which the court case occurs. It is unreal and naive to suggest that the only way we can change these limits is by introducing new legislation.  We have not exactly been lumbered by too much family law legislation in the last number of years and I do not anticipate that we will ever get as a priority a Bill dealing with the upward revision of monetary limits in the Family Law Bill, 1981.</P>
      <P>As a basic formula for ensuring justice on a continuing basis we should build in where possible a mechanism whereby a responsible person, perhaps answerable to the House, would be able to do what is intended to be done in this Bill, that is, to ensure that the limits we speak about are realistic in the context of the price of the values of the day.  This does not do that.  It means that somebody who has a case under this Bill dealing with property valued at £14,000 is enabled to have it heard at a certain level of court.  However in ten or 15 years' time that value remains the same and the £14,000 would be reduced to one-third of what it now is and the person would then be obliged to go to the High Court to have the case fully heard, depending on the attitude of both parties.  That means that in two successive years the same standard will not apply in the courts or in the context of this Bill.  I cannot understand why as a guiding principle we do not include in this Bill and in every Bill which has monetary values a mechanism for re-evaluation which would do nothing more than take account of inflation and the values of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the suggestion that we have not had a considerable amount of family law legislation in recent years and a considerable amount of commitment and involvement in the sensitive area of family law.  I assure Deputy Keating that he can compare the record of a <Col N="3247" /> previous combination of parties who claimed to govern this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not bring politics into it this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and he will note that we have exceeded their efforts and that much more is in preparation.  I am satisfied that we will have considerable time in future years to bring that type of legislation into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy L'Estrange would have said, you are whistling past the graveyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is in the best interests of the people whom the Deputy claims to have at heart, those deprived or underprivileged because of lack of legislation, or if it is for the protection of the Deputy's own high political profile that the Deputy has repeatedly repeated himself in this House.  We discussed the whole question of monetary limitation during the passage through the House of the Courts Act, 1981, and the Deputy contributed &mdash; other people would accuse him of having waffled but I am not that disrespectful to any Deputy &mdash; on this area.  I have explained that this is a very important area and that it should only be the Members of this House who should decide on monetary controls in any legislative package being provided for the benefit of the nation.  If we were to proceed outside of the method adopted and established constitutionally over the years we would go into the area where elements outside of this House would be in a position to make decisions about matters of family law and the monetary limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that we should provide for 14 or 15 years' hence. I reject that.  Why should we put a limit of 14 or 15 years on the period for which we should provide monetary limits?  The present system is good and, having regard to the fact that this party will be around for a considerable time, the Deputy need have no doubt about the regular monitoring <Col N="3248" /> and reviewing of the situation as is desirable and necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the tone of political acrimony which the Minister sees fit to introduce to this debate.  I certainly put on record prior to this my concern about the question of monetary limits in Bills and I intend to continue.  Strange as it may seem to the Minister, what we said was correct three or six months ago continues to be correct and we will continue to assert principles which we see to be just regardless of how tedious it may appear to be to people who are clearly more concerned about other matters at this time than family law matters.  The reality is that the amount of money involved here is one which the Minister presumably sees as just and correct.  I contend if that is not open to change &mdash; not by some vague generalised interest outside the House but by the appropriate duly elected Minister of the Department &mdash; we get a degree of injustice.  The Minister's memory is very short because unlike what he has said, which is to imply a Minister has not got the power to adjust monetary limits in relation to inflation &mdash; I will admit this is difficult these days because of the rate at which it is growing &mdash; in the Courts Bill the Minister introduced an amendment to facilitate him changing limits by ministerial order.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to talk about the Courts Act now he is merely showing further disrespect for what is actually before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of nonsense the Minister is talking simply does not hold water.  Of course he changes his mind as often as his party change their economic and social policy.  The fact is we are here dealing with a very sensitive area, with an area dealing with the property of engaged couples and presumably there will be very little joy in the distribution <Col N="3249" /> of assets in these circumstances.  All we want to do, regardless of what provocation the Minister may offer, is to endeavour to ensure that assets are distributed justly and by that I mean consistent with standards year in and year out whether it be four years, 14 years or 40 years.  All I ask for is not a degree of political invective in heated debate, which I certainly did not warrant because I did not start in that tone, but respectful consideration of any suggestion coming from any side of the House in the context of a Bill which, whether the Minister likes it or not, is not likely to be repeated irrespective of which side of the House he finds himself on.  If the Minister does not wish to give that kind of consideration that is that.  I have made my point.  I will continue to make it on any opportune occasion in which a Bill does not in a commonsense way take into account the unfortunate upward progress of inflation.  That is all I have asked the Minister to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reply because it would be very wrong to allow Deputy Keating to put on the record a misinterpretation of what I said.  The section makes provision whereby amounts of over £15,000 may be dealt with in the Circuit Court provided both parties consent. I think that provides a very fair opportunity for the two people concerned. There is no limitation to the amount which may be claimed in the High Court.  Now the Deputy refuses to acknowledge that these two realities prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not more likely that the two parties will be before the court for the simple reason that they do not agree?  If the two parties agree is it not more likely the matter will be settled without their going to court at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong for the Deputy to presume they will necessarily be bad friends for the rest of their lives.  They do not have to behave like the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch the Minister's main thrust.  I am suggesting, and <Col N="3250" /> I want an answer if the Minister has no objection, that it is more than likely that the majority of cases which will go before the courts will be those in which the parties by definition cannot agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Agree about the property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is they may agree but it might be more appropriate to take the case in the Circuit Court rather than the High Court or <i>vice versa.</i> This is an aspect which may have nothing to do with the actual differences that may obtain between them over the property. The Deputy is working on hypothetical presumptions and it is just crazy to go on talking about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the salient point that the limit on the District Court is one which, regardless of agreement between the couples, is set down and they have no right to waive that except in circumstances where there is complete agreement between the parties?  Of course, in those circumstances the matter would be most unlikely to come before the court at all. The Minister is being naive and we will find that out in two or three years when people with little experience of family law matters and with little insight into social conditions which give rise to these problems have drafted legislation which is far from the best.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for the limitation of three years?  Would it not be more acceptable surely that the normal limit in relation to statute barred aspects in relation to contract, namely, a limit of six years, would be more acceptable and more appropriate?  I agree with the Minister there should be some cut-off point but three years seems to be very <Col N="3251" /> short.  The section draws a limitation period on the right to take proceedings arising out of the termination for whatever reason of an agreement to marry.  I can imagine circumstances where the effects of such disengagement, in the literal sense, would be such as might not be fully appreciated or apprehended particularly by someone in his or her teens or someone relatively immature.  On reflection after a period of two-and-a-half years he or she might feel he or she had the right to take proceedings.  But it could be three to four years.  The case once initiated would not come to fruition for perhaps three or four years.  If the interests of justice are to be served then the limit involved, if any limit is appropriate &mdash; and I agree there should be some limit &mdash; must be a reasonable limit.  Is this not too dramatic and too out of line with the limitations set in other legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is different from other types of legislation.  It is dealing with a very sensitive relationship between two people.  The Law Reform Commission recommended this period and the Government considered it appropriate to accept that recommendation because it appears to be in the best interests of those concerned.  I am sure Deputy Keating can envisage a situation arising, if a period in excess of three years were provided for under this section, in which the two parties could be disadvantaged individually or collectively because they had not visualised difficulties arising in connection with their particular relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the nature of these disputes they should be dealt with as quickly as possible.  That is the only reason why the three year period was considered. After very close and in depth examination, it was considered appropriate and proper to have a reasonable length of time, and three years was thought to be reasonable.  I accept that there are six and seven year limitations in other areas of legislation but, because of the nature of this legislation and the sensitivity of the area which is being dealt with, I am convinced <Col N="3252" /> of the desirability of having such disputes arising over property and so on, dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has advanced four reasons why the three year period would appear to be the right limit. The first reason is that because this is a different Bill from other legislation it deserves a unique response.  I suppose every Bill is unique.  I do not accept that there is any validity in that argument. Secondly, he referred to the Law Reform Commission as being one of reasons why their recommendation of three years should be acceptable.  That is severely at odds with section 1 of this Bill where the Government did not accept the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and, more importantly, showed a distinct change of heart in not suggesting a replacement action to the abolition of criminal conversation as recommended by the Law Reform Commission and, incidentally, sought by this party nearly a year-and-a-half ago.  I do not feel that the Minister can drag in the Law Reform Commission when it suits him, if that is to be the justification for the three year cut-off point.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the Minister talked about these matters being of particular sensitivity. I agree with that.  However, if we are talking about sensitivity, both presumably in the emotional and psychological areas, people who are deciding not to go ahead with an agreement they had to marry, it seems reasonable that we should err on the side of caution in affording such people the opportunity of taking an action rather than jumping in with a cut-off point earlier than is general in legislation.  Surely it is reasonable to expect that people would be given the maximum length of time within which to consider taking such actions.  In most cases we are dealing with young people. In many cases we are dealing with very young people and, in some cases, we will be dealing with people who are not fully aware of their rights, or their obligations perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the case for three years has been proven.  It should be proven if it is to be a significant departure from <Col N="3253" /> traditional norms in this area, as it is.  I can see a situation where somebody of 17, 18 or 19 decides at 22 or 23, based on consequent or consequential evidence or personal difficulties arising from that initial decision and subsequent agreement not to go ahead with a marriage, that they are entitled now to take a certain type of action.  Nobody relishes the prospect of such actions.  We hope there will be as few as possible, but that is another day's work.  If somebody has an entitlement, in justice, they should not be abruptly cut off from the opportunity of taking an action.  If these were men or women of 40 or 50 years on average, one could say they were mature enough to make a decision fairly rapidly, but, generally, they will be young people.  A limit of six years, which is the norm in legislation going through this House &mdash; not the rule in all cases but the norm &mdash; is what should apply.  The Minister, apart from some vague generalisation about a collective desire that such cases should be settled at an early date, has not given one whit of evidence why young people should be dealt with over efficiently and over swiftly in this respect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating has referred to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations not having been accepted in connection with section 1.  He also referred to the imaginary conflict in the Government's attitude to section 1 and section 9.  The Deputy totally ignored the existence of the Law Reform Commission when he came into this House with a Private Member's Bill.  The Deputy ignored the Law Reform Commission and the findings of eminent people which we were prepared to wait for.  To do otherwise would be to make that commission which was set up in the national interest irrelevant.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the action of criminal conversation in section 1.  We decided to abolish that action.  In this section we decided to accept the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, not because they were made by the Law Reform Commission but because, as the Government, we have the right and the duty to make a decision taking into consideration the submissions of the Law Reform Commission and any other vested interests.  With respect to the Deputy, we have given cursory examination to some of his proposals.  They would have been much more valid and helpful if the Deputy's party had waited for the Law Reform Commission's final document and examined their own proposals in that light.  It is not unusual, as the Deputy has suggested, for a three year limitation to exist.  A three year period exists in tort for personal injury.  The fact that the Deputy is not aware of these situations and that he is prepared to talk off the top of his head in a confused, distorted manner clearly reflects the inability he has, either personally or in his party, to pursue the type of legislation which is in the national interest and the common good.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not just inaccurate but wrong in what he said in a number of respects.  First, he indicated in passing that the Law Reform Commission said that the action of criminal conversation should be retained &mdash; those were the words the Minister used. They did not say that.  They recommend a replacement action which would be open to both husband and wife and not <Col N="3256" /> the retention of the present unconstitutional arrangement.  Secondly, I am fully aware of the three year limit in regard to personal injuries.  The point is that a personal injury based usually on a physical injury to a person in an accident, for example, is clearly manifested within two or three years.  We are talking about what the Minister calls the particularly sensitive area dealing almost exclusively, certainly very largely, with young people &mdash; not in terms of physical injury but in terms of psychological damage and in terms of the traumatic events relating to the breaking off of a wedding that was to be.  There is no analogy between those two events.  The basic point that the norm is six years has not been answered.</P>
      <P>I make this appeal to the Minister.  We have been dealing in this House over the past number of months with a number of issues in the family law area, some perhaps more weighty than others, certainly some very superficial.  We have done so with reasonable respect for each other. Would the Minister withdraw from the line he is now taking in engaging in deliberate distortion and smear and get back to the issues?  If he wants to play it the other way, however, he will get more than he bargained for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 1, to delete &ldquo;For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a case which came to hearing since the Bill was circulated, the High Court decided that a consent of an under-age spouse is not sufficient consent for the <Col N="3257" /> purposes of section 3 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976.  In the absence of an appeal against the decision, this High Court judgment is now the law in the matter and accordingly it is inappropriate to frame the section on the lines of removing doubt or declaring the law.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes therefore to delete the words &ldquo;For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that&rdquo;. Amendment No. 4 is necessary because section 10 is not now declaring the law, but is changing the existing law as set out by the High Court decision to which I have already referred.  The section as amended will provide that consents already given by under-age spouses for the purposes of the 1976 Act shall not be taken to have been invalid solely because they were given by under-age spouses. Also, the amended section provides that any such consent given in the future by an under-age spouse will not be an invalid consent solely because it is given by an under-age person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long argued that the legislation of this House is being framed as if it was to be a prerogative for discussion by erudite lawyers and not legislation for the people of this country.  I have no doubt that the average person, regardless of the Bill, would be quite unable to make head or tail of it.  It does not help in communicating the fact that law is about people, to unduly clutter it up with unnecessary verbiage.  This section is badly drafted.  The average teacher of English would probably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; improve on it. There are many such average teachers of English around.  That deals with semantics. More important is the fact that we are asking people now to give up &mdash; that is the wrong expression &mdash; we are taking from them their right of action in the context of this Bill, because they gave consent while they were below the age of majority.  Bear in mind that we are dealing with young people in the case of persons below the age of majority, who have given their consent to a marriage &mdash; persons of 17, 18 or 19.  Their rights are being fundamentally altered by virtue of this section.  I question the wisdom of that.  If there is anything we in this country do in regard to young people, it is to tend to minimise the rights they already have.  In some cases, if they happen to be the innocent victims &mdash; if that is the right expression &mdash; of people who chose not to go through the civil and Church marriage ceremony, they have no rights at all in certain respects.  Leaving that aside for the moment, we are removing from these young people, who have given their agreement to marriage at an age when, by common consent, their physical, emotional and psychological maturity is still evoling and is certainly not at its height, that immaturity as a reason for invalidating their right to take an action in regard <Col N="3259" /> to the disposal of a family home.  The likelihood is that there is one family home and the protection of what I might call an infant, to use that quaint legal expression, a minor, someone who has not reached the age of majority, is being jeopardised by virtue of the fact that we are now going to say, &ldquo;Even if you gave your word when you were aged 17, and even if we generally recognise that you were immature and emotionally unfit to give it, that does not make it an excuse any more.&rdquo;  That is wrong.  Why should that be?  Why should one not be able at least to plead the case?  Section 10 should, therefore, be amended in a number of respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is to what extent the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, where property or a family home within the meaning of that Act is involved, is to be infringed upon.  There is concern among legal people with whom I have spoken about the possibility of a reason being advanced at some future date which would, on the basis of this Bill, invalidate their action.  The point being, of course, that unless there is some cut-off point &mdash; six years or otherwise &mdash; introduced into this section, we will run the risk of people in the context of the Family Home Protection Act and this Bill, making a case later on that the person, though of young years, has now no longer an excuse to suggest that any consent then entered into was invalid on that account.  This is slightly worrisome.  We should obviously have some kind of order in this area.  What is the reason why a person whom society considers to be immature at age 17 or 18, who wants to take an action under this section, finds that his or her interests would be best served by relying, as it were, or falling back on the fact that they were clearly unable to make the right decision at that time, if that is demonstrated?  Bear in mind that they must prove this.  What is the reason for victimising teenagers in this way?  Is it not accepted generally that emotionally, psychologically and physically they are more immature than they would be at a later date and that, consequently, they need our increased protection <Col N="3260" /> rather than to be stripped of that protection which is what is being done here?  On these grounds we oppose the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of house purchase loans, the houses are conveyed to the lending institutions as security for the loans and the consent of the other spouse is required to that conveyance.  Lending institutions have refused to accept as a valid consent for the purpose of section 3 (1) of the 1976 Act, the consent of a spouse who is under 21 years.  Consequently, in the case of an adult applicant for a house purchase loan whose spouse is under 21, proceedings have had to be instituted under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to ask the court to give consent on behalf of the under-age spouse.  It may have happened also that consents were given by guardians under that Act.  The view taken by the lending institutions has been confirmed in a High Court decision in the case of Lloyd v. O'Sullivan &mdash; 6 March 1981.  That decisions was given after this Bill had been circulated and was to the effect that the consent of a spouse under 21 was not a sufficient consent for the purpose of section 3 (1) of the 1976 Act.  That would remain the law unless or until the decision was changed on appeal.  The High Court decision that a minor spouse cannot validly give consent for the purpose of section 3 (1) of the 1976 Act makes it inappropriate for section 10 (1) of the Bill to take the form of a declaration &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt&rdquo; that the spouse can validly do so.  Consequently, section 10 (1) is being amended so as to secure the same result by providing that no consent given by a minor spouse before or after the passing of the Act shall be, or shall be taken to have been invalid by reason only of the spouse's minority.  The section applies also to a consent given for the purpose of section 9 (2) of the 1976 Act. The High Court decision applies also to that provision.  It must be presumed and accepted that a person under 21 who is married was mature at the time of the marriage and was capable at that time or afterwards of applying for a house loan, that is, that the application was being <Col N="3261" /> made in good faith with the applicant knowing what he or she wanted to do.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything unreal or unusual about a person under 21 and married seeking to obtain a loan for the purpose of acquiring a home.  Regarding any claim that might be made at any time after that to the effect that the person was incapable of taking certain decisions because of his or her tender years.  I can only say that the fact that he or she sought to acquire a home could not give any credence to the view that the person did not know what he or she was doing at the time.  The only reason for the section is to remove a difficulty that has existed and, in fairness, Deputy Keating must agree that it is important that we remove a difficulty which results in both spouses having to make applications to the High Court in these cases.  It is important that the law in this area should, in the family interest, be changed as proposed in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The section makes a major assault on the rights of young people because its effect could be to deprive such person of their full entitlement in justice.  It could operate in such a way as to subject them to an interpretation of law which will be clearly unjust in their case.  It is at odds with what is occurring in other quarters.  For example, the churches today are viewing with increasing understanding and compassion requests for annulments from very young people.  It is clear that a significant degree of emotional immaturity obtains where a couple can show that they were ill-fitted to enter into a bond which at the time appeared to be right.  I know of instances in which teenage marriages lasted only days.  We hope that only a small minority will be involved here and there is no reason to assume that a marriage between teenagers should by its very nature be liable to this type of difficulty but the statistics show that there is more breakup of teenage marriages than is the case of the more mature marriages. There are figures which show that between 40 and 50 per cent of teenage marriages break down in the first number of years.  If that is correct, obviously, <Col N="3262" /> there are various reasons involved and one of these must relate to the fact that in many instances people of 16, 17 or 18 have no idea of what marriage involves.</P>
      <P>What is suggested here is that that immaturity and a degree of emotional unpreparedness is no longer to be accepted as a reason for this action being taken.  I cannot accept that.  To accept it would leave us in the situation of acting not in the best interest of young boys and girls.  If, as the Minister has now indicated, the reason for the provision is that lending agencies are unhappy about lending to parties in the case where one spouse is a minor, there are a number of ways of dealing with such situations.  One of these would be to change the age of majority and another might be, at the very least, an amendment to the section to the effect that there could be cases where young people could make application to the courts by way of helping to prove that they had no idea of what they were going into.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Government are increasing the degree of irresponsibility which exists in relation to teenage marriages when what they should be doing is the reverse.  It is clear to anyone who has any contact with society that the whole area of teenage marriage needs more attention.  Instead, we are here removing from them whatever meagre protection they have.  Regardless of what may be the difficulties for lending agencies in cases where one spouse is under 21, there are ways around such problems and these do not necessarily involve making major assaults on the rights of young people. What we are saying by way of this Bill is that adult society prompted, on the basis of what the Minister has said, by the lending agencies, do not care about whether we deprive young people of the right to plead emotional immaturity at the time of marriage.  That is what is being suggested here and it is not right.  We should be considering in constructive ways what more we can do to give teenagers protection in legislation such as this.  They are exploited across the board in the commercial areas and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in this section means we do not care about the young people but <Col N="3263" /> are concerned only to make it easier for the lending agencies to give money and if anything goes wrong to ensure they have a fall-back position.  I cannot understand this attitude.  We must remember the lending agencies are lending for a home, not for something that will be frittered away.  We are talking about a house, a fixed asset that increases in value.  Whatever may be the legal and technical difficulties of lending agencies in pursuing their right of action, there is no loss whatever involved for them.  I challenge anyone to say where the lending agencies, having loaned money to a couple one of whom has not attained the age of majority, have lost money.  It may make it more complex from the legal point of view but otherwise there is no difficulty for them.  I want this House to realise what this section proposes to do. We are taking away from young people the protection they have and which society accepts, namely, of stating they were not prepared to take that step, that they did not know what was involved and of pleading they had not attained the age of majority.</P>
    <P>The age of majority at present is a safeguard for some young people.  I remember a young person whom I knew very well and who wished to purchase a car but was not given the finance because he was too young.  It was right at the time that he did not get the finance necessary because it is unlikely that he would have been able to repay it.  In this context we are talking of young people who will come through what is a very difficult period for anyone, that of marriage and house purchase.</P>
    <P>This section is indicative of the passion of the Government for looking after the interests of big business and selling down the river the interests of teenagers and young people.  I reject that.  Young people tend to be more immature and more unprepared emotionally and that factor must be taken into account.  I find it ironic that at a time when the churches are taking it into account in terms of their consideration of applications for annulments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I said &ldquo;churches&rdquo;.  It is clear that both in church and State circles increasing consideration is being given to the question of the vulnerability of young people in this area.  It is ironic that at a time when more consideration is being given to this factor as a reason for bringing into question the validity of some contracts by teenagers, whether marriage or otherwise, that the State appears to be doing the opposite here.  The State is removing that protection and is taking away from young people the right to say that however firm their intention they were not ready to enter into a contract.</P>
      <P>This section should be changed.  At the very least it should provide for allowing young people to seek in the courts the right to take an action.  How can somebody who can show he or she was not ready in a number of respects to enter into a contract be deprived of that right? If this section is passed as it stands, we will do a disservice to young people.  People of that age are not represented in this House.  It was interesting to note from the Minister's initial reply that his concern was for the lending agencies.  Their problems can be circumvented by sensible local authorities or by a more courageous decision to review the law regarding the age of majority which would allow people the same status at the age of 18 years that they have with regard to voting rights, to paying taxes or to take up arms on behalf of the country.  However, that is another day's story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section goes through as it stands it will invalidate the right of young people to plead on the basis of a factor that is commonly accepted.  There is no argument about the degree of emotional immaturity of the young people.  Apparently the only argument is that the Minister finds it more convenient to remove <Col N="3265" /> the right of young people in this area.  We propose to tell them we do not care whether they were ready to enter into a contract, that we consider the rights of lending agencies and the obligations of business to be more important.  Our attitude to them is that they entered the contract and they are stuck with it.  That is what the Minister is saying and we do not support if.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong and I am glad we agree on that.  The position heretofore has been that, for example, if a husband or wife made an application to a building society or other financial institution to obtain a loan that application would be refused if the other spouse was under the age of 21 years because that spouse could not give a valid consent to the conveyance.  In order to give a valid consent in accordance with what is required by existing law that couple would have to apply, at considerable cost, to the High Court so that a valid consent could be given.  In this Bill we are not giving greater facilities to building societies.  I mentioned building societies or financial institutions to illustrate one of the areas where this difficulty arises for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not giving any additional facility or any right to the building societies or the financial institutions.  We are dealing with a legal requirement which they are now lawfully entitled to demand before they will give a loan by giving, in section 10 of this Bill, a right which the <Col N="3266" /> spouse under 21 years has not got at the moment, that is, the right to be able to give a valid consent without having to go to the High Court, as they have to do at the moment, to get a home for themselves as soon as possible after marriage. If it can be provided before marriage it can be a great help in the marriage.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Keating throws dirty water on the giving of a right in law to a married person under 21 years to be able to give a valid consent without having to go the the High Court to meet the requirements of financial institutions for the purpose of getting a loan, and says that right should not be given, his ambiguity is too much for me.  I could not make even a remote assessment as to what type of mind would wish to deprive young people of that right.  I know the Deputy and I do not think he intends to be evil or wrong where they are concerned.  He fails to recognise that a 20 year old wife is mature enough to give a valid consent.  If his argument were to be brought to its logical conclusion there would be chaos in the selling of houses.  It just would not work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keating seems to hold the Law Reform Commission in some contempt, if I read him aright, in so far as he has never been interested in any of their final conclusions even to the extent of considering them or rejecting them as he thought fit.  He has not waited for them.  The Law Reform Commission are dealing with the age of majority.</P>
      <P>It may be contended that the real problem is the legal incapacity of persons under 21 years to obtain a house purchase loan and that a provision should be inserted in the Bill which would enable engaged couples under 21 years to obtain a mortgage to enable them to purchase a home jointly or otherwise.  Any such suggestion raises the whole question of the general contractual capacity of minors in relation to all contracts and not only contracts for the repayment of loans.  It was never the intention to deal with the contractual capacity of minors in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 10 is to deal with the separate, specific and important <Col N="3267" /> problem arising from the operation of the Family Law Protection Act, 1976.  Legislation dealing with the general question of the contractual capacity of minors would have to deal with all other legal aspects of the status of minors as well as the age of majority itself.  To attempt to deal with this whole question in this Bill would go far beyond its scope and would raise questions of policy which would require greater and further consideration. If you were to be misinterpreted by young people in connection with this Bill and other Bills it might appear that you were rejecting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reports of the Law Reform Commission will be of enormous assistance in this connection.  We will be anxious to have them and we will not engage in any immature or precipitate action as happened in Deputy Keating's case in relation to this Bill and others.  I am satisfied that there is justification for having changes made in the law to give a right to give a valid consent to an under-age spouse without having to go through the High Court as is the case at the moment. I have no intention of making any change in the proposed section.</P>

      <P>When one picks one's way through the Minister's contribution one finds there is no substance in it.  The Minister has implied that we do not pay adequate attention to the Law Reform Commission.  I doubt the wisdom of defending ourselves against every slur and every allegation the Minister throws <Col N="3268" /> at us, presumably as diversionary tactics because the last thing he wants to talk about is the essence of our argument.  I have with me the report of the Law Reform Commission as I do regularly.  I would be reluctant to say this normally, but the Minister may be interested to know that there are two Deputies in the House who have taken the trouble to go and see the Law Reform Commission and their eminent chairman.

By and large they are abused in this House by the Government side, as we have just heard now with regard to the age of majority.  There might be a change in the age of majority but, having taken three steps forward, they will take two steps back, after the usual consideration and reviews with the reports of the Law Reform Commission tacked on at the end to give them plenty of breathing space in case they stuck their necks out too far in the first place.  The Law Reform Commission deserve our pity and our sympathy. They are not represented here and regularly they are used as a mudguard by a Government, who want to take every possible action except to introduce legislation.</P>

      <P>Could we get back to the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister did. The Minister said he is trying to give young people a right.  Black is not white. Subsection (1) says that it is hereby declared that no consent given by a spouse is or was invalid by reason only that it is or was given by a spouse who has not or had not attained the age of majority.  The clear implication is that, <Col N="3269" /> regardless of its complexity, that is a reason at present for declaring the consent to be invalid.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the cumbersome nature of the procedure, at present a young person has the right to say: &ldquo;The fact that I was a young person may mean that the consent I gave was invalid.&rdquo; That is the central fact.  The Minister is now saying that no longer applies.  Nothing else matters. It is not important whether it is the High Court or any other court.  If the Minister was concerned about the legal complexities we would do it some other way.  The way to deal with it is not to take away the right.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about giving a right to people.  We do not give people rights.  They have them and in this case apparently we are endeavouring to take them from young people.  The High Court is not mentioned in this section nor is it in any way implicit that any aspect of the High Court's operations are relevant to it.  All that is relevant is that for some reason the Minister has not given us, which he might purport to imply, evidence of concern about young people.  If he was truly concerned about making sure that young people had homes he would do something about the actual cost of houses and building land, although I have no doubt that he would say that that is not his responsibility.  This section does one thing and one thing only.  It takes away from young people the right to say: &ldquo;The fact that I have not reached the age of majority is a defence.&rdquo;  That is what it does and no amount of gilding the lily will change that interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned also other aspects of legislation arising from the change involved here as being too comprehensive an area to get into.  I share that view, but I do want to ask one question which is very serious and important. It is in relation to consent given by a mother who wishes to have her child adopted.  I would like the Minister to have his officials consider whether or not the change here has implications in relation to the rights of the parent, or the rights of the child, in regard to that kind of decision.  The Minister may argue that the only thing at issue here is the consent <Col N="3270" /> under this Bill by a minor spouse to dispose of the family home.  Eminent legal minds tell me that there may be implications for other areas of law.  For example, people who are at present engaged in adopting, or in giving children for adoption, may run into serious consequences arising out of the fact that the fundamental change here is to downgrade or deprive young people of the right of action they now have based on their not having reached the age of majority.</P>
    <P>That is the essential case and I do not think the Minister has answered it.  The question of the mechanics of how that operates at present, the somewhat cumbersome difficulties young people experience in getting that consent, is a matter purely for mechanics.  That could be dealt with very simply, if the Minister wishes and if he sees it as a problem.  Indeed, the Minister for the Environment undertook in this House, in response to questions from other Deputies and myself, that there would be change in that area.  It was ludicrous that, say, a boy or girl of 23, 24 or 25, and a girl of 20 years of age, or a boy of 20 years of age getting married found that they were getting unnecessary hassle from people simply because one or other had not reached the age of 21, a nonsensical situation.  But the answer to that problem &mdash; and it is a problem &mdash; is not to say: &ldquo;Well, in that case the easiest thing to do is no longer recognise the fact that you have not reached the age of majority as a reason for invalidating your cause of action.&rdquo;  That is not the answer to it.  There are many other answers to it and I can suggest them if the Minister so wishes.</P>
    <P>The essential proposal in this section, no matter what way the Minister wishes to twist and turn, is spelled out in the first two lines and last two lines of the subsection which says:</P>
    <P>...it is hereby declared that no consent given by a spouse,...is or was invalid by reason only that it is or was given by a spouse who has not or had not attained the age of majority.</P>
    <P>That is the nub of the issue and we oppose it because we believe it to be fundamentally inimical to the interests of young people.  I have no doubt that if the Minister <Col N="3271" /> gives it adequate thought he will agree with that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a comment on subsection (2).  I am disappointed that the Minister stonewalled on the first part of the section, but perhaps that was to be expected.  With regard to subsection (2), does the Minister consider that some kind of time period would be important within which action should be taken?  I mentioned initially the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, in that regard.  The present position is that in a case where there are, or were, a number of conveyances since the coming into being of that 1976 Act, and if one of those earlier conveyances did not have the appropriate consent or, alternatively, had not some form of declaration to state that it was not a family home, then all the subsequent conveyances would be void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would appear to be the case.  It might be wrong to say that this would have been due to the negligence of some previous solicitor on the title not having complied with the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and that he or she should not be held responsible for any error made on a previous conveyance of title simply because that 1976 Act perhaps was not well drafted.  Regardless of the culpability of a solicitor the facts are that the question of consent with which we are now involved may have a detrimental effect on some subsequent conveyance of the house.  The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, simply stated that, where a property was a family home within the meaning of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, the consent of the spouse would be got.  There is no provision in that Act putting the onus on <Col N="3272" /> the purchaser's solicitor to get a declaration and a State marriage certificate from the spouse so that she can prove that she is, or he is, the correct and the only spouse to give his or her consent to the sale.  There must have been thousands of cases within 12 months of the coming into effect of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, which simply had the consent of the spouse or the vendor endorsed on the deed and signed by the spouse without getting this additional requirement of the declaration exhibiting the State marriage certificate.  In all of these cases, in future sales &mdash; and this is the point we are coming to &mdash; purchasers' solicitors will hold that the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, have not been fully complied with as the consent of the spouse on the previous deed of conveyance was not sufficient within the declaration and the marriage certificate of the spouse.</P>
    <P>Perhaps therefore a simple amendment of either the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, or of this Bill might be appropriate, whereby we would place on each spouse a limitation of perhaps three to six years to take any action or proceedings against the other spouse &mdash; personally I would say six years &mdash; or any claim for damages based on his or her case that the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act had not been complied with.  This would mean that each purchaser's solicitor should not have to be concerned with any conveyance of property over six years old as to whether the provisions of the 1976 Act had been complied with.</P>
    <P>The point essentially is that we are possibly interfering here with conveyances already undertaken and carried out and perhaps with their subsequent resale or reconveyancing.  We might now enter into a situation in which we could question whether or not that was carried out properly arising out of the modification proposed to the right of action in this section, if that is not too complex.  Perhaps the Minister would care to comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) of this section is just a simple declaration of the <Col N="3273" /> law in relation to consents given prior to the passing of this Act.  Naturally the Deputy would find fault with it when he has disagreed with the contents of sub-section (1) and has failed to recognise the purpose for which the new right is being given.</P>
      <P>The question of statutory limitations does not arise at all under this section because, as it is known, there is a statute of limitations which provides for limitations in various areas of law.  Therefore, I am satisfied that subsection (2) is proper and correct in so far as it gives clear statutory validity to consents that were obtained either as a result of application to the court by the spouse or by a guardian on behalf of the spouse.  What we are really doing is extending the provisions of the new right to situations in which consents were given before this Act came into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would have to agree to differ on that.  But the essential point, as the Minister has said, is that this section is in part retrospective, it goes back over consents given before or after the passing of the 1976 Act.  Therefore there may be grounds &mdash; and it has been represented to me that there are &mdash; for concern in regard to this retrospective area.  Would it not therefore be worth considering the possibility of introducing some kind of termination date within which actions should have been initiated if they are to be initiated?  Otherwise, you run the risk at some future date of having declared void all conveyances on a certain home.  That is the risk when you get into the area of blandly making retrospective the contents of this section. However the Minister wishes to interpret it, it deprives young people of a defence they now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the sub-section is to remove any possible doubt that might arise as to the sufficiency of these consents.  For example, the Supreme Court on appeal could reverse the recent High Court decision and hold that the consent of a minor spouse was at all times sufficient for the purposes of the <Col N="3274" /> 1976 Act.  If this were to happen doubts might arise in regard to a consent given by a court or a guardian on behalf of a spouse because the consent was not given as required by the 1976 Act by the spouse himself or herself.  It is to ensure that no difficulties can arise that this declaration in law is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it interesting that the Minister now invokes the possibility of reference to the Supreme Court as a defence or an answer to the question when previously he was saying that the right of action in the High Court was too cumbersome for young people.  However, is not the Bill in part retrospective? Does it not refer to actions and consents given prior to the passing of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It ensures, on a statutory basis, the validity of any consent given in the past where that consent could not be obtained in law because the new right given to young people in this Bill did not exist.  Consequently, we are giving a retrospective validity in law to consents where they were obtained either by application of the spouse or by an application of the guardian to the High Court on behalf of the spouse.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main object of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.  This convention is the fifth in a line of conventions on safety of life at sea &mdash; commonly known as SOLAS Conventions. The Bill, therefore, is totally concerned with safety and, when enacted, it will enable Ireland to enforce the highest international safety standards in respect of Irish-registered ships and other ships which use Irish ports.  I will now set out the background to the latest SOLAS Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of 1974 a conference of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation&mdash;IMCO&mdash; which is the United Nations specialised agency concerned with maritime affairs, was held in London to consider a revised convention which would replace the 1960 SOLAS Convention.  The conference had two main objectives.  The first was to incorporate into a new convention all the amendments to the 1960 convention which had yet to come into force.  Some of these amendments were up to eight years old and were clearly needed to improve safety and yet, under the terms of the 1960 convention, they could not come into effect until there had been a large number of positive acceptances by individual Governments.  This led to the second objective of the conference. Apart from the need to implement past amendments, it was plain that action was <Col N="3277" /> needed to quicken the pace at which future amendments would come into force.  The conference, therefore, agreed to adopt an accelerated amendment procedure to prevent delays in the future. As a result of its deliberations, the conference adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.</P>
    <P>The 1974 convention replaces the Safety of Life at Sea Covention adopted by IMCO in 1960 and is the latest in a series of conventions going back to 1914. SOLAS 1974 includes the numerous technical improvements incorporated in the amendments to the 1960 convention. These include changes in the regulations concerning fire safety, radio equipment, the carriage of grain, and equipment to improve the safety of navigation.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the 1974 convention is the new tacit acceptance procedure which will make it much easier to bring future amendments of a technical nature into force.  The new procedure means in effect that, with regard to future technical amendments to the SOLAS Convention, contracting states will be automatically deemed to have accepted them within a specified period unless they take specific steps to seek an extension of the period.  This procedure does not apply to the main articles of the convention nor to the more fundamental provisions of the annex, that is provisions relating to scope, surveys, inspections and certificates.  Here, amendments can only enter into force six months after their being explicitly accepted by two-thirds of the contracting states.  As a result of the revised amendments procedure being included in the latest convention, it is envisaged that SOLAS 1974 will be the last SOLAS Convention in the series.  In the future, technical amendments can be incorporated as they arise, thus avoiding the need to draft a new convention due to a backlog of amendments, as in the past.</P>
    <P>In consideration of recommendations by its Maritime Safety Committee, the Council of IMCO decided on 25 May 1977, to convene the International Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention, which was held in London in <Col N="3278" /> February 1978.  As a result of its deliberations the conference adopted two protocols: the protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, known as the SOLAS Protocol and the protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, known as the MARPOL Protocol.  In this Bill we are only concerned with the SOLAS Protocol.</P>
    <P>The SOLAS Protocol modifies certain requirements of the 1974 convention and adopts some additional requirements. These modifications mainly concern the type and frequency of inspections and surveys and the duration and validity of certificates.  A significant addition calls for intermediate surveys, that is surveys within the period of validity of certificates, to be made for tankers of ten years old and over.  The protocol is particularly aimed at increasing tanker safety. Revised fire safety measures for tankers are set out in it.  For example, it requires that tankers of 20,000 metric tonnes deadweight and over shall be fitted with a fixed deck froth system and a fixed inert-gas system.  Under the 1974 convention this requirement applied only to tankers of 100,000 metric tonnes deadweight and upwards.  The additional requirements contained in the protocol reflect international anxiety over the growing number of accidents involving oil tankers.</P>
    <P>We in Government, and indeed the country as a whole, are acutely aware of the risk of such accidents occurring especially when we recall the disaster at Whiddy Island in January 1979 in which 50 lives were tragically lost.  The importance of the contribution which this protocol can make to increasing tanker safety was recognised in the report of the Whiddy Tribunal which urged the implementation of the requirements of the protocol in respect of inert-gas systems as soon as possible.  Implementation of the SOLAS Protocol will, therefore, give effect to that particular recommendation of the Whiddy Tribunal report.</P>
    <P>The 1974 SOLAS Convention came into force between contracting states on 25 May 1980.  The SOLAS Protocol came <Col N="3279" /> into force in May of this year.  Recognising that both of these instruments can make a significant improvement to the safety of ships and the lives of persons on board, the Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention, referred to earlier, adopted a resolution calling on those states which contemplate becoming parties to the SOLAS Convention to do so in respect of both the convention and the protocol simultaneously.  The convention and its protocol are treated as two distinct instruments even though both are concerned with the safety of life at sea and one is, in effect, an extension of the other.  Both instruments are required to be ratified separately and only parties to the convention may become parties to the protocol.  This Bill, when enacted, will enable Ireland to accede both to the 1974 SOLAS Convention and to the SOLAS Protocol.</P>
    <P>Having laid out the background to the convention, I now turn to the Bill itself. The IMCO text of the convention is a long and complex technical document.  In comparison the Bill appears to be short and simple.  The reason is that existing statutory powers allow for the making of the necessary regulations to implement the vast majority of the requirements imposed by the convention.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of provisions in the 1974 convention which cannot be implemented under existing powers. Power to implement these provisions is provided for in section 2 of the Bill. The convention lays down, for the first time, rules on the oil fuel used in machinery on board ship, by prohibiting fuel which is liable to ignite at low temperatures. Sub-section (4) of section 2, therefore, makes amendments to the 1952 and 1966 Acts to enable the necessary regulations to be made.</P>
    <P>Processed grain, which can be as hazardous a cargo as natural grain in that it is equally liable to shift and disturb a ship's stability, is now made subject to the grain regulations which currently apply only to natural forms of grain. Also, the convention now covers all ships carrying grain, regardless of the volume <Col N="3280" /> of cargo in relation to the size of ship. The previous position was that only ships whose cargoes of grain exceeded one-third of their tonnage, were affected. Sub-section (5) of section 2 provides the powers to make rules in respect of these two developments in the grain regulations.</P>
    <P>I shall next deal with the question of future amendments to the convention, which is covered in section 3.  I have already stressed that the conference which framed the convention was concerned to accelerate the pace at which amendments come into force.  The procedure which was eventually adopted is contained in Article VIII of the convention.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the complexities of the new amendment procedure but the aim is clear&mdash;to accelerate the introduction of amendments needed to maintain up-to-date safety standards consistent with the fullest possible consultation between contracting Governments.  No Government would be bound to accept or implement any amendment to which it objected, so there is no question of a loss of national sovereignty.  Section 3 of the Bill provides me with the power to implement by the making of regulations, any future amendments made in accordance with Article VIII of the convention.</P>
    <P>The next section of the Bill, section 4, is a very important one in that it makes provision for offences in respect of ships which are unfit to go to sea without danger to human life.  I already have powers under sections 459 and 462 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, to detain an unsafe ship either absolutely or until the ship has been made safe.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the imposition of fines of up to £50,000 on the owners and masters of such ships.  These powers, taken together, provide a strong deterrent to be used to prevent sub-standard vessels from entering Irish ports, and they effectively implement a recommendation on that subject contained in the report of the Whiddy Tribunal of Enquiry.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides me with the power to make regulations requiring such ships as are specified in the regulations to carry adequate and up-to-date <Col N="3281" /> charts, sailing directions, lists of lights, notices to mariners, tide tables and all other nautical publications necessary for the intended voyage.  This power is necessary to give effect to the requirements of SOLAS 1974 in respect of nautical publications.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill simply amend certain sections of existing Merchant Shipping Acts for the purpose of extending the provisions of such sections so that effect can be given to the requirements of SOLAS 1974 in respect of pilot hoists, navigational equipment and cargo ship safety construction certificates.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Deputies will note, is primarily an enabling measure.  The actual process of giving statutory effect to the detailed technical requirements of the convention will be done through technical regulations to be made under powers contained in previous Acts and in this Bill.  These regulations will take the form of statutory instruments and they will be laid before the Dáil and Seanad in the customary manner.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the Bill.  Anything that includes safety at sea and safety on ships using our ports is to be welcomed, but I question seriously the working of the Bill and how it can be implemented when it is blatantly obvious that the Minister's Department do not have the personnel required to carry out the type of inspections which are so necessary.  This Bill, unfortunately, like so much other legislation, is a result of reaction to events if not reaction to a disaster, that being the Whiddy Island disaster.  It would be far better if we brought in legislation in good time to prevent such catastrophes in the country.  It would be far better if we had personnel who were able to inspect these installations, whether on shore or on the ships themselves, to see that they are working properly and that they conform to the proper standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the availability of such personnel and I question the amount of finance which is being spent to make sure that the proper personnel are being provided <Col N="3282" /> and trained and also that the proper equipment is being provided on Irish-registered ships.  I have good reason for doing that.  Some of my information comes from journals, more of it from replies to Dáil questions and most of it from personnel who serve on Irish ships. The whole thing would lead one to believe that the position is highly unsatisfactory and still highly dangerous.  For instance, on 5 February last, just two months ago, the Minister in reply to a Dáil question told us that there was not a nautical surveyor and examiner in his Department.  Surely the essence of any inspection is that you have a nautical surveyor and examiner to find out what is happening on those ships and to inspect the equipment.  It transpired in reply to the same question that we depend on the British authorities to set examinations for certificates of competency for deck and engineer officers and we depend upon their standards completely.  We do not seem to have any method by which we can carry out examinations ourselves.  We as a maritime country surely should have the basic facilities available to train people and examine them within our own Department.  Seemingly that is not the case.</P>
    <P>According to <i>The Maritime Journal of Ireland,</i> autumn-winter edition 1980, it seems that the personnel are just not available.  I will quote briefly from that journal:</P>
    <P>The delegation from the Merchant Marine Committee of the Maritime Institute of Ireland met Mr. Richard Burke</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is the Transport Commissioner</P>
    <P>in Dublin on Sept. 12 to express the Institute's support for the proposed new laws, on ship safety and the banning of sub-standard ships and vessels with sub-standard crews from E.E.C. waters.</P>
    <P>The meeting followed Mr. Burke's speech in Cork earlier that week when he spoke of the problems of shipping safety and that of oil tankers in particular.</P>
    <P>That primarily is what we are dealing with in today's Bill.</P>
    <P>However, the delegation pointed <Col N="3283" /> out to Mr. Burke that even if the new E.E.C. directives were made law in the morning, Ireland could not enforce them as at present the responsible authority, the Department of Transport cannot carry out its functions in some areas.</P>
    <P>For example, they instanced the lack of the marine engineering examinations conducted by the Department which were suspended temporarily in 1977, owing to the lack of qualified staff.  &ldquo;Today, three years later, there is still no definite news as to when they will be restarted.  Letters to the Minister in question Mr. Albert Reynolds on this subject have so far gone unanswered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill does not really mean an awful lot when we have not the personnel to implement its provisions.  Apparently we have not got trained personnel in the Department of Transport to inspect these vessels or even to train personnel to operate these vessels.  It has to be done abroad, and that is a highly unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>It has been obvious for many years that the standard of equipment and of supervision of the operation of the Irish-registered shipping fleet has not been up to standard.  I constantly get complaints from personnel who are serving aboard Irish ships about the lack of concern in this country for these safety standards. For instance, I do not know if the Minister is aware, but the fire-fighting regulations on board Irish registered ships are deplorable and frequently are commented upon by the crew members and officers of these ships.  Up to 1978 the following defects were principally noticeable. There is no facility in the Republic for the examination of engineers.  That confirms what is in <i>The Maritime Journal of Ireland.</i>  Secondly, there is only one examiner in the whole country for masters and mates, and that man also has to set out papers and generally manage the maritime affairs of the country generally. That is just one man for the whole country. Thirdly, there is no approved fire-fighting course in the Republic.  That is not funny.  It is not a joke.  That is a very <Col N="3284" /> serious indictment of the Department.  I believe that up to a few years ago there was not even a first aid course nor was there a survival course.  Personnel were not trained in either of these.  I believe now that those two courses have been implemented but personnel serving on the ships tell me that neither of them is satisfactory, neither of them is up to national or international standards.  I would like the Minister to inquire into the standard of the courses in question and in particular to see if a fire-fighting course has been brought in.  If not, when is it going to be brought in?  That is the greatest danger of all, as we saw at Whiddy Island and elsewhere.  We need fire-fighting equipment and fire-fighting courses if we are going to prevent major disasters.</P>
    <P>I am told also that Irish-registered ships are infrequently examined to see that the very regulations which are set out in this Bill today are being implemented. Such examinations are very infrequent, and the reason is obvious. We have not got the trained personnel to do them.  That is a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs.  For instance, I am told that no self-contained breathing apparatus is available on Irish ships.  In other words, if fire breaks out aboard an Irish registered ship there is no breathing apparatus available.  If no fire-fighting course is available how are the crew expected to deal with any such situation? Also nowadays there is a vast increase in the amount of chemical industry in this country which involves bringing to this country lots of toxic and inflammable materials.  Again, for instance, if a container ruptures we have not got the facilities on board these ships to deal with the emergency.  I believe that only one shipping company serving this country provides protective suits, breathing apparatus and proper fire-fighting apparatus. That is only one company out of dozens. The reason is that the law as it stands does not demand it.  How could the law demand it when there are no courses available to enable people to implement it?  I would like the Minister to bear those things in mind.</P>
    <P>I believe the checks on those ships are <Col N="3285" /> so infrequent that shipowners can ignore the provision of very basic safety precautions. Something will have to be done about this immediately.  What is being done to see that the very basic necessities are provided?  Shipowners, like any business interests, will do things on the cheap if they can get away with it.  If they can get away with inferior radio equipment or navigational aids they will not provide proper radio equipment or navigational aids.  Why should they provide them when we have not got inspectors to see that such equipment is provided?</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House has so much rhetoric it is hardly worth the paper it is written on.  The personnel must be provided to ensure that the proper equipment is provided.  The Bill is merely a reaction to the Betelgeuse disaster in Bantry Bay.  The findings of the Bantry Bay tribunal showed a disgraceful state of affairs in relation to our maritime management. Fire hoses were not working; in other instances hoses were not provided and connections were so rusty they could not possibly be used.  What action is being taken against the companies and individuals responsible?  This is indicative of what is happening in our shore and ship installations.  Anybody involved in shipping would not be surprised if there were a further disaster.  Such disasters may not be of the same magnitude as the Bantry Bay disaster and may not involve oil tankers but, because many of the ships have not got the most basic equipment, we are inviting disaster.</P>
    <P>There would certainly be a public outcry, if such a disaster happened, why this was not done or why this equipment was not provided.  It is too late then.  This Parliament is the forum to see that things are changed and that proper equipment is provided.  I cannot see anybody doing anything to rectify the situation.  The maritime journal of Ireland is probably the most independent and the most responsible voice that we have got in <i>Maritime Journal of Ireland</i> is probably fied with the present standards on our ships.  Will the Minister tell us how many people in his Department are on this work, where they are employed and how often those ships are checked?  I have <Col N="3286" /> been told that it would not be unusual for a ship not to be checked even once in a year.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Torrey Canyon disaster off the French coast and the Betelgeuse in Bantry Bay, other countries brought in very stringent regulations. Every ship, which enters the ports of France and Britain, is examined to see that it has the proper equipment and safety standards.  I do not believe even one in one thousand ships is examined here for the same deficiencies.  How many of the small ports in the country are regularly visited by the safety officers from the Minister's Department to see what the standard of equipment is like aboard the ships which dock in them?  You get many ships flying a flag of convenience, such as the Liberian and Panamanian, that will not uphold safety standards if they can get away with it.  They are operating in those countries simply because of that and are doing things on the cheap.  While they are signatories to the convention which the Minister referred to, the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974, that does not bind them to the standards in question.  If those people were prosecuted the Minister would have a most protracted law case in the international courts.  There is no certainty we would win such a case.</P>
    <P>We should do what has been done in France, Britain and other countries that are alive to the dangers of bad equipment. We should ensure, in the case of any ship which is found to be deficient, that not only should the owners be prosecuted but that ship should be detained in port until the proper equipment is provided and proper standards are adhered to.  We have a Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which is referred to at length in the Bill and in the Minister's statement.  I have never heard of any prosecution brought under that Act although I am sure hundreds of prosecutions should have been brought under it.  I have never seen a prosecution brought against a shipowner for not providing proper standards of safety.  Will the Minister tell us what is being done?  Are ships coming in and out of our ports day after day which are not up to standard?  The Betelguese was a <Col N="3287" /> disastrous example of bad safety standards. When the Bantry Bay inquiry was held we saw all the deficiencies.  It was not just that the ship lacked a helium inert gas system to prevent the type of explosion which occurred but the ship was corroded.  Numerous faults were found.  Who is going out from the Minister's Department today investigating the same type of ship?  How often are such ships being inspected?</P>
    <P>The countries I have mentioned also monitor the movement of ships around our coast, particularly ships carrying dangerous cargoes like oil, nuclear waste or toxic material.  This is done because of a public outcry in France and in Britain and because of action by the seamen's union, who will not tolerate the haphazard type of arrangements we have.  That day is gone especially in the English Channel area.  Those ships are monitored from the moment they enter French or British waters until they leave.</P>
    <P>What are we doing?  Radio communications around our coast are not good.  I have been told that at times there is a virtual blackout in radio communications between land and sea especially between Cork and Rosslare.  It is not unusual for a ship or trawler to get into trouble off Ballycotton or the Waterford coast and the only station which picks up the distress signal is Lands End.  If that station were not good enough to relay the message back to our sea rescue service we could have major disasters off our shores. We have not even got the radio network to monitor the movement of ships in our waters not alone answer their distress calls.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly raised this matter in the Dáil but nothing has been done.  The pilot station at Dunmore East, whose function is to act as a coastguard service, is the only station capable of picking up those messages but its range is limited. The pilots in that area have repeatedly called for a VHF station to be set up on that coastline to help in the case of a disaster.  There have been major disasters, such as the Fastnet Yacht race two years ago, when many people lost their lives.  Our radio stations are not equipped <Col N="3288" /> to deal with that type of situation.  I know it costs money and it takes personnel but such equipment will have to be provided. The trouble is that this will be done when a further disaster occurs.  It is the old Irish adage that you close the stable door when the horse has bolted.  Will the Minister make sure that every precaution is taken to ensure disasters do not occur?  Even with the best will in the world accidents can happen.  There are disasters in every country &mdash; air or road crashes or disasters at sea &mdash; because of a weakness in the craft, but we must eliminate as far as possible the incidence of such errors.</P>
    <P>There has been talk, although it was denied in this House, that there will be a one-way system of shipping operating around Britain.  This is being considered because of the frequency of collisions in the English Channel.  Almost monthly there are collisions in that area and one of them will end up in a major explosion. These discussions have been denied in this House but every officer in a sea-going vessel knows this is a fact.  At present the British and French have two lanes.  Ships going from the Atlantic to the North Sea keep to the French side of the coast and ships coming from the North Sea to the Atlantic keep to the British side of the English Channel, but even that has not proved to be satisfactory.  The channel between Dover and Boulogne is quite narrow and there have been numerous accidents in that area.  If it is decided that ships will operate a one-way system around Britain, the Irish Sea will be used as part of that system.  The Minister should make it his business to find out how far that proposal has gone.  If it happens it will increase the dangers of accidents in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The bulk of our sea-going traffic is between Ireland and Britain and travels at right angles to other traffic which will be going up and down the Irish Sea.  The Fishguard-Rosslare, Dun Laoghaire-Holyhead, Dublin-Liverpool and Belfast-Larne traffic would be crossing one another's lane.  Any attempt to send heavy traffic, especially tankers, up the Irish Sea should be strenuously opposed by the Government and I am giving them <Col N="3289" /> this warning in time because despite denials this matter is being discussed.</P>
    <P>Two years ago we had a most disturbing incident which showed the contempt with which we are treated in maritime affairs.  There is obviously a feeling abroad that we are a soft touch.  The Cristos Bitas went on the rocks off the Welsh coast and was badly holed.  The captain was told to get away from the Welsh coast as quickly as possible.  I do not know if the British authorities or the ship owners told him to move but where did that ship go?  Twenty-four hours later it was off the Wexford coast presenting a serious pollution hazard.  Why did this happen?  In my view, it happened because the captain knew he could get away with it, because we, as a country, would not create a stink.  He would not have taken the ship to the French coast because it would have created an international incident. In maritime affairs we are regarded as a soft touch and that should not be so. We should assert ourselves and ensure that such an event does not recur.  Luckily the incidence of pollution from that ship was not very great, but it could have been.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if any prosecution had been taken because a ship did not conform with our safety standards.  I think that is an interesting question because I suspect there was not even one such case, and I suspect there should have been a great many.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many cargoes coming to this country are highly dangerous.  In recent years a number of chemical plants have been set up here which necessitate the importation of dangerous substances. I am told by personnel on Irish ships that <Col N="3290" /> they do not have the facilities to combat any spillages which may occur if some of the containers rupture, nor do they have the means to fight fires which might break out.</P>
      <P>Some of the materials being imported, such as hydrogen fluoride, are very dangerous when they come into contact with water.  Is the Minister aware that we are importing very large amounts of that material?  When dissolved in water it gives the very corrosive and poisonous hydro-fluoric acid.  It does not confine itself to a liquid; it vaporises very quickly and is highly toxic to the skin and highly poisonous.  The personnel on the ships carrying this material are not equipped to deal with any emergency which might occur and I do not believe the Department are taking the proper precautions to deal with matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>We need a coastguard service to prevent maritime disasters and to inspect ships suspected of being of a low standard. The Minister has repeatedly said there is no need for such a service, but I emphatically say there is.  The bland answer we get is that the Naval Service will perform these duties.  At present the Naval Service have many duties to perform, some of which they were not set up to carry out.  Their primary function at the moment is as a fishery protection service.  Their resources are spread out very thinly because we have a 2,000 mile coastline.  They are observing the practices of foreign trawlers &mdash; Spanish, Dutch, French, Russian and so on and they are not in a position to carry out the type of service which should be done by a coastguard service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The personnel of the Naval Service cannot be jacks-of-all-trades.  They cannot be trained to deal with every contingency &mdash; fire protection, fire precaution, preventing spillage of toxic waste, examining substandard ships and so on.  We must have a specialised service for that duty.  The volume of shipping is increasing and smaller ports are being used more often because of high transport costs, it is imperative that we have a specialised service to ensure that ships coming here are of a proper standard and that they <Col N="3291" /> are not carrying materials which are dangerous to the public at large.</P>
    <P>This country has become known as a soft touch when it comes to drug smuggling, because of inadequate arrangements at our ports.  It has been used even to a greater degree as an intermediary, from the Continent to Ireland, from Ireland to Britain.  A lot of this could be prevented, and I am not just speaking of general contraband.  It could be drugs or guns or explosives, and obviously they are coming in.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I must stress the importance of a coastguard service.  We are far too vulnerable to ruffians and pirates of all sorts who can come in here and get away scot free.  There is very little chance of them being apprehended under our present system.  We need an organised system of coastguarding to prevent that type of trafficking.  An organised coastguard service to do the work I am talking about could also engage in the inspection of old ships of inferior quality.  The Bill refers to ships registered in Ireland and those using Irish ports but it does not refer to ships sailing through our coastal waters, vessels that could be seriously deficient.  That is a glaring loophole in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will give some specific information in regard to instances of possible contravention of this law.  Two months ago we had a major foot and mouth disease scare.  There had been an outbreak in the Isle of Wight following a widespread epidemic in the Cherbourg Peninsula.  In the heart of my constituency, Dunmore East, 22 French trawlers tied up without any restriction whatsoever.  That was at the height of the outbreak.  There is an illustration of the laxity of our maritime laws.  Twenty-two French ships came into port without any of them being examined to see if they were carrying any substance which might be conducive to the spread of the disease &mdash; a lamentable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I am pointing out that the Bill is not worth the paper it is written on unless it provides that the personnel be employed to see that its provisions are implemented. All the evidence, whether elicited <Col N="3292" /> by way of parliamentary question or in articles in maritime journals, indicates that we have not got the personnel.  Incidents such as those which the introduction of this Bill seeks to prevent will recur until such personnel are provided.</P>
    <P>I will point to another loophole in the Bill.  Section 4 provides that it shall be a defence in proceedings for an offence under the section to prove that at the time of the alleged offence for a ship not registered in the State to say that the ship had been obtaining shelter in Irish waters.  That should not be a defence. There could be all sorts of defects in such a vessel.  Ships which are just sailing through our waters should have the necessary safety requirements in operation and it should not be a defence to say ships had been sheltering in our waters.  They could have engine trouble.  That kind of a defence is like a person absent from work saying he had a pain in his back. Who is to say he had not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

However, we welcome the Bill, ineffective as it may be because of present manning standards in the Department.  We hope to see proper personnel recruited and trained.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party welcome the Bill.  The Minister described it as an enabling measure but we regard it as of great importance.  The safety at sea aspect of shipping has been neglected for too long.  The Minister outlined the involved history of this type of maritime law between 1960 and 1974 when the convention was signed.  It seems remarkable that seven years should have elasped before we decided to introduce this Bill.  Although it has been described as an enabling measure, the Bill provides powers for the Minister to do certain things by regulation.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual process of giving statutory effect to the detailed technical <Col N="3293" /> requirements of the convention will be done through technical regulations to be made under powers contained in previous Acts and in this Bill.</P>
    <P>He said such regulations will be laid before the House, but sections 3 and 5 also give him power to make regulations. Will those regulations be laid before the House for annulment or approval?</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions I should like the Minister to answer.  Will he tell us whether the 1974 convention was laid before the House?  Perhaps if it had been it would have given us an opportunity to broaden the debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not need to stress the importance of provisions for safety of life at sea, particularly in the case of merchant shipping.  This is described as the Merchant Shipping Bill, 1981, but can the Minister tell us if there are in existing legislation sufficient safety precautions for passenger boats?  Perhaps such provision exists in separate legislation.  The Minister might let me know if that legislation in respect of passenger boats is up to date.</P>
    <P>We had the vivid description from Deputy Deasy of the awful tragedy at Whiddy Island and the great necessity for adequate precautions in regard to tankers. This is one of the most important aspects of safety at sea.  In a case like that we are concerned not alone with the safety of the crew which is of paramount importance but we are concerned with the safety of the cargo.  There is another aspect of which all Members of the House are conscious.  That is the awful pollution and the danger and the damage that can be done to our beaches and bird life and so on.  I am concerned in any case to get more information about tanker safety.  I suppose it is all very well for us to criticise the present Minister of State.  But we have all been neglectful in this respect. This goes back to 1960 and various Governments have been neglectful, including the two of which I was a member.  But that does not excuse the Minister from his responsibility and we trust that with his usual vigour he will introduce regulations <Col N="3294" /> which will provide for greater safeguards.</P>
    <P>Approximately 68 countries have signed this convention and they are, I presume, taking the necessary steps in their own parliaments to implement the various provisions in it.  But in these 68 countries &mdash; and I suppose Ireland is included &mdash; there are fishing fleets making very long journeys and I would like to know whether they are excluded, as they appear to be.  There are also cargo ships of under 500 tons and I would like to know whether these are included.  I do not know the reference in the convention to the particular regulation.  I would also like to know whether ships of war are included because there are people on these as well, and whilst they have to undergo certain risks in warfare which we certainly do not anticipate at present, in normal times these could be adversely affected by lack of certain precautions.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect about which I would like to get information.  In regard to ships which are not normally engaged in international voyages but which may wish to make a single international voyage I am informed that they are exempted from the provisions of this Bill.  It seems to me that the 1972 convention takes a big risk in exempting such ships.  I would like to know precisely whether or not they are exempt.  Safety regulations are, of course, obligatory but the whole question of seaworthiness as expressed in the international convention of 1974 seems to be relaxed in the single international voyage situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some reference to instructions on the safe packaging and storage of goods or cargo but perhaps he would expand in his reply.  There are certain ships with certain types of cargo that are at very high risk, for example, those carrying gas, explosives, inflammable liquids, solid goods liable to spontaneous combustion.  As the Minister said, there is a danger in having a large amount of grain cargo on a ship.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I agree absolutely with Deputy Deasy when he talks about an inspectorate.  We pass a great deal of legislation here in this House.  The last <Col N="3295" /> was in relation to dumping at sea and again we did not provide for any sort of inspectorate.  If this measure is to be of any use at all, consideration must be given to this.  The Minister must tell us now what sort of an inspecting team we will have, where it will be recruited from and so on because we can have all this embodied in legislation.  If we do not have the inspectorate to ensure that the requirements laid down by the Minister are met by shipowners then the measure itself goes for nothing.  Will there be checks on log books and entries relating to safety?  For example, included in this particular measure or regulation that may be made, is there any reference to ballast, to derricks, lifting gear, machinery, electrical installations, steering gear, auxiliary steering gear and radar?  All these things are of the utmost importance as far as safety at sea is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say apart from welcoming the Bill and joining with Deputy Deasy in saying that the Bill will be worth nothing if there are no inspectors to ensure that the regulations are observed by the shipowners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because I hope it will enable the Minister to make a regulation which I am particularly interested in.  I am speaking specifically about the operation of ferry boats from small ports, particularly from Dunquin to the Blasket Islands.  I am seriously concerned following a number of letters I got from very frightened people.  In one particular instance there were 55 people on board this ferry with no life jackets and no safety precautions whatsoever.  The county manager in Kerry got the same representations and he felt he was unable to introduce any regulations to combat this very serious situation that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the county manager that ferry boats that carry 12 passengers are licensed by the local authority but that ferry boats which carry over 12 passengers have to be licensed by the Department.  The people I am referring to have never applied for a licence.  If they were taken to court at the moment they would only be liable to a fine of £2 <Col N="3296" /> under an Act of 1908.  There is no mention of amending the 1908 Act to bring it up to date.  I am very seriously concerned about this.  I am frightened that something will happen because I cannot imagine 55 people on board the type of craft that is operating that service at the moment.  If that boat were to hit some type of flotsam floating in the Blasket Island sound, which is possible because there is a very strong current, something serious would happen.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the Dáil and for giving me the opportunity of bringing this up.  The county manager is so concerned about it that he has contacted the Department in an effort to get a necessary regulation made and have the law amended immediately. I appeal to the Minister not to wait for weeks but to do it now.  He has plenty of correspondence in his Department. I have contacted the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, on this issue and he has acknowledged my representations.  I hope the Minister will do something today even if it means putting an extra section into this Bill.  Otherwise I have no doubt that we will have a tragedy in Kerry.  A quick wind could blow up and where would those 55 people aboard this craft be?  I hate these fly-by-night operators. We have a good reputation in Kerry for looking after our tourists.  I appeal to the Minister &mdash; he has the ball at his feet &mdash; to add another section to this Bill to cover ferry boats offering these services. The people in the Dingle Peninsula, the licensing authority of the Kerry County Council and the passengers who use that ferry will be grateful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the universal acceptance of the Bill as being a suitable measure in a continuation of measures dealing with maritime safety.  I recognise the deep commitment of the speakers and their concern that we should do everything essential to maintain the highest possible standards both nationally and internationally in dealing with matters of safety at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy said, the question of personnel is of paramount importance in <Col N="3297" /> dealing with this legislation.  While there is an element of truth in what Deputy Deasy says about the full complement of staff necessary, it is not true that we are incapable of dealing with the number of applications and inspections needed.  We have three nautical surveyors on the staff and a fourth vacancy is to be filled.  It has not always been easy to get suitably qualified staff to apply for these positions when advertised but we hope to strengthen that section of the maritime division.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy was right in that we have an arrangement with the British authorities concerning examinations for certain types of personnel to man our ships.  This was a reasonably good arrangement and I ask Deputies to support the point of view that it provides for good standardisation if we operate under the examination papers being set and corrected by competent authorities in Britain.  Some examinations take place here but they are set and corrected by the British authorities.  This is not a bad arrangement seeing that we do not deal with the same numbers of maritime staff as do Britain which is a huge maritime nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to that procedure so long as we have sufficient staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the idea in allowing arrangements to be made in consultation with the British authorities.  It has worked reasonably well.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the question of personnel on board ship.  It has always been accepted that manning levels on our ships have been up to the highest international standards.  What the Deputy says about manning levels on other ships might be true.  A doubt was expressed recently that some ships might not have had the appropriate complement of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to fire-fighting measures on board ships and arrangements in relation to equipment on board ships registered here.  It has always been accepted that close attention is paid in the issuing of certificates to all that kind of equipment which is regarded as essential <Col N="3298" /> for fire-fighting purposes.  The Deputy can rest assured that we aim to provide a certificate so that all and sundry can recognise that the best fire-fighting equipment is on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that there is no fire-fighting course here for ships and that there is no self-contained breathing apparatus approved of by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Fire Brigade Acts a fire fighting course is primarily the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.  Practical arrangements with the Department of the Environment have been worked out and are at completion stage.  We hope that we will be able to accommodate the Deputy's anxiety in that regard in the near future.  I can readily see the need for a suitable course and we are in the final stages of arrangements with the Department in that regard.  As far as fire-fighting services are concerned generally, while there is always room for improvement it is generally accepted that there is a very high level of expertise and dedication within our fire brigades and that the very best of equipment has been provided by most of the local authorities. I was at a recent conference dealing with that and it was generally accepted that the best of equipment is made available to fire brigades.  But, as the Deputy says, we need an overall course so that we will have an integrated system.  That view is receiving active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was raised about the infrequent examination of ships.  That is not accurate at all.  We have an arrangement of annual and bi-annual surveys and certificates are issued by the Department surveyors on an annual and bi-annual basis.  It is interesting to note that we deal with certain types of surveys on an annual basis.  They include all kinds of passenger ships together with radio and communications equipment.  We have a bi-annual survey of all types of cargo ships which includes all life-saving equipment, fire-fighting equipment, construction and stability of ships, load lines and all that sort of thing.  Certificates are issued and they have to be produced on entry to most ports.  The surveys are carried out by <Col N="3299" /> surveyors in the Department of Transport and the necessary certificates are issued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point that all foreign registered ships entering French or British ports are examined.  As far as I understand it that is not the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  In relation to the carrying of toxic chemicals on ships and in relation to breathing apparatus and so on it is recognised that we comply with the very highest standards that apply through various conferences and protocols under IMCO regulations.  The Deputy should put his mind at rest on that score.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not just a reaction to the Betelgeuse disaster.  The 1974 convention was only just ratified by a significant number of countries that had to ratify it before it became effective.  It is not easy to get that number of countries, about two-thirds of all the countries contracting, to agree at the same time.  Agreement has now been reached and consequently it is a matter that we can entertain in this legislation.  The protocol of 1978, as Deputies know, has only come into force in May this year.  It would not be justifiable to say that we are behind in relation to enacting the necessary legislation to bring it into force.</P>
      <P>In case a question might be raised in relation to fire-fighting facilities at Bantry, the Minister for Labour has responsibility there and he has made very detailed safety regulations which will be complied with in any future operation which takes place there.  While we all regret disasters and the unfortunate tragic loss of life, we have not had a great history of that type of disaster here. While I agree that that is no reason for complacency it would indicate that our performance to date has been well up to international standards.  This legislation reinforces the view that we will make every necessary arrangements to ensure that we no not have a recurrence of such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that perhaps more random surveys should be undertaken. <Col N="3300" /> On-the-spot checks at random of certain types of operators would be a good thing.  The Deputy may rest assured I have taken note of it and when the surveying staff complement in the Department is stepped up &mdash; it is difficult to recruit these people &mdash; I will point out that this is a good point and I will pay particular attention to having it included in the overall survey being undertaken by the Department on a year-to-year basis.</P>
    <P>There is a very important EEC directive about to come into force.  It concerns a check list.  Every ship will have to have a check list which must be available to harbour masters and port authorities. They will have to prove they have an agreed check list of certificates before they can operate through any particular ports.  We will take all the necessary steps to implement that because inherent in that directive is the best means of guaranteeing that all ships plying between this country and other ports comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>There was reference to certain more sophisticated systems of monitoring operated in other waters.  I accept this as fair comment but I would point out that the Dover Straits have an exceptionally high level of traffic, one of the highest in the world, and for that reason it is absolutely essential to have very sophisticated technological radar in that area.  With the level of traffic in the Irish Sea I doubt whether it would be necessary to have a similar system installed here.  It is a point of view.  At the moment we provide something short of that system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that there is an incredible gap between Valentia Island and Land's End.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that.  I do not mean to sound smart-alecky when I say this but if you have a great many countries accepting the provisions of certain conventions and protocols and they are applying the regulations, as the Deputy wants us to apply the regulations, the fact is ships do not develop peculiarities overnight.  Ships have to ply from port to port.  They do not operate out of some nameless port.  It was suggested by the <Col N="3301" /> Deputy that many ports have very stringent regulations and apply these regulations rigorously.  By and large the bulk of our traffic would be with those very ports. I do not say this as a reason why we should not be as vigilant as possible but ships move from our ports to other ports and once the check list system is adopted that will be a great advance in keeping very strict control on the movement of ships.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to radio communication. I am pleased to say we are improving our communications.  We have undertaken to step up the level of performance of our VHF services.  That is essential.  Deputy Corish was concerned about this as was Deputy Deasy.  We must have a first-class communications system. We have taken the initial steps.  The Deputy can have the details if he wishes. Tenders have been received and we are examining them in connection with various locations primarily along the west coast.  Finance is being made available. There are difficulties with regard to sites and access to isolated areas.  It is my intention to provide in the immediate future the most sophisicated system we possibly can along the west coast.  I am talking now about Valentia and that area. Presumably that would satisfy the Deputy's requirements in that area.  It would be my intention to cover the whole coastline in due course.  I readily accept that this is not just necessary but essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of tonnage.  Deputy Corish specifically referred to this.  Our regulations are primarily concerned with tonnage over 500 tons.  It is interesting to note, as I said on Second Stage, that it was intended originally that certain types of systems would apply only to ships over 100,000 tons.  We are bringing that down to 20,000 because I believe we should make the situation as tight as possible where inert gas systems are concerned to solve some of the problems that have been experienced in some recent tragedies at sea.  All new ships of 2,000 tons and more will have to be fitted with the inert gas system.  That is the most important type of proportion that can be taken at the moment to solve some of the problems that have arisen as a result of <Col N="3302" /> explosions.  The on-deck fault system may not be quite as important as the inert gas system but it does provide an added safeguard and will be applied in the case of all new ships.  It will be applied in the case of older vessels on a time scale.  That is a big advance.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the coastguard service.  I have given particular attention to that and I agree with many of the points raised by the Deputy.  We should have the best possible service.  There will be a detailed examination and the necessary improvements will be made to bring the service up to the highest international standard.  A good deal of finance is involved but I doubt if anyone would begrudge money spent in that area and it is almost as if one had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the amount required at the latest available date in 1981 to purchase what £1 would have purchased in June 1977; and (b) the percentage decrease in the value of the Irish pound between 1977 and 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) On the basis of the consumer price index, which is calculated in respect of mid-February, mid-May, <Col N="3304" /> mid-August and mid-November each year, it is estimated that £1.62 would be required in mid-February 1981 &mdash; the latest available date &mdash; to purchase the same quantities of goods and services as £1 would have purchased in mid-May 1977.</P>
      <P>(b) Estimates of the percentage change in the domestic purchasing value of the Irish pound are based on the percentage change in the consumer price index.  It is estimated that the domestic purchasing value of the Irish pound fell by 38.1 per cent between mid-May 1977 and mid-February 1981, the latest date for which the index is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State now agree that our present high inflation rate of 21 per cent &mdash; the highest in Europe &mdash; budget deficits, the excessive borrowing we have had and the doubling of the national debt in the last four years have all accelerated the decrease in the value of the Irish £?  Would the Minister of State not agree also that this is completely contrary to what was promised in the famous manifesto of 1977, when his party promised the exact opposite to the Irish people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do admit that the inflation rate is high.  But I might point out that in 1977 the increase was 90 per cent. Therefore the lesson there is that, if this Government were not in power, the people would be an awful lot worse off than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, whereas during the period of the National Coalition our domestic inflation rate ran at 3 per cent less than the rate of imported inflation, in terms of imported price increases, under this Government it is running at 3 per cent more than the rate of imported price increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's statement.  I would point out from the evidence I have here today that the increase under the last Government was 90 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister I think is aware that what I have stated is correct <Col N="3305" /> and that what is under the control of our Government are the variations between the imported rate of inflation and our own.  Is the Minister aware of what the figures are, that during that four year period we kept the rate of inflation down to 3 per cent below the rate of imported price increase, whereas this Government has pushed it up 3 per cent above that rate?  Is that not the true measure of the performance of a Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many facets to this, but I do say that the Deputy's party stand indicated by their failure when they were in power.  I think we will let it go at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I am not going to get much further with my question, but I think my point has been made. Would the Minister indicate to us, in respect of the second half of the reply, what is the decrease in the purchasing power of the Irish pound over and above what he calls the domestic decrease, that is to say, what is the decline in the period in the trade-weighted value of the Irish pound externally over and above the internal domestic decline in its value in terms of our currency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds like an economic lecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an economic question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I will repeat the second part of the question which reads:</P>
      <P>Estimates of the percentage change in the domestic purchasing value of the Irish pound are based on the percentage change in the consumer price index.  It is estimated that the domestic purchasing value of the Irish pound fell by 38.1 per cent between mid-May 1977 and mid-February 1981, the latest date for which the index is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister why the estimates are on the basis of the domestic purchasing power when in fact account should be taken, and is taken, by any economist assessing this <Col N="3306" /> question of purchasing power, of the fall in the value of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> other currencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking why it happened I would say because of a world recession.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware that refuse dumping on an organised and planned scale by Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council appears to be continuing on the area of Sandymount Strand, Dublin which is an area governed by the Foreshore Act, 1933; the information that has been given by him under section 13 of that Act to enable this dumping to proceed; if he will make available a map clearly indicating the area for which permission has been obtained; the date on which that permission was granted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that no dumping is being carried out on Sandymount Strand by Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board some months ago completed reclamation of an area of foreshore in this location for which consent under the Foreshore Act, 1933, was originally granted in 1968.  Consent was given to the ESB in 1967 for reclamation east of the area covered by the consent to the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I understand that reclamation was completed a number of years ago.  I will make available to the Deputy a map showing both areas if he contacts my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="3307" /> whether the map in question is one of a sufficiently large scale to show the area accurately?  Is the Minister aware that all maps that have been made available to public representatives or other interested parties so far have been small scale maps with lines drawn with a thick pen, giving no clear indication as to the precise area in question?  Can we be clear that we will now have a map which will show with precision the area for which permission was given and that that map will be authenticated as the one relating to the permission when it was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems adequate for the requirements, but should the Deputy wish it expended or blown up I am sure we can accommodate him in that respect also.  Anyway, no further consent has been given since the consent to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would accept that, if one has approved a rough, small scale map on which lines are drawn with a thick pen, that does not get one any further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that when permission of this kind is given it must be given in the same terms as any permission which involves property, with an exact delineation on a large scale map?  Is there such a map or is there not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the basis on which the Dublin Port and Docks Board claims ownership of a portion of Sandymount and Merrion Strands under a conveyance made to it by the Earl of Pembroke; the date on which it was legally conveyed to the board; whether his Department was consulted on the matter; and if he will make available a map indicating the precise area of Sandymount shore and strand that has been allegedly conveyed by the Earl of Pembroke and his estate to the board.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board acquired the fee simple interest in about 650 acres of foreshore on Sandymount Strand from the Pembroke Estate by deed of conveyance dated 3 November 1962.  The board had been legally advised that the title of the Pembroke Estate was a perfectly good one.  My Department was consulted and consent, as required by section 158 of the Harbours Act, 1946, was given to the acquisition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the Chairman of the Fire Prevention Council on four occasions to discuss matters concerning the task force, the establishment of which he announced in this House on 18 February 1981, cols. 1990 and 1991, volume 326 of the Official Report.  The meetings took place on the morning and the afternoon of 16 February, on 25 February and on 26 March 1981.</P>
      <P>The role of the task force is to undertake a number of special projects aimed at increasing public awareness of fire hazards, with particular reference to places of public entertainment and resort, including the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Special seminars or conferences at <Col N="3310" /> various centres for proprietors and managers of discos, dancehalls, night clubs, hotels and other places of public entertainment. The first of these, dealing with fire prevention in hotels, was held on 22 April 1981 in Dublin.  A seminar for proprietors and managers of discos, dancehalls and function rooms was held in Dublin on 14 May 1981 and further similar seminars will be held in provincial centres.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A television, radio, press and cinema campaign with the object of educating the public in relation to the exercise of diligence and awareness when attending places of public entertainment and resort.  This campaign will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The preparation of leaflets and posters for proprietors and managers of discos, dancehalls, night clubs, function rooms and hotels giving guidance on fire safety procedures.  A leaflet on fire dangers in hotels has already been produced.</P>
    <P>The matter was considered by the Fire Prevention Council at my request and these proposals were put forward as being special projects additional to their normal programme.  The task force comprises, in addition to the Chairman of the Fire Prevention Council, Mr. G. Cronin, who heads the force, the fire adviser of my Department, Mr. J. Connolly, and supporting administrative staff.  The services of further technical staff will be provided for the task force as required.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a sum of £125,000 will be required to finance the activities of the task force this year.  As I have already indicated the cost of the task force will be met by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the Stardust disaster and other recent tragedies, it is a matter of speeding up and it is additional to the activities of the Fire Prevention Council.  It is to take immediate action in regard especially to making the public aware of the dangers of fire and also to organise those seminars with managers and proprietors of discos, dancehalls and so on and do it more speedily and try to bring about quick action.  This is in addition to the activities of the Fire Prevention Council, with extra staff.</P>

      <P>No, I am not saying that but it was realised that the activities needed to be stepped up and improved, that increased activity was needed in this area.

Apart from that, as the Minister has said, there will be more people <Col N="3312" /> doing the job.  Is it the intention of the task force to confine its activities to places of entertainment or is the matter of other fire dangers such as in the case of hospitals, schools and so on going to be dealt with by the task force?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force was brought in as an addition to, not a duplication of, the work of the Fire Prevention Council. It was set up to go into all aspects of fire dangers and the immediate problems at places where people gather and the immediate hazards that were presenting themselves as very serious hazards were discos, dancehalls, hotels and various things like that.  Their job is to give special attention to identifying the dangers attached to such places and to making the public aware of those dangers and also to make managers and proprietors aware of what might be done and have a fresh look at the problem.  It is not a duplication; it is an addition in order to bring about a speedy result.  They are not excluding hospitals or such places.  These are included.  I have just mentioned the immediate ones.</P>

      <P>An interim report from the local authority has been received in my Department in this case and a copy of the report has been forwarded to the staff member concerned for any observations he may wish to offer.  When an officer of <Col N="3313" /> a local authority is suspended under section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1941, it is established practice for the manager to forward a report of the results of his investigations with a recommendation as to the disciplinary action, if any, to be taken in the case.  The suspended officer is then given an opportunity to state his case.  The statements of both sides are fully considered and such further observations as are considered necessary may be sought from either or both parties before the case is finally decided. In the present circumstances of the case referred to by the Deputy, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to make any statement in the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The special mortgage subsidy scheme and the local housing information centres are two elements in a wide-ranging package of housing initiatives which the Minister announced on 10 April 1981.  In addition to these elements, the Housing Package 1981 embraces the local authority house purchase and improvement loans schemes, the local authority housing programme, a scheme for financing improvement works to rented local authority houses, tax allowances for the provision of rented residential accommodation, increased financial assistance for voluntary housing bodies, and improvements in certain housing grant schemes.  A summary of the main features of the package was set out in a prominent advertisement published in the national daily newspapers on 16 April.  An explanatory leaflet on the special mortgage subsidy scheme was also available to the public on that day.  A circular letter giving detailed particulars of all aspects of the package issued to local housing authorities and recognised voluntary housing bodies on 8 May 1981. Amending legislation is being prepared to give statutory effect to the special mortgage subsidy scheme from 10 April 1981.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether funds will be made available to local authorities in urban areas in order to provide the housing information service recently announced by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister announced details of the Housing Package 1981 on 10 April 1981, he said that the many measures contained in the package illustrated the complexity of housing needs and entitlements.  In view of the wide-ranging nature of housing problems generally, I see the necessity for the establishment of local housing information centres at which a comprehensive housing information service would be available to the public at the principal local levels.  I consider, however, that the costs of operating the centres, which will provide a service of local benefits should appropriately be met from the local authorities' own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, certain elements of the package will result in savings in expenditure financed by local authorities. <Col N="3319" /> For example, the low-rise mortgage scheme is being phased out with a consequent saving to local authorities in subsidy payments.  Payment of the special mortgage subsidy to eligible applicants will be made by my Department.  Similarly, where a local authority decides to pay an annual subsidy to a voluntary housing body providing certain housing accommodation for eligible categories of housing need, half of the subsidy will be recouped by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that he unilaterally announced the provision of a service to be funded by local authorities, which are ostensibly autonomous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is information we expect local authorities to give the public on all aspects of housing matters.  I consider it a well worthwhile and necessary service.  That was why I gave the savings to local authorities which will enable them to provide the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say he had decided that the local authorities would provide this service and pay for the cost of it, although they did not have any discretion or prior knowledge of the matter.  Is the Minister aware that the Minister for the Environment attended a meeting at the turn of the year in Kilkenny of the City and County Managers Association at which the managers of all local authorities impressed upon him the cash crisis they were in at that time and the fact that they did not envisage they would be in a position to continue to maintain the existing services in 1981?  In view of that information from the chief executives of local authorities how does the Minister envisage that additional services can be provided and funded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing package of 1981 provides for the replacement of the low-rise mortgage scheme and there will, therefore, be a saving accruing to local authorities in the future because they will not have to pay subsidies to such cases, apart from transitional cases.</P>

Is that the idea behind the arrangement?  The next question refers to the low-rise mortgage scheme and I should like to know if the Minister will try to justify the virtual abolition of the low-rise mortgage scheme which was put in to assist those who were on a very low income, and now appears to be there to substitute it to pay money to people, many of whom could very well pay the full interest on the loan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment why he has decided to abolish the low-rise mortgage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided to phase out the low-rise mortgage scheme and instead <Col N="3321" /> to bring in a new scheme of special loans and subsidies for eligible categories of persons.  Under the scheme persons previously eligible for the low-rise mortgage scheme will be able to get loans of up to 98 per cent of the approved value of a private house subject to a maximum loan of £18,000.  As before, a person who wishes to purchase rather than rent the new local authority house allocated to him may get a mortgage of up to the full net cost.</P>
      <P>Instead of the graduated subsidy available to applicants under the low-rise mortgage scheme it is intended that the special mortgage subsidy will apply to persons who qualify for the special loan of £18,000 whether they buy new or previously occupied houses and also to persons who qualify for a mortgage to purchase a newly allocated local authority house.  I think that answers the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that the Government have decided to abolish any income limit in relation to housing interest subsidies?  I refer him to the bottom of page 1 of the housing section where it states there is no means test and that the new housing subsidy applies to both single and married persons.  Does he agree that that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, as is stated on page 3 of the same circular, there is going to be an inordinate demand for funds to pay for people who can afford to buy houses in their own right.  Would the Minister of State, therefore, agree that the purpose of the low rise mortgage scheme was to give financial assistance to people who could not afford to finance the purchase of a house on their own and that the effect of this measure is, in classic Robin Hood style <i>á la</i> Fianna Fáil, to take from the poor and redistribute to the rich on the eve of an election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy knows full well that that is not the position. The maximum loan was £12,000 or <Col N="3322" /> 98 per cent of the value of the house, whichever was less.  A mortgage up to the full cost of providing the house could apply to the purchase of a new house and the repayments of the loan could be reduced by a combined State and local authority subsidy of £624.  They are going to be far better off under the new housing package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, the Minister of State knows definitely that they are going to be far better off under this package, but how much is it going to cost?  He will have to relate it to general taxation and foreign borrowing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that a scheme which was operating specifically to deal with people in the lower income groups to assist them in purchasing their houses by subsidising their rent over a period up to the tenth year is now being substituted by a scheme which, on the face of it, will give a loan to anybody who has not previously bought a house over a much shorter period, three years, and will prevent those who cannot afford to pay the high interest rate from buying such a house because they will not be able to find for the next six years the subsidy which would be given under the low-rise mortgage scheme?  Secondly, is the Minister of State saying that the amount of money, millions of pounds, which has been found to be inadequate for the year 1980, is now going to be used to apply to a much greater group of people so that the money which could not be given last year will not be available at all this year? Does the Minister of State know that?  Is this just eyewash, because there is to be a general election and people will not get an opportunity of looking at all this in time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment why he proposes to maintain the local authority housing programme at a level of 6,000 completions a year in view of the substantial housing application list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the local authority housing programme is to provide satisfactory housing accommodation for families who are in need of rehousing but who are not able to provide the necessary accommodation from their own resources.  The level of the programme is determined on the basis of the overall housing need as indicated by the approved waiting lists of housing authorities and the capital for local authority house construction provided by the Government in the context of the general economic situation and the competing demands for other social services.  On the basis of these criteria the Government have decided on a programme geared to provide about 6,000 new houses each year.  Combined with casual vacancies in existing local authority houses this allows for the rehousing annually of between 8,000 and 9,000 approved applicants off waiting lists.  The average number of approved applicants on housing application lists in the four years 1977 to 1980 was 26,730 which, in effect, indicates a three year turnover of all approved applications, two-thirds of which were in respect of families of three persons or fewer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of local authority housing cannot be considered in isolation from other important facets of housing policy.  Directly as a result of this Government's overall policy on housing, annual housing completions have been increasing steadily since 1976 when 24,000 were completed.  The total completions last year, 27,785, was an all time record.  Because of the Government's measures to encourage home ownership, the most recent of which was the housing <Col N="3329" /> package which the Minister announced on 10 April, many who might otherwise look to local authorities for rehousing are in a position to provide their own houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that during the period of the last Government in office the then Fianna Fáil leader on more than one occasion claimed that the Government were building too many local authority houses in relation to the total number of houses being built and in fact, when the present Government took office, they put that theory into practice?  Is it not true the Government are building fewer local authority houses than were built since 1972?  Is the Minister also aware that a local authority on the verge of Dublin city and Dublin county are in fact considering 148 applications for 48 local authority houses?  Does he not know that every local authority in Ireland have had their waiting lists increased enormously because of the stupid policy adopted by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this is not the position.  As I said, our aim is for approximately 6,000 local authority houses per year.  I indicated in my reply that this is geared to dealing with the applications we have before us.  Home ownership for people has always been the policy of this Government.  We are doing everything in our power to encourage people to have their own homes and that is the reason that we brought in this new housing package. I consider this to be the right policy. Our record with regard to local authority housing is one we can be proud of and is nothing to be ashamed about.</P>

It was also stated that, arising from the results of the 1979 Census of Population and from data for the labour force surveys taken in 1977 and 1979, the revised estimate of the number at work in the industry was 87,000 in April 1977 and 101,000 in April 1979.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment (a) whether he has access to figures which would show the growth in the number of vehicles registered for persons resident in the South County Dublin area between 1970 and 1980; (b) whether he knows of any other area in the country in which the growth in this period has been so rapid; (c) whether he is aware of the serious problems of road safety, road amenities and of energy waste and the social cost implied by this development; and (d) the <Col N="3334" /> proposals he has for improving the situation without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Vehicle registration figures compiled by licensing authorities relate to the total number of vehicles registered with them as being ordinarily kept in their area.  Separate figures are not available of the number of vehicles registered in the names of persons resident in any particular part of a licensing authority's area.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy's information, I can, however, advise him that the total number of vehicles registered with Dublin Corporation, which is the licensing authority for Dublin city and county, increased by 56 per cent in the ten year period from 1970 to 1980.  This increase is comparable to that experienced in Cork city and county over the same period.  However, the growth in percentage terms was considerably greater in Galway city and county 88 per cent, Kerry 77 per cent and Donegal 70 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the implications of the growth which has taken place in the vehicle population over the last decade. The Government are committed to the road development plan which is designed to remove deficiencies in the road network, improve the mobility, efficiency and safety of road transport and generally bring the country's road network including that in the Dublin region to a standard capable of meeting present and future needs.  As evidence of this commitment, the Minister has this year allocated the unprecedented total of £87 million in road grants.  Of this, Dublin County Council have been allocated £9.822 million, a substantial portion of which is in respect of major improvement works in the southern part of the county.</P>
      <P>The Government have announced their decision to establish the Dublin Transportation Authority and measures towards this end are being pursued by the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his reply reflects the total indifference of his Department to the special and unique conditions of congestion in the southern part of County Dublin, <Col N="3335" /> in as much as the increase he has spoken about is taking place in a county you would lose in County Cork or County Galway?  Does he not recognise there is a problem of a very different order when you get an increase in an area which you can cross on a bicycle in half an hour as compared with an area like County Cork which is 100 miles from one extreme to the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked a specific question &mdash; whether the Minister knows of any other area in the country in which the growth in this period has been so rapid.  I gave him that information and he is criticising me for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the thrust of the question obvious to the Minister?  Is it not clearly intended to extract from him an admission that the traffic problems in South County Dublin &mdash; aggravated by the growth in the car owning population over the past ten years &mdash; are unique in the country?  Admit it.  The Minister will be over here in a few months' time getting someone on our side to admit it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Government have recognised this problem.  That is why an unprecedented sum of £87 million has been made available for the entire country.  This year's road grant to Dublin County Council amounted to £9.822 million, an increase of 56 per cent over the level of grants to the council in 1980, or 289 per cent over the level of grants allocated by the Coalition Government in 1977.</P>

      <P>If the Government's concern about South County Dublin is so burning, I want to ask the Minister about three specific projects so well known that they are household words.  First, what are the Government's proposals about reutilising the route of the old Harcourt <Col N="3336" /> Street line?  Second, what are the Government's proposals for building a relief road along the Southern Cross route? Third, what are the Government's proposals for building a by-pass avoiding the village of Dundrum?

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister an idea of the dimensions of the problem?  Does he know the distance of dual carriageway that £9 million will build in 1981 or 1982, 1983 and 1984, which is the least time for a project like that.  How much of a carriageway could you put in for that much money?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> asked the Minister for Health the urgent proposals he or the Eastern Health Board have to deal with the consequences of industrial action taken by hospital porters, auxiliaries and domestics; if he is aware that St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, has had to cancel visiting <Col N="3337" /> facilities as from today; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take both questions together.  As part of a programme of industrial action in pursuit of a pay claim, an overtime ban is being introduced today by porters employed in Dublin voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that this action does not involve any risk to patients.  I might add that the preparation of meals by management staff does not arise at this stage.  However, some hospitals have considered it necessary to cancel night visiting facilities with effect from this evening&mdash;from a recent check we are aware of only one, St. Vincent's.  Hospitals administered by the Eastern Health Board, such as St. Brendan's, Grangegorman, are not affected by this dispute.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that every effort has been made to prevent this dispute from taking place, including a full Labour Court investigation.  However, the offer to the staff concerned, amounting to £9.08 a week, was rejected following a ballot.  This sum was, of course, in addition to the standard increases under the national understanding.</P>
      <P>I have at all times been in close contact with this dispute and I shall continue to make every effort to have this resolved. I am very anxious to avoid any inconvenience for patients or their relatives.</P>
      <P>A Labour Court conciliation conference has been arranged and this will take place tomorrow morning.  Therefore, I ask the House to refrain from further comment this evening which might exacerbate the situation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister aware that from this evening porters' duties will be halved, that only half the duties of porters will be carried out, and that during the weekend there will not be any porters available at all?  Does that not mean that immobile patients will have to be moved to and from theatres by medical or nursing staffs?  If this goes on much longer, does it not spell a complete breakdown of hospital services in the hospitals affected?  Are these hospitals not preparing to send patients home?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that, as I said in my statement, I take this matter very seriously.  I have been in very close contact with it.  It is an industrial dispute and it has been fully and thoroughly investigated by the Labour Court.  The findings of the Labour Court, which provides the industrial machinery available for such disputes have been turned down. A Labour Court conciliation conference has been arranged for tomorrow morning. With the ban coming in this evening, having arranged the Labour Court conciliation conference in the morning represents urgent action.  I can assure the Deputies it is being dealt with urgently within the machinery available.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister tell us why, in this very sensitive area involving suffering, hardship, anxiety to patients and their immediate relatives, things were left to get to the stage this dispute has reached before the Minister or the Department involved themselves effectively?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask three brief questions.  How long has the Minister been aware of the dispute?  Second, is there not a danger that the involvement of senior staff, usually engaged in administrative duties, in duties which are not theirs in order to substitute for those on strike or in dispute will inevitably mean there will be some degree of hazard or risk to the normal good management of the hospitals which could involve problems for patient?  Three, is it a fact that at this moment hospitals are preparing lists of patients for early release?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Deputies not to prejudge industrial relations procedures. I certainly will not do it.  The resolution of industrial disputes is difficult enough in any event and I have asked Deputies to desist from this line of questioning so that those who are directly involved trying to resolve the dispute can bring it to resolution.  In relation to the preparations and plans which management might have, the Deputy is anticipating, as management would have to anticipate, the problems that might arise if the dispute is not resolved soon.</P>

      <P>I was accommodating Deputy Deasy in this regard.  I was agreeing with him that there was a need to improve the facility so far as radio and telephone <Col N="3358" /> communications are concerned in our 53 sub-stations around the country.  Practically all countries have search and rescue operations around their coasts and they involve very many services like the lifeboat service, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the security forces, the police, the harbour authorities and so on.  The Department itself chairs the committee to co-ordinate the marine search and rescue service in the country.  I agreed that there is a need for improvement in that area and it is being undertaken as speedily as possible.  The Deputy made reference to this country being a safe haven for drug stocks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody asked, I suppose hoping that it might not be possible to give the exact information, when was the last prosecution taken under this legislation. The most recent prosecution under this legislation was in 1980 and it bears a direct relationship to what Deputy Begley said about the operator in the Blasket Islands.  Deputy Begley can rest assured that immediate action has already been put in train to deal with that matter.  I agree with him that we cannot waste any time in having the matter put in hand properly.  The Deputy will understand that county councils have responsibility for dealing with licensing ferries carrying less than 12 passengers and that the Department are responsible for those carrying more than 12 passengers.  Rather than alarm anybody, let me say that it is my intention to take the necessary action to deal with this particular operator and hopefully it will be possible to create a safe situation if, as I presume, this ferry is necessary and can be licensed and the proper precautions and safety measures <Col N="3359" /> complied with.  That will be dealt with this evening.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Begley for bringing it to my notice.  There was another issue raised which relates to safety.  That is the question of the <i>Cristos Bitas</i> and about the British ordering it to be taken away from their coast.  As the Deputy knows, it finished up about half way between our coast and their coast and subsequently it was scuttled.  The disposal of the vessel by sinking was decided in an agreement between the two Governments.  That is the usual manner in which these things are dealt with. There is a good deal of co-operation and consultation between the various maritime states dealing with all matters concerning shipping.</P>
      <P>I will now direct some of my replies to Deputy Corish who raised certain matters. His first one was in connection with the delay which he feels has been experienced in this matter since 1974.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  But the Deputy will understand that quite a large number of countries have not yet ratified this convention or the protocol attaching thereto.  In fact the 25 ratifications necessary to make it effective were only reached this summer and I believe that there has been no undue delay, as the protocol only became effective in May of this year.  In fairness, it could not be said that we have been in any way tardy in having the matter put in hand.  The Deputy made reference to the regulations and orders that might be made contingent on this legislation.  As is customary, such regulations and orders as are required by Statute will be made before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy also made reference to the question of particular ships that might not be covered by this. This measure includes passenger and cargo vessels.  The Deputy will appreciate <Col N="3360" /> that this legislation applies to vessels in excess of 500 tons.  But he can rest assured that it would be my intention that we would apply it across the board to all vessels irrespective of their size.  The Deputy also made reference to the fact that fishing vessels were being excluded. The situation is that fishing fleets are exempt from the control of this legislation because they are covered by a separate convention.  I think it is the Torremolinos Convention of 1977.  That has not yet been ratified here but it is the intention of the Department to get it moved up in the legislative programme as soon as possible because it is important that fishing vessels would also be subject to the reasonably strict conditions that are applied to other vessels.</P>
      <P>As far as warships and their involvement in this legislation are concerned, they are specifically excluded from this convention.  This is standard practice in relation to warships.  I understand that there are reasonably strict regulations attaching to the furnishing and equipment of warships, for obvious reasons.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish referred to Whiddy and we all regret the tragedy that <Col N="3361" /> took place there.  The fire-fighting equipment and facilities necessary to deal with any outbreak there are covered by the Department of Labour regulations which will be applied rigorously to any new operator or any continuing operation there.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made reference also to exemptions for single journeys.  That was a decision taken by IMCO in support of the situation that arises in the delivery of a ship.  It was felt that until such time as the owners took possession of the ship in the port where the contract was to be signed, there would be an exemption order.  Once the ship goes into normal usage the full rigour of the legislation is imposed.  I do not know if that is specifically stated in the convention but the intention of the framers of the convention was that it would apply to single journeys and that that would be a case in point where it might apply.</P>
      <P>While there are very high risk cargoes every effort is made to ensure that there are no inherent dangers attaching to them.  We must all accept that in a developing economy high risk substances will have to be transported.  I understand that from the conventions ratified and the conventions we will deal with in the programme of legislation to up date our participation in all these conventions a comprehensive package of safety regulations will emerge to deal with all matters concerned with ferrying whatever substances are necessary to keep the economy going. I again express my gratitude for the unanimous acceptance and support of Deputy Deasy and Deputy Corish of this legislation which will form not the total package dealing with all matters connected with marine safety but which will serve as a further step in the programme to bring about a situation where we can be reasonably assured that everything we can do is being done to provide the best and safest possible means of transportation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present law relating to patents is the Patents Act, 1964, which brought up to date at that time the first Act relating to patents enacted after the foundation of the State, namely, the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act of 1927.  The Bill now before the House is designed to bring our patent law up to date to meet modern conditions and to harmonise it with that of other countries, in particular with that of EEC countries. Since 1964 there has been considerable international negotiation, in which we have co-operated, aimed at harmonisation of law between different countries, at facilitating protection of invention in different countries, and in particular at avoiding wasteful duplication of effort by inventors in securing such protection. The second main object of the Bill, and this is really another facet of the first object, is to enable us to ratify two international patent agreements, the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-Operation Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more important of these agreements is the European Patent Convention. The history of this instrument goes <Col N="3363" /> back to an EEC initiative of the early sixties, which, because of political reasons, did not make great progress until it was revived in the wider European context at the end of the decade and which culminated in the Convention on the Grant of European Patents, otherwise known as the European Patent Convention, which was signed on behalf of 14 European countries, including Ireland, in Munich in 1973.</P>
    <P>The duplication and waste to which I refer arose out of the fact that an inventor has to file a separate application for a patent for his invention in each of the countries where he wishes to get protection, and to go through a complicated but essentially similar grant procedure in each of these countries.  The cost and delays involved in processing these individual applications are very large.  By contrast, under the European Patent Convention, anyone seeking patent protection for an invention in a number of states which are members of the system will file one application designating the states in which he desires protection.  The application will be examined pursuant to the code of patent law as set out in the convention by the European Patents Office set up under the convention.</P>
    <P>This code, which forms a new common body of law, may be regarded as the embodiment of concepts in the field of patent law and practice which are generally accepted in the European Economic Community, in Europe generally and elsewhere in the world.  When the European patent is granted, the effect of the convention is that it results in a number of national patents in each of the countries designated by the applicant, and in each of these countries, the patent is, in principle, subject to the law of the individual state in respect of which it is granted, that is to the law applicable to the national patent.  This carries the corollary that the procedure for the grant of patents by our Patents Office has to be aligned with that for the grant of patents through the European Patents Office, so that the status of the patent is the same <Col N="3364" /> in both cases whether it goes through the European route or the national route.</P>
    <P>The second important international convention being dealt with under this Bill is the Patent Co-Operation Treaty, which has also been signed on behalf of Ireland.  This is a world-wide, and not merely a European, treaty, and it is also designed to simplify the processing of applications for a patent for the same invention in a number of countries.  The procedure involves one application in one language, and one set of fees instead of a number of separate national applications. The single application is processed at the start in a central search and/or examination authority, and is then sent to the separate designated national patent offices for further treatment leading up to the actual grant of the patent. The European Patent Convention is designed to tie in closely with the requirements of the Patent Co-Operation Treaty.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will bring our law into line with the two international agreements to which I have referred and will enable us to ratify them. The enactment will enable us to benefit from the cutting of duplication and waste inherent in the international patent system and will simplify and rationalise applications for protection for inventions.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted and comes into operation, it will be possible for Ireland to join with our colleagues in other countries in ratifying the two international agreements referred to.  The present number of countries which have ratified the two agreements is 11 for the European Patent Convention and 30 for the Patent Co-Operation Treaty.</P>
    <P>While the Bill represents a major revision of our law, many elements of our present law remain and the general layout of the Bill is closely similar to that of our present Act.  I might help Deputies if I indicated briefly some of the highlights of the Bill and some of the changes which we propose to introduce into the law as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>Part II, that is sections 6-11, lists the requirements which govern the question <Col N="3365" /> as to whether an invention is patentable. These requirements are the same as those set out in the European Patent Convention and an important part in these requirements is that the invention must involve an inventive step.  This is defined by saying in section 10 that the invention is not obvious to a person skilled in the art, that is, in the processes and &ldquo;tricks of the trade&rdquo; of the particular field of the inventions.  This is a very important change in our present law.  It brings our law into line with the more stringent standard of most of our major trading partners, and it should strengthen the Irish patent, and should increase considerably the presumption of validity of that patent, thereby enhancing the value of our patents system.</P>
    <P>The definition of novelty in this part of the Bill is also taken from the European Patent Convention and is broadly in line with our existing law.  The present arrangements for &ldquo;dividing&rdquo; an application are in essence continued in section 21, but the possibility of getting a &ldquo;patent of addition&rdquo; which was a possibility under the 1964 Act, will no longer exist.</P>
    <P>The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, to which we are parties, makes provision for &ldquo;priority&rdquo;, which is the system under which the date of filing of a first application in a contracting state, will be respected as the &ldquo;priority date&rdquo; in other contracting states provided the applications are filed in these other countries within 12 months of the date of filing of the first application. These provisions have always been part of our law and they are continued in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>A further important change proposed in the law is that the new Bill will not provide for continuing the long-standing present system whereby applicants could file &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; and &ldquo;complete&rdquo; specifications. These specifications are being dispensed with and in future every specification must be the subject of a separate application and may proceed in its own right to grant or may serve as a basis for priority in respect of a later application, that is in the European Patents Office or in other countries.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill provides for examination <Col N="3366" /> of an application to be carried out in two parts, namely, preliminary examination and substantive examination. Both of these examinations are on request and on compliance with certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Another important change which it is proposed to make is that the patent term will be 20 years, and not 16 years as at present.  Twenty years is the period provided in the European Patent Convention and apart from this the general consensus is that, because of the longer time which is necessary for the development of inventions in these modern times, the extension of the monopoly term is well justified.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for appeal to the High Court from the controller's decisions remain essentially as at present.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill to which I should perhaps refer is section 38, which extends the protection given by a patent to protection against indirect use.  This provision will enable a patentee to stop third parties from deriving benefits from the invention without directly using it.</P>
    <P>A further extension of our present law is provided by section 41 which gives certain protection to an application after it is published, thereby making the protection conferred by the patent, if granted, retroactive to the date when the application is published.  This revision follows the general principles of the European Patent Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 40 expresses a principle of equity, namely, the principle of &ldquo;exhaustion of rights&rdquo;, which is new to Irish law, although it is a principle well known in foreign patent law.  The section restricts the patentee's rights to the extent that the first sale in commerce of a patented product exhausts the patent monopoly and after such first sale he cannot restrict acts concerning that particular product. The section provides for such exhaustion of rights not alone after the product has been put on the market in the State but also after it has been put on the market in any other member state of the EEC and this accords with general principles of EEC law.</P>
    <P>Section 42(3) in effect reflects another provision in the European Patent Convention <Col N="3367" /> which defines the extent of protection accorded by a patent.  The section ensures that the criteria for the interpretation of claims of domestic and European patents will be the same and will be in harmony with the interpretation of claims in other contracting states.</P>
    <P>The transition from the present law to the new law is catered for by the Second Schedule.  In principle this replacement will not effect things done in the past. The schedule provides detailed provisions to cover the question of applications and patents in existence at the commencement of the new law.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add, for the information of Deputies, that, following the ratification of the European Patent Convention, which this Bill is designed to enable us to do, the next step will be to ratify another very important convention &mdash; the Convention of the European Patent for the Common Market, or the Community Patent Convention as it is called. It is our intention to proceed at a later date with ratification of this convention.</P>
    <P>I recommend the principle of this Bill for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill has been the subject of some speculation, not amongst the public at large indeed but amongst people who are dealing directly in this very specialised field. The subject may be regarded, I suppose, as somewhat esoteric.  However, one must say that the Bill before the House will have far-reaching effects and I am surprised that the Minister introducing the Bill spent more than half the time, four out of a six-and-a-half page statement, dealing with the provisions of the Bill without going in any great depth into the consequences the Bill may have on the existing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions will have significant effects on industry.  They could have serious consequences for those directly involved in this specialised field, namely, the patent agents or &ldquo;patent attorneys&rdquo; as they are more correctly described. From the industrial point of view the position here is quite satisfactory.  In <Col N="3368" /> making that statement in the light of what the Minister has said in relation to harmonisation and how better off we would be if this legislation were enacted, let me say that because of our size geographically, our market size, and our remoteness in world terms, people with entrepreneurial skills have been free in this country to manufacture what they liked. Because of what I have said in many instances inventors have not registered for patents in this country.  The position that has obtained up to now is that Irish people with the kind of skills in entrepreneurial fields I have mentioned can avail of these inventions in a very simple manner because the protection applying where patents have been taken out in other countries has not obtained here. The kind of people about whom we are talking, who normally deal in seeking protection and taking out patents are in many cases large multinational companies. Because of the size of our country, the market here and so on, up to now at least these people have not bothered to seek protection in this country.</P>
    <P>One must question the advisability of the introduction of this Bill at this time when one considers particularly the degree to which opposition has been expressed to its introduction at this time &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; and I will explain why later.  In particular when one looks at the people and the groups who are expressing, and who have expressed, their vehement opposition to this Bill, one cannot but scratch one's head and ask oneself: why this Bill at this time? One finds that groups such as the Confederation of Irish Industry, the IIRS, the Irish Goods Council, added to which are the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Junior Chamber Ireland and the Association of Registered Patents Agents in this country, in one voice have all expressed the view that this Bill should not be introduced at this time.  They have given very good reasons for that view.</P>
    <P>When one examines the groups that have seen fit to express that opposition to the Bill one finds that some of them make very strange bedfellows indeed.  It is good to see that they agree even on matters such as patents.  But there is a common <Col N="3369" /> thread running through their opposition to this Bill.  I would assume that everybody would see that the last association I mentioned, that of the Registered Patents Agents &mdash; because of their vested interest in this Bill, or in any legislation concerned with this area of activity &mdash; would take a more than casual interest in the Bill, and they have a perfect right to do so.  I understand they represent four companies with something like 250 employees. While I have said that the opposition may have sprung from a vested interest, it would be unfair to them to leave it at that.  While they have a vested interest, the submission they made on this subject goes far beyond their vested interest and obviously they are acting in what they see as the interests of industry and the country at large.  Therefore, when one considers the groups of people who have expressed their opposition to this Bill &mdash; people like the CII, the ICTU, the IIRS, the Irish Goods Council &mdash; one must pose the question: why are these people creating such a hassle about this?</P>
    <P>To outline the background in relation to the opposition expressed by the patents agents, or attorneys, to use the correct title, these people represent inventors in this country who are seeking patents through the normal channel of the Patents Office.  These agents prepare detailed submissions.  They are experts in this field and are the people who undertake that kind of thing.  I should say also that the patent agents in this country also prepare submissions to the Patents Office in the same way on behalf of foreign applicants because, as matters stand at present, foreign applicants must make a specific application to the Irish Patents Office to seek protection in this country because we have not yet &mdash; that is until this Bill is enacted &mdash; come under the umbrella of the convention to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>Therefore the patents agents in this country are no doubt delighted &mdash; it is part of their business &mdash; to handle the work of Irish in addition to foreign applicants. Under the provisions of the Bill now introduced foreign applicants need no longer apply to the Irish Patents Office.  All they need do is apply to the <Col N="3370" /> European Patents Office designating this country as one in which they seek protection for their patent.  If this Bill is passed they can go through Munich, which is the location of the European Patents Office, designating this country as one of the countries in which they seek protection and that is the end of the story so far as protection is concerned here, bypassing the current requirement of using the facilities of Irish patent agents, and ensuring the employment we all regard as a necessary element in our economic and industrial life.</P>
    <P>The current level of applications is approximately 3,000 per annum.  A significant factor in this is that something like 88 per cent of those 3,000 would be foreign applications.  This Bill will now provide that foreign companies seeking patents need not go through Irish patent agents.  The result will be a major lay off in jobs in the case of those employed by the four offices now operating in this country.  As the Minister has said, the Bill will allow for the ratification of the European Patent Convention and, as he stated also, for the Community Patent Convention, under ministerial order, for which there is provision in the Bill.  As things stand at present we and the Minister are obliged to adopt the European Patent Convention and it is not an EEC law. Section 128 of the Bill has provision for allowing adoption of that convention by ministerial order when we have no option then, if we are to be regarded as the good Europeans we have been in the past, we should adopt the Community Patent Convention and that would allow for a uniform registration system.  The time has not yet come when we are obliged to do that.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Bill will be to increase the number of patent applications.  At present there are approximately 6,000 patents operating in this country covering a whole range of commercial and industrial technology.  It is expected that the number of patent applications will probably treble or quadruple and some say will reach 50,000 or 60,000.  The result of that will be that in many cases you will be cutting off Irish industry, which will fear infringing patents that are now <Col N="3371" /> foreign-owned but which they can use because this country has not been designated as a protected area.  Denmark, Norway and Spain have not made the necessary changes in their legislation to adopt what we are now adopting, the European Patent Convention.  I understand there are some constitutional problems in Denmark which are delaying adoption and it seems they are in no great hurry to bring their constitution into line to facilitate adoption of this convention.</P>
    <P>Looking at the opposition which has been expressed by very responsible bodies, one must ask: why the introduction of this Bill at this time?  The ICTU have said that they oppose ratification of the convention by the Government and intimated they would be conveying that view to the Minister and his Department.  The Irish Goods Council have also expressed the view that it is now evident that we would not be serving our own best interests by applying either convention.  The reality is that when the Community convention comes along we have no option, but we have the option now to defer action on the European convention.  I understand that the Confederation of Irish Industry submitted a very detailed memorandum on the Patents Bill to the Government, which they seem to have ignored.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards said that in their experience in dealing with the invention service sector within the institute the Government would be well advised not to go ahead at this time with this legislation.</P>
    <P>To me there is only one logical explanation why this is happening now and it is that the Government seem to have succumbed to pressure being applied by certain sections of industry.  It is very easy to nail down this sector to a very narrow field and here we are talking about the chemical and pharmaceutical multinational sector.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of June 18 last their correspondent, Aidan O'Sullivan, wrote a very informative article in relation to the background of patents in this country and in relation to this Bill.  Towards the end of the article he seemed to have made <Col N="3372" /> contact with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries and, in reply to the question why were they pressing for a change in legislation, they said: &ldquo;The view of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in Ireland is that there would be much merit in Ireland ratifying the European Patent Convention particularly because the volume of international investment and its size dictates the necessity to acknowledge and protect industrial property rights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards protection of industrial property rights given as a reason for a change in legislation, I do not think we have anything to be ashamed of in that field.  Patents in this country have been protected down the years where protection is sought where this country is designated as an area of protection.  We have been party, as the Minister said, to international conventions and regulations since 1927 under the Paris Convention. So far as I know very few breaches of patent regulations have occurred and where they have &mdash; in the last few years we had one particular case &mdash; the company went to court and won its case.  The Irish court found that these people were absolutely within their rights to seek protection from the courts and the courts guaranteed them that protection.</P>
    <P>I referred to the multinational pharmaceutical and chemical industry, a very powerful lobby involved in large sums of money.  Of course, large sums of money will be saved by them in relation to the registration of patents if they have the facility to make an application only to one authority, in this case the European Patents Office, instead of having to seek individual patents in each country where they wish their patents to be protected. It seems to me that now we are going under to this kind of pressure.  It is nothing short of sinister that this is happening at this time.  I have no qualms about supporting the Government where they are obliged to take legislative action because of a Community Convention based on Community law, but where there is not any need to do that at this time I believe we are doing a disservice to the Irish industrial sector.  That sector has been enjoying certain freedoms, conferred <Col N="3373" /> on them by default more than anything else, but they will no longer be in that position because of the facility now being provided by an Irish Government. This facility will allow foreign applicants to make an application elsewhere the results of which will apply here.  The Irish Parliament, for example, will not have any control.  Our courts will not have any control over the activities of companies who can operate under the umbrella protection of an international agent or agency to give them a patent which will designate Ireland as one of the protected areas.</P>
    <P>What danger is there in this?  In theory one might say that there are dangers and in practice there are not that many.  But when one considers our stance on certain subjects, and the production of certain products, one cannot but express the view that we should not allow ourselves to be pressurised into taking action we need not take.  There is no law in the world that can pressurise us into taking the action which is proposed.  I should like to give the House an example of what I am referring to.  I have here an application by a multinational pharmaceutical firm to the European Patents Office.  That firm sought protection in this country through the Irish Patents Office as far back as 1979 but was refused because of the nature of the product.  We had the power to refuse the application under section 115 of the 1964 Act.  The reason for the refusal was that this product, which shall be nameless, as shall the name of the company, possesses high activity as an abortifacient.  The product is a derivative of a chemical product and may be used &ldquo;to terminate pregnancy or to induce labour or parturition&rdquo;.  It was also stated that it was a method of inducing abortion in a pregnant female mammalia host in need of such treatment, which comprises administering to said host an effective amount of the drug of the claim.</P>
    <P>That quotation was taken from the submission prepared.  The submission also stated: &ldquo;Additionally, expulsion of an embryo or a fetus is accomplished by similar administration of the compound during the first or second trimester of the normal mammalian gestation period&rdquo;.  In <Col N="3374" /> other words, we are talking about a product which is used as an abortifacient.  The company concerned can, on the passage of this Bill, through the European Patents Office in Munich designate this country as a place where it seeks protection in relation to this product.  It can be manufactured here and there is no control over its activities.  That is only one example of what we are talking about.  It may be an emotive and topical example but my party, and I am sure the Minister's party, have made it clear where they stand on issues such as this.  The end result is that all this is very far removed from what was contained in a rather dismissive statement by the Minister to the House, that this was just a tidying-up job.  He told the House that when the Bill was enacted and was in operation it would be possible for Ireland to join with other countries in ratifying the two international agreements referred to.  That is so, but at the moment is it a good thing for us?</P>
    <P>The implication in the Minister's speech is that by doing this tidying, by harmonising our legislation with that obtaining elsewhere, we are doing this country a great service.  But, in fact, the reverse is the truth.  I feel that the European Patent Convention need not and should not be adopted now.  When the time comes to adopt the Community Patent Convention as part of Community law, where we have no option as a member of the Community but to adopt it, then I will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  We are on the team and we must play the game.  Going out of his way now producing this mammoth Bill with 130 odd sections and two schedules when, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism could be introducing much more effective legislation which would have some benefits for industry in this country is beyond me.  I reiterate that the only reason I can see for doing so at this time is that the Government are under enormous pressure from some multinational lobbies in the pharmaceutical and medical sectors and they have succumbed to that pressure. There is no justification for this legislation at this time and I oppose it vehemently on these grounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This substantial Bill of about 74 or 75 pages, while one would think it is attempting to update the Act of 1964, goes quite a considerable way forward in many respects.  I have reservations about the extent to which this Bill is going with regard to allowing a lot of people from outside Ireland to be able to apply at an international level for and obtain patents which would allow them to have a huge variety of items manufactured here in Ireland.  This is an intricate and delicate matter, but I believe that the actual application to obtain a patent is relatively straightforward and simple. Applications are made to the Patents Office and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism have a close liaison with the Patents Office.  It is not a difficult application and Irish industrialists have had no problems whatsoever in making such applications.  For any firm who wish to manufacture any type of item here in Ireland on an industrial level, textiles for instance, if a patent has already been taken out in respect of it in some other country it would be quite simple to take out such a patent here. Therefore, I do not see any immediate problem of any firm who have ideas at international level being prohibited therefrom.  I am quite certain that any person who wishes to patent any item here in Ireland will get every help and facility required from the Patents Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I am interested to know the reasoning behind our efforts at this stage to, as the Minister said in his speech, up-date our law to meet modern conditions. In my view our Patents Office have updated themselves and have been as forward-looking as any of our offices and at this stage to allow the importance of our Patents Office to be in any way diminished strikes me as being very strange.  If we in our industries are in the process of inventing some projects &mdash; and our Irish industrialists have been as inventive at least as most people in other contries and in some instances they have been ahead of people in other countries &mdash; the protection that we can still obtain under the 1964 Patents Act is something that we should seriously consider retaining.  If this Patents Bill, 1981, had been law <Col N="3376" /> before now we could have had a number of foreign industrialists patenting certain items here before our Irish industrialists would have had a chance to do so.  Therefore, we are really giving a go-ahead to a lot of people from outside Ireland to come in and patent items about which research may be going on at present here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the Bill because of this aspect.  I would like the Minister to think about this further.  If an industrialist in Ireland tonight is in the process of patenting an invention, the Minister is allowing somebody from outside Ireland to come in and perhaps have a patent for such an item lodged, processed and taken up before the person in this country would have had an opportunity of doing so.  I am sure the Minister has not really thought about the long-term implications of this.  At present and for perhaps the next year or two this would cause serious problems and I ask the Minister to look into this a little more closely.</P>
    <P>The second item that I would like to deal with is in Part VII of the Bill which deals with the effect of a patent and a patent application.  Over the years I have met a number of Irish industrialists who have taken out patents for various items. Let us say that a person has taken out a patent for some kind of machine, the patent has been processed and the machine has been manufactured.  I know of a number of firms with inventions of their own, some of them top-class inventions, and after a period other inventions not of the same quality but very similar were put on the market by other firms and in some instances the same price was being charged for them as for the original item.  This has resulted in the original item, which was patented and manufactured very successfully, losing the prestige which was built up for it originally. That is touched on in Part VII of the Bill, but overall it is not sufficiently tightened up there.  There are many problems in this area which are not sufficiently covered in the Bill.  Some items which are later manufactured cause problems because they so closely resemble the original item.  I hope the Minister can tighten <Col N="3377" /> this up.  I believe the people who later manufacture those items are breaching the patent.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an item which is patented in Ireland, manufactured here and later distributed here.  In the case of some of those items an almost similar patent is taken out in England and on the continent.  Some of those items have been closely associated with Ireland.  Those items later come in branded as Irish but they have been manufactured outside Ireland.  Perhaps the Bill could be tightened up to catch the people engaging in this sharp practice.  There is no use in a person patenting an item in Ireland, manufacturing it here and then finding a foreign firm have patented the same item outside Ireland, set up a small section of their industry here, pretended that the items have been manufactured in Ireland when they have actually been manufactured outside the country.</P>
    <P>We should try to protect our patents. If any firm outside Ireland wish to manufacture here they can have their particular items patented here.  While there is a lot of procedure involved in patenting an item here I believe there is no problem for a successful industrialist.  They can be assured that if a person from outside Ireland wishes to patent some item here he will get co-operation.  We should proceed with caution in this regard or we could do harm to our Patents Office and the protection we have had.  I would like the Minister to consider the matters I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy O'Toole and Deputy Enright for their contributions.  One could sum up what they have said in a few sentences.  They accept that we have to come in line with our European partners and with international agreements in relation to this Bill but they do not accept that this is the time for us to introduce the Bill.  We have heard for a long time the argument that Irish industry is operating in a relatively patent-free environment.  This Bill is in the interests of Irish industry and we know there will be advantages and disadvantages. <Col N="3378" /> We are satisfied, however, that the overall benefits will outweigh the disadvantages.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole referred to objectors, the IIRS and the Irish Goods Council.  It is not true to say they have objected.  It is true that the CII opposed the Bill and that the patent agents have also objected. The agents are naturally worried but it is far from clear that their business will suffer.  It may change but it must be remembered that the patent agents also handle trade marks, which are not touched by this Bill.  Our main interest is Irish industry and we are satisfied there will be a net benefit to Irish industry.  I include our main industry, agriculture, in that.  We are satisfied that the Bill will be beneficial to Irish industry in general.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows we have undertaken to participate in international agreements and as far back as 1973, together with 14 other countries, we signed in Munich the Convention of European Patents.  We cannot keep dragging our heels.  We have to bring ourselves in line with our EEC partners.  When we joined the EEC we had the same kind of fears expressed in relation to our industry and industrialists.  At the time, we were told we would be wiped off the map but the demolition of tariffs has not killed industry.  We find that our industrialists have geared themselves to compete.  I believe now we should try to educate our people, get into this system <Col N="3379" /> and try to ensure that we will be able to hold our own with whatever competition we face from outside.  We cannot sit back, and the Deputy knows it.</P>

Contrary to what Deputy O'Toole has been saying, our courts will have full authority to deal with infringement of European patents which designate Ireland.  He mentioned abortifacients. <Col N="3380" /> I ask him to look at section 7, which says that a patent shall not be granted in respect of an invention if it is contrary to public law or morality.  I would also ask him to look at section 6 regarding the patenting of abortifacients. While it may be that a patent could be obtained in Munich designating Ireland, the sale and distribution in Ireland would still be subject to criminal law.  The point the Deputy made is covered by this legislation and we can still object to any of these things if they are brought in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to facilitate accession by Ireland to the International Convention on the Control and Hallmarking of Precious Metals 1972 by making the legislative changes which are necessary as a prerequisite to accession. Seven countries took part in the discussions on the drafting of the convention and five ratified it.  These are Britain, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. The other two, Portugal and Norway, have not yet submitted instruments of accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provisions of the convention are that the legal provisions of a contracting state which require articles of precious metal to be assayed and hallmarked by an authorised body to national standards of fineness, shall be deemed to be satisfied in respect of articles of precious <Col N="3383" /> metal imported from other contracting states if these articles have been controlled and marked in accordance with the provisions of the convention. Contracting states may, however, refuse admission to articles bearing such marks if they do not conform to national standards of fineness.  Imported items may be subject to check testing for verification of convention marks and for conformity with standards of fineness but such check testing may not unduly hamper items from going on to the market.</P>
    <P>Precious metals are defined as items of gold, silver, platinum or their alloys and where these are intended for export to contracting states, they must first be submitted to an authorised assay office for assaying and hallmarking in accordance with the provisions of the convention. The Common Control Mark of the Convention which must be struck on them is required to be made a lawful national mark in each contracting state.</P>
    <P>Britain, which is the main export market for Irish items of precious metal, acceded to the conventions in 1975.  Since then, Irish manufacturers are at a disadvantage because goods which have been assayed and hallmarked in Dublin but do not bear the convention mark may not, according to British law, go on to the British market unless they are assayed and hallmarked again in a British assay office.  Delays in clearing Irish goods imported into Britain and through British assay offices are common and this results in loss and disadvantages from a competitive point of view.  Irish manufacturers, therefore, requested the Government to accede to the convention and it has agreed to do so.</P>
    <P>Under existing statutes all articles of gold and silver manufactured in Ireland must be made to prescribed standards of fineness and must be submitted to the Assay Office for assaying and marking before being offered for sale.  Imported items must also be made to the Irish standards of fineness and must be submitted to the Assay Office for marking with approved Irish marks before being placed on the market.  Items which are so fragile that they might be damaged by <Col N="3384" /> marking are exempted from that requirement but must be assayed by the Assay Office.</P>
    <P>The changes necessary in Irish law as a prerequisite to accession are that the common control mark will be a lawful Irish mark which will be recognised in other participating countries; that the marks of participating countries will be recognised here, and that imported articles bearing such marks will no longer be subject to hallmarking on entry, but may be subject to check testing for conformity with Irish standards of fineness and for verification of the marks.  A standard and hallmark for platinum must be set and Irish legislation will apply to platinum. Standards will also be set for solder.</P>
    <P>As far as the Irish trade is concerned, the main attraction of the convention is that mutual recognition by contracting states of the common control mark will enable Irish items of precious metal which are controlled in accordance with the provisions of the convention to have quick and easy access to these markets and in particular to their principal export market which is Britain.</P>
    <P>The convention does not interfere with national methods of control.  In Ireland, control is at manufacturing level and all items manufactured or imported must be submitted to the Assay Office for assaying and hallmarking as required before being exposed for sale.  By retaining this method, the safeguarding of consumers' interests is being continued.  From the consumer's point of view the convention is also attractive in that it permits contracting states to control national standards of fineness.  This is particularly important where silver is concerned because the prescribed Irish standard for silver is higher than that in most other countries.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be no change in the law as far as articles exported to or imported from non-contracting states is concerned.  These will continue to be subject to existing control by the Dublin Assay Office before exportation or on importation.</P>
    <P>In making the changes necessary prior to our accession to the convention, I am taking advantage of the occasion to bring <Col N="3385" /> up to date penalties prescribed for forgery of the dies or stamps used in hallmarking. I am also bringing the law into line with the practice relating to antique articles of precious metal.  By law, all items of foreign manufacture must be assayed and hallmarked on importation. As a modern marking on a valuable item made 100 years or more ago would diminish its value, the practice has been to accept the markings on these and not to mark them further.  I am defining antiques and exempting these from assaying and hallmarking on production of satisfactory proof of date of manufacture.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister has said, it is in response to a request by the manufacturers of fine articles who are directly involved in expanding their business that this harmonisation of legislation is being brought about.  From what the Minister has said, it will facilitate the expeditious sale of Irish manufactured goods, for example, in the UK which up to now has been denied to us as a direct market.  We have not had access to this market without having the delay of having an item go through the British Assay Office.  I assume I am interpreting the Minister of State correctly when I say that the common control mark of the convention will now be the accepted format and will be acceptable in markets where those countries are party to this convention which we are now adopting and which was adopted in the UK in 1975.  I am also glad to note that one of the effects of the adoption of the convention will be to safeguard consumers' interests in that they are guaranteed an article of quality bearing an internationally accepted hallmark and they can be assured of quality because of that.  I also welcome the fact that the hallmark for platinum has been introduced and will apply from the time this Bill is enacted.  All in all, this Bill is a worthwhile piece of legislation and is in contrast with what the Minister's colleague was talking about an hour ago in this House.  Indeed, having said that, could I say that discussing a Bill like this in this House today is something like <Col N="3386" /> having a wake without a corpse?  Legislation from the Minister's Department more urgent than this should be going through this House to alleviate pressures on the industrial sector.  However, this Bill is a step in the right direction in response to the expressed wish of the sector directly involved.  I hope it will have the beneficial effects it is expected to have for producers and consumers.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for being brief and to the point.  The Deputy mentioned the common hallmark and I suppose what he had in mind was what was contained in the convention.  That the common hallmark be acceptable in all participating countries is the main purpose of the convention.  All the articles will have four different marks on them, the date mark, the convention mark, the Assay Office fineness mark and the sponsor's mark.  This is what we are discussing in relation to the Common Hallmarking Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday on the introduction of this Bill by the Minister of State, Deputy Killilea, we had an opportunity to look at the contents and the purpose of this Bill, which is merely an interim measure to keep the show going until such time as An Bord Telecom is established.  That is one of the two State bodies it is proposed to set up to administer the postal and telecommunications service.  In the course of his speech last week the Minister of State said that much remained to be done to improve the standard of our telephone service.  That was stating the obvious.  We must recognise that we have the worst telephone service in western Europe.  The lack of a modern telecommunications service is proving to be a serious impediment to the economic development and social progress of our country.  The unsatisfactory nature of the telecommunications service was exacerbated in 1978 and 1979 during the prolonged industrial dispute in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Another aspect is that 40 per cent of our subscribers cannot be contacted directly from Dublin.  It is amusing and perhaps significant that I can dial major centres in western Europe and in the US but that I <Col N="3388" /> cannot dial directly my own home at Bruree 33 in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave quite a lot of statistical information in relation to the progress of the telephone service, the enormous increase in the number of applications and the failure of the Department to keep up with the enormous backlog which was worsened considerably during the long strike.  It is important that we as a nation recognise the important role that telecommunications can play in our development and progress.  It is unfortunate that we have the worst telecommunications service in western Europe because we are a small island on the periphery of Europe and the lifeblood of our economy depends on exports and foreign trade.  It is vitally important that all our industries should have available to them the most efficient and sophisticated telecommunications system that can be provided.  There are jobs at stake.  There are businesses at stake.  The entire western seaboard is dependent on tourism.  It is constituted of regions to which successive Governments have been trying to attract industry in order to create jobs.  Business has been stymied and impeded and severely disrupted because of the inadequacy of the telephone service.  When I was Minister for the Gaeltacht I met industrialist after industrialist suffering extreme frustration because of the inadequacy of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the extension of the data processing service.  This is very important.  I had a very bad experience in relation to a computer operation established in Furbo in the Connemara Gaeltacht which subsequently folded up because of unsatisfactory telephone connections. The transmission of computer data is done through the normal telephone system.  Because the system was so bad the industry was lost.  The Minister will agree it is becoming more and more difficult to attract industry to these areas, areas still dependent on manually operated telephones.  We must look at this situation very carefully.  There are a number of extremely urgent steps to be taken if we are to tackle the enormous backlog in the number of applications, in the technology, <Col N="3389" /> in the obsolescent equipment and so on.  It is an enormous job to modernise and streamline in order to achieve the most modern technological equipment, particularly digitalised equipment, which appears to be the most advanced, the most satisfactory and the most sophisticated.</P>
    <P>A number of steps of grave urgency must be taken.  The decision has been made to hive off the telecommunications section to An Bord Telecom and the postal services to An Bord Phoist.  It is essential that An Bord Telecom be legislated for, equipped and structured as quickly as possible.  At the same time great care must be taken to ensure that the transfer from the present civil service structure to the semi-State structure is done as efficiently as possible in full consultation with the staff, the unions and so on.  When the evolution is complete I am sure it will be a case of full speed ahead.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed the Minister did not see fit to supply us with a White Paper.  There may be very good reasons for not doing so but a comprehensive debate on communications is greatly inhibited because of the lack of a White Paper.  I understand a White Paper is in course of preparation on telecommunications. This will be very relevant to the establishment of An Bord Telecom.  Our expectations were raised with regard to the availability of a White Paper.  However, I have been long enough here now to know that overdependence on White Papers or Green Papers will not solve problems.  This is a very complex area and there is an enormous backlog to be made up.  Anything I say in regard to An Bord Telecom is equally relevant to An Bord Phoist.  The powers and functions assigned to the board and the general constitution of the board will determine whether or not in the eighties we can develop a modern telecommunications network.  Our objective must be to aim at as efficient a system as possible, a system as efficient as that obtaining in our partner countries in the EEC.</P>
    <P>There are enormous technological problems involved plus an enormous financial commitment.  There were estimates a year ago of £650 million for a <Col N="3390" /> four or five year programme.  That figure has gone up now to £800 million.  It is reasonable to assume that the Bill will reach £1,000 million.  The application of new technology is <i>sine qua non.</i>  A decision has been taken to concentrate on digital equipment.  Having had experience of this in the European Parliament and in Brussels I know it is an almost magic system compared to what we are used to here.  The replacement of the existing system will be a very large undertaking. There is then the financial aspect. The money will have to be found.  The expenditure can be justified.  I have been very worried at our image in Europe because of our telephone service.  It has done us no good.  The service has impeded the work of An Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála, the IDA and the other agencies whose job it is to encourage industry and promote exports.  We must get our priorities right.  The money must be found.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to different sources in order to raise finance.  I was interested to note he got substantial financing from the EIB.  My colleagues and I who are members of the Regional Policy Committee have been emphasising over and over again the vital importance of telecommunications here and the fact that we regard telecommunications as a very intricate part of the basic infrastructure of the nation.  Government policy in relation to the Regional Fund &mdash; and here I am sure that whatever Government is in power they will have the full support of all the Irish members of the European Parliament &mdash; must seek and ensure more financial assistance from European institutions.  The European Investment Bank is a different ball game &mdash; it is more a commercial operation &mdash; but emphasis must continue to be placed on the improvement of our telecommunications services.  It must be continuosly presented in Brussels that this expenditure on the development of telecommunications could appropriately be met through the European Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a statement some time after Christmas in relation to the financing of the development of our telecommunications said he was proposing to set <Col N="3391" /> up a State-financed company &mdash; I have been endeavouring to find the reference without success, so I do not have the precise words he used but when replying he might refer to this.  It is dishonest or, if you like, we are living in cloud cuckoo land when we talk about the introduction of the most sophisticated technology into our telecommunications services while at the same time being unable to find the requisite moneys.  I have referred to two possible sources, the European Investment Bank and the Regional Fund.  The Minister referred to the setting up of a State-financed company which would contribute to the financing of the development of our telecommunications.  I do not think there was any reference to this aspect in the speech of the Minister of State on Thursday last or if there was, it was not very detailed.  Perhaps the Minister when replying would elaborate on what exactly he has in mind here.  I think what he has in mind is the encouragement of private enterprise, the private sector, to contribute to the development of the national telecommunications system. The establishment of a State holding company may be the correct way in which to inject private capital into the development of our telecommunications services. The service must be improved, modernised and streamlined as quickly as possible and the requisite money must be found.</P>
    <P>In relation to its technological aspects &mdash; as was referred to by the Minister of State in his introductory remarks &mdash; there have been fantastic developments in electronic science, particularly in digital science and the application of modern electronic science, through digital technology, to the international telecommunications systems.  One aspect of this is most important and must be borne in mind, one on which I have laid great stress in this House on previous occasions: with the improvement and modernisation of our telecommunications system, entailing enormous capital expenditure, which creates a demand for an enormous amount of equipment and products of all kinds, new employment opportunities are created in the design, <Col N="3392" /> development and manufacture of those products and equipment.  It should be a national priority that the maximum amount of such equipment and products be manufactured here by Irish people.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister made reference to two developments. In recent years in this country there has been an impressive growth in the development of electronic science. We have succeeded in attracting a significant number of electronic industries here.  One of the proposals to which I have referred is for a joint venture between Telectron and a French company. I had experience of Telectron during my term of office as Minister for the Gaeltacht as they have a very large branch in the Gweedore industrial estate agus tá aithne ag an Ceann Comhairle ar an tionscal sin agus sílim go raibh baint aige go pearsanta le bunú an tionscail sin. The progress of Telectron since it was established here is clear proof that we have the potential and the talent here, that given proper opportunity Irish enterprise, skill and talent can be applied to the development of the technology needed to modernise telecommunications and will have a very significant impact on employment, our balance of payments and so on.</P>
    <P>The other proposal involves the Swedish Ericsson Company which I understand has a subsidiary plant in Athlone. Perhaps I might make a suggestion to the Minister in this regard.  People tend to become emotional about multinational companies; there can be adverse reaction to them and so on.  But the main emphasis must be placed on ensuring that the greater part of their manufacturing and production activities be carried out in Ireland by Irish people.  Has the Minister considered the possibility of utilising the engineering personnel expertise and know-how existing in the Engineering Section of his Department, which will subsequently become An Bord Telecom. I am not sure whether any facilities exist for utilising that expertise, experience, talent, skill and know-how acquired by such personnel over the years.  It might be a good idea to consider establishing a research unit for this purpose.  The point <Col N="3393" /> I am getting at is this, rather than hand the whole lot over to foreign or foreign-participating industry, we should endeavour to utilise the research facilities, for example, of the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick where there exists a high level of technological faculties.  Perhaps it would be possible to utilise the undoubted engineering skills and expertise existing already in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Aontaím leis an mBille seo.  Is Bille gairid é ach déanfaidh sé an gnó go dtí go mbeidh an Bord Telecom bunaithe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be assured that the passage of this Bill will not be delayed particularly in view of the recent information that seems to have filtered through from the Government Party to the effect that the Dáil will be dissolved at 4 O'clock tomorrow afternoon. However, we have heard so many rumours of this in the course of the last three weeks that the possibility remains of it being held in June 1982.</P>
      <P>I do not disapprove of the measure introduced by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seeking permission to borrow and spend as required £350 million over the next five years.  It seems only a short time ago, when the Ceann Comhairle was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that we gave permission to borrow a similar amount.  Even though the five years is not yet up, I presume the bulk of the money has not been spent but that during the coming year the £350 million will be accounted for.  In the background we have the proposal by the Government for the establishment of the telecommunications board.  The Minister in his speech today did not seem very certain as to when this new State-sponsored board would be established.  In one part he said &ldquo;next year&rdquo; and in another part he was not certain whether it would be another year or two, three, four or five years.  In any case, in anticipation of it being established this year or next year I assume it will not be necessary for the Minister to draw on the £350 million from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure in the Post Office as in <Col N="3394" /> many other State Departments is divided into two, the day-to-day operation &mdash; maintenance, upkeep, renewals and improvements in the service &mdash; and then what we are dealing with here today, capital expenditure which may appear to be a colossal sum but which is needed for the work necessary to give us a telephone service, that is, development works, establishing of new trunk routes, laying of cables whether underground or over-ground, extension of plant and installation of new telephones.  I was very interested in that part of the Minister's speech where he said it costs £1,100 to instal a telephone plus other things such as expenditure on cable work and so on. The public might have a greater appreciation of the Minister's difficulties if they realised the actual cost.  Inevitably when people approach us about telephones they say it needs only one pole or no pole at all.  It is not so simple; it is not a question of connecting one pole with another.  That information is revealing as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile capital expenditure because as regards current expenditure the better service we have the more revenue will accrue to the Department.  Up to recently I believe that expenditure on day-to-day operation, maintenance, upkeep, renewals and improvements was met by income but that has not been so in the last year or two.  We would all like to see a situation where day-to-day expenditure would be met by revenue derived from the installation of many more telephones.  As an enabling Bill we realise this does not give the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs authority to spend £350 million just like that; he has to go to the Minister for Finance for approval.</P>
    <P>The raising of this £350 million will constitute another increase in our borrowing. I think the Minister said it would be repaid over 25 years but I should like him to give us a little more information as to the rate of interest whether fixed or market rate.  In the case of this particular borrowing I think it is justified in view of what I said about the revenue that accrues on the installation of more telephones. It is justified in providing a public service for the whole country.  For many <Col N="3395" /> years the Department has been rightly criticised for lack of progress, for faulty telephones and lack of them.  It must be obvious to many people, especially those who have been a long time in the Dáil, that not much interest was taken in our telephone service.  We did not give it high priority.  I may be wrong but I think that the first real shot in the arm that this branch of the service got was in the 1973 Act which provided for the expenditure of £175 million between 1973 and 1977. It had been the Cinderella section of Government Departments.  I suppose it was not realised then how important the telephone service was not only to industry and commerce, tourism and hotel business but to the country generally whether for social or other use.</P>
    <P>The £175 million appeared to be a big sum in 1973.  We are asked now, as we were in 1977 to approve of the expenditure of £350 million &mdash; I suppose that would be the correct amount having regard to inflation.  Possibly it is a little more than what was approved in 1973.  I note that it is intended to raise £100 million from private sources.  Perhaps the Minister could give us a little more detail on that because there was little elaboration of it in the speech of the Minister, Deputy Killilea.</P>
    <P>We could make the usual justifiable criticisms and it is true that, as Deputy O'Donnell said, our telephone system is the worst in Europe.  Telephone density in Ireland in 1977 was 15 per 100 of the population.  We are promised now as we were in 1977 that that would be raised to 28 per 100 by 1984.  I presume that is still the objective and perhaps the Minister would indicate whether in view of all the changes that are to take place that result will be achieved.  We shall still have the lowest telephone density in Europe.  It will take time and quite a lot of money I presume to catch up.  We are second to France which in 1977 had a telephone density of 27 per 100.</P>
    <P>We are in a telephone age as demonstrated by figures given by the Minister. Between 1969 and 1971 there were 25,000 applications per year; from 1974 to 1976, 37,000 per annum, and from 1978 to <Col N="3396" /> 1980, 57,000 per annum.  Whether that increase was matched by installation of phones in the last two or three years I do not know but the point is that there is an ever-increasing number of applications.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the present Ceann Comhairle, predicted that in 1984 there would be 800,000 telephones in the country but we are still at the bottom of the league in Europe, still at 23 telephones per 100 of the population.  It must be recognised that we are in a telephone age and that without sufficient telephones we experience great difficulties.  They are important to industry, commerce, tourism and hospitals.  They are also important for social use.  We must appreciate the frustration and anger felt by almost all subscribers, whether they are natives, industrialists or visitors, who experience difficulty with our telephone system.  We still have delays and there has been very little improvement in the system.  On many occasions one cannot get through. It is very unsatisfactory trying to ring out from Leinster House or to get a call here. The Minister should concentrate on improving the service.  Recently I was informed by one of the Minister's employees &mdash; needless to say I will not disclose his name &mdash; that in Athlone, where there are 25 lines, only two of them are working.  That is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in Athlone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my information and it is quite possible that the employee has as much knowledge about the telephone system as the Minister has.  There are many lines to Belfast but only a limited number in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Ceann Comhairle was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the House voted £350 million for a five-year programme and we were told that the annual connection rate would be increased from 45,000 to 85,000.  If that has not been achieved absolutely I believe it is near achievement.  The then Minister also said that it was intended to raise to 96 per cent the number of automatic phones, which stood at 87 per cent in 1977.  I do not <Col N="3397" /> know what the figure is now, but I am sure it is over 90 per cent.  While that is not entirely satisfactory, it shows that some progress has been made.  In 1977 we were told that part of the £350 million was to acquire sites, place contracts and procure equipment and I should like the Minister to give us some details of how that work has proceeded.</P>
    <P>We seem to be in the dark as far as the new telecommunications board is concerned. As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, we were promised a White Paper, but that has not been issued.  We are all concerned as to the type of board it will be.  The employees in the telecommunications area of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are also very concerned. We were told, when it was suggested that the two boards be established, that there would be consultation with the trade unions involved.  I do not know whether the consultations have taken place, but if the board is to be established at all it is vital that the interests of the employees are kept foremost in the minds of those who sit on the telecommunications board.  One matter that concerns employees is their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other Departments.  At present an employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can get a transfer to another Department, and I should like to know if this will obtain.  If nothing is done to maintain that situation those employees would be ranked the same as those in CIE, Aer Lingus and the other semi-State bodies. Employees of the Department have had the right to transfer to other Departments for many years and that aspect should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we debated a similar measure I raised the matter of telephone kiosks.  The Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs repeated what was said in 1977, and before it, that for a kiosk to be established in certain areas there must be evidence that it would pay for itself or that the local authority would guarantee against loss.  That is grossly unfair.  It must be obvious to the Minister, and to whoever is in charge of the telecommunications board, that in a housing estate of up to 700 houses a public telephone kiosk <Col N="3398" /> is an absolute essential.  Very few people living in those estates have private phones and if they want to use a phone in an emergency they must travel a long distance.  I can understand the Minister saying it would be impossible, or daft, to have kiosks dotted all over the country in areas where they would not in any way pay their pay, but it must be abundantly clear that a kiosk is a vital necessity in housing estates.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the laying of telephone cables.  Where a housing estate is in the course of construction telephone cables should be laid on in conjunction with other infrastructure such as water, roads and electricity. Is there any sort of liaison or consultation between the gas companies, the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in an effort to have a joint operation in providing those services?  Damage to public kiosks continues apace and I do not know what the Minister and the Garda can do about this.  It is absolute vandalism and it is still a big problem. The Ceann Comhairle, when Minister, told us in 1977 that the cost of such damage to the Department was very big.  It is possible that the only thing we can do is to erect kiosks that could not be broken except with the use of a sledge hammer.</P>
    <P>I should now like to raise a matter which may not please the Minister, and it relates to the increase in the number employed in the Department.  With such a huge expenditure there must have been an increase in the number of men working on such jobs as laying cables.  How many men were recruited since 1977? How many will be recruited?  Above all, what is the method of recruitment?  I complained that recruitment to the Department in the capacity I mentioned was dependent on one's membership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Minister may grin when I say that, but I should like to know if such people are recommended by Manpower or are recruited through the local employment exchange.  I am aware that in various parts of the country if one is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party one is almost assured of a job.</P>
    <P>I see very few of my own supporters getting jobs, but I would discount that if <Col N="3399" /> the Minister could assure me that these workers are employed through Manpower or the employment exchange.  This would dispel the rumours or wrong information. At least we should know the method of employment.  There used to be a system where I worked many years ago where the Minister for Social Welfare could make a nomination of a special person who had to be registered at the employment exchange, but such people were the Minister's nominees.  I would like to be assured that there is a fair method of recruitment through some agency like the Department of Social Welfare or Manpower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief.  I will start on a note similar to that on which Deputy Corish finished regarding the purchase of telephone exchanges by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I raised two questions in this House in the past couple of weeks, one concerning the purchase of an area of ground for a telephone exchange at Athenry, County Galway, the second concerning the purchase of ground for a telephone exchange at Carna, County Galway.  Dealing with the Athenry case, I asked the Minister if he could give me details of the area of ground purchased and the price, and if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had any dealings or any communication regarding the purchase of any other site in the area with any other individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the Deputy representing the area and it has come to my knowledge that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had the contract for the purchase of the site in Athenry, County Galway, for quite a nominal sum from a certain individual whose name I will not bother to mention in this House.  If some small technical difficulty could have been ironed out with proper communications between the Department and a certain individual, the site could have been purchased for something in the region of £5,000.  With the advent of a new Minister of State to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Killilea, it would appear that another site was purchased.  They forgot <Col N="3400" /> about the first site that they were supposed to buy at £5,000, and for a similar area of ground they paid something in the region of £60,000.  I know that that is only a rumour.  But as a Deputy who represented that area for many years, and even if I never represented it for a day, I am entitled to know what the Department of Posts and Telegraphs paid for that site.  I failed to get an answer to a parliamentary question in the Dáil and now I am asking the Minister for an answer.  I ask the Minister if any contract was made or signed with another individual for the purchase of a similar area of ground at the cost of £5,000.  I will say no more about it except that I want to know the answer.  The life of this Dáil may not be too long, but be it long or short I will keep at it until I embarrass the Minister or his Minister of State into giving me that answer regarding Athenry.  As far as I and the people of that area are concerned, and many others who do not even know it, it seems that there has been a misappropriation of approximately £50,000 regarding the purchase of a site for a telephone exchange at Athenry, County Galway.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the place to say it and I tried to raise it by parliamentary question here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking the easy way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, I am not like the Minister, trying to take the easy way out all the time.  Regarding the purchase of a telephone exchange at Carna, County Galway, from a document I have seen it would appear that there was an official contract between the Department and a certain individual for the purchase <Col N="3401" /> of a site, quite a small one, for £2,500.  To be fair, I am not altogether sure of these facts, but I am saying it and it is up to the Minister to give the answers because the buck eventually rests with him.  It has come to my notice recently that that was turned down.  I do not know the reason, because there was a good contract there. Another site was purchased &mdash; and I will not mention the name of the individual although, due to the protection given to me in this House, I could do so and no one could do anything about it &mdash; for double that amount.</P>
      <P>Without saying any more about the sites purchased for the erection of exchanges or whatever type of centres the Department want or need, they are getting the necessary information now and they are getting the whole lot of it. I charge that this Department have misappropriated funds in that direction.  I will mention the two of them again, one at Athenry, a big scandal, one at Carna, only a little scandal because only £2,500 was involved.  I want this investigated and when the Minister is replying here I want the answer from him.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that the Department are looking for an extra £350 million if they spend money <i>ab lib</i> when there is no need to spend it at the rate they are spending it for the purchase of these sites. Possibly I have used the phrase that is often used in this House, &ldquo;the tip of the iceberg&rdquo;.  The things that I have talked about may be a small tip in relation to £350 million.  I want direct answers from the Minister and I will follow him until such time as I get them.  It may be a long time before this is exposed but it will eventually be exposed and it will be on the heads of the Minister and his Minister of State, particularly the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also on this occasion to talk about the kiosks, these little boxes we see around the country here and there.  From time to time, like any other Deputy in this House and particularly one representing a rural area more than an urban area &mdash; at least I did in the past &mdash; I have made representations to the Department and the respective Ministers who have been there with a view to getting <Col N="3402" /> a kiosk erected here and there.  One instance comes to my mind because I got a very special letter last week regarding representations I made about the telephone kiosk at a place called Anbally, Tuam.  Anbally is only a very small village of ten or 12 houses, but at the time I was told by letter and by parliamentary question that the kiosk could not be erected there and certain reasons were given.  Lo and behold, I got a letter last week saying that the criteria were changed and as a result of changes in the criteria it is now found possible &mdash; at some stage in the future &mdash; to erect a telephone kisok at Anbally, Tuam, County Galway.  When the Minister gets up to say his few words perhaps he will tell me what changes took place in the criteria.  It was not announced publicly The case I am talking about is not peculiar to Anbally; it has happened elsewhere.  If there has been a change in the criteria we should all like to know what it is.  There are many areas which would not qualify under the criteria used in the past which probably would qualify under the new criteria, as enunciated in a letter to me by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I agree with several remarks made by Deputy Corish when he spoke about the people employed by the Department.  Do they all need a certain type of membership card?  It is quite obvious from the personnel in the Department that they are hand-picked.  Is there a special criterion for that also?</P>
    <P>I remember that, soon after the Minister was appointed Minister for Post and Telegraphs, he spoke about leadership, which was very necessary in the Department. On that occasion, in the RDS, he spoke about the work he would do in comparison with somebody else who was in charge previously and how that particular person could observe from a safe distance.  He boasted about the number of phones he would install and about the targets he had set.</P>
    <P>There is no point in building one million houses if one does not have enough people to go into them and there is no point in installing thousands of telephones if the telephones do not work. That is the worst problem we have at the <Col N="3403" /> moment in relation to the telephone system. The position is bad in Dublin, but it is much worse in the west.  If one had a good loud voice, like I have, one would be as well employed standing on the highest roof and shouting as trying to use the telephone system in operation at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister carried out his boast because he installed telephones, but he forgot that the people who had the service before he took up office were unable to get calls from their telephones.  The service is very poor and the position is the same in relation to the new telephones which have been installed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the repair of telephones, certain categories of people such as doctors are on a special list so that when their telephones break down they are in category one for repairs.  I believe that several politicians are on the same list.  I would like to see certain politicians on the list of no repairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Mark put the Deputy on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am happy to think that as his telephone is on the same trunk circuit as mine his service is as bad as mine.  That is the one consoling factor about it.  That cheap remark by the Minister does not explain to the people I represent why their telephone service is so bad.  The telephone system in this country is the worst in the world.  I believe if one went to the most undeveloped country in the world, and if that country had a telephone system, it would have to be better than ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to stop installing telephones.  I appeal to him to try to get those which are already installed working.  Apart from the fact that we have the worst telephone service in Europe and that the Minister of State in the Department seems to have some special reason for changing the criteria for the erection of telephone kiosks and instals telephones at an enormous rate, the cost of the telephone call has risen enormously.  When one pays a high price for something one expects to get a good <Col N="3404" /> service.  I do not mind what the Minister does in the rest of the country, but will he please stop installing telephones in County Galway and will he get those which are already connected working?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain the difference in the purchase price of the site for the telephone exchange at Athenry, County Galway, from £5,000 to £60,000?  Perhaps those from whom it is being bought have been haggling about the price, but I should like to know the facts.  I want the facts also about the purchase of the site for the telephone exchange at Carna, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Donnellan came into the House we had a very constructive debate but he seemed to adopt the role of making it a very destructive debate.  I have no intention whatsoever of stopping the installation of telephones. If Deputy Donnellan had any interest in the debate he would have looked at the very comprehensive details in the speech of the Minister of State about every aspect of the telephone service and studied it.  He did not bother his head to do that and he comes into the House making totally uninformed comments in relation to the quality of the telephone service and the installation of telephones. Nobody would accept as being anywhere near the factual position his statement that we have the worst telephone system in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the Deputy the worst places in the world.  I will give him the worst places in Europe, if he wants to know them.  If the Deputy wants to go to parts of Spain, parts of Scotland or parts of Wales, he will see a worse telephone system than we have here.  But it is an Irish trait to continually knock our own, so we are told we are the worst.  That is typical of what I hear from people like Deputy Donnellan and others, who constantly reject any efforts made here to raise our standards to EEC levels or beyond them.  If the Deputy wants to go to the west coast of America he will find that in California there are ten party lines, which does not exist in Tuam or anywhere else in County Galway.  It was <Col N="3405" /> interesting to hear Deputy Donnellan, by and large, confine his remarks to the area in which he is doing battle with a colleague of mine, the Minister of State, in relation to the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>The Deputy would know, if he bothered to read the document presented by the Minister of State, that within the next month a new exchange will be opened in Tuam and that a new radio link will be installed as well.  He would also know that a new digital exchange is being installed in Galway and that improvements are on the way.  I believe he was trying to get his voice into practice for what he expects will be a different kind of contest in the very near future.  He is trying to raise all sorts of scares about how Posts and Telegraphs buy sites.  We go to locals and auctioneers like everybody else.  What is important is that for every site or building we purchase the Valuation Office give a valuation and that is the criterion used.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Donnellan had done me the courtesy of advising me before this debate that he wanted particulars about a particular site, I would have endeavoured to get that information for him. He knew I would not have the information at my fingertips; but, as he said, the buck stops with me, and I accept that.  I will get the information and communicate with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough, but it is only fair to say that I raised these matters by way of parliamentary question and the Minister failed to answer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy did not expect me to give information about an individual site?  In this programme we are buying over 500 sites and erecting more than 530 buildings, yet the Deputy comes in here this evening asking about two individual cases, Carna and Athenry. I will give the Deputy a full report &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the very extensive document dealing with telecommunications he will see our approach to the development of telecommunications. We are working to a programme which, on the one hand, is developing the quality of service and, on the other, is accelerating installation.</P>
      <P>There was one district where we fell short of our target, and deliberately so, and that was Portlaoise, because there was not the capacity to meet the target. I repeat 62,584 telephones were installed and working, 7,000 additional phones were installed for people who moved premises and 15,000 extensions were added to our telecommunications service. When a Deputy comes here to talk about facts he should get them right because I know them off by heart.  The review group which looked into the Department of Posts and Telegraphs produced a target for &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the only one who believes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard for the Deputy to have to listen to the truth.  The review group produced a fault factor of one telephone per day for every instrument, that is 1,500 faults per day.  We are below 1,000 and that is below the target set as the acceptable level.  These are the facts. Deputies should not come in here with loose chat because it will not work.  We are working on a planned development programme to accelerate the installation of telephones and to raise the quality of service to EEC standards by 1984.  We are on target and we intend to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies asked how people were employed by the Department and how many employees we had.  There are approximately 17,000 employees.  They are recruited as follows: trainee installers are interviewed by the engineering section <Col N="3407" /> of my Department, passed through the interview board, sent for medical examination and, if they pass the medical test and the interview board, they are recruited.  There is and has been no change from that situation, and nobody should try to allege otherwise.  Trainee technicians are recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners, and nobody here would say that anybody could interfere in that area.  Temporary labourers are recruited by Manpower and recommended for employment.  That is the truth of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They are recruited by Manpower exclusively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Manpower recruit labourers, the Civil Service Commissioners recruit trainee technicians and an interview board of the engineering section of the Department recruit trainee installers.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputies recognise this is a very serious problem, that an immense programme has to be carried out and that this Bill is specifically designed to provide the money needed.  The question of the £350 million was raised by Deputy Corish. Up to £270 million of that money had been spent by the end of December.  The money provided in this Bill is to enable the Department to continue with this work until the two semi-State boards and An Bord Telecom take over, which I expect will be next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper is in print at the moment and will issue early next week. It is a major operation because a significant number of submissions were made on the basis of the Green Paper which issued last year.  A considerable amount of consultation took place and at the end of the day 33 Government decisions were involved.  Everybody will agree that no time was lost in getting it out.  Consultation with unions started some time ago and will continue, because I recognise that when you attempt to take more than 50 per cent of the people out of the civil service and put them into semi-State bodies there has to be a considerable amount <Col N="3408" /> of consultation and a great deal of work is involved.</P>
    <P>The heads of the Bill are well advanced and I expect to introduce legislation dealing with the splitting up of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into two semi-State boards in the autumn.  Deputies will appreciate that over 100 legislative amendments have to be made.  Most people will recall that it took a very long time to pass similar legislation in the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>The question of maximising the manufacture of the equipment, cables and so on in this country was raised.  Deputies will recall that early last year we ran exhibitions to show Irish manufacturers, or would-be manufacturers, the opportunities that existed in this development programme for them to avail of products which could be added to their existing production lines or possibly to start a new industry.  That has had considerable success. At present we are self-sufficient in this area to the extent of 60 per cent and our aim this year is to further improve that to 75 per cent.  There will always be a certain amount of highly technical products needed but the phasing out of old technology and the introduction of new technology would not warrant the setting up of a production line either in Ireland or anywhere else.  Many of these components are common to telecommunications all over the world.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made in this area and there will be a considerable spin-off from this development programme right through the economy.  Everybody knows telecommunications are very closely related to the development of the electronics industry, which is one of the brighter spots on our industrial horizon. It is expected to expand faster than any other sector of the economy in the coming years, and the development of telecommunications side by side with it is and will be a very significant contributor to the development of the entire economy. I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that one of the greatest impediments to the full development of our economy has been a totally inadequate telecommunications service.  The financial commitment needed to take on this massive programme <Col N="3409" /> has been made by the Government. Last year and this year £343 million will be spent on it.  I was asked about the company set up.  It was established on 1 April, Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.  That company will raise up to £100 million from the private sector. Many times since I became Minister various people in the private sector have put forward the idea that they should be given an opportunity to invest in it. Therefore, in future years this area will not be starved of the necessary capital to develop it.  This is the way it will be done in the future.</P>
    <P>This company will raise up to £100 million this year.  They will merge with and become part of An Bord Telecom when that semi-State body take over to run the service.  Telecommunications is very capital-intensive and much of the investment made in the earlier years will not bear fruit or show revenue until later. However, the whole secret of developing the industry and getting it into a revenue-earning position is to get the infrastructure right, to get the network right.  It is no use coming in here to make childish statements about this thing being wrong or that thing being wrong.  The whole programme has to be developed. It involves a big building programme, a big trunk-laying programme, a big line-laying programme.  It involves the purchase and installation of major trunk switching exchanges.  Then the question of subscriber exchanges comes into it.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are 450 manual exchanges still left, representing 10 per cent of the total subscribers.  More than 300 of these will be converted to automatic dialling in the next two years and the balance will be fully automatic before the end of 1984.  One of the major developments in recent times to improve the trunk service out of Dublin has been the opening of the Adelaide Road trunk switching station.  Already a number of trunk circuits have been routed into Adelaide Road and this will be finished progressively in the next couple of months. Consequently Dublin people who have found difficulty in ringing parts of the country will see a perceptible improvement by the end of June when Adelaide <Col N="3410" /> Road will have become fully operational with 4,600 additional circuits.  In the other major trunk switching areas throughout the country &mdash; they are the key to the whole network &mdash; new exchanges will be installed this year, in Galway, Naas and other centres where there has been congestion in recent times.</P>
    <P>That is only part of the job.  We are installing 5,000 additional trunk lines. Deputy Corish asked about Athlone.  He spoke about 25 trunk lines of which only two are working.  There are approximately 65 or 70 trunk lines to Athlone. Some of them will always be withdrawn from service because of maintenance being carried out but there is nothing like the position there that Deputy Corish described.  Naturally I would look after my own &mdash; charity begins at home.  I cannot confirm Deputy Corish's question about 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.  It is for somebody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>How many lines are there to Athlone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty to 70.  Twenty-five would not be in any way adequate to meet the number of calls through Athlone. There will always be a certain number of trunks under overhaul.  Major trunk replacements are going on throughout the country and this is being supplemented by microradio links.  Incidentally, we will be putting a microradio link in Tuam, Deputy Donnellan's home town, next month.  This will help to relieve congestion and improve the service.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell may not be aware that earlier this year I inaugurated a telecommunications council involving industry, our people in Posts and Telegraphs and others, to provide the interaction necessary.  I have covered most of the areas referred to.  I will have a look at Deputy Donnellan's allegations in relation to Galway and I will communicate with him.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Government Economic Policies: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by <Col N="3412" /> Deputy B. Desmond on Tuesday, 19th May 1981:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, having regard to the wide range of crises which beset the nation at present including:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the continuing rise in unemployment which, it is forecast, will rise to 135,000 by the end of the year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;continuing dramatic increases in prices, which rose by 21% in the year to mid-February last and which are forecast to rise by 18% in 1981;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the crisis in our balance of payments and the dangerously low level of our external reserves;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the recent increase in interest rates, which reflects growing pressure on the Irish Pound and which will create further difficulties for industry at a time when this sector is already in deep crisis;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the cuts in local authority and health board expenditure which have led to substantial reductions in the quality of the services provided by these public bodies;</P>
    <P>condemns the incompetence of the Government, and recognising that the Government has disastrously mismanaged the nation's economic affairs, resolves that it has no confidence in the present administration.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann re-affirms confidence in the economic policies of the Government and expresses approval of the measures being taken by them to mitigate the effects of the present world recession, to promote growth in output and employment, to combat inflation and to promote general economic development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are proceeding on their economic policy in the <Col N="3413" /> innocent belief that as long as there are bankers prepared to lend them money it is all right to go on borrowing more. There are many farmers in Ireland who worked on that philosophy in 1977 and 1978 and who now know how horrifyingly wrong that philosophy can be.</P>
      <P>As a result of the free borrowing policy of the Government we have by far the worst trade deficit in Europe.  At 13½ per cent of GNP, our balance of payments deficit is three times as bad as that of the next worst country in Europe, Belgium, whose trade deficit is 4.5 per cent of GNP.  Government borrowing which is not matched by increased production leads inevitably to increased imports and is therefore directly responsible for the yawning gap between our imports and exports.  This year the Government have borrowed 17 per cent of our gross national product.  In contrast Britain, which is extremely worried that its borrowing is far too high, will borrow only 4 per cent of its GNP.  A huge debt and a huge deficit might make some sense if we had something good in return for them.  But by any standards we do not. Since 1978 when the foreign borrowing really got under way our economic performance has actually got rapidly worse. As compared with our 16 major competitor nations in Europe and North America, as stated in the Central Bank Report, Ireland's economic growth has fallen from the top of the list at 5.8 per cent a year in 1978 to the very bottom of the list, minus growth of .5 per cent in 1980. Likewise our rate of inflation has worsened from sixth lowest of the 16 countries cited in 1978 to second highest in 1981. This borrowing was supposed to save jobs.  It has not done so.  The Economic and Social Research Institute predicts that unemployment will reach 135,000 by the end of this year as against 122,000 at the end of 1980 and 88,600 at the end of 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A continuance of current policies will probably lead us to an unemployment level by the end of 1982 of double the 1979 level.  The present economic policy simply has not worked and that policy <Col N="3414" /> can only be changed by a change of Government. The following are, in my view, necessary to devise an alternative economic policy: we must control inflation and to do that we must control Government borrowing and spending; we must devise institutions to keep a check on irresponsible spending and borrowing by governments whose time horizons extend no further than the next election.  In former times fixed exchange rates and the gold standard restrained governments in this way.  These constraints which have been removed, the first in the twenties and the second in the seventies, must now be replaced by new ones in the national interest.  It is no coincidence that those countries which have significant restraints on the Government's ability to spend money, for instance, West Germany, have suffered least from inflation and have made superior economic progress. We must therefore look anew at the role of the Central Bank in our economy.</P>
    <P>Second, we must reassert parliamentary control over Government spending which is the major cause of foreign borrowing. This involves a radical reform of Dáil procedures, considering Estimates for Departments before and not after money is spent as is the case at present, and subjecting them to rigorous scrutiny. We must ensure that Government investment is properly balanced.  Government capital spending, often on imported goods, has shot up in cost away over official budget targets in recent years.  For instance, last year the public capital programme overshot the budgeted target by 24 per cent.  The Government arbitrarily calls this capital spending investment. But much of it will not yield the financial return with which to repay our debts. Government investment should in future be planned on a five-year basis and not on a one-year basis as is the case with the present so-called investment plan.  It must be subject to a proper analysis here in the Dáil before the money is spent. Our tax system must be reformed to put the emphasis back on employment and on working.  Our industrial relations system must be reformed to reward long-term thinking and penalise the wreckers. These issues are all vital issues to our <Col N="3415" /> national economy and they are all issues which have been dodged or postponed by the present Government.  It is time to elect a Government which will have the courage to face them.</P>

      <P>If I did not know him better I would take the previous speaker seriously. He talked about Government spending.  I sat here yesterday and listened to the debate on agricultural rates relief.  The Deputy's party talked about giving over £31.5 million for rates relief. He sat here on Tuesday of last week and listened to his own colleague on the front banch talk about offering £35 million to the landlords of this city and of this country to improve their buildings and offer tax reliefs on rents to the rent payers. Now he comes in and has the unmitigated neck and gall to talk about putting the public finances in order.  The Deputy's party cannot have it both ways and the people of this country will judge them on that.</P>
      <P>I would like to again remind the House of mine and the Government's commitment given last October and on a number of occasions in the meantime to ensure that local authority services will have resource allocations commensurate with their importance to the economy.  The investment plan for 1981 and the budget and the action since taken deliver in full on this commitment and I take the opportunity to again put on record the massive increase in funds provided for local authority services.  Moneys on a scale unprecedented have been made available for housing, roads, water and sewerage services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to cuts in local authority expenditure is of course very relevant to the period in office of the former Minister for Local Government who signed the motion.  Before dealing in more detail with certain matters I will emphasise some of the main and more striking facts, statistics and comparisons of the depressed Coalition times.  An amount of £87 million allocated to road authorities for road works in 1981 represented a massive increase of some £29 million or <Col N="3416" /> over 49 per cent on 1980.  This figure of £87 million for a single year compares with total allocations by the Coalition of under £68 million for the last three years in office, 1975, 1976 and 1977.  A figure of £74.7 million was provided by way of capital moneys for public water and sewerage schemes for 1981 as against £51 million in 1980, a huge increase of over £23 million or 47 per cent on this year. Again this compares with a total increase of a paltry £12 million by the Coalition in their four years in office.  Indeed their allocation for 1977 was less than that for 1976.  A figure of £242 million was provided for housing in 1981, giving an increase of 33 per cent on the original provision of £183 million for 1980. Expenditure by the Coalition actually dropped by 57 per cent in real terms between 1975 and 1977.  The Deputy of course, as spokesman on Finance, should know something about figures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a record 12 per cent upper limit in 1981 on the increase in the rate in the pound to be struck by local authorities and the grant in relief for rates for 1981 is £120 million. This grant arises from the Government decision to derate domestic dwellings and certain other properties, a measure which has benefited some one million ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 103,000 new houses have been completed by this Government over the past four years, including 25,000 local authority dwellings, with an all-time record of almost 28,000 completions in 1980.  There have been consistent and continuous incentives by the Government to stimulate the building industry <Col N="3417" /> and to assist first time house purchasers. These arise from a decision to introduce the £1,000 grant and from the package recently announced by me which introduces a special mortgage subsidy of £3,000 in addition to the £1,000 grant. These measures contrast sharply with the Coalition's inactivity when in office.  The income and loan limits for local authority house purchase loans have been increased on four occasions over the past four years by 198 per cent and 211 per cent respectively.  The Coalition, with their customary disregard for the plight of the building and construction industry and for persons in search of housing, allowed these limits to remain unchanged between September 1973 and 1977 despite the fact that new house prices and earnings had more than doubled in that period.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are fond of drawing attention to the so-called parlous state of the building industry.  What is conveniently forgotten is that under this Government the industry's output has been at a higher level than ever before.  There are now substantially more people employed in the industry than when we took office in 1977.  Direct employment in the building industry increased by 15,000 since 1976 and total new house completions for 1980 were at an all-time record of almost 28,000.  Public capital support for the building industry has never been at a higher level in real terms.  In 1977 public capital expenditure in the industry was £387 million and this year it will be over £1,000 million.  Government investment in major infrastructural services has increased dramatically over the last four years.  This increased investment is of major economic significance because it provides a basic modern infrastructure without which future sustained economic growth would not be possible.  As a direct result of the increased public capital investment in the building industry in 1981, which was announced in the Government investment plan, I am confident that building industry output will increase significantly and that employment will also increase between now and the end of the year.  The Government's concern to ensure increased economic growth and <Col N="3418" /> to encourage increased investment in key sectors of the economy should not be construed as implying a lack of concern for social issues.  The housing package 1981 is designed as an incentive to increase new housing output by helping first time purchasers of new houses.  However anyone who studies the package will know that it also provides generous assistance for many of the weaker sections who were neglected when the Coalition were in power.</P>
    <P>I will contrast the remarkable achievements of the Government in the housing field with the abysmal record of the previous Government.  In 1973 Fianna Fáil had sown the seeds for a major upturn in housing completions and in their early years in office the Coalition reaped the harvest of our foresight and claimed record levels of completions.  Predictably, the Coalition failed to continue the good work and failed to recognise that if housing policy is to be successful it must be flexible and responsive to housing existing needs.  The Coalition's failure to take positive constructive initiatives meant that housing completions began to decline.  There was a fall of nearly 3,000 between 1975 and 1976.  During the first half of 1977 completions declined further to an annual level of 21,000, when the housing need was clearly 25,000 new houses per annum.  When we returned to office we took the type of courageous action required to arrest the decline set in motion by the previous Government's inactivity and sterility.  We introduced the £1,000 new house grant scheme, as promised in our manifesto, and since that was introduced about 28,000 purchasers have benefited.  This grants scheme represented the Government's considered response to the need to help first time owner occupiers.  Naturally, we recognised that housing policy must be receptive to changing circumstances and that was why in April of this year we decided that the first-time purchaser was again in need of assistance.  Accordingly, having considered various alternatives, we introduced the special mortgage subsidy scheme under which my Department, in addition to the £1,000 grant, will pay a subsidy of up to £3,000 to first-time purchasers <Col N="3419" /> of new grant type houses to help them meet mortgage repayment in the early years of the loan when the burden of repayments is at its heaviest.</P>
    <P>The second area we looked at on our return to office was the local authority house purchase loan scheme.  Here there was even more glaring evidence of the Coalition Government's total insensitivity to the legitimate demands of that section of the community who seek to provide their own homes with finance from their local authorities.  Between September 1973 and June 1977 the former Minister for Local Government, whose name appears as one of the proposers of the Labour Party motion, turned a deaf ear to requests for increases in the loan and income limits governing this scheme despite the fact that during the period in question house prices and earning more than doubled.  Expenditure on house purchase and improvement loans in 1977 amounted to less than £20 million.  This year's allocation is £96 million.  We have in four years increased the normal loan and income limits on four occasions by approximately 200 per cent and they now stand at £14,000 and £7,000 respectively. Mainly as a result of the actions by the present Government in these two areas housing completions rose in each of the past four years, culminating in the record figure of 27,785 completions last year.</P>
    <P>The building societies, of course, also play a major role in the financing of the Government's housing programme. Almost 75 per cent of all private housing finance is provided by building societies. They advanced almost 17,000 house purchase loans to the value of £269 million in 1980, providing mortgage finance amounting to £126 million in respect of 7,807 new houses and £143 million in respect of 9,137 others.  A major factor in attracting the inflow of funds to the societies was the Government's decision to make an interest subsidy available to societies with effect from 1 June 1980.  I expect that the societies will make in excess of £300 million available towards financing the Government's private housing programme in 1981.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that <Col N="3420" /> in discussions I had today with the building societies the societies are increasing the investment rate to their depositors and that the Government have once again, recognising the needs of the mortgage holders as they did in June last year, decided to re-introduce the mortgage subsidy for mortgage holders to keep their mortgage repayments at the percentage level they are at at the moment.</P>
    <P>The provision of housing for those unable to provide houses from their own resources is an essential element of our policy and some 24,600 houses were built by local authorities between 1977 and 1980.  The total public capital programme provision for housing in the current year is £242 million which represents an increase of 34 per cent in real terms compared with the 1977 provision by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Interestingly the people who tabled tonight's motion were party to a Government which allowed expenditure to drop by 57 per cent in real terms between 1975 and 1977 and I am not at all surprised to hear the Labour Party speak of cuts in local authority expenditure.  After all, it was their Minister who excelled in making such cuts over the period 1974 to 1977.  Take, for example, the roads area alone.  The grants allocated by the Coalition Government in its first year 1973-74 fell short of £19 million whereas the present Government in its first full year in 1978 allocated grants up to double that amount.  In fact, immediately on taking office in July 1977 we felt obliged to supplement by £5 million the inadequate grant allocation already made by the Coalition for 1977.  For the nine months in the financial period April to December 1974 the Coalition allocated grants of £16 million which would represent about £21.3 million in a full year.  In 1975 the Coalition Government, despite sharp cost increases, failed to meet even the figure of £21.3 million with road grants. The grant for 1976 at £20.4 million showed a further reduction.  The total grants allocated by the Coalition Government in their last three years in office &mdash; 1975, 1976 and 1977 &mdash; fell short of £68 million.</P>
    <P>I would like now to contrast our performance <Col N="3421" /> with the abysmal record of the Coalition in this area.  For the current year alone &mdash; I am sorry Deputy Tully is leaving us because I know the figures are of interest to him &mdash; we allocated grants of over £87 million, which represents and increase of nearly 30 per cent over the paltry investment made by the previous Coalition Government in their three years in office.  Starting with grants totalling £37.55 million for our first full year in office, 1978, we have maintained a steady annual increase in road investment.  The grants for 1979 were increased to £48.39 million.  They were further increased to £58.46 million for 1980 and for this year they have reached the unprecedented level of £87.2 million, an all time record.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, while in opposition, fully recognised the disastrous effects of the totally inadequate investment being made by the Coalition Government in the road system, a system we fully recognise as essential for agriculture, industrial, commercial, tourist and social development and, on assuming office in 1977, we undertook the preparation of a major road development plan designed to anticipate the demands of the eighties.  This road development plan was published in May 1979.  It marked a milestone in road planning, being the first plan of its type since the foundation of the State.  The plan is both imaginative and realistic, outlining the Government's objectives for the development of the road system in the current decade.</P>
    <P>We fully recognised that our task was only beginning with the launching of this plan.  More important still was ensuring that the necessary finances were provided to implement the plan.  We have not been found wanting in this regard.  The investment plan for 1981, in highlighting the importance of productive infrastructural investment, provided a massive £80 million for roads in 1981, on foot of which I have made grant allocations totalling over £87 million to road authorities.  This represents an increase of 49 per cent on road grants allocated last year and an increase of a remarkable 227 per cent on the level of grants provided by the Coalition Government in their last year of office.  Investment on this scale clearly <Col N="3422" /> indicates our commitment to seeing that the works under the plan are carried out and our recognition of the importance and value of a satisfactory road system.</P>
    <P>I have provided grants of over £31 million for over 80 major improvement works which are listed in the road development plan.  I am very encouraged by the results of a special progress report undertaken recently in my Department in relation to these schemes and I am confident of significant developments before the end of the year on the many new relief roads and by-passes for which grants have been made.  Among the major schemes for which I have made grants in the Dublin region are a new road from Whitehall to the airport; by-passes of Swords and Balbriggan; a new road linking Clontarf road with the East Wall road; a new bridge adjacent to Heuston Bridge and a by-pass at Palmerstown on the N4 to the west.</P>
    <P>In Cork city I have allocated grants for three new bridges over the Lee and a new ring road, as recommended in the Cork Land Use and Transportation Study.  I have also provided grants for ring roads in Limerick, new bridges in Waterford, Athlone and Galway and inner relief roads or ring roads in Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Tralee and Clonmel. Outside the main urban areas I have provided grants for other major projects including the Naas by-pass; new Cork &mdash; Mallow road; new road through the Curragh, and ring roads or by-passes at Mullingar, Navan, Carrick-on-Shannon, Dunleer, Coolooney, Ballinasloe, Oranmore, Roscrea, Donegal, Midleton and Dungarvan.</P>

      <P>It is such a vast extensive programme it would be impossible to identify every individual unit.  You could identify things in 1977 when the Coalition were in office because the <Col N="3423" /> money was abysmal but, with the vast allocation of £87 million this year, if I were to read out the list of schemes I would take up too much of the time of the House.  I am more anxious to get on the record the achievement of the Fianna Fáil Government.  While the road development plan highlights the major works to be undertaken it also provides for an extensive programme of normal improvement works designed to bring all sections of the national primary routes and significant sections of the national secondary routes up to a specified minimum standard.  I have allocated grants of over £21 million for this programme in 1980.  I have also provided substantial block grants to supplement the resources of road authorities and grants for special works, including bridge works on roads other than national roads.</P>
      <P>This year, for the first time, I have provided, in addition to normal maintenance grants, £6 million for a special programme of works for the strengthening and renewal of critical sections of the principal roads.  Work of this nature is essential if we are to ensure continued benefit from the considerable sum invested annually in the road network.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the roads programme I have briefly outlined, with particular reference to the major improvements of the principal routes, will serve as a valuable contribution to the Government's policy for regional and industrial development.  In addition, the programme will have valuable supplementary benefits in that it creates increased activity in the construction industry; generates employment both on-site and off-site and utilises materials and equipment of Irish manufacture.  Towards this end I have impressed on the road authorities the need for the maximum use of Irish materials to ensure that employment in Irish firms is protected and increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognise that adequate investment in piped water and sewerage services is an essential precondition for development at national and local level.  As in so many other areas, this cannot be said of the Coalition Government, <Col N="3424" /> who actually reduced the capital provision for sanitary services from £25 million in 1976 to £24.91 million in 1977. This represented a cut in real terms of almost 15 per cent in sanitary services investment.  It is indeed something of which they should be ashamed and the Irish people will never forget it for them.  We have steadily increased capital spending on piped water and sewerage schemes since our first budget in 1978 to an unprecedented level of £67.3 million in 1981.  Sanitary services investment is now about 170 per cent above the level fixed in the last budget of the Coalition Government. This increased level of investment has enabled us to approve for commencement almost 200 major public water and sewerage schemes costing £166.5 million since 1977.  Direct employment on sanitary services has increased from 1,300 in 1977 to about 2,000 in 1980 and a further 350 jobs will be created in 1981.  Direct employment on sanitary services has increased from 1,300 in 1977 to approximately 2,000 in 1980 and a further 350 jobs will be created in 1981.</P>
    <P>Due to the record capital provision for sanitary services in 1981 I have recently approved 55 public water and sewerage schemes estimated to cost over £31.5 million for commencement, including such schemes as Listowel regional water scheme, Saggart-Ballyboden trunk water main, Tramore River Valley sewer, Ballinasloe water supply improvement, Kells-Oldcastle regional water scheme &mdash; I know Deputy Tully will be particularly interested in that one &mdash; Lough Gowna water supply, stages 2 and 3, Ballybay-Louth Egish water supply and, I am pleased to be able to tell the House, I was in a position to sanction the Lusk sewerage scheme, one in my area needing attention.  In selecting schemes for approval I have had regard to the priority of the schemes&mdash;</P>

      <P>Wicklow did well.  The Deputy does not come in often but, now that he has mentioned it, as he knows Wicklow is being well looked after this year.  In selecting schemes for approval I <Col N="3425" /> have had regard to the priority of the schemes and also the locations of work in progress and of schemes approved already but not yet commenced.  My objective has been not only to provide services but also to secure a wide spread of works which will contribute to local employment and facilitate the creation of further job opportunities by improving Ireland's attractiveness for industrial investment and employment.</P>
      <P>The small schemes programmes of local authorities are designed to respond flexibly to urgent needs arising from the on-going process of development.  The Government under-lined the importance of this programme by increasing the cost limit for small public water and sewerage schemes from £20,000 to £30,000 and increasing the budget for small schemes more than fourfold, from £1 million in 1977 to £4.5 million in 1981.</P>
      <P>As Minister for the Environment I am determined that a substantial effort be made over a period of years to eliminate pollution caused by inadequate local authority sewerage schemes and to ensure that economic and physical development can proceed in harmony with the environment.  The expansion in the overall financial provision for sanitary services has enabled a substantial increase in investment in new and improved public sewerage schemes.  As evidence of the progress being made I might mention the following examples of the treatment works nearing completion or completed: the Naas sewerage treatment works, Swords treatment works, Tipperary town treatment works, Charleville treatment works.  Major sewerage schemes in progress or approved for commencement include Ballina main drainage, Mallow main drainage, Gorey main drainage, Edenderry sewerage treatment works and Thurles sewerage treatments works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that contract documents for the remaining stages of the Greater Dublin drainage scheme have been approved.  This major scheme, which will involve a total estimated investment of £40 million, should be completed by 1984 and will meet the needs of Dublin city and environs for the next 15 to 20 years.  In catering for the sanitary <Col N="3426" /> services requirements of the larger populated centres I have not overlooked the needs of the smaller communities.</P>
    <P>The private group water supply scheme programme plays a vital role in bringing piped water to rural houses and associated farms.  Fianna Fáil launched a programme in the early sixties and, on returning to office in 1977, gave a major boost to that programme by increasing the maximum State grant from £100 to £300 per house.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should remind the House of what has happened in relation to the farming sector.  We had a debate on the farming sector here all day yesterday on the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill under which rates relief for many farmers has been dramatically improved.  To date only farmers with land valuations of £20 or less received full rates relief.  This year farmers with a valuation of up to £50 are relieved of all rates on land and those with valuations of between £50 and £70 receive partial relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time available to me I have illustrated fully the massive increase in funds made available by the Government for local authority services.  We will continue to act as and when necessary to provide any additional funds needed for building and construction, including <Col N="3427" /> housing, road works, sanitary services and other miscellaneous services in order to stimulate further economic development. I fully endorse a vote of confidence in the Government on their handling of the economy.  Regrettably, on the basis of their performance when in government, no such vote of confidence can be in the Government on their handling of the economy.  Regrettably, on the basis of their performance when in government, no such vote of confidence can be given the Coalition Parties who had the building and construction industry, indeed the economy generally, in a shambles when they left office in 1977.</P>

      <P>What measures may I ask?  As far as the country is concerned people are prepared to listen to arguments but they are perfectly satisfied that the largest failing of this Government is that they have not taken any measures.  In fact they do not seem to know where they are going.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's final comment about the farmers he seems to have forgotten that it was a Fianna Fáil Government who last year decided that it would be wrong to continue to give rates remission to farmers and therefore reduced the remission to those with valuations of £40 and under.  On top of that they proceeded to add a 2 per cent levy creating a situation in which farmers who were already in serious trouble were pushed further into the mire by an uncaring Fianna Fáil Government.  Of course they were then a further year away from an election and they thought it would be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been talking about <Col N="3428" /> housing.  He was bragging about the fact that they claimed to have built slightly over 28,000 houses last year.  I would be the first to congratulate the Government on any such achievement.  But there is just one little point that should be made about that.  When we took over we said that we required 25,000 houses a year in our period in office.  In the four years we were in office we succeeded in building over 101,000 houses &mdash; that is 25,000 a year.  The big mistake Fianna Fáil made was that, rather than aiming for at least 30,000 houses per annum they continued our programme.  They should have been aiming for at least 30,000 because of the proven increase in population, because people needed those houses.  I suppose it would be too much to expect them to do anything else.  If we go back to 1966-67 all the houses built in this country under Fianna Fáil amounted to 11,354.  The following year, 1968, that figure was 12,447, the following year 13,533, yet the following year 14,169.  In 1970-71 they were down again to 13,971.  In 1971-72, the year before we took over, the best they could do was 16,421.  We took over the following year and, despite the fact that we had to re-jig the budget, that we had to change the whole system developed by Fianna Fáil, we succeeded in having built in this country 22,422 houses, an increase of 6,001 on the best Fianna Fáil could do.  The following year that figure rose to 26,190, the following year 26,892; in 1976 the figure was down to 24,000 and for 1977, the year in which the Minister's predecessor took over, the figure was 24,548.  Reconstruction grants show the very same pattern, up from 8,576 in 1966-67 to 14,389 when he handed over.</P>
    <P>With regard to water and sewerage, to which the Minister has just referred also, all the grants they could give when we took over in 1966-67 were 6,747.  There were 12,066 given in 1965 and when we handed over, the figure dropped to 12,542, not unexpectedly because that is the pattern of Fianna Fáil.  I want to repeat what I have said here on a number of occasions &mdash; for years Fianna Fáil were under the impression that if they could build anything up to around 18,000, 19,000 or 20,000 houses in the eighties <Col N="3429" />&mdash; and I have it on record from a predecessor of the Minister &mdash; that would be sufficient.  I have that in a minute from the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken over the mantle of Fianna Fáil in that office and he must take the rough with the smooth.  He talks about the additional building workers that are employed.  I noted he was not here today, which was rather a pity because we had a very interesting Question Time, during which his Minister of State had to admit that it was expected that the number of building workers this year would drop by over 1,000 on 1980. What does the Minister see in that to boast about?  I am glad he has decided to pay an interest subsidy to the building societies in order to keep the interest rate from going up but he must remember that neither he nor Fianna Fáil began that idea.  All through the years they refused an interest subsidy.  I introduced it when I was a Minister in the Coalition Government and we kept it there longer than the present Minister kept his subsidy because he rushed away to save a few bob at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>He also talks about housing completions and all the people who will avail of the new £4,000 grant.  I would not be surprised if he got a tremendous number of applications for the £4,000 grant but I would like it very much if he could do something about paying people who are waiting over two years for the £1,000. They cannot get it because there is no money to pay them.  All possible excuses are being made, the most recent one being: &ldquo;Send it to the Minister for Finance; ask the income tax authorities for a certificate&rdquo;&mdash; anything to delay payment of the grant and save a few bob in any way possible.  That is what the Government are doing.  The question of the £4,000 is a joke with people who are waiting for the £1,000.  Many of them asked me next morning if they would qualify.  I said: &ldquo;I do not think so but I will try to ensure that you get full particulars&rdquo;. I got the particulars more quickly than some who spoke here today who did not get them for a long time.  I got them fairly quickly from the Minister's office.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into an argument now; we shall have the next three weeks for that.  The £4,000 grant would not apply to all the people who are waiting for grants or loans, some of them had to sell their houses, having built them, as they could not get the SDA loans they were promised because the Government would not give the local authority the money to pay those who wanted to borrow money to build houses. It is the greatest disgrace ever known. Meath County Council, for example, were promised £5,700,000 up to the end of December last.  This year they got £3.4 million.  Out of that &mdash;&ldquo;the loaves and fishes&rdquo; the Minister referred to &mdash; they are supposed to pay £5.7 million for last year and the balance for this year.  Where would it come from?  The Minister does not know.  There is no use in asking him because he did not know at the time how much money would be required.  It is the greatest joke ever known that we have a Minister who claims to know everything: he knows what happened four or five years ago, according to himself; he does not know what is happening now.  He also talks about building societies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course, the building societies paid a lot of money because of a change which took place.  The one good thing about joining the EMS was that we had money which had to be brought back here and which was invested in the building societies.  What is happening now? How much money did the building societies get last month and the month before that?  Is it not idle to talk about big increase in the amount of money to be lent by building societies when the Minister knows they are now at the pin of their collar to meet the loans that are being sought?  Applicants cannot get loans because people would not invest with the building societies because they did not have the money; they had to buy bread and butter with it.  Money for saving is not there now; Fianna Fáil saw to that.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the question of the ring road in Drogheda.  Sometime he should show me that ring road.  The only money ever spent on an attempt to put a ring road in Drogheda was money spent on the bridge when I was there and the money spent on the approach to it. That is there still and will be there because the present Government will not be able or prepared to spend money there.  The same applies in Navan.  You can promise them money but so far no work has been done and work cannot be done without money.  The Minister is codding himself if he thinks the people are being codded by what Fianna Fáil are doing.  They got away with it in 1977 but they will not get away with it again &mdash;&ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3432" /> As regards prices between May 1977 and February 1981, all prices increased 61.6 per cent.  In the UK it was 50.8 per cent; in the Netherlands, 20.1 per cent; in Luxembourg, 20 per cent; in Italy alone it was 75.8 per cent; in Germany, 17.6 per cent; France, 46.5 per cent; Denmark, 43.8 per cent; Belgium 42.4 per cent.  Ireland is next to Italy at 61.1 per cent, out on a limb.  That is the way this Government like to run the country. They do not know; they change their minds from day to day as with the calling of the election.  The Taoiseach is like a man about to commit suicide by drowning. He goes up on the bridge, changes his mind and gets down.  He looks at the water and says the water may be deeper in a couple of months and he will not hurt himself so much.  That is how Fianna Fáil are governing the country, as everybody knows.</P>
    <P>What price the economy of the country in the past fortnight when the Government refused to govern and allowed thugs in the centre of this city to run riot with the result that trade has dropped through the floor?  Similarly in country towns north of here where, through people being threatened and cajoled you have a situation in which the economy is suffering badly.  People are losing on prices, wages and everything else.  The Government are doing nothing about it and if the Garda are doing nothing about it, there is one reason and that is that the Government told them not to do it, if there is no other reason why they should not, in case they would lose a few votes when the election comes along.</P>

Go to O'Connell Street and you will find it; go to Drogheda and Dundalk and you will find it and in other towns in the North.  Look at the coming tourist season.  Will tourists from Britain come here when everywhere you see slogans on the walls threatening them and everybody belonging to them?  And nothing is being done about it.  When I was in office I made local authorities clean the walls. Here in Dublin, when they said they could not do it because they could not rub it off, I insisted that it be done and they put brown paper over those slogans. What are they doing now?  They are just leaving them there with the result that every place in the country is destroyed with slogans.  I do not care whether the Minister is for or against them but it is wrong to allow any group to destroy the appearance of the country and destroy the economy by insulting tourists.  That is what is happening under Fianna Fáil. There is no way they can get away with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing Fianna Fáil were never able to do, either by telling lies or truths; was to put me off my stroke because as the Minister is aware, I am <Col N="3434" /> pretty well able to look after myself.  The increase in all prices over the four-year period was 61.6 per cent.  Food prices over the same period increased by 51.9 per cent; alcohol by 79 per cent; tobacco, 85.3 per cent; clothing and footwear 56.5 per cent; fuel and light, 91.4 per cent; housing rents, 28 per cent; durable goods, 55.4 per cent and transport, 62.5 per cent.  That is not a new increase. When Fianna Fáil took office we did not go back to square one and start up again. That is on top of the prices which Fianna Fail in their manifesto said they would reduce by 1 per cent in the first year, 2 per cent in the second year, and 3 per cent in the third year to bring us to 1980. The Minister may try to smile that one off, but he will have a bit of a job proving that Fianna Fail can survive with that as their record.</P>
      <P>Unemployment, as the Minister is aware, is officially 126,000.  The unofficial figure is about 140,000.  If we adopt the system used by Fianna Fáil &mdash; when we had 110,000 unemployed they said the figure was 185,000 &mdash; we must be close to 200,000.  I am being generous when I give the figure of 140,000, but that figure is rising weekly.  The forecast of the ESRI recently was that the unemployment figure would reach 140,000 by the end of the year but in my view, unless Fianna Fáil are turned out of office, the figure will be 170,000.  With the possible exception of Belgium, our unemployment figure is the highest in the EEC.  When we joined the EEC the Government told us there would be work for everybody.  If there was no work here all we had to do was to arrange for our workers to go abroad where there would be plenty.  What has happened?  All countries are in the same boat but, with the exception of Belgium, they are not as bad as us.  We are at the bottom of the pile and there is not one thing we can do about it.</P>

I can recall the former Taoiseach telling the unemployed before the last election &mdash; it is also in the manifesto &mdash; that there would be employment for all school leavers.  They would be all working within one week of leaving school, but now there are 35,000 unemployed and it is estimated that there are at least another 5,000 who have not registered. The situation is deteriorating rapidly. There has been a drop of 10,000 in the number employed in the manufacturing sector in the last 12 months alone.  Is the Minister aware of that?</P>

      <P>It would be as well if the Minister kept going.</P>
      <P>Our inflation is the highest in the Community. From mid-February 1980 to mid-February 1981 prices rose by 21 per cent.  The forecast for this year's net inflation is that it will be at least 18 per cent. The huge increase in inflation is coming at a time when price increases in the UK are beginning to slow down.  In fact there is a price reduction coming for oil in Britain.  Coal and oil have been increased recently here.  The price of coal here was increased by £5 per ton a few weeks ago, but in Britain it went down by £7 per ton. I would like if someone could give me the answer to that one.  I put it down to the incompetence of the Government who do not know where they are going or what they are doing.</P>
      <P>The current budget deficit was targetted at £515 million by the Minister for Finance last January, but there is universal agreement now that it will be at least £700 million or possibly £800 million by the end of the year if Fianna Fáil are still in power.  Last year the deficit exceeded £500 million, as it did in 1978 and 1979. Since Fianna Fáil were returned to office they have borrowed more than £2,000 million just to finance the current deficit and we hear Fianna Fáil speakers talking about borrowing for the purpose of productive employment.  As a result of this borrowing interest payments amount now to almost 77p out of every pound collected in income tax.  On current trends I am sure it will soon absorb the entire income tax revenue.  It is only fair to point out that in 1977 the amount of income tax collected from the PAYE sector was £498 million and last year, although we were told of the wonderful reductions in income tax the PAYE sector would get under Fianna Fáil, it had risen to £1,124 million in 1980.  That is another of the Fianna Fáil promises which they could not keep and I believe they never had any intention of keeping it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no argument but that the Exchequer finances are completely out of control.  The chaos threatens future <Col N="3437" /> employment and the maintenance of the social services.  I am worried that we are reaching a stage under the Government where there is a great danger of us being unable to continue State service because Fianna Fáil, having started on this squandermania, cannot stop.  They will reach a situation where they will not be able to raise enough money to pay for the services of the State.  The extraordinary thing about it all is that Fianna Fáil are doing this while at the same time they are blaming us because of what they call reductions in the years 1976-77.  We experienced the biggest recession ever.  We had to borrow money to get out of it and, having succeeded in getting out of the recession, we reduced the amount of borrowing deliberately by reducing certain payments.  We did that in an effort to put the country on its feet.  Having handed over to Fianna Fáil with an inflation rate under 10 per cent, we found that Fianna Fáil, who promised a 5 per cent inflation rate in the following year created, a 20 to 21 per cent rate and the rate has been up and down from 15 to 18 to 21 per cent since then.  They are the people who tell us that they are the only ones who can run this country.  We know what they can do.  They should after that word &ldquo;run&rdquo; and insert the letter &ldquo;i&rdquo; because they are the only people who can ruin the country. In the last four years they have gone a long way towards doing that.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments has reached such dimensions that drastic remedial action will be imposed upon us if the Government do not act soon.  Last year the deficit exceeded £700 million.  This year it is forecast by the ESRI and the Central Bank that it will be around £1,200 million.  This means that the deficit will be around 12 per cent of GNP and some forecasters believe will be even higher. Even at 12 per cent of GNP it is ten times the Community average.  It has been brought on by the Government.  Some of the members of the Government are whispering that devaluation might get them out of trouble.  Of course, it is unavoidable if the deficit continues at that rate.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that devaluation within the <Col N="3438" /> EMS, if it is forced on us, would only in turn increase the cost of energy, particularly oil which is priced in dollars. The last thing I want to see is the devaluation of our punt but this Government seem to be running riot with it and if they are allowed to continue it will not be very long before that happens.  Deflation is offered as the only solution to both inflation and the balance of payments deficit. The Labour Party reject that process emphatically because it will simply increase unemployment and cut further into living standards.  The solution must be based on a planned approach to managing the economy with the immediate objectives of cutting down the rate of inflation, reducing the current budget deficit and the frightening dependence on foreign borrowing, eliminating the balance of payments deficit over a phased period, preventing devaluation with the EMS and restoring for everyone's satisfaction the economy to growth.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil claim that the economy is recovering.  To say that simply is laughable. For example, the OECD forecast no increase in personal consumption this year in Ireland.  New inquiries with the IDA are falling off and unemployment is rising.  A recent EEC study of other member states' economies had this to say of Ireland: &ldquo;The outlook for the recovery in activity in 1981 will not be reflected in a great improvement in the employment situation.  Unemployment may continue rising.&rdquo;  Therefore, on all grounds the Dáil and the country cannot have any confidence in this Government.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude with a few short comments. We have a big blow in this House again and again and advertisements on radio and television about buying Irish, buying &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo;.  Of the goods being sold in this country at present far too high a proportion are not Irish.  Some of them are being sold &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo; when they are not Irish.  They or portion of them are assembled in Ireland.  It is ridiculous.  On top of that we are told, &ldquo;What can we do?  The EEC countries and the third countries throught the EEC have the right to send goods into this country&rdquo;.  I had a question down on 7 <Col N="3439" /> April to ask the Taoiseach to give details of the level of imports of furniture from Eastern European countries to Ireland in each year since 1975.  To my surprise I find that from the USSR, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria in 1975 furniture to the value of £195,100 was imported.  In 1980, last year, £1,143,000 worth was imported.  Is there any point in talking about buying &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo; where we are allowing this country to be flooded by EEC countries and third countries through the EEC, who have no right whatever to destroy our industries, and very few of whom are buying from us in exchange?  I am particularly annoyed about furniture because Navan, the central town where I live, is the home of furniture and the people there are kicking up a row.  Rightly so, because VAT has been increased from 20 per cent to 25 per cent and yet this stuff is coming in from abroad.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have the farmers complaining that this year, as in previous years, despite a solemn promise from the Minister for Agriculture, Cypriot potatoes are being brought into this country in enormous quantities across the Border every week and being sold here in competition with the Irish potato.  The only confidence I can have in the Government is if they tell us before this debate concludes that the Taoiseach cannot be here because he is on his way to the Park to have the Dáil dissolved.</P>

      <P>However, I will quote from a document from which the Deputy has just quoted on the CPI.  The Deputy <Col N="3440" /> chose to be very selective.  There is a second column on the sheet of paper that I have and I assume that we are both using the same document.  Deputy Tully went down the various items and referred to the price increase from mid-May 1977 to mid-February 1981, a three-and-three-quarter-year period.  He pointed out correctly that food prices had gone up 51.9 per cent.  He did not refer to the previous three-and-three-quarter-year period when food prices increased 81.1 per cent, from mid-August 1973 to mid-May 1977.  That trend has continued down down through the recent figures produced by the CPI.</P>
      <P>There are other very interesting figures here.  I do not want to go back over the ground that Deputy Tully went over but just to come to the total figure for the basket of products referred to in the CPI. During the three-and-three-quarter-year period that the Coalition Government were in power there was an increase of 87.2 per cent and in the same period 61.1 per cent.  One can use figures for one's own argument and not make direct comparisons.</P>

      <P>We have agreed on all sides of the House since I came in here that we have an international recession. Probably when we were on the far side of the House we were criticising the then Government and now the Opposition are doing it.

      <P>Deputy Tully referred to four headings which have to be dealt with, inflation, possible devaluation, current deficit and foreign borrowing.  These matters must be dealt with.  I have not heard one concrete suggestion as to where the two Opposition parties would cut spending, get the current deficit down or reduce foreign borrowing.  They are in here every day that we have Question Time criticising Ministers for not spending money.</P>

      <P>Today again an offer made by the Labour Court rejects it.  Why does the Minister not do something to <Col N="3442" /> find a solution?  The aim of Question Time is criticism of Government finances.  Let us hope that we are going to have this campaign in the next three or four weeks and let us have some concrete suggestions.  I would like to think that I would always be practical enough to accept good ideas.  They have not come in this debate.  There is continual criticism. That is an option that the Opposition have but they must also be prepared to put on the record of the House how they would do what they think should be done.  It has not come from either of the parties, and that is the real crunch.  We are there to be judged by the electorate, and let us be judged.  If we get criticism for such an aspect of Government spending it is because we have not adopted the approach of our near neighbour.  Are the Opposition parties recommending savage cuts in public spending?  If so, let them spell out where these cuts should come.</P>
      <P>If they want to be factual about the situation they should also point out that during the previous Government period there was a lot of lag in public sector pay awards.  There were a lot of areas where issues were not faced up to.  Since then the Labour Court have made some very substantial awards to the public sector. Should they have been honoured?  The Labour Court considered they should be honoured.  The Government honoured those recommendations and have been criticised because of increases given to the public sector.  It is up to the general public to decide this issue.  The Opposition parties have been critical but they have not been practical about whether they would have granted those awards or whether they would have rejected them and cut back on public spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation with regard to public spending is not as ideal as one would wish.  We are a young, rapidly growing country with a number of major demands on Government spending.  My constituency is a typical example.  In the past four years a vast sum of money has been spent on the bricks and mortar that go into buildings which provide education. We have the choice of borrowing the money, spending it, investing it in <Col N="3443" /> their future or letting them go without education.  This approach can be criticised. The Government feel it is the right approach and we feel that when the opportunity comes for the electorate to decide they will endorse that.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael recently said they would not have a manifesto, that they would have a charter.  I heard some Members of the Fine Gael Party say that is what the Fine Gael Platform will be.  We are anxiously waiting to scrutinise their document to see how they will rectify all ills.  Their colleagues in the Labour Party have produced some documents but they have not put in figures.  They have stated that, politically, this is not practical, that they will have to wait until they assume office to decide how they will implement it. This is not factual policy making and I do not believe the electorate will accept it.</P>
    <P>We put figures on paper in the manifesto and we can be judged on whatever has or has not been achieved.  Let the Opposition parties produce their alternative blueprints and let the electorate decide.  I suggest that the Opposition in a political sense have criticised a lot but, in a practical sense they have not come up with any positive recommendations. I do not believe that is the proper approach.  I believe the public are demanding more from Dáil Éireann. They demand a co-operative effort from politicians.  They want them to be much more practical in their approach and not have this &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; situation with the Government and Opposition.</P>
    <P>I was not in the House during the last recession and I have no doubt that many of my colleagues may have been unfairly critical of the then Government.  I recommend, when the election campaign starts and when the Opposition parties put forward their documents, they should be clarified and discussed in a practical way rather than criticising and not providing an alternative.  That has been the trend in the debate so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that emerged from the last speaker's contribution was in his last remarks, when he clearly demonstrated that he has deeply <Col N="3444" /> held political convictions &mdash;&ldquo;We are all the same.  Why should there be an Opposition? Let us all be together.&rdquo;  How could we be together with that Government and that party after the damage they have caused the nation in every single sphere? That Government whom the Deputy supports, and will support again, are directly responsible for the situation in the country at the moment and the dismal future which our young people face unless the Government go out so that there can be a real change in policies.</P>
      <P>Somebody asked me why the Labour Party put down this motion.  We put it down for a number of reasons.  We wanted to remind the people of the economic programme on which the Government were elected and we wanted to point out not only what they stated categorically they could achieve but to compare what their claim was and what the misplaced confidence of the electorate resulted in.  I would like to say, first of all, with all sincerity, that the country now and for the last five or six weeks has been in a state of political and economic paralysis because the man whom some of the Deputy's colleagues &mdash; the Deputy was possibly among them &mdash; saw fit to elect as Taoiseach is so indecisive that he cannot make up his mind if he should come or if he should go.  We are ready, whether the Taoiseach goes now, next week or next April.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the right to decide within a five-year span when he should call an election but with that right he has a very grave responsibility.  I would like to remind him &mdash; he is not present as is usually the case when we are likely to be critical of him or his performance &mdash; that the Irish people also have rights.  They have the right to demand, particularly of their Taoiseach and their Government, that this situation be clarified now in the national interest.  The Taoiseach should either go to the country or make it clear that there will not be an election in the immediate future.  He owes that much to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The election atmosphere, which the Taoiseach and his colleagues have generated in the House and throughout the country since before the Easter recess, <Col N="3445" /> has undoubtedly done very considerable harm on the economic and political fronts.  These are very serious times. Surely the man who was elected Taoiseach must realise that and must also realise that he has this responsibility to the people he governs.  I believe that if there was a free vote tonight on this motion of no confidence in the Government, many of the Deputies who sit behind the Taoiseach would support this no confidence motion.  This indecision, this lacking the capacity to be able to make a firm decision, is not new.  It is on a major issue this time, the general election, but we have had clear indications of it before from the same man.  I listened to a former Minister for Finance, who has now gone to Brussels, stand up in the House on behalf of the Government and introduce a budget.  In that budget reference was made to the farmers' resource tax.  Exactly one week later the Taoiseach stood up here, made his contribution and backed away from his own budget.</P>
    <P>Another example was that the Taoiseach made it clear he was going to remove the Irish Ambassador in Washington from his post and send him somewhere else.  Two weeks after making clear his intention he went to Cork and confirmed the Ambassador in Washington. I did not agree with his original decision because in my opinion, that Ambassador is an excellent man.  This is a further proof that the Taoiseach is so indecisive.  He has done, is doing and will continue to do damage as long as he stays as Taoiseach because he is not capable of making a hard decision.  On a Labour Party motion on neutrality he decided to block a vote. The media put on the heat because of the despicable parliamentary tactics employed.  Next day we had the vote. That was done by the leader of Fianna Fáil, but unfortunately he is a leader who has been imposed on me and tens of thousands of other people too and we are paying a very heavy price for it.</P>
    <P>In electoral terms it is only important in this respect: the overriding consideration is not who gets back but the future of the people of this country, particularly the young people.  There is no way they have a future here as long as the Government <Col N="3446" /> continue with these policies.  Our only hope of getting out of this deep economic crisis is for this Government to be kicked out of office.  What is happening &mdash; and I predicted this nearly 12 months ago &mdash; is that major economic decisions are being avoided or decisions which are taken and implemented are not taken for economic reasons.  They are taken for party political electoral advantage with the result that we are sinking deeper and deeper into an economic mess.  A terrible price is being paid and will continue to be paid by the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>One has to wonder about parliamentary democracy.  Over the past two months since the Ard Fheis, when the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; business started again with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, telling of the £4,000 package for which we have yet to see legislation introduced, our friends in the media have been telling the people that these measures were being introduced for electoral reasons. They say the Taoiseach must go to the country soon because he cannot continue to be so irresponsible.  He can inflict damage on our economy, and he can do it blatantly for electoral advantage.  But in our democracy we are conditioned to such an extent that it is accepted and openly commented on by every newspaper, television and radio commentator in the country.  Surely we are more mature that than?  Surely the people realise that, irrespective of what party are in power, who the politician is or the political philosophy followed, a Government's first responsibility and only responsibility is the welfare of the people.  That simple fact has never penetrated the minds of the Fianna Fáil Government and it certainly has not come to their minds over the past four years.</P>
    <P>In 1977 we went before the Irish people. The Fianna Fáil manifesto told us that in 1981 23,000 people would be unemployed.  It is 126,000 now and it would be 9,000 higher if the figures had not been adjusted for the live register.  If the number of young people and women seeking jobs but not registered, because there is no financial benefit to them in registering, were taken into consideration, <Col N="3447" /> it would probably be another 25,000.  What are we getting from the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, from our friend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and every other Government spokesman?  We are told things are improving, that they are looking up.  The Minister for Finance said that in this House last night in his amendment to this motion.</P>
    <P>I ask any Member of this House to name one independent economic agency or one responsible independent economist who has not publicly and consistently said we are going through a deep economic crisis and that it is worsening? There must be some sense of responsibility on the Fianna Fáil benches.  There is in the Seanad.  Senator Whitaker does not agree with Fianna Fáil.  They do not like what he is saying, but it is true. Somebody associated with Fianna Fáil is telling the truth &mdash;one out of 150.</P>
    <P>This is not just an economic debate.  It is a plea.  Somebody in Fianna Fáil must have a sense of responsibility.  Somebody who has been in political life for a number of years must have some commitment to the Irish people rather than to his own political advantage.  If there is, for God's sake speak up.  You owe it to the people. We, as individuals, will not pay the price. We are told time and again that 51 per cent of our population are under 25 years of age: they are the people who will really pay the price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3448" /> They should not be asked to pay the price for Fianna Fáil's lack of commitment, lack of courage, lack of honesty and last but not least, lack of any policy whatsoever.  When members of the Government stand up here or go on radio or television to tell the people things are looking up they never acknowledge what everyone else in the country knows, that there is a most serious problem to be solved.  I think it is appropriate that Deputy Woods should be going around singing &ldquo;One Day at a Time&rdquo;, but it is a bad way to run a country &mdash; one day at a time, staggering from one 24-hour period to the next, wondering not how they will get the people out of the mess Fianna Fáil have got them into, but what will be their next political stroke.  That is what is occupying their minds.</P>
    <P>With all the defects our democratic system has, it has one advantage: whether we like it or not, at least every five years we must give an account of our stewardship to the people and it is in the people's interest.  The Taoiseach has a major responsibility: either he goes to the country immediately and accepts the verdict or makes it clear that there will not be an election in the immediate future.  The damage the Government are inflicting on Irish political and economic life is totally unjustified, unworthy of any Irish Government.</P>

      <P>This application was rejected in January 1980 because the type of windows <Col N="3344" /> used were not approved for grant purposes.  This applicant, together with a number of others who had fitted windows of the same type, contested that decision and they were informed that the matter would be reconsidered if the manufacturer could procure the assessment of the windows from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  This assessment has not yet come to hand but the institute have indicated that it will be made available to the Department shortly.
