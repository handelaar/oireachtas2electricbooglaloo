      <P>Yesterday I sought to raise on the adjournment the question of Ireland's neutrality and the possible discussion of a military alliance with another country.  I was informed by the Private Secretary to the Ceann Comhairle that he had ruled out the matter on grounds of national security.  I have examined Standing Orders and the Book of Precedents and I cannot find in either of these documents any justification for your ruling.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that it is not in order to raise this matter on the Order of Business.  However, as there appears to be some confusion in relation to my message, I wish to set the record straight.  In disallowing the Deputy's request I acted in accordance with normal and long-standing procedure and practice in this House.  When a Minister states in his reply to a question that he will not give further information the Chair cannot allow a Deputy to bring forward the matter on the adjournment <Col N="1668" /> as there will be no further elucidation. This has been the practice through the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Your message was conveyed not only to me individually but also to the Chief Whip of the Labour Party, Deputy Barry Desmond.  The message in both cases was the same, namely, that the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle was that I could not raise the matter on the adjournment as it was a matter of national security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the misunderstanding be the obvious public concern at the fact that there would appear to be some negotiations going on which would abandon Irish neutrality and which would commit us to a military alliance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no justification for disallowing it.  Can you cite anything in the Book of Precedents or Standing Orders to justify your ruling?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a discussion on this matter.  First of all, these decisions are always given outside the House and would not be in the rulings of the Chair unless challenged in the House.  I repeat that this ruling has been followed through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you seriously telling me, in a situation where there is considerable evidence that this country's neutrality is to be abandoned by the present Taoiseach, possibly in a military alliance with Great Britain, that we may not discuss the matter in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally out of order.  I have already explained to the Deputy why his question was not in <Col N="1669" /> order, although, strictly speaking, I should not have allowed any discussion at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, you have ruled that where a Minister refuses to answer a question it is out of order to seek to have the matter debated on the adjournment.  I should like to know the precedent you cite for this because it is my recollection that virtually all adjournment debates are precisely to seek additional information where a Minister has refused information.  As the very purpose of an adjournment debate is to do this, how can you conceivably rule that an adjournment debate cannot be held for that purpose?  That ruling stands all the procedures of this House on their head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very well aware of the fact that, if a Minister states he cannot or will not disclose further information, the matter cannot be allowed.  This has been the procedure and practice in this House through the years.  In one of the cases where this ruling appears to me to have been challenged the ruling of the Chair was that a matter is raised for further elucidation and to get further information from the Minister and, if the Minister states that he cannot or will not disclose further information, the matter cannot be allowed.  The ruling by the Chair which the Deputy has mentioned is that questions to which Ministers have refused to reply are not suitable matters to be raised.  This is a previous ruling of the Chair.</P>

I have given my reasons publicly, which is not normally done and which will not be a precedent so far as I am concerned, as to why I refused to allow Deputy Cluskey's request in respect of the adjournment debate last night.  I am dealing with this matter in the manner which has been accepted in this House through the years and I have no doubt that Ministers and Deputies are well aware of this fact.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I understand that if a Minister or Taoiseach refuses to answer a question or to give further information that is the end of it and the matter cannot be raised on the adjournment.  That does not make sense, as the point of Question Time is to get information from a Minister and the point of raising a matter on the adjournment is to get information which the Minister refused to give or to clarify the position arising from the Minister giving insufficient information.  If all a Minister has to do is to refuse to give any further information that means the end of Question Time and the end of the adjournment procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned yesterday I was about to refer to tourism.  There is great potential for the tourist trade in Limerick but unfortunately 1980 was our worst year for a long time.  Will the Government promote farm guesthouses, a great attraction to the tourist and the best value for money? To facilitate that we must develop suitable amenities such as boating, fishing, and pony-trekking.</P>
      <P>Last year we were the only country who suffered a reduction in income from tourism.  Tourism should not be considered a direct source of revenue but as a means for generating wealth.</P>
      <P>In relation to the land registry there is an immediate need for decentralisation of that service.  All public representatives must be aware of the delays caused to rural people especially when building houses.  An application for land registration could take from three months to a year-and-a-half to be processed and during that time the builder is probably on a bridging loan for about £24,000.  This is a great source of hardship.  It would not be unreasonable for the Government to provide land registry facilities throughout the country.  To date no Government have operated such a system and I do not see any reason why they should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also problems in relation to the health services.  Although a lot of money is being poured into the health service it is grossly unsatisfactory especially <Col N="1673" /> for those depending on the medical card.  According to the 1970 Health Act a doctor can have 2,000 names on his panel.  How could any doctor cater satisfactorily for 2,000 patients?  The same situation occurs in the hospitals.  As far as our regional hospital is concerned they are understaffed.  With so much unemployment why can we not have more doctors?  We could bring them back from England where the best of our doctors have gone.  We also need money to build hospitals in the mid-western region because the regional hospital is so overloaded that patients are in the corridors. It is a disgrace and it is humiliating for patients to be in the corridor when people pass by to visit their friends.  It is also embarrassing for the visitors.  Because money for the health services in the mid-west are not adequate, community care services will be out of money by next August and what will happen then?  The budget will expire as far as the mid-west is concerned next September.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment is another Department which gives cause for concern.  Up to recently there were many group water and sewerage schemes.  Less than three years ago a group contribution would be not more than £70 but participants in a group scheme are now expected to make a contribution of £600.  This has meant that many schemes have had to be abandoned. The Department should make a greater contribution.  People are anxious to make this scheme work but they can only go so far and a man in a cottage with three or four children is not in a position to pay £500 or £600.  This has occurred because of inflation and the people are no longer in a position to help the county council and the Department.  A few years ago many people who would normally have qualified to get water from the county council were good enough to participate in the group and they would borrow the £50 or £60 required and pay it back over a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>In relation to roads I must remind the Minister of the serious situation in County Limerick.  The only roads being looked after are the roads being improved with the EEC grants.  We have <Col N="1674" /> no roads capable of standing up to the traffic in the rural areas where bulk tankers and heavy machinery are causing dangerous potholes.  I have always agreed that the breathaliser was a very good idea and that it saved many lives but if the roads in my county deteriorate further they will be as dangerous to the public as is the man who is drunk behind the wheel.  The Minister should realise that the Limerick county roads have never been as bad as they are now.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the social welfare increases in the budget but increases of 20 per cent or 25 per cent are very little use today if every day we have price increases.  Nearly every shop in a small town or village has different prices.  The unfortunate person in receipt of an old age pension, a widows' pension or children's allowances cannot cope with the increase in the cost of living.  If overtime was cut out for 12 months and manual workers were asked to live on a basic rate of £70 to £90 there would be strikes all over the country because they would not be able to support their families.  Apparently old age pensioners are not supposed to eat.  I am not charging the Government with not giving enough but their entire approach to social welfare is wrong. Social welfare recipients are being treated as under-privileged people.  I appeal to any Government who come into power to review the whole structure of social welfare.  I believe that were it not for the goodness of the sons and daughters and friends of old age pensioners many of them would be hungry.  The relations of those people, because of the high cost of living, are barely able to support themselves and are not able to assist their fathers, mothers, fathers-in-law or mothers-in-law.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a social welfare recipient is asked to forward his social welfare book to head office and it may not be returned for ten weeks.  When that person approaches a public representative he tries to ring the Department to satisfy the poor person.  It is almost impossible to get through to the Department of Social Welfare.  There is an engaged tone all the time.  I appeal to the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1675" /> to give an extra few lines to the Department. A public representative who rings the Department is doing this because he is under pressure from people who urgently need money.  I cannot understand why the employment office in Limerick, for instance, could not deal with such claims and be able to pay out the money when it is certified that there is a delay in Dublin.  This would save a lot of the time of public representatives and would eliminate the hardship of the unfortunate recipient who is badly in need of money.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about law and order, which is a very serious matter at the moment.  The Minister for Justice, when he was in Opposition, said in the Dáil at column 2102, Volume 291, of the Official Report for 30 June 1976:</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Minister that there is now wholesale and general acceptance of the fact that the Government have failed very badly to protect people and their property.  The Minister for Justice, and the Government, stand accused, and rightly so, of gross negligence and total failure in the maintenance of law and order throughout the State.  It is now a fact that armed gangs of hooligans can at will successfully hold up or rob banks, post offices, shops or trains.  Instead of making crime more difficult for these people, unfortunately, the situation is the reverse.</P>
    <P>That was a statement made by the present Minister for Justice in 1976.  He has been Minister for Justice for the past four years.  Can anybody deny that the position has deteriorated?  Not only do we hold the record for the number of bank robberies but we also hold the record for the amount of loot which is taken.  About one-and-a-half miles from the Minister's home approximately £1 million was taken but the culprit was never traced.  Is the Minister guilty or are the Government guilty, as the present Minister for Justice said in 1976?  I would like to pay a tribute to the Garda Síochána, who are doing a wonderful job, and their lives are very often in danger.  It is only a short time <Col N="1676" /> ago that three outstanding officers were murdered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but he is going very far away from the budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána are doing a wonderful job but I believe they are the most underpaid people in the State.  If one talks to a garda in any rural barracks about his income one will find that a man working in any industry has a larger income than his.  Are we using the Garda Síochána to the best possible extent?  I have always been a great believer in the man on the beat and having the barracks in the little village.  It means great security to the residents of that village.  I hope I will see the man back on the beat again.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk from the Government over the past few years about the world crisis.  We are all asked to tighten our belts, to come together and realise there is a world recession.  Everybody knows that.  We on this side of the House are conscious of the fact that it is not possible for any country to live in isolation during the course of a world recession.  Were the Fianna Fail Party as constructive in 1975?  Every time a Coalition Government Minister mentioned a recession there were sneers and jibes. They said the problems were not caused by the world-wide recession but by a weak and divided Government.  Today they have a majority of 20 and prices are increasing continuously.  Nothing is being done about inflation.  They keep on borrowing with no thought of tomorrow.  I remember being at a church gate in Limerick in 1977 and I heard a man who is in this House saying: &ldquo;We know where the Arabs are now.&rdquo;  I have no trouble in discovering where the Arabs are now.  If I were to be as destructive as the Fianna Fáil Party were then, I would say there are 84 Arabs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government need a rest.  They should go to the country.  The position is deteriorating.  I do not put all the blame on the Taoiseach.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, went on a spending spree <Col N="1677" /> in 1977.  Deputy O'Donoghue also went on a spending spree.  People believed that he was a type of faith healer and that everything he did would turn out right. We are now in the worst position we have ever been in since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first Deputy on the Opposition side to mention the recession was Deputy O'Brien.  Listening to and reading the Opposition speeches on the budget, one is struck by the thought that most of them have forgotten the fact that there is a severe international recession and that Ireland as a very small nation depending to a great extent on external trade has suffered severely because of that recession. It was nice to hear Deputy O'Brien mentioning that there is a recession. While his contribution was delivered with sincerity it shows the malaise of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In the short time during which he spoke this morning Deputy O'Brien suggested that Limerick should have better roads, new hospitals, extra doctors, a Government office where land could be registered. While admitting that the social welfare concessions in the budget were reasonable, he felt they were not good enough.  He felt there should be extra pay for the Garda and quite a number of other individuals.  He criticised the Government for borrowing too much, as he said.</P>
      <P>Reading the speeches made in the budget debate by the Opposition spokesmen one could be forgiven for wondering if they are living in Disneyland.  They have succeeded in pushing the international recession into the back of their minds.  They spoke as if the world economy was as buoyant as it was in 1977-78. They forgot the truly enormous impact oil prices have made on the fortunes and economies of some of the world's strongest countries.  They have wrapped themselves in a cocoon of make-believe and self-delusion, forgetting the realities of life and allowing fantasy to replace thought and planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to  with some of the <Col N="1678" /> comments made by Deputy Bruton and Deputy FitzGerald.  The main theme of the Fine Gael speeches was to suggest (1) the Government have not spent enough; (2) the Government have spent so much that they have to borrow excessively; and (3) the figures presented in the budget were fiddled.  In their speeches they were all things to all men.  On the one hand they were critical of Government expenditure and, on the other hand, they were loud in their demands for more expenditure.</P>
    <P>Most Opposition Deputies who have spoken so far expressed the view that sufficient funds have not been provided for the various Government Departments. Deputy Bruton said the budget is bad for employment and does nothing for agriculture.  He and Deputy FitzGerald said there is nothing at all in the budget for the PAYE taxpayer.  Deputy Bruton said that Government strategy &ldquo;in every measure it set itself has been a complete and abject failure&rdquo;.  He was highly critical of pay in the public service.  This theme was carried on by Deputy FitzGerald in his budget contribution the next day.</P>
    <P>One can find excuses for Deputy Bruton and sympathise with the position in which he found himself having been promoted only recently to the position of spokesman on Finance.  It is hard to accept that the speech made by Deputy FitzGerald was a serious one having regard to his reputation as an economist. His comments were selective, inaccurate and contradictory.  For example, he suggested that this budget does nothing for married couples without children in the £3,000 to £6,000 income bracket.  This is a grossly inaccurate and misleading statement. It is not true and it backs up his own admission that he did not have time to do the calculations.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might set the record straight on that point.  Married couples whose income does not exceed £4,000 are being completely exempted from income tax with marginal relief over that figure.  A married couple without children, where the wife is not earning, will pay £300 tax on an income of £4,500.  This represents a considerable saving, contrary to what Deputy FitzGerald said.  It is approximately <Col N="1679" /> a reduction in tax of more than 35 per cent as compared to 1980-81 and this can hardly be described as small and inconsequential.  Neither can I accept the claim of the Leader of the Opposition in this context that the 1980 budget left taxpayers with under £10,000 income worse off.  That claim is wrong, based on inaccurate measures of the cost of living effect of the budget and the impact of the indirect tax changes on lower income households.</P>
    <P>The 1980 budget had substantial tax gains of greater or lesser magnitude for virtually all groups.  Exemption limits were introduced for those on low incomes.  Income splitting was introduced for all married couples.  Reference by Deputy FitzGerald to the large tax gains accruing to a man with £50,000 a year is an implied criticism based on an extreme example of the tax redistribution inherent in income splitting and must be seen as a criticism of the practicalities of income splitting.  Can one be for the principle but against the central and inevitable consequence?</P>
    <P>The introduction of income splitting was a major improvement for married couples and in addition the expansion of the rate bands this year and last year has given considerable relief to many taxpayers. Over the past two years the basic allowances granted to PAYE taxpayers has been increased by over 53 per cent for single persons and by about 25 per cent for married persons.  The income tax concessions in the budget &mdash; most of these will go to the PAYE taxpayer &mdash; will cost more than £60 million this year and more than £90 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Great emphisis has been placed by the main Opposition spokesmen on what has been described by them as a penal blow to business.  The only evidence they have produced in support of this accusation is that businessmen must pay one-and-a-half years tax this year in a single year.  All that is in question is a bringing forward of the tax payment date for companies who have enjoyed a privileged position because of the exceptionally lengthy period allowed to them up to now for payment.  There is no question of an <Col N="1680" /> increase in the amount of tax payable nor in the rate of tax.  If a PAYE taxpayer must meet his obligation immediately and payment dates are brought forward for schedule D taxpayers generally, surely it is only appropriate that companies should be required to pay tax within a reasonable period.  At most the advancement of the payment date will involve businesses in a financing cost of approximately £3 million on which interist relief can be claimed.  The corporation tax burden on manufacturing is particularly light so that this sector is likely to be the least affected by the change.  The Opposition, by their stance on this issue, pay lip service to the claims that they are looking for equality in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>It is odd that while, on the one hand, the Opposition have expressed concern for business there is criticism that the 100 per cent allowance in respect of expenditure for moderate cost rented accommodation is unduly generous.  Again this is a contradiction in terms.  There is a serious shortage of rented accommodation, particularly in major centres of population. A substantial allowance is called for in order to provide the necessary boost to meet present needs.  The Government will monitor the operation of the scheme and review it at the end of three years as indicated in the budget speech.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 50 per cent initial allowance to lessors leasing to the IDA for sub-letting to industrial users will encourage private investment in advance factories outside of Cork and Dublin. The efforts of the IDA to date to provide such investment on the basis of the existing arrangements have been hampered by the reduced security of private investment in factory buildings outside of our two major cities due to the absence of an active market in industrial property.  I am sure the scheme will lead to the provision of advance factories and buildings outside of major centres and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald claimed that privatisation would be more expensive than borrowing.  As the instruments to be used in the privatisation funding are not yet <Col N="1681" /> finalised and would probably be of a different nature from fixed interest securities it is premature to speculate on costings. The Government are determined that the terms of privatisation will represent reasonable value for the State.  The claim that on a full year basis the current budget deficit would be £651 million, bringing it to a higher level of GNP than the 1980 level, is another example of juggling and selectivity engaged in by the Opposition because even they must be aware that each year's budget has its own carry-over effect into the following year. Some years this carry-over will contribute to increasing the deficit and in other years to reducing it.  A multiplicity of other factors such as tax buoyancy, unemployment and price trends will affect the opening budget position for 1982.  The figures included in the recent budget only relate to 1981 as is the normal practice. It is premature to project the 1982 budget figures.  The Government will have to review the current deficit position for 1982 when planning the 1982 budget and will take the appropriate steps at that stage to continue their policy of reducing the current deficit.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputies Bruton, FitzGerald and others that the expenditure estimates and provisions in the Estimates volume are inadequate and that the outturn will far exceed the provisions. They pointed to what they termed a number of absurdities in the Estimates volume.  Inquiry about the basis for the figures would have shown the reduction in the postal services provision in the Department's Votes which occurs in 1981, to be due to the fact that most Departments have credits for previous years due to them from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  These credits arise mainly because of the effect of the postal dispute in 1979 when the services were curtailed by the estimated amounts and these were paid for accounting reasons.  It was not possible to take account of these credits in 1980.</P>
    <P>In particular there is a reduction of almost £1.6 million in the estimated cost of postage by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners due to credits in previous <Col N="1682" /> years and there are also reductions in the estimated costs of other services provided by the Post Office which are due to credits. The estimate for 1981 for telephones shows an increase over 1980 to take account of increased telephone charges. The reduced provision for Army and Navy stores arises from exceptional or non-recurring expenditure in 1980 &mdash; for example, the £3.4 million on aircraft, £6.3 million on final deliveries of fishery patrol vessels and advance payments on new ships.  No comparable expenditure is anticipated in 1981.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary increases to which Deputy FitzGerald referred in appropriations-in-aid can also be easily explained.  In the main these extra receipts will come from abroad, from the EEC, including recoupment in respect of road and sanitary services projects being undertaken under the FEOGA aid scheme for the west, from the United Nations in respect of our involvement with UNIFIL and from the United Kingdom in respect of the special premium on our exports of beef there.  Far from being increased charges adding to the cost of living, as alleged by Deputies, these are largely extra receipts emanating from outside the country.  These examples should be adequate to illustrate the invalidity of the comments made by Deputy FitzGerald in this area and I shall not take up the time of the House dealing with all of the items he mentioned.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that reference to the increase in official external reserves in 1980 demonstrated that the Government were trying to hide the fact that we have a large balance of payments deficit.  The increase in reserves is a fact and there is no reason that the Government should not acknowledge the fact.  It indicates that the balance of payments deficit was financed and that reserves were restored to something better than their 1979 total in monetary terms.  In terms of import cover the end-of-year position was approximately three months, better than the 2.4 months cover at the end of 1979. The Government recognise that balance of payments deficits on the scale experienced in the past two years are too high. The policies enunciated in the budget <Col N="1683" /> statement of reducing and gradually eliminating the Exchequer deficit on current account and re-orientating capital expenditure are designed to contribute to a major improvement in our external balance over a period of years.  While Deputy FitzGerald was correct in stating that the 1980 budget put up the CPI by 3.8 per cent, this did not show in the quarterly CPI figures until mid-May and the average year-on-year inflation effect was 2.9 per cent only.  It is this average year-on-year effect that is referred to in the economic background to the budget.</P>
    <P>I might deal with another allegation made by Deputy FitzGerald, that is, that the employment figures mentioned in the economic background to the budget were phoney.  This is totally incorrect.  For example, the Deputy quoted a figure of 10,000 as being the increase in the labour force between April 1980 and April 1981. It is difficult to monitor labour force changes because of the migration and participation rate factors but, on the basis of the latest CSO estimates, it is clear that increases in the labour force in recent years have been well over 10,000.  For example, between April 1979 and April 1980 the CSO estimate this increase to have been 18,000.  As to the contention made that services employment declined during 1980, the CSO estimate that services employment increased by 14,000 between April 1979 and April 1980 and by 19,000 on average during the previous two years.  Therefore it is reasonable to assume that services employment increased during 1980 as a whole in the light of that trend.</P>
    <P>Deputies FitzGerald and Bruton were very taken up with the Taoiseach's speech in Ennis in August last.  They implied that the Taoiseach gave a misleading figure to the public in that speech. They should acknowledge that five months have passed since that speech was made and that much has changed in the intervening period.  The Taoiseach's reference to the balance of payments situation as having been stabilised was mentioned. The deficit is likely to have been approximately the same as in 1979.  It is true that a change in pattern was seen <Col N="1684" /> towards the end of the year which caused the estimates of the deficit to be revised upwards by all commentators but this was due largely to substantial increases in the importation of capital goods, above all, raw materials, both indicative of economic recovery.  May I say that the balance of payments deficit still dropped as a percentage of GNP from 10 per cent in 1979 to 9 per cent in 1980.  I might mention also that Ireland had the largest export growth in the EEC, 6 per cent as compared with an average of 3.5 per cent. The Taoiseach's statement in August that the 1980 budget targets were being adhered to generally was correct at that time.  Subsequently it became clear that the recession was continuing and having an even greater impact on our economy than anticipated.  Accordingly the Government decided to relax the tight limits on spending so as to sustain the momentum of the economy and provide employment. A large part of the additional expenditure was directed to the public capital programme.  Overall the bulk of the additional expenditure, capital and current, constituted deliberate and considered departures from budgetary policy designed to meet the needs of the emerging economic situation.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments made, particularly by Deputy FitzGerald, were selective. Apparently he by-passed the social welfare provisions, making no comment on them at all.  One of the principal objectives of this budget is to improve the living standards of the less-well-off members of our society and there has been almost universal approval of the social welfare increases provided for in the budget.  Even the Opposition have acknowledged that the Government have fulfilled their commitment to keeping social welfare payments in line with the increase in the cost of living.  The increases provided for in the budget bring about a real improvement in the living standards of the less-well-off in our community. It is recognised and appreciated by most that people on long-term payments, those on pensions, widows pensions, invalidity pensions and so on require special attention in the social welfare context.  With this in mind the Government <Col N="1685" /> have once again given an increase of 25 per cent to people receiving those benefits.  Therefore, in real terms, these people have gained.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare has dealt fully with these provisions and, as most Deputies in the House have acknowledged and welcomed them, I shall not pursue this matter any further.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest criticisms made by Deputies FitzGerald and Bruton was that the budget was deficient in that it did not provide adequate improvements for certain sections of the community, such as farmers, PAYE taxpayers and the business community.  No effort has been made to explain how the additional resources might be found to provide for greater improvements.  On the contrary, the case has been made that there will in fact be a shortage of resources to match the commitment given in the budget and that the borrowing provisions will be exceeded.  It would be useful to know where additional funds to match the greater concessions will come from if we are not, on the one hand, to resort to further borrowing and if, on the other hand, in keeping with the concern of the Opposition, we do not want to raise the cost of living index by further increases in direct taxation.  What Aladdin's lamp will Fine Gael or the other members of the Opposition rub?  What will they summon up to reconcile the unreconcilable?</P>
    <P>I listened for a while to Deputy Bermingham speaking on Tuesday.  He made certain suggestions.  He admitted, however, that these suggestions would cost money.  One cannot give something without paying for it either by taxation or borrowing.  He was honest in stating that he did not know where the money would come from.  The Fine Gael spokesmen, have, on the other hand, glibly criticised the alleged shortfalls without even considering where the extra finance would come from.  Perhaps they are still following the deliberate leak that came some years ago, the suggestion of the total abolition of income tax and its replacement by a purchase tax in some form or other.  If so, perhaps they would tell us the details and let the people judge what form of taxation they feel is best.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> I come now to the criticism that has been made of the growth of the nonindustrial civil service.  The Government are also anxious to ensure that the State and the taxpayer get value for money. The Minister stated in introducing the budget:</P>
    <P>The sheer size of the public sector and the amount of finance required to sustain it suggest that there is considerable opportunity for saving by rationalising its programmes, administrative machinery and structures, staffing and systems.  An interdepartmental task force is being established to make a critical appraisal of the scope for such action and to draw up proposals, as a matter of urgency, to achieve savings this year of at least £25 million on the Estimates figures.  On the basis that these savings will be identified and implemented, I am making a deduction of £25 million from the budget expenditure.</P>
    <P>Between 1971 and 1979 the census showed that the population grew from 2.978 million to 3.368 million, an increase of 13 per cent.  Any increased population requires an increase in the numbers of people needed to administer the public service, particularly in the case of personal type services, even if there is no increase in the level of service provided. The greater part of the increase between 1970 and 1980, however, is accounted for by new services and increases in the level of existing services.</P>
    <P>In telecommunications, while arrangements are being made to establish the new telecommunications board, the aim of bringing our services up to the European level is being vigorously pursued and new installations last year were at a record level.  This could not have been done without additional trained staff and the policy of recruiting and training extra technical staff is now beginning to pay off.  In the area of social welfare there are numerous improvements and innovations in benefit schemes.  But the major innovation with substantial staffing consequences was the move to payment of social welfare benefits on a fully pay-related basis.  At the same time the volume <Col N="1687" /> of employment-related legislation in the decade has required a consequential increase in staff in the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>New schemes of aid to agriculture required additional staff and of course our entry to the European Economic Community, while producing substantial benefits, also meant that extra staff had to be employed.  It may be of some interest to note that the direct increase in numbers in EEC work was about 1,400, of whom 700 were in the Department of Agriculture and about 200 and 150 in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  The Department of Foreign Affairs had also to expand to meet EEC needs and representations abroad generally and these developments were encouraged by all recent administrations.</P>
    <P>Other services are similarly expanding. The Department of the Environment grew to meet housing, environmental and infrastructural needs.  Industrial and commercial development and consumer affairs required more staff in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the new Department of Energy was created to meet the current difficulties. The Department of Justice grew to deal with law reform, to provide a welfare service and, through the Land Registry, to provide improvement in registration of title and facilities for the purchase of ground rents.  The Ordnance Survey section has been strengthened to map the whole country.  Education and youth and sports services have been expanded.  It is unfortunate that the security situation caused a large increase in numbers not only in the security services but also in administration in the Departments of Justice and Defence.  The relative increase in the prison service was over 300 per cent.  But all will agree that there is no escaping the need for this increase albeit the fact that it was mentioned in a different way by Deputy O'Brien some time ago.</P>
    <P>The increase in the civil service represents a general increase in standards of service in this community.  I understand <Col N="1688" /> the EEC have been doing some work on social indicators.  While conclusions have not yet emerged I have no doubt that the improvement in services that I have mentioned will be substantial on any scale that might be devised to measure social progress.</P>
    <P>Support services for all these programmes also require more staff.  Computerisation is one such service where the greatest increase in staff has been in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  If we are to have an expansion of activity in the public service it is going to cost money and we must have more staff to collect the increased revenue required for the various services including those which many Opposition spokesmen, even since the budget debate, have been looking for.</P>
    <P>Again, while Deputies Bruton and FitzGerald have been very forthright in their criticism of the special increases which have been made, one must treat this criticism with a certain cynicism and remind them that during the negotiations with the teachers, nurses and other groups they led the Opposition clamour for what they at the time called just claims, even to organising a debate on health matters in this House to coincide with the nurses' march to Leinster House.  Will they now renege on the findings and recommendations of the various commissions set up to investigate claims or are they now saying that conciliation and arbitration findings should be ignored?  I feel that the concern now shown about the cost of special increases is in sharp contrast to the tones adopted by Opposition spokesmen, particularly Fine Gael speakers, in the debate I referred to.  These same people who now complain about the cost of these claims were very vociferous in their comments and requests and indeed demands for extra and special payments for quite a number of bodies.</P>
    <P>Having said that I come to the question of the Exchequer pay bill, that is the pay of civil servants, teachers, gardaí, the Defence Forces and the employees in the health areas, together with amounts included in subventions to certain State bodies and the universities.  This year's <Col N="1689" /> budget provision is £1,860 million, an increase of 19.6 per cent over last year's outturn which, in turn, was up 34 per cent on 1979.  The size of the increase and the overall cost of the Exchequer pay bill are causes of very great concern to the Government. This is particularly so just now when we are grappling with the problems of recession, high inflation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it is all the more disturbing to observe that the level and number of claims which are being submitted by unions show little sign that those concerned appreciate the need for the most rigorous restraint if the risk of major danger to the economy and to the Government's finances is to be avoided. Indeed settlement of some claims seems merely to spark off a series of new claims from other grades or categories which leads to a massive ultimate increase in costs.  All of these groups have received in full the general increases under the national pay agreements and almost all of them have already received at least one special increase over the past two years or so.  Bearing in mind the element of security enjoyed by public sector workers by comparison with other employees it is not unreasonable for the taxpayer, and the Government on his behalf, to question seriously the extent and timing of these claims.  At a time when so many workers in the private sector are faced with a loss of employment and radical cuts in income and living standards, it is reasonable to ask public sector workers to accept in the national interest the over-riding need for restraining their pay demands and for tempering their expectations by reference to the realities of the economic situation.  Unless they do so taxation must be increased and/or services reduced.</P>
    <P>In case it is felt that I am overemphasising this matter, I would draw Members' attention to the fact that the Minister for Finance, in his budget speech, revealed that the cost to the Exchequer, over the past two years, of special increases exceeded the cost of the basic increases under the agreements.  This fact raises serious questions for the whole future of national pay agreements &mdash; questions <Col N="1690" /> which all concerned should consider carefully and urgently.  It is obviously impossible to justify a situation in which the cost of what should, by definition, be exceptional increases exceeds the cost of the basic increases under the agreements. When the time comes to review arrangements at national level, this will clearly be a key issue to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the need to moderate the rate of growth of the Exchequer pay bill is the need to maintain real industrial peace.  Essentially this means a willingness by all concerned to implement fully the peace provisions of the national understanding and to make proper use of existing machinery, such as the Labour Court or agreed domestic procedures, to settle disputes.  While neither employers nor workers can escape responsibility for ensuring industrial peace, a particularly heavy responsibility must, in the nature of things, rest on union leaders to be seen to exercise effective leadership in this area and on employers to react quickly and urgently to what are legitimate grievances.</P>
    <P>There have been Opposition accusations that the budget has done nothing for employment or to promote employment. The Government's investment plan will, it is estimated, result in higher direct employment of about 10,000 most of which will be in building and construction. The indirect employment created will be substantial also and in the longer term, the improvements in our basic infrastructure which will result from this plan will make a significant contribution to increasing the number of productive jobs in manufacturing and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The investment plan is, of course, complemented by the Government's programme for the decentralisation of Government offices to 12 provincial centres with a broad geographical spread.  This programme &mdash; involving as it does the relocation of over 3,000 jobs and a large scale investment in office accommodation &mdash; will have a significant effect in the short-term on employment in the building and ancillary industries.  In the longer term it will contribute to a more balanced development of the economy on a regional basis.  I am hopeful that the Government's <Col N="1691" /> lead in locating service-type employment outside Dublin will be taken up by employers generally.  Experience has shown that organisations can operate efficiently and effectively in regional centres and the attraction that Dublin hitherto had for service-type organisations will diminish as our plans for improving the infrastructural and telecommunications systems yield fruit.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that very considerable progress is being made with the decentralisation programme.  A multi-discipline team set up by the Office of Public Works to look after site acquisition, planning and design went into action immediately after the programme was announced.  I am very pleased with the progress they have made so far and I am confident that the target set by the Government of getting actual construction underway as soon as possible during 1981 will be met.  Preliminary discussions have been held with the staff interests and on-going consultations on matters of concern to them will be held as the programme progresses.  Their support and co-operation in this major programme is to be welcomed.  I thank them sincerely for it and look forward to this continuing.</P>
    <P>Sites have been inspected in all the locations and negotiations are in progress for site acquisitions.  I wish to acknowledge the great help being given to the Office of Public Works by local authorities and other bodies.</P>
    <P>I was in the House when Deputy Boland spoke.  He suggested that the Government were yielding to the politics of pressure.  The party of which he is a member have a long history and a deep knowledge of how to use the politics of pressure and their recent attempts to obtain signatures from farmers is a supreme example of inviting the politics of pressure.</P>
    <P>Because the Minister for Agriculture will deal with the provisions and aids in the budget for agriculture later, I will not detain the House by referring to them in detail.  It was claimed that little attention was paid to farmers in this budget.  The provision of £35 million in aid in the budget cannot be viewed in isolation.  It <Col N="1692" /> must be taken as the latest in a series of measures which commenced last year to help farmers cope with their difficulties. Last year a substantial amount of supplementary assistance was made available to the farming community from the national Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Forty million pounds was provided in 1980 in supplementary grants.  Cattle and beef cow grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme were doubled.  An extra £28 million in grant moneys under the farm modernisation scheme was paid to farmers bringing the total paid in the year to just £60 million &mdash; nearly twice the amount paid in the previous year.  The second moiety of rates for farmers in the £40-60 RV bracket was waived completely, while local authorities were instructed to adopt an understanding attitude in relation to all other farmers who were having temporary problems with rates payments in 1980.  The Government also authorised borrowing abroad by the ACC and the associated Banks totalling £100 million for on-lending to farmers at concessionary rates, for which the exchange rate guarantee element was borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance said in the course of his budget statement, the Government are hopeful that the position of farmers will be further improved as a consequence of the negotiations under way at present with the EEC.</P>
    <P>Any Government in a budget must balance the expectations of many different interests and groups with the reality of finding and providing the finance for these provisions.  Taking the economic realities here, and throughout the world, into consideration the Minister, and the Government have achieved in the budget a fair balance between the need and expectations of our people, between the need to stimulate the economy, maintain and provide and promote employment, provide for the less well-off and reduce the balance of payments deficit.  This will come to be recognised in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been a Member of this House for long but it seems that this kind of debate which we are having has a certain ritual quality about it that <Col N="1693" /> will not do anything to inform public opinion as to the true nature and extent of our economic crisis.  It will not do anything to inform this side of the House as to the Government's intentions in relation to any of the measures they propose to introduce on foot of the budget. We have the ritual of various Ministers and Ministers of State coming here &mdash; I do not mean any disrespect to the individuals who deliver their prepared speeches &mdash; making contributions with all the skill and aplomb of paid public relations experts on behalf of their various Departments.  There is not a budget debate going on here and we have not had one.  I do not believe that the way we structured the Oireachtas in 1981 enables us to conduct such a debate.  We can hurl speeches at each other but they will be manifestly unsuccessful in creating one extra job with the exception of leading to some overtime in the operation of the printing presses of the national newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that a Government with such a secure majority as the present Fianna Fáil conservative one have, a party who came to office with a commitment to reform the public service and public procedures, would attempt to reform this charade and replace it with a fully-fledged Oireachtas committee on economics.  Such a committee would enable us to talk to &mdash; I do not mean any disrespect to the public relations representatives of the various Departments &mdash; the senior civil servants who write the speeches and put the words in the mouths of the various Ministers who hold their cars so as to ensure that they hold their seats or secure their running mates.  I do not mean to make a personal insulting remark but the same logic of politics would dictate that kind of action if the parties of this side of the House found themselves on the Government side after the palace revolution that went on in December 1979.  That is the nature of politics here as of now.  Above everything else, as the public pay sector shows, it is a very expensive one because the cost of keeping a marginal seat in the hands of a government party is something in the region of £250,000.  If the public think <Col N="1694" /> they are getting good value for the hind tit Deputy of a constituency to be reelected they should throw in the cost of a regional airport, the cost of a new bridge or something else.  That is the nature of what we are talking about and, without being snide, it is the kind of politics we have allowed to take place over what we should be discussing.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, may follow and deliver a prepared speech, like the last speaker, but the background to the discussion is contained in the document which deals with the economic background to the budget of 1981.  We have had three years of this dramatic Government spending taxpayers money, assuring us that with their target and their &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; employment would be up and inflation would be down and the underlying words used throughout the document are &ldquo;decline&rdquo; and &ldquo;fell&rdquo;.  In relation to investment those words are repeated throughout the entire text.  The document states that investment declined by 9 per cent in volume in 1981.  Investment in machinery and equipment fell by 10 per cent in volume. The value of work in progress declined. Out of State tourism fell by 4 per cent and there was a decline in real terms in tourism of almost 3 per cent.  Imports fell in volume by about 5½ per cent, largely in the area of producer-capital goods which are related to end-production here. Trade deterioration was down by 7 per cent.  Our currency, against our major trading partners, as distinct from the rise of sterling, declined by 11 per cent in value over the year.  Output in manufacturing industry is expected in 1981 to show a decline.</P>
    <P>Those statements were taken from a Government publication.  If it was produced by any other political party it would be dismissed by the same public relations personnel in the Taoiseach's office &mdash; whose number has been increased by 100 per cent without any increase in function, according to himself &mdash; as propaganda.  It is not propaganda; it is their own information.  The total employment increase for last year was 18,000 and God knows what the cost per <Col N="1695" /> job was.  In a debate on the budget in which each Member tends to argue a sectional interest, whether it is a constituency or a political point of view, is this the sort of way the country which now pays more than £3,000 million for the privilege of having a budget, can look at the money and the resources we have and attempt to match them against our needs before proceeding to plan rationally and invest hopefully to reap the harvest of that decision in the form of secure jobs? I do not think it is.  I do not have the experience that other Members have but it seems that that kind of activity will not produce any significant answer but yet we have a ritual here that the debate will go on for three or four more weeks.</P>
    <P>We start from a position after three-and-a-half years of being governed by the most electorally successful Government we have ever seen of the economy being in worse shape than when they received it.  The prospects for the economy are worse than at any time since 1957.  The bleating reply from the Fianna Fáil benches, who discover economic recessions when in office but never in Opposition, is that we are a small open economy and we cannot effectively manage our affairs as long as the world outside is cold and stormy.  That was not their reply during the first oil crisis from 1973 to 1977.  That is politics and one can discount it.  Let us deal with the present.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the world economy is deteriorating and that the prospects for international growth and trade are poor. However, I would go further and say that they are becoming worse, that the prospects for the next 15 years on a global scale, will get worse relating the rich Northern Hemisphere to the rest, the South, which is impoverished and becoming poorer by the day.  No magic Santa Claus in the shape of President Reagan or some other controller of a large economy will create a wake of prosperity on which little Ireland can ride because of a boom created by other people.  The world does not owe us a living, to quote what is so often quoted in this House, and now we must sit down in an open economy in <Col N="1696" /> a period of open trade and try to define how we can go about creating a sound economy in this State to enable us to secure employment for this generation of people and for young children who will be coming on the market.  Without question, as everybody in this House will recognise, there is in this country a major economic crisis, a crisis of unprecedented dimensions.  That must be the opening position.</P>
    <P>The second matter we must look at, if we recognise that, is to establish a degree of control over our domestic economy that enables us to ameliorate the deteriorating conditions in terms of international trade, whether for export markets or competition from cheap imports against established industries here.  We have quite a degree of control if we are prepared to exercise it.  This budget, if it is about anything, is about the control of money and its allocation into current account expenditure in terms of wages, salaries, running costs for schools and hospitals and local administration, and capital account projects for investment in roads or facilities of one kind or another or attracting foreign enterprise into this country.  However, nowhere in the budget do we find the central question: who controls the money in this country ?  Who controls the ownership of money and wealth in this country?  If we do not establish that clearly and decide then how we are going to allocate that money, we are not really at the races at all.</P>
    <P>Ireland by any international standard is not a poor country.  We have never been a poor country.  We have for far too long been an exploited country, and too many of our people have been exploited by foreigners, initially and since 1972, with consummate success by our own citizens. We are not a poor country.  The lie-should be laid because it is a lie that suits and supports the minority of our people in this country who have never experienced poverty or insecurity.</P>
    <P>There are in this country traditional and new forms and sources of money, and I will get on to those in detail.  I will not try either to rewrite history or simply re-invoke it.  An analysis can be made of the Irish economy in terms of 1981 which <Col N="1697" /> takes into account major changes in social structures in relation to the control and ownership of money which has been brought about since 1945.  I will leave aside for the moment the whole question of current account expenditure and simply concentrate on capital expenditure and investment.  We have a borrowing requirement brought about by a need to borrow money to invest in projects such as roads, telecommunications, harbours and all the other things that have been identified by the investment plan, the national road plan and all the other documents that so far have been put forward, not in any great detail but, nevertheless, identified.  We have a need for this Parliament to take a vote at the end of the day to authorise this Government to borrow money domestically and internationally at great risk and with the implication and the consequences of putting a millstone around the necks of today's PAYE workers and future generations of people who have yet to come out of school, let alone start their jobs.</P>
    <P>Side with that, private banks in this country have considerable amounts of money which have not been made available and they consistently have declared profits in the region of £42 million to £43 million which have not been touched.  On top of that we have a whole new dimension of financial institutions, ranging from building societies to the pension funds, which are potential sources of major investment to achieve the sort of objectives on the desirability of which this House would be pretty well agreed. What do we get from the party of men of open-necked shirts?  Subservience to imperialist traditions of economic orthodoxy that would do justice to Lord Carson, not to mention the founding fathers of Fianna Fáil &mdash; republicans perhaps but of the Ronald Reagan nature and version.</P>
    <P>One area of potential investment that would alleviate the need for external borrowing &mdash; borrowing which, if our currency has declined by 11 per cent in one year, has horrendous implications for the repayments &mdash; is the harvest of the success of the Labour movement in achieving pensions in private and public sector industry over the last 25 years.  We do not <Col N="1698" /> know, the Government will not tell us and the Ministers, all of them, have refused consistently to give me the information which I sought by way of parliamentary questions as to the exact nature, scale and extent of the pension funds of the semi-State companies in this country. Before Christmas, in response to a comprehensive question put down to each relevant Minister, the Ministers either declared or pretended ignorance or lack of knowledge of the extent of these moneys. These are the savings of working people who won the right to have a pension as part of their job conditions and who paid for it by deferred wages and salaries.  The fund managers of these pension funds invested them in such a way as to ensure that they would produce index-linked, constant value pensions at the end of the day when the worker would stop working and retire.  Too many workers at the moment do not know where that money is being invested and too many workers have no control over how those funds are being invested.  The Government, who do not realise in full the potential of such investment funds, still either claim to be ignorant or are refusing to inform the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>We will probably get from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies some more elucidation than we have ever got from that side of the House, irrespective &mdash; let me say in assurance to Minister of State, Deputy Connolly &mdash; of who happens to be in the position of responsibility. The Irish Life Assurance Company, by far the most dominant assurance corporation in this country, are constantly investing money in property not only in the city of Dublin but throughout the country.  There is no socio-political control over the nature of that investment. Side by side with that we have a city crying out for funds and disintergrating from the lack of investment, because, as we are told repeatedly, money is scarce.  In this assurance company 97 per cent of the equity is owned by the Minister for Finance.  Yet, this assurance company, established by the Irish people, is making decisions on investments the consequences of which are never subject to any kind of social or political scrutiny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> When times get hard and there are cutbacks, as there are at the moment, the Ministers of the day will say &ldquo;Money is scarce.  We cannot do anything.  Yes, we know that the housing list of Dublin Corporation has gone up from the time of the Coalition, when it was 5,500, to 8,500 now.&rdquo;  People are being told that sufficient money is not available for local authority housing.  The coffers are bare and the political public relations experts in the ministerial offices of various Government Departments come out with this kind of line with great skill, great conviction and great compassion and side by side with that we have this source of funding that is not being utilised.  In the last two years this source of funding has become very substantial and the need to utilise it even more acute.  The reason for that is that when we joined the EMS we effectively broke the link with sterling, once sterling diverted its value away from the Irish £.  Coincidentally and as a part of joining the EMS, no Irish individual, organisation or company could invest Irish money anywhere overseas without the consent of the Minister for Finance. Prior to that, surplus and excess funds in assurance companies and pension funds generally, which by their very nature and definition are obliged to invest in gilt edge securities, were invested in the London market where there was a wide range of investment opportunities and where their percentage investment was miniscule relative to the scale of the London market.</P>
    <P>That is not the case now.  That option for fund managers is closed.  There is, literally, an embarrassment of pension fund moneys available to the economy. We should redefine whose money it is.  It belongs to the ordinary working people who joined a pension fund scheme run by the firms they work for so that they would have some kind of pension at the end of their working lives.  This investment plan, which the Government have produced, an integral part of the budget process which, essentially, is the Public Capital Programme dressed up in fancy print with black dots, is going to cost a lot of money. It is going to involve a lot of borrowing, some of it from overseas, with all the <Col N="1700" /> consequences of exchange risk.  It will also cause a lot of borrowing in undertaking by a conservatively orthodox Government at a time when every orthodox economist in the country has said that we can no longer sustain this level of borrowing without some form of horrendous consequences.  Perhaps it is because of the very nature of their conservatism that the Government have refused to look at the internal options of taking a greater control and direction of our internally owned and created finance institutions.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the entire budget exercise is, undoubtedly, that of getting more money and certainly more money than had been anticipated this time last year.  We know there is an election coming and that money is now being made available in a way in which it was not last year.  Local authorities, who had to cut down their spending programmes because of the shortage of money, are now embarrassed by the flush of money which is being thrust at them &mdash; not actual cash, promissary notes and assurances that the money will be there.  County managers are wiser than that, they want to see cash in the bank before they take on extra staff.  The Government, having hit the economy brake so hard last year that the economy really did go into a decline, are now trying to rev it up, causing considerable damage to the engine of the economy.  There is no fundamental assessment being made as to the nature of available finance in the country. Because of that, the budget exercise has become irrelevant.</P>
    <P>We have been inundated with documents which purport to be plans.  If ever a word in the English language was abused by the present administration it is the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo;.  Any kind of press release now constitutes a plan.  If any of these documents, the road development plan for the eighties or the investment plan for 1981 or the next election &mdash; take your pick &mdash; was put forward to a private financial banking firm for consideration for moneys in the form it is put forward to us, they would not get past the porter. We also are a banking institution, to the extent that we propose or give our assent to the lending of public moneys by way <Col N="1701" /> of levies and compulsory taxation with harsh penalties for non-payment.  It is because of the inadequacy in the form of their presentation, because of the childlike way it is assumed that if you throw money into the air some will land, some might seed and, of the seeds which eventually grow, some might provide jobs. We are talking about job approvals of up to 30,000 in the IDA in the current year. We have all tried to get money from financial institutions for home loans and so on.  If you put yourself in the position of trying to explain to a local bank manager that, on the basis of that kind of assessment, he should lend other people's money to you, try to conceive what the likely result would be.  That is supposed to be investment planning, invoking the expertise of the civil service and the political acumen of Fianna Fáil.  We do not have planning.  This document, the road development plan for the eighties, was laughed out of court in the EEC.  The Minister of State, Deputy Connolly knows that.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of European Communities in this House and in Brussels were shown the document and it was ridiculed in terms of infrastructural development and investment planning.</P>
    <P>We are nearly proposing more money for the maintenance of secondary and tertiary roads which have maybe ten or 15 vehicles per day using them, than for the national primary route system which represents 3 per cent of our road and 25 per cent of the volume of traffic.  The only thing these documents are planned to do is to win the next election.  I do not fault them one bit for the skill which that kind of decision-making has taken, but they would not get past an assistant bank manager in terms of serious economic thinking. That would not be too bad if it was Fianna Fáil's own money.  They are talking about the tax money of everybody in this House, porters, ushers and reporters and they are talking about our children's tax money, children who have not come out of primary school yet.  My children will be servicing debts incurred by this kind of economic nonsense.  What for? We have yet to see the actual effective <Col N="1702" /> cost per job in the creation of this kind of employment.</P>
    <P>I cannot engage in a serious economic discussion in the House with the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, or the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, because this Chamber sets us up like boxers in a stadium with people watching. We are expected to perform certain roles, either of defence or attack, for our respective supporters.  All the time the population of the country gets larger and the gap between expectations and delivery becomes wider.  This House and this Government, irrespective of who &mdash; as Colm McCarthy has now described it &mdash; has the misfortune to hold office, desperately need to get their system of economic thinking right.  I do not say that from any doctrinaire, ideological point of view. The only doctrinaire economists in the House, as far as I am concerned, are on the right wing side and they passionately believe that private enterprise still works. There is no such thing in this country, except the people who are totally outside the tax net, the black economy: that is the only private one.  The so-called private sector is no more private or independent and no more strident in the merchant adventuring sense than civil servants in the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>This is an even more serious charge: perhaps the Irish private sector is becoming a very small portion of the overall private sector of industry.  At the CII conference about three weeks ago all the traditional household names of Irish industry were represented, virtually each one of them in receipt of substantial grants, aids or supports from the Government either directly or indirectly.  Yet, they go on talking about the private sector. Significantly at that CII annual conference, which is a very revealing and interesting affair, the major growth industries, which give a certain amount of blasé to our export performance figures, were not represented &mdash; the microchip industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the electronic technology industry and the mining industry which are the hard currency international earners, those with the highest productivity and export performance paid for in the main <Col N="1703" /> through the IDA by you and me and the other taxpayers.  They were not represented. Even within the so-called private sector there is a division now between foreign-owned and foreign controlled and privately owned.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas we had a Private Members' motion here from the Labour Party on the need to develop State sector enterprise and to look at the whole question of the nature of the control of Irish industry.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, to whose skill and expertise and commitment I should like to pay public tribute discussed the matter in real and reasonable terms and expressed his own concern at the way in which Irish industry was perhaps going and the need to support and develop local enterprise and private enterprise on a small scale.  But the scale of support that SFADCo in the Limerick region and the IDA in the national region are providing for &ldquo;private&rdquo; enterprise makes nonsense of the English language meaning of the word private.  The only things that are private in those circumstances are their profits and their books, and the workers in those industries never have a chance to see that aspect of the business.</P>
    <P>We know that at the end of this debate a division will be taken and the result is a foregone conclusion.  The impact of the budget in terms of current account spending has already been assessed by the public. The people who got a little out of it feel reasonably happy &mdash; or they will in April, when the social welfare payments are made &mdash; and on behalf of those who need social welfare payments I welcome the increase in the budget.  It would be churlish and intellectually dishonest to do otherwise.  There are implications in relation to expenditure on petrol and car tax which I would like to hear discussed by the relevant Minister at some length.  It ties back into the whole question of what we do with the McKinsey report and our transport system.  It ties back with the whole attitude to the utilisation of energy for transport and oil imports in particular and the way in which we provide an alternative system of public transport that <Col N="1704" /> actually works &mdash; unlike what we have at present.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of expertise in this House combined with the wisdom of people who meet and mix with the public and it is not being utilised.  The evidence of a conclave of 15 Ministers surrounded in a bureaucratic stockade protected by an army of civil servants is that frequently their judgment and their contact with the outside world is impaired and abandoned because of the nature of democratic politics operating in this country at present.  My speech in this debate is essentially an appeal to whatever group of people happen to be in office to change the nature of this Parliament, to take it out of the nineteenth century &mdash; dare I say eighteenth century? &mdash; into the last 20 years of the 20th century and set up a working committee system on economics so that we could look on an ongoing basis at the economic proposals of any administration and assess them on the basis of their economic value and not try to take political potshots at whoever happens to be Minister for Finance.  There is really no debate, no effective evaluation of solutions to our problems because the details of the solutions on which a substantial evaluation could be made are not provided in the documents we get.  They are not cross-referenced so that we can see what the cost-benefit would be of investing £50 million in this sector or £25 million in that.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the full speech of the previous speaker but I did hear him repeat what the Government have said on a number of occasions.  He said that the whole question of public sector pay and pay moderation was extremely important and that we had &mdash; I do not know if he used phrase nine, phrase five or phrase 14 &mdash; to live within our means or something like that, whatever the GIS produce.  The Government on one hand attempt to slap down public sector employees on the grounds that they are somehow uniquely privileged because they have a job and should moderate their wage demands and on the other hand create jobs as they did according to the Economic Background To The <Col N="1705" /> Budget, 1981 which said that last year the productive sector of industry produced 7,000 new jobs, so that 14,000 jobs were created in services employment of which 5,000 were in the public sector.</P>
    <P>I do not regard public sector employment as being unproductive in the classic economic sense.  I do not regard teachers of electronics as unproductive if you want to develop a microchip industry, but the Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot pretend that they are meeting job targets as indicated in that rather regrettable and sad speech made yesterday by a Deputy for whom I have a good deal of admiration, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue; they cannot pretend they are meeting those targets and actually create them on a false economic basis within the public sector along that type of scale and then say to those who have got those jobs: &ldquo;How dare you ask for any increase?&rdquo;  That is trying to have it both ways.  It is the kind of contradiction they should be confronted with and asked to resolve.  They must say either that they are going to limit the amount of employment in the public service sector and live with the political consequences of having failed quite substantially to meet their job targets, or else say that the nature of our economy is such that they would prefer to have a large number of people employed in that particular way and will negotiate direct with the trade union movement on the level of remuneration and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is in the House and I wish to make what I consider some informed remarks on the whole question of the price of agricultural produce. I do not have, and do not pretend to have, his expertise on that matter.  On behalf of the Labour Party and as a Deputy who represents an urban constituency in which 1,100 &mdash; if that is the precise number &mdash; of Dublin workers who may never have seen a green field lost their jobs because of the price of meat.  I am referring to the firm IMP in Grand Canal Street.  One of the commitments of this Government on coming into office was to increase employment in the food processing sector.  The evidence of achievement is pretty scarce, although I am open <Col N="1706" /> to correction on this.  The prospects are not very good.</P>
    <P>An unfortunate division is being artificially created in our society between the urban and rural dweller.  This division is being manipulated by various sectional interests for their own short-term gain.  It is to nobody's advantage and, in the short term, has led to actual loss of jobs in a highly urbanised constituency.  The Minister, whose political skills are not doubted by anybody on this side of the House, should move, in the next year or whatever time is left to him, to create a solid economic basis for food processing throughout the country, in order to ensure that the value content of primary produce created and reared here is not exported on the hoof or unprocessed. The maximum value content must be retained here, with a consequent increase in jobs, wherever they might occur &mdash; in Sligo town, Ringsend or out in the green fields of County Offaly.</P>
    <P>There is a mutual interdependence between these activities.  These are things which we control.  The Department of Agriculture and this country control the nature of land ownership.  The Arabs, the Gnomes of Zurich &mdash; to use Harold Wilson's phrase &mdash; do not dictate how we organise our infrastructure.  There are things over which we have exclusive control and food production is undoubtedly one.  The document produced by the Department of Agriculture on land policy has highlighted some factors which are related to the achievable productivity in agriculture and certain other sectors. The Minister and this Government should look at these from the point of view of a rational analysis of our needs, our capabilities and capacities.  We do not have that rational analysis, we have intimations. The substance is not there and, regrettably, this type of debate does not enable anyone to get down to the substance. We are left skirmishing at the fringe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I note very carefully what Deputy Quinn has said and can give him an assurance that I am concerned about the very important points raised by him.  I understand them and am taking <Col N="1707" /> whatever measures are possible within our control to correct them.  I particularly hope that the employment situation of a downward trend which he has outlined can be reversed in the quickest possible time.  Anything that I can do to encourage that will be done.</P>
      <P>The budget had to be framed in difficult economic circumstances and against the background of a continuing severe international recession.  The criteria which it had to satisfy were diverse.  It had to help to maintain economic growth and development so as to enable us to come through the current recession in a position that would allow us to take full advantage of the upturn in the economic conditions.  At the same time, the living standards of the poor and under-privileged had to be protected.</P>
      <P>An added consideration was the need for proper control on the public finances and on the level of our foreign borrowings. Moreover, it had to provide for the problems which have spilled over from the general economy into the agricultural sector.  The reconciliation of all of these criteria was not easy, but in his Budget the Minister for Finance has achieved the best result possible in the difficult circumstances which confronted him.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, the level of farm incomes has fallen significantly, following a period of exceptional growth. Admittedly, 1978 was a record year and comparisons with that year must inevitably produce a bad picture.  However, the fact remains that farm incomes declined greatly in 1979 and 1980.  The Government, and I as Minister for Agriculture, accept the fact and, indeed, I have said so on several occasions.  We do not require any convincing about the need to restore prosperity in Irish farming and to put the agricultural industry back once more on the road to expansion.</P>
      <P>The measures in the budget relating to agriculture were formulated with two main considerations in mind, firstly, the need to expand farm output and productivity and the volume of agricultural exports and secondly, the need to alleviate the financial difficulties which many farmers are facing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> It is essential for our economic wellbeing that our farming industry is working at full capacity.  This is especially so in terms of exports and employment, including employment in the various ancillary industries and services that are dependent on agriculture and for which a thriving agricultural industry is a vital factor.  The decline in incomes which individual farmers have suffered is a matter of particular concern, and the budget measures and those taken by the Government over the past six or eight months are designed to help these farmers generally to ensure a restoration of confidence in farming.</P>
    <P>I should mention that there are a number of encouraging features on the agricultural scene at the moment.  The mild winter has considerably eased the pressure on fodder supplies.  Also, farmers have the prospect of earlier grass this year.  More important still is the fact that prices in general are satisfactory, particularly in the cattle and sheep trades.</P>
    <P>In the current economic climate, there are severe limits on the resources available to the Government.  At the same time there are considerable demands on these resources from various interest groups, each of which considers that its own position is the most deserving.  The task of the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, is to achieve a fair balance between the various demands and, at the same time, ensure that the general economic objectives are pursued.</P>
    <P>In their current situation, farmers must rank high on the list of deserving interests and this has, in fact, been recognised in the budget.  The Government are prepared to back Irish farmers within the limits of the resources available to us. Indeed, I think it is sometimes forgotten that, down through the years, the State has provided significant encouragement and support for the farming industry.  We will continue to provide that encouragement and support.</P>
    <P>This year gross exchequer expenditure on agriculture and lands will amount to £254 million.  I think some people have the false impression that the State is now contributing little or nothing to the farming <Col N="1709" /> industry and that all assistance for agriculture comes from the EEC.  This is far from being the case, as the total expenditure of £254 million which I have just mentioned shows.  Furthermore we have been getting substantial funds from the EEC.  In 1980 our agriculture received £415 million from there.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the budget must not be viewed in isolation.  They must be considered in the context of the measures already taken by the Government in the second half of last year and in the light of the prospects of special EEC aid and price increases which will be negotiated in Brussels in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I might also point out that the budget measures and the measures introduced earlier arise from discussions held with the farm organisations and concentrate in particular on areas suggested by them in the course of these discussions.  Indeed, it is fair to say that over the months we have done something about every single one of the demands raised by farm organisations at the outset.</P>
    <P>For example, the disease eradication levies are one item on which the farm organisations have pressed for some time.  The suspension of these levies will mean ½p on a gallon of milk and £3 per head of cattle for the individual farmer. This will save farmers an estimated £9.65 million in 1981 and represents a direct incentive to farmers to increase output of cattle and milk.</P>
    <P>The new tax provisions for stock relief will add impetus to expansion of the breeding herd.  In the 1980 budget farmers were allowed full relief on any increases in stock values over 10 per cent of their profits.  This year the 10 per cent limitation has been removed entirely, so that farmers will now get full relief in respect of any increases in stock values. As I have said, the emphasis has to be on expansion.  It is accordingly most important to eliminate any trend towards destocking.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recent measures, there are of course already in existence attractive grants and subsidies through the Cattle Headage Payments Scheme <Col N="1710" /> and the Beef Suckler Scheme to encourage an expansion in numbers.  I significantly increased the level of headage grants last year.  Indeed, the level was roughly doubled, and with the suckler grants there is now a very positive incentive to expand the breeding herd.</P>
    <P>For example, a farmer in the disadvantaged areas can get a grant of as much as £57 for an extra beef cow.  The incentive and support is there to help farmers to increase stock numbers and any tax disincentive that might have existed has been removed.  It is simply not in accordance with the facts to say that the Government are not encouraging expansion in the national herd.</P>
    <P>The failure to increase stock numbers is a matter of concern.  Inadequate stocking rates are not in the interests of farmers themselves and it is imperative for the agricultural sector and for the economy as a whole that stock numbers should expand.</P>
    <P>A sector in which there has been some pressure on the resources of the industry itself is the seed potato industry.  Storage and marketing problems have not made the situation any easier.  The seed potato industry is very important for the livelihood of many small farmers, particularly in the western counties.  More important still is the fact that there are good prospects for an expansion in exports, particularly with the new varieties that are now becoming available.  It is essential for future development to have suitable grading and storage facilities.  It is on this basis that the Government decided to make £¼ million available for financing measures to assist development and growth in this industry.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present discussing with Irish Potato Marketing Limited and with other representatives of the industry, arrangements for implementing this aid with a view, in particular, to using the money to help growers in the main production areas in such matters as storage and production of new varieties.  I hope to finalise details very soon.</P>
    <P>Another area crucial to the immediate financial position of farmers is the system of agricultural rates.  Farmers under £50 RV will have full relief and those between <Col N="1711" /> £50 RV and £70 RV will get 50 per cent relief.  These reliefs will benefit 59,000 farmers, 49,000 of whom will be fully de-rated and 10,000 will receive 50 per cent relief.  This is a significant measure of assistance and means a £19.6 million reduction in farmers' rates bill this year. Again it concentrates on an area suggested by the farm organisations and, depending on the rateable valuation involved, can mean a very worth-while contribution to the income of the individual farmer.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government had already decided that the resource tax would be discontinued after one year. This means a further saving to the farming community of more than £6 million. Furthermore, the continuation of the two payment dates for income tax has been provided for.  All these concessions are designed to help the income position of farmers and greatly to ease the taxation burden on the farming community.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the measures announced in the budget should not be considered in isolation but rather as part of a series of actions taken by the Government to help farmers.  The measures already taken cost £39 million in 1980. The elements in this budget are worth £35 million to the farming community. However, that is not all that is being done.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the constraints on the Government as regards the resources that can be made available.  We have to be realistic in this regard.  Since our entry into the EEC a vast amount of support for Irish agriculture has come from EEC sources &mdash; as much as £1,800 million &mdash; and we have come to depend to a great extent on EEC policies.  We have been consistent in our defence of the CAP and its principles.  I think there is widespread agreement that it is not in our national interest to cause any major disruption of the basic elements of that policy.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions have been put forward from various quarters as to how agriculture might be helped by the Exchequer.  However, we have to be careful that we do not move away from the basic concepts of the CAP.  That <Col N="1712" /> would not be in our interest in either the short term or the long term, because our best hope lies in the maintenance and preservation of the common pricing and common support measures of the Community.</P>
    <P>As is well known, I have been endeavouring to secure special assistance for Irish agriculture from the EEC.  What really matters to farmers is the assistance provided to them at the end of the day &mdash; not the starting positions or the day-to-day moves made to secure results.  The whole objective of my efforts is to secure additional help for Irish agriculture in its present difficult situation.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that it is necessary, first of all, to convince the EEC Commission that the Irish situation is such as to require special help.  Then, after the Commission have put forward proposals, it is necessary to persuade the Council of Ministers to agree to what has been proposed.  The negotiations, or more correctly discussions with the Commission are still in progress.  Anybody who understands the European scene will know how difficult these kinds of negotiations can be.</P>
    <P>I can say, however, that I put forward a comprehensive list of possible ways in which Irish agriculture could be helped. The various suggestions have been receiving careful attention from the Commission, and I myself have had discussions on them with the late Commissioner Gundelach and more recently with his successor, Commissioner Dalsager.  In addition, there have been a number of meetings at senior official level to examine these proposals.</P>
    <P>Progress was unfortunately hampered by the sudden death of the late Commissioner Gundelach.  May I say at this point that the Commissioner had a very good knowledge and appreciation of Irish agricultural conditions and had sympathy for our current difficulties.</P>
    <P>Following Commissioner Gundelach's death and the appointment of a successor, I arranged an early meeting with Mr. Dalsager to discuss our suggestions.  He, too, was sympathetic and understanding. Arising out of that meeting and subsequent <Col N="1713" /> contacts, work on our suggestions is being pressed ahead in the Commission.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I put forward a comprehensive list of possible ways in which Irish agriculture could be helped.  Some of these suggestions are not acceptable to the Commission for various reasons.  A number of suggestions are, however, still being considered and I look forward to positive conclusions on these being forthcoming at an early date.  As they are still under discussion, I do not think that it would be appropriate or helpful for me to go into detail at this stage; indeed, this is fully in accordance with the wishes of the Commission.  However, as soon as conclusions have been arrived at in Brussels I will certainly give details.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is expected that the prices proposals for the new marketing year will be published next week.  It is already quite certain that the price increases proposed will be greater than the rates of increase in recent years.  What will eventually be decided upon by the Council of Ministers is not certain, but I am satisfied that a worthwhile deal can be negotiated for Irish farmers.  It will also be my objective to ensure that the new prices are brought into operation at the earliest possible date.  Given the seasonality of our milk production delays can involve significant losses for our dairy farmers in particular.  Thus we have a very direct interest in having early decisions on the prices proposals.  At the same time, we will need to be concerned about any ancillary proposals which might be to our long-term disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the cumulative effect of the measures taken by the Government and the benefits from the EEC will mean that Irish agriculture will have received significant and positive assistance. I look forward to leaving behind the difficulties of the past two years and putting the industry again on the path of progress and development.</P>
    <P>I do not accept for one moment that Irish agriculture is in a slump from which it cannot be retrieved.  To accept this would mean ignoring the inherent strength of the industry and its ability to overcome the difficulties confronting it. <Col N="1714" /> Since I became Minister for Agriculture I have constantly referred to the need to maximise output and efficiency.  Never before have Irish farmers had available such a range of back-up facilities or services. The establishment of ACOT has given a new dimension to the advisory and education services.  The scope for expansion of the agricultural industry is tremendous.  To quote an example, our average milk yields are nowhere near what they should be despite our natural advantages in milk production.  This point was recently borne out by the general manager of a leading co-operative when he indicated that the limiting factor to improving farm income is poor management and husbandry.  To underline his case he showed that a 10 per cent milk price rise would increase incomes by £240 per year in his own co-operative area.  On the other hand, the achievement of a stocking rate of one cow to two acres, which is very low, and an increased yield of 200 gallons per cow, which is possible, would increase gross income by £7,200 per annum.</P>
    <P>The availability of credit at attractive interest rates has posed problems for our farmers.  In general the position as regards interest rates is now much more satisfactory than was the case a year or 18 months ago.  Furthermore, loans are available at lower than normal interest rates, either through the Euro-loans arranged with the banks and the ACC or through the co-operatives.  Indeed, I wish to record our thanks to those bodies for their co-operation in administering these loans.  We now have lower interest rates than the majority of our EEC partners. The farmer who wishes to expand and develop can do so with the support of the Government.</P>
    <P>For some years now considerable investment has taken place at all levels of the agricultural sector.  Investment in agriculture rose from £50 million per annum in 1970 to some £300 million by the end of the decade.  In recent years a strong processing sector has been developing. For example, in 1980 some 50 projects in the food sector, with a combined employment potential of over 2,000 new jobs, were approved for grant <Col N="1715" /> assistance.  These projects involve societies and firms spread throughout the country, including Ballyclough Co-operative Society, Shannonside Milk Products Limited, Lough Egish Co-operative and Dairy Society Limited, Cork Marts IMP, Kildare Chilling Company and IAWS, to mention but a few.  Already this year grants have been approved for Avonmore Creameries and Waterford Co-operative.</P>
    <P>In the period 1977 to 1979 IDA approvals for projects in the food sector have totalled nearly £15 million in grant commitments and nearly £19 million in re-equipment grants.  In addition, we have been receiving regular grant assistance from the FEOGA guidance section. Since we joined the EEC over £36 million has been approved for the food processing sector.  In 1980 total grant-aid for Irish projects amounted to £9.4 million.  I mention these figures to show that positive developments are occurring in vital areas of our agricultural economy and that many farmers and their co-operatives have confidence in the future.  Progress in Irish agriculture has not come to a halt. With the active support and encouragement of the Government, considerable investment is occurring both at farm level and in the area of processing.  This will stand to us in the years to come and will strengthen our ability to reach the end to the recession and to meet the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of agricultural marketing significant changes have been taking place.  There is now a much greater awareness throughout the whole industry of the importance and value of marketing. CBF, with their new powers, now have a more meaningful role.  Bord Bainne have been well recognised for many years as a highly efficient marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>In the pigmeat sector there has recently been agreement between the various interests concerned on arrangements to improve the marketing of pigmeat.  Here again the Government are giving positive help by suspending veterinary inspection charges at bacon and pork factories.  We are certainly moving in the right direction <Col N="1716" /> and the outlook for the future is encouraging. In the final analysis it is the competiveness of our products in the market place that will be the main determinant of success.  I believe that we can be more than a match for our competitors.</P>
    <P>Another recent major development is the introduction of the western package. This package of measures will do much to improve standards in western agriculture and in the infrastructure in general. It includes aids for on-farm investment, land improvement, rural infrastructure such as roads, water supplies and electricity, agricultural education, advisory services, forestry, agricultural marketing and processing.  I have seen recent suggestions that we are dragging our feet on the introduction of the new measures and I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>First of all, part of the package is in operation, namely, that dealing with marketing and processing projects.  In fact, £5 million was allocated in December for the modernisation and expansion of agricultural marketing and processing facilities in the western region.  Before the remaining measures in the package can be implemented a programme settingout the detailed arrangements for the measures has to be drawn up by the Government and the EEC Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that my Department, in association with the other Government Departments concerned, have pressed ahead with the preparation of the programme with all urgency. Work on the programme was, in fact, initiated even before the package was approved by the Council of Ministers and has not slackened since. However, given the wide-ranging nature of the measures the number of Departments and other agencies involved, and the inter-relationship between the measures, detailed consultations over a period of months were necessary in order to ensure that an effective and comprehensive programme was drawn up, and that the best return possible would be secured from the very considerable expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The programme has, in fact, been with <Col N="1717" /> the EEC Commission since late in 1980 and my Department are pressing for its adoption at the earliest possible date.  We are, however, dependent on clearance by the Commission and by a committee representing all the member states.  We are seeking to obtain this as quickly as possible. I can give an assurance that as soon as the programme is approved it will be implemented by us without delay.  Money has been provided in the Estimates of the various Departments and agencies involved in its implementation.</P>
    <P>The budget tackles the country's problems in a realistic and effective manner and deals constructively with the major issues of the day.  There are no easy options in our present situation, but the Government have faced up to the difficulties and the measures contained in the budget are positive and worth while. There is no magic wand that can restore prosperity overnight.  In the agricultural sector, we will have to work hard for whatever gains are achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government have already provided assistance in the measures taken last year and in the budget and we shall make every effort to ensure benefits at EEC level through the prices settlement and special arrangements for Ireland. With the help of these various measures and through greater productivity and output, it is possible to make real gains that will not be easily eroded.</P>
    <P>I can promise that this Government will give the maximum support possible at all times to the agriculture sector.  I can promise also that I will do my utmost to achieve the best outcome from the EEC negotiations.  However, cash injections though they are of tremendous importance are not in themselves the full and only solution to the current problems. The response at farm production level and in the various other sectors of the industry are also vital elements.  For their part the Government can be relied upon to do what they can to create the right environment for progress and expansion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer at a later stage to the speech by the Minister for Agriculture. Much has been said and written during the past few weeks about this <Col N="1718" /> budget and most of the comment has been adverse.  It appears that most sectors see little in it to inspire confidence in an economy which sadly lacks that ingredient. The business community, including manufacturing industry, services, the distributive trade and the retail trade see little in this budget for them.  The farming community have also voiced their opinion and would seem to be incensed at the lack of consideration for them and their problems.  The fishermen were given 2p per gallon off the cost of fuel oil and they maintain that because of the extreme difficulties in which they find themselves this is nothing more than a gesture and means very little in practical terms. Housewives see little in the budget to make their lot any easier.  All in all, the comment has been adverse.</P>
      <P>All these sectors without exception have heaped derision on the Government, and no wonder.  At budget time one can expect complaints from sectional interests, but one rarely experiences the widespread outrage expressed in this instance.  The depth and the intensity of the reaction provoked by the provisions of this budget have singled it out as something to be remembered for that rather than its contents.  Can all these people be wrong?  This question should exercise the minds of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the current state of the economy.  The Minister for Agriculture, to his credit, unlike his colleagues has consistently said that we are living in hard times.  The vast bulk of comment from his colleagues during Question Time in the House is that plenty of money will be available and that we have never had it so good.  Then we find that the money is not being made available. The confidence which ought to be inspired by a practical approach, by facing the difficulties which confront us and by implementing a strong, virile fiscal policy that would make some effort to get us out of this economic mess, is not there. One of the main essentials of success is, first, an admission that something is wrong.  There is no such admission, although everybody knows that something is wrong.  The result is that we get <Col N="1719" /> this dithering approach from the Government as expressed in this budget.  It is indicative of a group of people who have not the will to govern or who have lost the nerve to provide the kind of policies needed.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance on the part of the Government to admit to the near crisis state which we now face.  There are daily assertions that everything in the garden is rosy except for some peripheral irritations which are causing some problems. This ostrich-like approach in dealing with the economic morass in which we find ourselves is incredible when one considers that we have a Government with an enormous majority, a Government which could get through any corrective measures they thought fit.  For reasons best known to themselves and for political reasons, they are not prepared to use the muscle they have in the House to correct the terrible imbalances in the economy.</P>
    <P>Will the House consider the fact that since the present Taoiseach took office just over a year ago over £1,200 million has been borrowed?  This means that every employed person has now to support not only his family and pay his mortgage but has to support an extra £1,125 in the form of a State debt imposed on him in a 12-month period.  One could justify that if it could be shown that this borrowing was having a beneficial effect on the economy and that it was getting us out of the crisis.  However, the reality is that there is little to show for this enormous borrowing.  There has been no drop in prices, in fact the consumer price index is stubbornly staying at the 18 per cent level.  This means that the spending power of the average worker has been cut over the last 12 months by something in excess of £1,000.  That is the reality of having a persistently high inflation rate.</P>
    <P>Neither has there been a fall in unemployment. I will not go over the promises made in the manifesto but it should be pointed out that our intolerable level of unemployment cannot go on.  This Government could go into the Guinness Book of Records for having presided over an economy which lost one job every four minutes of every working day in 1980. <Col N="1720" /> This week we have the figures for unemployment for the first month of this year. They showed an increase in unemployment of something in the region of 3,000. The comment of the Minister for Labour on that could be described as something approaching elation because it was not as bad as the previous month.  I would be delighted to see a situation, regardless of who was in Government, where a Minister for Labour could announce that there was no increase in unemployment in any month, because the human tragedy brought about by unemployment is damaging to our social fabric.  If we are to be seen to be doing our job here, then on the basis of compassion alone, such unemployment should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>What about the standard of living? Fianna Fáil promised that the national output would rise by 7 per cent this year, thus affording ample scope for improvements in living standards.  The Central Bank, an independent body without any political axe to grind, reckoned that in 1980 there was no growth in the economy. Since the population has continued to grow this means the average living standard has fallen by as much as 5 per cent.  The Government case at first sight seems convincing.  There is world-wide depressed economic activity and we cannot isolate ourselves from its effects. There is an international recession. Increased fuel costs must be accepted as having an effect on our balance of payments, inflation, competitiveness and many other matters.  There is a persistent defence put up by the Government that our problems are imported rather than created here, that we have no control over current economic trends.  If one follows this to its logical conclusion one could say that we have no control over anything here because of the pressures that are being brought to bear on us from outside areas.</P>
    <P>We do not need to have long memories to recall the onslaught from the Opposition benches when the same kind of problems confronted the Coalition Government.  The main problem at that time, the first oil crisis, came so quickly that nobody was prepared for it.  While this Government cry over the effects of <Col N="1721" /> energy costs it is nothing new.  They must have known they would have this pressure sooner or later.  They were not in a position to make provision for the day they would be confronted with those enormous problems because of their lust for power through the electoral promises they made.</P>
    <P>With regard to imported inflation, while some of our inflation has to be imported, a reply given by Commissioner Ortoli last August in the European Parliament was very revealing.  As far as he and his advisers could calculate, the inflation rates generated domestically and from abroad showed a vast difference between Ireland and those in the other three countries mentioned.  In the case of Belgium, in 1980 it was 3.7 per cent generated domestically, while in the case of Ireland there was 9.7 per cent inflation generated by domestic factors and domestic policies.  The figure for Germany was 3.4 per cent and for the Netherlands 3.8 per cent.  Our rate of inflation generated through our domestic political decisions was two-and-a-half times that generated in the other three countries, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Commissioner Ortoli has no political axe to grind so far as the political parties here are concerned.  Inflation is a major barrier to economic problems.</P>
    <P>Is the current rate of inflation accepted?  It is not, because it brings wage demands which the average worker feels are his right, because he is expected to keep up with inflation.  It cuts across our competitiveness abroad.  This is where the real problem lies.  The average person who is faced with an inflation rate of nearly 20 per cent sees no reason why he or she should not get a wage increase in keeping with that level of inflation.  There is nothing wrong in the logic of that argument except that the commodity produced has to be sold in a market where the inflation rate is half or one third of ours.  If that commodity did not have to be exported there would not be anything wrong with our inflation rate nor the wage increase provided to meet it.  The adverse effect of inflation, because we are so very dependent on exports, bites into our exports.  There is one figure <Col N="1722" /> which puts in very simple terms the effect of inflation.  In 1977 goods purchased for £9.83 now cost £14.16.  This is the kind of simple mathematical problem which confronts the breadwinner and the housewife.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, commented on the speeches made by Deputy Bruton and Deputy FitzGerald in relation to budgetary calculations.  My colleagues on this side of the House challenged the figures produced in the budget and they were right.  We all know the furore which was created in 1979 when Deputy FitzGerald challenged the figures produced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley. Derision was heaped on his head as a result of his casting doubt on the veracity of the statement made by the Minister and the validity of the figures produced. Yet we all know that, by the end of 1979, the doubts cast at budget time proved to be the truth, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>One does not have to be an economist to realise what lies behind the budgetary calculations produced this year.  In agriculture there is an actual cutback of 12 per cent, despite the fact that the Minister came in here a few months ago and sought a supplementary estimate on his original figure for 1980.  In transport and communications there was a cutback of 15 per cent, despite the fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs trooped in here a few months ago, sought and got a 27 per cent increase on the 1980 estimate. In health there is an increase of 3 per cent, despite the fact that the Minister for Health came in here two or three months ago and sought and got an increase of 23 per cent on the 1980 estimate. Yet we are told the figures produced are realistic calculations designed to meet the needs of the economy and to run the economy for the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Supplementary Estimates have been referred to before in this House.  A total of £463 million was sought, and got in this Chamber, two-thirds of which was for current expenditure. Never before had this amount of money been looked for or needed in supplementary estimates.  To my mind it was an abuse of the supplementary estimates <Col N="1723" /> device, because that amount of money should have necessitated the introduction of a supplementary budget.  Because of the odium attached to that kind of supplementary budget, it was not introduced and the device of the supplementary estimates was abused on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Looking at the past record it would seem that the provisions for 1981 will in no way meet the funds which are necessary for the 12-month period and we will have massive supplementary estimates introduced immediately on the return of the Dáil after the summer recess.  It will depend on what political activities may arise between now and then.</P>
    <P>There is also the new element in this year's provision of moneys of the sum of £200 million which is a speculative sum to be raised from the private sector.  The word &ldquo;privatisation&rdquo; has been bandied around this House with great abandon. This amount has been written in as if it were available for use by the Government. I hope the private sector will respond in a positive way to this appeal by the Minister for Finance.  One cannot be too sure what the response will be.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could refer to an article written by a correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 February headed &ldquo;Sugar Company wrong not to Service Shares.&rdquo;  That refers to the fact that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann saw fit to withhold a dividend from preference shareholders, the amount being £15,000.  This is a State-guaranteed company.  As that correspondent rightly said, if a company backed by the State decide in their wisdom to pass this amount for preference shareholders, this infinitesimal amount of 15,000, what certainty has the ordinary operative working for that company of getting his non-contributory pension?</P>
    <P>To broaden that argument further, if a State-guaranteed company like Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann decide to pass this dividend, surely an appeal for funds to the private sector will be looked on with a jaundiced eye when there is no guarantee whatever that dividends will be forthcoming even from a State-backed operation like Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, in the course of his contribution in the House this morning, also mentioned that our external reserve position had improved and that we now held cover for three months, which was an improvement on the position a year ago when it was 2.8 months.  What he failed to tell the House was that the normal minimum cover accepted by Governments through the years is a 4-month cover.  That has now dropped by 25 per cent and the Minister of State conveniently failed to give that information.</P>
    <P>The same speaker referred to the Taoiseach's speech in Ennis and castigated Opposition speakers for pointing out some glaring errors of judgment made in that speech.  He said that while the Taoiseach mentioned that the balance of payments deficit had levelled out it had to be revised upwards later because of increased activity in imports, through massively increased imports of capital goods for investment purposes, raw materials for further processing and so on.  I accept that if an upward revision of our deficit had to be made for this purpose it would be an acceptable format but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a statement along the same lines which was made by a Government spokesman a week ago in relation to import figures for the month of December which showed an increase of £209 million or 70 per cent.  He attributed the massive increase in imports to an upsurge in imports of investment goods.  This was the most blatant piece of cover-up I have seen in a long time.  He said it would increase the productive potential of the economy in the years ahead.  The actual import figures show that this is totally untrue.  If we leave on one side motor cars and office machinery, which can only be doubtfully regarded as investment goods, the proportion of the £209 million import increase attributable to capital goods amounts to £33 million or less than one-sixth of the total.  For the rest the increase is accounted for by oil imports which come to £34 million and a massive increase in imports of foodstuffs and consumer goods, many of which are produced here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> Imports of foodstuffs doubled from £24 million to £48 million including such staggering increases as a fivefold increase in meat imports and a two-and-a-half-fold increase in dairy products and eggs.  Let no-one tell me we do not produce enough dairy produce and eggs to satisfy our needs.  In that month we imported £10 million of fruit and vegetables.  The kind of statement that these increases are due to increased activity in the area of capital goods and raw materials is not true and spokesmen outside the House and Ministers in the House should desist from trying to cover up this fact.</P>
    <P>There is an element in the budget concerning a saving of £25 million and the <i>modus operandi</i> by which it is to be effected is through rationalisation in the public sector.  This morning I listened carefully to the Minister of State who has charge of this Department.  While he gave us a dissertation on the expansion of the public service and the need to do so to meet demands and provide for the administration of new schemes, which I fully accept, he did not say one word concerning the £25 million and how it was to be hived off.  When a specific amount is mentioned in budgetary calculations, the least one would expect is that specific information would be given as to where the saving would be effected, but we did not even have a hint from the Minister responsible as to where it might be made.</P>
    <P>As regards industry and commerce reference was made to changing the taxpaying period to bring it into line with the PAYE payer.  I am talking about schedule D tax.  The initial reaction of commentators and industry was that they would be paying extra amounts this year due to bringing forward the date of payment by three months, I do not think it is causing industry such great worry.  In effect it means that they will be losing interest on investment for that period, and the amount quantified at £3 million is not great.  Therefore there is no great need to discuss that particular aspect of the budget any longer.</P>
    <P>What annoys me is that, as happened here this morning, mention was made of that and it was discarded as a kind of flea bite, implying that industry would not <Col N="1726" /> feel that kind of burden &mdash; something with which I fully agree &mdash; but nothing else was said about the imposition which has been placed on industry.  One would imagine that this was the sole item with which industry was burdened at present when, in reality, the provisions of this budget have cost our industry not £3 million but £60 million when one calculates the other provisions imposing burdens on industry &mdash; PRSI, something in the region of £20 million, postal charges in the region of £8 million to £9 million, increased hydrocarbon costs £28 million and, as I have said, £3 million for the change in the payment period for income tax.  We on this side of the House have been accused of being selective.  But, when mention is made of £3 million as being the only imposition on industry, forgetting about the £57 million, if that is not selectivity, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>On the question of excise duty on industrial fuel the Minister made a great song and dance about not increasing it this year.  I should point out that in this country, at 7p per gallon on industrial fuel, we have the highest rate of duty in the EEC.  Our industry is expected to compete with their EEC partners in the same market place while their partners pay, in some cases, zero duty on industrial oil.  The nearest duty level to our 7p is 4p; there are 3p, 3½p, 2p, 1p and zero but 4p is the rate of our nearest competitor. Yet the Minister did not see fit to offer some form of assistance to industry by reducing that penal level of duty on industrial oil which is costing our industry and country jobs.  The Minister was told that, he is aware of it and still nothing is done.</P>
    <P>The job creation programme of which we heard so much since 1977 would seem now to have been abandoned because there is nothing in this budget tailored to the creation of any degree of worthwhile employment.  We have now reached something in excess of 125,000 unemployed, with something like 8,000 on systematic short time working.  What hope is being held out to these people?  To whom can they look for some form of recognition of their difficulties?</P>
    <P>We had the <i>Investment Plan 1981</i> published <Col N="1727" /> last month.  If I may be permitted to quote from section 3, headed &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo;, paragraph 3.1 states:</P>
    <P>The preceding sections have set out the investment planned by the Government for 1981.  It will result in higher direct employment of about 10,000 most of which, as already indicated, will be in building and construction. This extra employment will be additional to the jobs arising in manufacturing industry as a result of investment by the industrial promotion agencies.</P>
    <P>I hope that investment plan will provide the 10,000 jobs expected.  I would hope also that the extra employment said to be on-stream will be realised.  But the recent target record of this Government does nothing to indicate that the net result of the best combined efforts of the IDA, Coras Tráctála, the Irish Goods Council and the Irish Productivity Council will increase net employment in this country. They failed to do so in 1980 simply because the rate at which we lost jobs was greater than the rate at which they were able to create them.  The incentives in this recent budget do little to give any degree of encouragement or hope that this year, despite the best efforts of those agencies &mdash; who have been working very hard and are to be complimented on their efforts &mdash; there will be the net return on the plus side at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture provided us with a 29 page document outlining the efforts he is making to see to it that our farmers get their entitlement.  He mentioned the provision of the disease eradication levies which will give some little relief all round to farmers faced with this problem.  He did mention rates relief. The coincidence is that those two very points were proposed first of all in a Bill and, being unable to introduce the Bill as a Bill, they were introduced in the form of a motion from this side of the House a few months ago and were turned down by the Minister and his colleague.  We now find them turning up in the budgetary provisions for this year.  The most amazing statement &mdash; and indeed one is <Col N="1728" /> not surprised because of the seemingly dithering approach of this Government and the Minister for Agriculture &mdash; comes where he says that it is fair to say that over the months they have done something about every single one of the demands raised by the farm organisations at the outset.  The Government have done &ldquo;something&rdquo;.  In the normal way the Minister ought to be asked to define &ldquo;something&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Something&rdquo; means nothing, and when one looks at the reaction of the farmers to the provisions of the budget in the light of the performance of the farming industry over the past two years, &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; would be equal to &ldquo;something&rdquo; in so far as some scripts are concerned.</P>
    <P>The small farmer and the big farmer suffered during the past two years.  The one thing which would be worthwhile at the moment to get these farmers out of trouble would be some form of subsidy on interest rates.  While I agree with the Minister that at current levels of interest which are lower than the normal interest there is no problem, there is a problem arising where farmers borrowed heavily two and three years ago at very low interest rates and have been faced in the meantime with something in excess of twice these interest rates.  Those are the people who are in real trouble, not the man who is borrowing today because he is getting fairly reasonable rates of interest. It is the person who borrowed in 1978 and 1979 who is being hammered into the ground and that is the person for whom the Minister is doing nothing and has done nothing in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We are depending on the EEC and as has been said &mdash; and I hope it is not true &mdash; the reaction in Brussels may be that when we got the chance on budget day to do something from our own resources for the farmers in trouble we did nothing and why should we expect Brussels to bail them out.  This is a very sensible, logical argument.  I hope that this will not happen but I am afraid that the Minister, because of his own seeming inaction and lack of consideration for the farmers' plight, will be confronted with this argument and will find it difficult to put up a cogent argument against it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> Before I conclude, let me say that this budget is one which has received the kind of reception which it deserves because in it there is little for anyone.  I have not mentioned social welfare payments.  I feel that the increases given to social welfare beneficiaries have been generous.  A 25 per cent increase, in any man's language, is a generous increase.  Let me finish by saying that it is generous if one accepts that it is reasonable for an old age pensioner living alone to get £22.65 per week comprising his old age pension plus the living alone allowance.  The question is does anybody in this country in 1981 accept that a person can live on £22.65 per week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The objectives of the budget should be to provide adequate finance for the current services for the year covered by the budget and to influence economic growth in the country.  This budget has failed abysmally under both of these headings.  The Estimates on which the budget is based and the allowances made in the budget for these Estimates show that the amounts provided are totally inadequate in many cases.  Allowance has not been made for inflation and, when questioned in the House since the budget was introduced, Ministers have stonewalled on this question of inflation and the provision made for it in the budget. They have also stonewalled and refused to say how certain cuts which were made in the Estimates this year as compared with last year can be explained and how the same services will be provided.</P>
      <P>In many cases travelling expenses have been cut down drastically.  We know that the cost of travelling has been put up substantially by the tax imposed on petrol and diesel for motor vehicles.  A glaring example of an Estimate in which gross under-provision has been made is that of the Department of Health where, on an Estimate of something over £700 million, an increase of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent has been allowed on last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health is a Department which is particularly sensitive to inflation and high energy costs.  Yet the allowance of less than 4 per cent has been made to cover the increases that will take <Col N="1730" /> place in the Department of Health expenditure this year.  I think there can be no doubt about it but that there will be substantial Supplementary Estimates required this year.  Last year there were Supplementary Estimates introduced by Ministers amounting to £463 million, to cover shortages which appeared in last year's Estimates.  It is clear beyond doubt that Supplementary Estimates of an enormous amount will be required this year.  If services are not to be cut back, if employment is not to be cut back, the only alternative will be to introduce Supplementary Estimates and borrow much more than was provided for.  After having provided these inadequate Estimates, the Minister for Finance proceeded to budget for a deficit of £515 million to borrow for current expenditure this year.</P>
    <P>This budget is an example of the state of our economy and shows the level the mismanagement of our finances has descended to, not withstanding that the Taoiseach told us about 14 months ago or less that his priority was to get our finances right.  This budget has not provided sufficient sums in the Estimates to run the country and in many cases it has grossly underestimated.  This budget has provided for a deficit and borrowing for current expenditure of £515 million, the figure at which last year's borrowing ended, and, according to last year's estimate, was an over borrowing of more than £200 million.</P>
    <P>This budget lacks imagination and innovation.  We were led to believe that when the present Taoiseach &mdash; and this is his budget &mdash; took over we would have a financial wizard, somebody who would brighten things up, who would introduce new thinking and new policy into financing the country and getting the country going again.  That is what many people thought he would do, but what have we here?  We have an old-fashioned grandmother type budget &mdash; add taxation on drink, cigarettes and petrol, give enough to the old age pensioners and the social welfare classes to keep body and soul together in a time of galloping inflation, and then proceed to borrow for current expenditure.  This old-fashioned, tired budget might have been introduced by <Col N="1731" /> any Minister for Finance, 30, 40, 50 or 60 years ago.</P>
    <P>I said the second objective of a budget should be to influence growth in the economy, to get the country going and to provide jobs.  I sat here this morning listening to the Minister for Agriculture who trotted out the speech we heard before and, which like the budget, had nothing in it.  I want to speak about agriculture. When speaking on this subject I do not regard myself as speaking about a sectional interest or about part of our community.  I am speaking about our basic economy, about the industry that employs directly by far the greatest number of people, an industry which provides indirectly the livelihood for 40 to 50 per cent of our people.  I am speaking about an industry which does a lot to provide for our balance of payments, an industry which pays, with its exports, for a lot of our imports, an industry without which the standard of living of this nation would be very low.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said 1978 was a very good year for farmers and that any comparison with that year was bound not to show up well.  He went on to say 1979 and 1980 were bad years for farmers. I want to go on record as saying that for many years our farmers were the poorest people in Ireland.  Not alone did they survive in poor houses which lacked modern facilities and existed on a very low standard of living, but they stood between this country and disaster over the years.  It is only since we joined the EEC that our farmers have reached the standard of living to which they were entitled.  It is true &mdash; and the Minister for Agriculture has to admit it &mdash; that over the last two years farmers' incomes in real terms dropped drastically by 30 or 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The most alarming thing about the agricultural industry at present is the dramatic fall in the national cattle herd. Independent publications, such as the annual review for 1980 of the Irish Livestock and Meat Board, show that the numbers of the breeding herd has dropped back to the 1972 level and the <Col N="1732" /> beef cow component of the herd is back to 1971 level.  Those are alarming statistics. Even if everything was to go full steam ahead now it will take two, three or four years to make any impression on the cattle herd and get it back again to a higher level.  The cattle herd numbers have declined drastically under this Government who should be ashamed of their performance in this area.  Shame would not be enough; they should have done something in this budget to increase the cattle herd and get the cattle industry going again because it is the backbone of this country.  The Minister for Agriculture boasted this morning about the weather.  I am glad we are having good weather but I hope the Minister is not taking credit for that.  The Minister also told us that cattle prices were good.  However, the fact that that situation exists is a reflection on the Government because it demonstrates clearly a fall in our cattle herd and the scarcity of cattle.</P>
    <P>The farming community do not benefit from the provisions of the budget.  In fact, £7 million is being taken out of agriculture. That amount is being withdrawn at a time when hundreds of millions of pounds are needed to put the industry back on its feet.  The Minister told us that £225,000 extra was being given to the seed potato industry.  I am glad that extra money was provided but apart from that allocation farmers were not given anything to help offset the decline in their incomes.  Farmers expected an interest subsidy to cushion those who borrowed at the suggestion of Government advisers and bankers and now find themselves crippled.  Farmers expected that something would be done to increase the VAT refund to compensate them for the present high rate of inflation but that did not happen.  Our farmers are being paid German and French price increases but they are suffering from Irish inflation.  That, more than anything else, has crippled the industry.  The budget does not help farmers who are affected by Fianna Fáil inflation.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister to relieve farmers of the disease eradication level is only a temporary measure.  It will be given for one year only and the figure of <Col N="1733" /> £9.5 million is overstated.  The Ministers for Agriculture and Finance boasted about the decision of the Government to discontinue the resource tax, a crazy tax that should not have been introduced and one which did a lot of harm to the country. That tax will be discontinued from this year but the £6 million which farmers were unable to pay last year will have to be paid this year.  The Government's attitude to rates relief is a typical Fianna Fáil stop-go approach to the economy.  In January 1978 the agricultural relief grant was abolished in respect of all holdings with a valuation in excess of £75.  That figure was reduced in 1979 to £60 and in 1980 the grant applied only to valuations less than £40.  Those three operations meant that the rates burden on farmers was increased enormously.  Before the decision in relation to rates was taken in 1979 a farmer with a valuation of £40 paid approximately £190 but the following year he was asked to pay £500.</P>
    <P>In their first three years in office the Government increased agricultural rates, introduced a resource tax, the infamous 2 per cent levy and other levies.  They are now claiming credit for abolishing some rates.  As a result of the provision in the budget in relation to rates, a farmer with a valuation of £40 will not pay rates; a farmer with a valuation of £50 will pay £337.5; a farmer with a valuation of £55 will be liable to pay £371; with a valuation of £60 a farmer is liable to pay £405 in rates; with a valuation of £65 a farmer is liable to pay £438 and with a valuation of £70 a farmer is liable to pay £945 rates. The Minister did not introduce any provision for marginal relief.</P>
    <P>I should like to analyse what the Minister described as concessions in the budget.  He told us that his provision in relation to rates relief will amount to £19.6 million, that the relief of levies will amount to £9.65 million and the changing of the time of payment for income tax will amount to a relief of £5 million.  The Minister also told us that his concession in relation to stock relief will amount to £500,000 and his concession in relation to seed potatoes will amount to £250,000, a total of £35 million.  The disease levies have not been abolished but suspended <Col N="1734" /> for 11 months, from 1 February to 31 December.  At the end of the year the Government will decide whether or not to reimpose the levy.  The Minister's estimate of the cost of suspending the levy is too high because the levy is only being suspended for 11 months and because the amount of slaughtering this year will be significantly less than 2.6 million head, the number disposed of last year.  A more accurate figure as the concession in relation to levies would be £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to rates I should like to state that the 1980 budget, and subsequent legislation, withdrew agricultural grants from farmers in the £40-£60 PLV bracket. The Government realised that that was stupid, criminal and crazy and restored the grant to such farmers later that year but only for one year at an estimated cost of £6 million to the Exchequer.  That amount is included in the £19.6 million estimate for rates concession but because the £6 million was not levied on farmers last year it should not be included in this year's concession to boost it.  The rates concession should be £13.6 million instead of £19.6 million.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the Minister's budget statement whether the concession on rates is being introduced for one year only or whether it will be permanent.  We must wait until we see the Bill that will deal with that matter.  The Minister claimed that the income tax concession would cost the Exchequer £5 million.  It is impossible to estimate the value of that concession but in any event it only maintains the <i>status quo</i> that operated for the tax year 1980-81.  It is not a concession in the real meaning of the word.  The benefit related to this measure is purely academic because many farmers will not be liable for tax.  The concession will operate for one year.  The stock relief for income tax purposes is uncertain also.  Because of the profitability of farming at present and the trends in the national cattle herds it is difficult to estimate the benefit of the stock relief resources.  The measure would benefit only those farmers who have taxable incomes and increase their livestock numbers.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 4 December 1980 in which I gave details of the grants which are available for the insulation of domestic dwellings. So far, about 2,000 grants have been paid out and applications are at present being received at a rate of about 450 a week. My Department do not administer a grant or loan scheme for the commercial sector.  I do not propose at this time to introduce insulation grants or loans for this sector nor to introduce loans for insulating domestic buildings.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw attention to the fact that under a residence-related employment scheme, income tax relief is given in certain cases on the labour content of household improvements, including insulation and other conservation measures, subject to a maximum labour cost of £450 (£900 in the case of a married couple), the first £50 being payable by the householder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the <Col N="1738" /> Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I have on numerous occasions clearly outlined the Government's policy to develop new energy sources.  I believe that energy from biomass, wind, and small hydro schemes is of particular relevance to the Irish situation in the immediate future and that in the longer term it may be possible to utilise solar energy, wave power, tidal and even geothermal sources.  Research and development and demonstration work are in progress in all of these areas. Because of its very nature, research, development and demonstration work in any new area is a slow process and reporting on progress at frequent intervals is not appropriate.  Nonetheless, I can provide details of recent developments.</P>
      <P>Since I instructed my Department last year to develop a national wind power programme, a large number of proposals have been received and evaluated by the Department of Energy.  The initial assessments led me to call for projects which would demonstrate the use of wind power at different types of locations where the wind power resource would be of different strength and quality, or could be harnessed for a particular purpose.  These locations included an island site, a coastal-mountain site, midland site, a co-operative based project, and a project involving manufacturing industry.  Following discussions with the relevant semi-State agencies including the ESB. An Foras Talúntais, the Meteorological Services and the Office of Public Works. ten projects have now been selected for funding &mdash; including those organised by the ESB.  The final details of these projects are being worked out by officials of my Department in conjunction with those agencies.  In addition to these demonstration projects which include electricity generation, grid connection, water pumping for both supply purposes and for drainage and water heating, work is well advanced on a programme to record wind data and analyse it in support of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given up-to-date information on the biomass programme in reply to a question on 27 January.  There have been <Col N="1739" /> no significant recent developments on solar and wave power.</P>
    <P>Actual figures on expenditure of public money by various bodies on alternative energy in 1980 are not yet available. However, estimates of expenditure, based on information available to my Department and to the National Board for Science and Technology indicate that in 1980 £1.02 million was set aside for this work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While one could worry about the potential of solar power, is it not a fact that we have special advantages in relation to wave power because of the great stretch of our west coast?  I understand that some research is going on at UCD.  Are we spending any significant sums on this project, especially in view of the fact that the British have just given up their rather promising experiments, the Cockrell Raft and so on, which would mean that if we do not do it nobody else is going to do it?  Are we spending real money on the project or do we intend to spend real money on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is considerable potential in this area.  It is estimated that potentially the energy generated by the waves around this island constitutes about three times the amount of energy consumed on the island at present, so the potential is there.  However, the harnessing of that energy is a project which is far ahead.  We are a considerable distance from achieving success in harnessing that energy.  As the Deputy said, we are doing some work in Cork and also in other institutions.</P>
      <P>There are wave measurement projects going on around our coast but, on the basic kind of work involved in this, the major effort is taking place in Japan.  We are participating in that experimentation. We contribute a relatively small amount to it but we are participating in the feed back from it.  I believe that is the area from which there is the greatest liklihood of progress.  I regard it as being a longer term project than some of the others I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision made for State support for the Avoca mining operation is provisional in that a review of the position by the Government is currently in progress.  Otherwise, the provisions shown in the Book of Estimates, which <Col N="1744" /> conform with the overall allocations decided by the Government, are adequate to maintain the level of services provided and I do not expect any staff redundancies to arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to economise on the activities of the Nuclear Energy Board to the extent of £83,000 without laying off staff?  Furthermore, will the reduction of £750,000 in the town gas subsidy mean an increase in prices to consumers in the cities of Dublin and Cork where gas is supplied? Will there be a reduction in the activity of the Geological Survey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go into details of the various subheads.  As I have indicated, it would be more appropriate for debate on the Estimate.  However, the reduction in the subsidy for town gas represents the fact that natural gas is now being supplied to Cork Gas Company and a subsidy is not required.  In regard to the Nuclear Energy Board, the reduction represents an estimated reduction in the requirement for consultancies, not a reduction in staff.  The provision of equipment for the Geological Survey has been held up because its new headquarters are not ready, due to the liquidation of the building firm concerned.  It is now going ahead and the provision this year is estimated to cover equipment which can be installed this year while the building is going ahead.  There will be no reduction in staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention generally in regard to natural gas is that it will be supplied, as the Deputy said, at an energy related price, but it would also be, broadly speaking, competitive with gas oil prices.  The Deputy may be assured that the reduction in the subsidy because it will not be paid in future to Cork Gas Company does not mean an increase in the price of gas in Cork.  On the contrary, it could well mean a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the number of bore-holes drilled off the Irish coast over the past ten years in the search for oil and gas; the location of each bore-hole which has shown traces of hydrocarbons; and the yield in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>59 hydrocarbon exploration wells have been completed off the Irish coast over the past ten years.</P>
      <P>There have been traces of hydrocarbons recorded in most of these wells. However, there is a big difference between a &ldquo;trace&rdquo; and a &ldquo;show&rdquo; of oil, and between a &ldquo;show&rdquo; and a &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. These are terms used in the industry in relation to exploration results which cannot be properly interpreted in isolation from other information and data.  For instance a flow rate is not indicative of the size of the structure in which it occurs. Nor is a relatively high flow rate from one well confirmation that the deposit will prove commercial.  The following information must, therefore, be viewed in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A well drilled in Block 48/25 in the Celtic Sea in 1971 led to the discovery of gas deposits off Kinsale Head.  Two further wells were drilled in 1972 and 1973 to appraise and further delineate the <Col N="1746" /> structure.  These wells were drilled in Blocks 48/20 and 49/16.  This led to the declaration of a commercial gas accumulation off Kinsale Head.  The field came on stream in 1978 and the operator contracted to supply 124 million cubic feet of gas per day over a 20-year period.</P>
    <P>The following wells completed in the Celtic Sea had hydrocarbon flows on test.</P>
    <P>A well drilled in the Ardmore structure in Block 49/13 in 1974 flow tested gas at a daily rate of 119 thousand cubic feet.  A further well in the same structure in Block 49/14 in 1975 flow tested gas at a rate of 8.81 million cubic feet per day.</P>
    <P>In the Seven Heads structure two wells were completed in 1974.  One in Block 48/24 flowed 780 barrels of oil per day on test and up to 10 million cubic feet of gas per day.  The second well, drilled in Block 48/28, flow tested oil at a rate of 1,550 barrels per day.</P>
    <P>These two structures were considered too small and too complex to justify economic development.</P>
    <P>Of the 14 wells drilled to date in the Porcupine Basin three flow-tested hydrocarbons as follows:&mdash; 730 barrels per day from a well drilled on block 35/8 in 1978; 5,500 barrels per day from a well drilled in block 26/28 in 1979; 1,500 barrels per day from a well drilled in 1980&mdash; also in block 26/28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the natural gas field at Kinsale I think the Minister said that 124 million cubic feet per day was what the prospecting company agreed to deliver.  Since then it appears that the field has proved to be larger than expected by about 20 to 30 per cent. Would the Minister say whether it is intended to take this over-supply in the field as an extra amount per day which would bring it up another 40 million cubic feet per day, or extend the life of the field to say 26 or 27 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the estimated reserve is in excess of one-third.  I understand there are certain legal consequences under the agreement signed in relation to it of this increased estimate. One of the consequences is an increase in the amount of gas contracted to be <Col N="1747" /> supplied and to be taken.  So, there is an automatic increase arising under the terms of the contract which I think answers the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this imply that we must take extra gas under the contract or can we extend the life of the field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that we must take a certain amount of extra gas per day depending on the amount of the increase.  We have certain options: we do not actually have to take the gas but we have to pay for it and accumulate it.  We could, perhaps, do that; that is an option open to us, but basically I understand that the increase in the amount of the reserve involves an increase in the amount that we are obliged to take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fundamental policy decision on the part of the Government in relation to our natural resources.  The Government or the Minister must have some view as to whether it is better for the economy to take more now, as opposed to paying for more now, or to extend the life of the field.  What is the Government's view on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the contractual obligation could involve not taking the gas now but paying for it now which would mean that you would have the gas available and paid for in 20 years' time or, making a deliberate decision to pay for the gas and take it out now and absorb it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as that, because there is a question of the cost of the refining contract and the products produced.  It is not a simple comparison of whether you do it here or do it abroad. Other factors including those I mentioned have to be taken into account.  As far as the Irish National Petroleum Company is concerned, they would wish, if possible, to have as much as possible of the oil at their disposal refined in this country.</P>

      <P>It may not be simple for the Minister but it appears to be very simple to the people working in the refinery who see it operated at about 40 per cent of its potential and see their jobs endangered.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if the long-term reduction, not the distortion caused by last year's dispute, in the throughput at Whitegate, is in any way related to the fact that Whitegate's refining capacity does not enable it to reduce the lead content of the petroleum to an acceptable EEC standard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think that is correct nor would I like the House to have any false impression about this matter. The total throughput for 1978 was almost the same as in 1977 and the figure for 1979 was greater than in 1978.  So, the reduction was in 1980 but that has been distorted by the dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy whether, in view of the recent earth tremors in County Wexford, he considers Carnsore Point to be a suitable site for a nuclear power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>According to my information Ireland is classified as a region of low seismicity and the barely perceptible tremors recorded recently in County Wexford are not inconsistent with this classification.  These tremors were very minor and, indeed, such seismic events have been recorded in Wexford as well as other parts of the country over the past few hundred years.  In 1976 the Nuclear Energy Board assessed the ESB's site report and advised that seismicity should not present any significant problem in preparing a safe and stable design for a nuclear power station at Carnsore.  The Nuclear Energy Board have advised me that they see no technical reason for varying this assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree at the same time, in view of the notorious dangers already existing with nuclear stations, that this is a new danger which should rule out Wexford as a possible site for a nuclear power station? This is simply an added risk to the already long list of dangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of arguments as to why there should not be a nuclear power station at Carnsore.  I do not, however, think that this is one of them.  It is weakening the case of those who are against the siting of the station there to rely on this argument.  There is not a basis for it.  The Deputy may be interested to know that the ESB site report, dated October 1974, was considered by the Nuclear Energy Board which, in turn, in September 1976, issued a report, including comments on the ESB report.  Copies of both of these reports were sent by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy on 8 March 1978 to the Clerk of the Dáil, with the request that they be placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Deputies. <Col N="1752" /> I do not know if the Deputy is aware of that fact.  If he is not, he might like to consult these reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point which the Minister has made about there being much more cogent reasons against Carnsore Point nuclear energy station than this particular one.  If he has it in the brief attached to his formal reply would he give us a definition of what the NEB describe as an insignificant problem involving seismicity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the normal design of any nuclear power station would involve a design sufficient to withstand shocks much greater than this, even in the normal way.  The Nuclear Energy Board have indicated, as I said in my reply to the question, that they do not think this would involve any major problem but they have not, in fact, approved the site.  They would require a much more detailed assessment of the specific reactor design to be located at Carnsore before they would approve the site.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister propose to cut the contributions to the various United Nations agencies, not only to last year's levels but even to a lower level than obtained in 1979?  Does he consider the impact which it would have on very reputable organisations such as UNICEF if all Governments were to adopt the attitude which his Government seem to intend adopting in this case?  Further, does he expect that there will be half as many destitute Irish people having to be repatriated from abroad by their Embassy this year as last year, in view of the fact that he has cut that contribution in half?  In view of the increase in travel costs, how does he expect to reduce the amount spent on travel by Irish diplomats by more than £½ million this year on what was actually spent on the same subhead last year?</P>

      <P>On the latter point, I <Col N="1754" /> have already devoted considerable attention towards cutting down costs, in regard to travel particularly, if it is feasible.  As regards the overall question of contributions to international agencies, I have decided as a matter of policy to concentrate on our bilateral aid programme which is increased by 26 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has a great facility for forgetting things.  For the third time, the question is will the Minister agree that the overall figure of £18 million for aid is at least £7 million short of the <Col N="1758" /> figure recommended by his advisory council, £25 million.  It is far short of the figure needed to make any progress towards attaining the target to which, supposedly, we are committed.</P>

      <P>I have made a conscious policy decision to divert funds under this heading towards bilateral aid this year. The allocation to the bilateral aid programme this year is £4.55 million.  It is intended that the bulk of this will be concentrated in positive programmes in countries like Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia.  This allocation represents a 26 per cent increase on the 1980 out-turn, which was £3.6 million.  We have lifted our bilateral aid from £3.6 million to £4.55 million, which represents an increase of 26 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1759" /> Foreign Affairs whether, in order to demonstrate truly to the IRFU that their team and their view are not representative of the Irish people, the Government will consider holding a referendum on the proposal by the IRFU to send a team to South Africa despite the existence of the gravely unjust system of apartheid in that country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the decision of the Irish Rugby Football Union to undertake a tour of South Africa in May does not have the support of the majority of Irish people.  It has been condemned by a wide and representative section of public opinion.  It is opposed by all the political parties in the Dáil, by prominent Church leaders, by trade union leaders and by many other bodies. The Government's opposition to the proposed tour has been expressed on several occasions, most recently in their statement of 3 January and in my reply to Dáil questions on 28 January.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that the holding of a referendum on the issue would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply of 28 January, I am considering a further approach to the IRFU to explain again the Government's policy on apartheid and sporting contacts with South Africa; to inform them of the international reaction to the proposed tour; and to urge them to reconsider their decision in the light of the clear expression of public concern that I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister is having another try with those extraordinary people.  I appreciate it is an extreme and desperate gesture to do this by way of referendum, but would the Minister not feel that he would be more strongly armed in his argument against those people going and disgracing the nation if he had a favourable rely from a referendum telling them that we are all ashamed of what they propose to do &mdash; that the whole Irish people are ashamed?</P>

Since that time the crescendo of condemnation from both sides of this House and outside it has been very clear. Now he has indicated to the House that he proposes to talk to them again.  When does the Minister propose to do that, and in view of the unanimity in this House would he not consider a joint delegation representing all opinions in this House would be useful in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether, in view of the recently reported resumption of sales of lethal military armoury to the military junta in El Salvador, discontinued temporarily following the murder of four nuns, the Government will consider using our new and influential membership of the Security Council of the UN to call on the US to cease supplying such armoury to this junta, one of whose members, General Casanova, is reported to have said that they intend to kill 150,000 Salvadorean citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to recall the reply I gave him to a substantially similar question on his part in the House last month.  I said then that our delegation at the United Nations had played a key role in preparing a resolution, eventually tabled and adopted, which called for the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in El Salvador.  The resolution called on governments to refrain from supplying arms and other military assistance to El Salvador. The resolution requested the Commission on Human Rights to examine at its current session the situation regarding human rights there and we would, of course, be prepared to examine any possible means open to us of helping to alleviate the situation in El Salvador at the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is the most responsible and effective way of expressing our opinions and exercising pressure to ensure that human rights are respected in the tragic <Col N="1764" /> situation which El Salvador finds itself in today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I put down included an extraordinary statement about the genocidal murder of 150,000 citizens of El Salvador.  I agree that we made representations as a member of the United Nations but now we have considerable power in that we are a member of the Security Council.  No doubt there are a lot of untruths on both sides.  The only way we can get at the truth and exercise real power is through our position on the Security Council.  In the light of the appalling situation in El Salvador I ask the Minister to take serious action. America has virtually declared war on this unfortunate tiny country.</P>

Secondly, we are in constant communication with friendly Latin American countries who take the same view as we do.  Two of the countries are represented on the Security Council, namely, Panama and Mexico.  We work within the United Nations and particularly within the Security Council with those two countries and we will be guided by them in whatever appropriate action it may be necessary to take in the Security Council.</P>

Did I understand correctly from the Minister &mdash; I could not quite hear his words &mdash; that we intend in conjunction with the two Latin American countries to raise this matter in the Security Council?  Secondly, have we raised or are we going to raise the matter in the European political co-operation framework?</P>

However, the difficult part is to move in co-operation with our Latin American friends, the people most immediately involved.  We are having informal contacts with the two countries I mentioned in order to decide on the timing of raising the matter in the Security Council.  In the meantime, this matter is down for discussion at the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and we will take an initiative there.</P>

    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When I moved the adjournment of this debate I was dealing with agriculture and I pointed out that this sector of the economy is at a very low level at present.  The Minister for Agriculture, who spoke earlier today, conceded that the years 1979 and 1980 were extremely bad years for agriculture.  The most striking evidence of the low state to which the industry has sunk is that cattle numbers are now back to 1972 levels.  The 1980 report of the Irish Livestock and Meat Board states that the breeding herd is now back to its 1972 level, whereas the beef cow component of the herd is back to the 1971 level.  Could there be more striking evidence of the present state of agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture claim that the sum of £35 million has been injected into the agricultural sector by the budget.  I put on record item by item that instead of £35 million the real provision is at most £22.85 million.  I want to compare the sum of under £23 million provided for agriculture in the budget to the allocation of £80 million for extra public sector pay claims in 1981.  I am sure the amount of £80 million is a moderate one and no more than is necessary.  It is important to note that the public sector pay bill in 1981 has increased by 101 per cent since 1978 while at the same time agricultural incomes have declined substantially both in nominal and real terms by about 40 per cent over that time.  The only solution offered by the Minister for Finance is an exhortation to the farmers to produce more.  His contribution towards <Col N="1803" /> increased production is to tax farmers out of existence by way of income tax, rates, resource tax and special levies and he expects the agricultural community to proceed with confidence.  In the face of all these taxes it is no wonder that there is a complete lack of confidence among them at present.</P>
    <P>I have spelled out clearly that the budget contribution to agriculture is £22.85 million, but let us consider what the same budget will take out of agriculture. Of course this is an inflationary budget and we cannot have exact figures but I am being conservative in saying that it is inflationary to the extent of 3 per cent.  If we accept this figure the immediate result will be the transfer of £30 million from agriculture to the Exchequer. Therefore we find that there is an injection of less than £23 million and a withdrawal of £30 million, leaving agriculture worse off to the extent of £7 million.</P>
    <P>The budget will also increase the cost of processing due to increase in the cost of petrol, oil, excise duty, PRSI charges and post office charges.  Initially these costs may be borne by the processors but finally they will be funded by the farmers by way of lower prices for farm products. The possibility of an increase in wages and salaries above the terms of the second phase of the national understanding must be kept in mind due to the inflationary effects of the budget and this will also affect the processing industry.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the direct effect of the budget on the business of farming is to provide additional gross income in rates and levies amounting to £25.8 million and to withdraw from agriculture £30 million due to the inflationary nature of the budget.  It is inflation which is killing our agricultural industry.  Farmers are accepting increases applicable to low inflation countries and at the same time they are fighting wild inflation here.  This suggests a direct withdrawal of £7 million from agriculture.  The indirect effects of the budget and the effects of indirect taxation on farmers as individuals are ignored for the purpose of what I have been saying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> The benefits in taxes outlined by the Minister on budget day are only part of the budget's plan for managing the State's finance for the year.</P>
    <P>When and if prosperity is restored to agriculture the small farmers must be protected from the cheque book tycoons who are gobbling up small farms that come on the market.  I have noticed that since the change of Government the Land Commission have been winding down and that they are coming virtually to a standstill.  The machinery in the White Paper will not protect the small farmer from the non-farmer or the big farmer.  I have known for some time that the Department of Finance do not understand the workings of the Land Commission, that they think it is some sort of social welfare operation, which it is not, and that they want to wind it up.  The White Paper indicates that, because it says that the Land Commission will not be wound up as it would be necessary for some time to deal with land on hands. When I raised this question in the House over the last three or four years I was told by Minister after Minister that the Land Commission were slowing down in acquisition and devoting all their energies to distributing land on hands.  It was a scandal that they should have kept so much land without distributing it.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture recently asking for particulars of lands acquired and distributed from 1975 to 1980.  On the acquisition side I was told that in 1975 5,518 hectares had been acquired, in 1976 7,618 hectares, in 1977 5,008 hectares, in 1978 4,976 hectares, in 1979 2,602 hectares and in 1980 882 hectares had been acquired. If I had closed my ears I would have thought that the Land Commission staff must have been killing themselves dividing land.  Luckily I had asked for the division figures for the same period and they were that in 1975 14,641 hectares were divided, in 1976 12,549 hectares, in 1977 14,446 hectares had been divided, and then when Fianna Fáil put the pressure onto land division, we find that in 1978 the amount divided was down to 11,652 hectares, in 1979 it was down to <Col N="1805" /> 10,587 hectares and in 1980 it was down to 9,286 hectares.</P>
    <P>What are the Land Commission doing? Have the staff been withdrawn?  They must have been, because I know that Land Commission inspectors do a good job when they are allowed to.  Those are scandalous figures which show that since 1977 the Ministers for Agriculture were bluffing me, the House and the country when they said that the object of winding down the acquisition section was so that the division section could go full steam ahead and get land divided and that the inspectors who were acquiring land should be allowed to divide land.  Not only have the acquisition section come to a full stop, acquiring not even 1,000 hectares in 1980 but division has gone down from 14,446 hectares in 1977 to 9,286 hectares.  We know that the Land Commissioners have on hands something like 60,000 or 70,000 acres.</P>
    <P>In the time left to me I will deal with taxation.  This is an unimaginative budget without innovation.  It is as old fashioned as if my grandmother had introduced it. We have put tax on cars, petrol, drinks and cigarettes; we have something for the old age pensioner to keep body and soul together and that is no more than one would expect in these inflationary times, and then the Government have borrowed the lot.  When Fianna Fáil were in opposition their war cry was &ldquo;job creation.&rdquo; What we hear about now is recession. We hear that all the faults and the problems of the present Government are due to the sheiks and the price of oil.  I concede that the increase on the price of oil causes some of our economic difficulties but why should we exacerbate the condition? If everybody from the Taoiseach down to the lowliest member of a town commission blames the price of oil for our not being competitive and for the loss of jobs and so on, why do they in two successive budgets have so little imagination as to put 20p last year and 15p this year onto the price of a gallon of petrol and onto diesel?</P>
    <P>If some of our complaints are due to the price of oil why does the financial wizard who heads the Government not let his own expertise be known and show <Col N="1806" /> a bit of imagination and get tax from elsewhere if necessary?  The effect of this 20p last year and the 15p this year on petrol and diesel will be inflationary.  It will penetrate through to every section of the economy and will make us less competitive at home and abroad.  That is all the imagination and the innovation that we see in this budget.  We then go to the hardy annuals, as they are called, and find that this year, after last year, drink is taxed and cigarettes are taxed.  It may be said that these are optional purchases. Do we completely forget tourism?  Are we not pricing ourselves out of the tourist market to such an extent that if the púnt had a reasonable value, people could go to England, pay the cost of transporting themselves and their cars and have a cheaper holiday than if they stayed at home?  When people are trying to make up their minds about where they will go on their holidays they consider the cost of petrol and the cost of drink and cigarettes. The tourist industry is being taxed out of business.</P>
    <P>There is a 9 per cent increase provided in the budget for tourism but this is actually a cutback.  If we want to encourage people to come here and we want to turn the weakness of the punt to our advantage we must exploit the tourist market.  Many people regard us as out of our minds because we are taxing things which will drive tourists away.  We have enough difficulties here in attracting tourists and in differentiating between the 26 counties of the Republic and the six counties of the North East without driving up the cost of holidays here.</P>
    <P>The allocation to local tourist boards has been cut this year.  It is difficult to understand that.  The budget demonstrates the mismanagement of the country by the Government over the last four years.  When I spoke about agriculture I said that of the £22 million provided, £3.5 million represents an increase in administration. The following items in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture show a reduction: lime transport subsidy, farm modernisation scheme, marketing, scholarships and training, technical assistance and general disease <Col N="1807" /> control.  We have only one agricultural instructor for every 500 or 600 farmers while in the EEC countries, notably Holland, where our competitors are, there is one for every 200.</P>
    <P>We joined the EEC in the full knowledge that there would be swings and roundabouts and that we could suffer from losses on the industrial swings but if we managed our economy and agriculture properly we would increase considerably on the agricultural roundabouts. We are not fighting hard enough in Brussels for our farmers and we are not organising technical training and supports at home to enable them to compete on the home market.  There are huge quantities of food imported from abroad.  It is a disgrace that in an agricultural country such large quantities of food should be imported.  It shows how badly the country is being managed.</P>
    <P>An increase of 25 per cent has been given to the social welfare recipients.  We must not forget, however, that the cost of living in the last two years has increased by 37 per cent.  I do not believe one can estimate the requirements of the lowest income sector by any yardstick.  It is impossible to say how much it takes to keep an old person who lives alone.  I do not consider that enough has been done for those people.  Fianna Fáil did not reduce the qualifying age for the old age pension.  It had never been reduced from 1907 until the National Coalition Government reduced it on taking office.  During our period in office it was reduced down to 66 years but Fianna Fáil have not reduced it since by even one year.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil talk a lot about their performance in relation to social welfare but it was the National Coalition Government who uplifted the social welfare classes during their period in office.  They gave huge increases in children's allowances and old age pensions.  We gave an allowance for single women who were destitute when we took office.  I welcome what has been done for the social welfare classes but we should not clap ourselves on the back because, like the farmers, they were poor people for far too long. <Col N="1808" /> They have got no more than is necessary to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the restoration of car tax.  The Minister for Finance on budget night stated on television and on radio that it was not a tax, that it was a registration fee.  It does not matter a lot to the person who goes into the tax office to pay £20 whether it is called a registration fee or taxation.  When this tax was removed from cars after Fianna Fáil took office in 1977 car owners were not told that it would be replaced by another tax under a different name.  That is a cynical trick. Maybe the Government thought they should throw it out with Deputy O'Donoghue.  This is the imagination and the innovation of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The PAYE people are worse off under this budget.  Fianna Fáil played on the sympathies and fears of a certain group of young people before the 1977 election and told them they would look after them.  It cannot be denied that a young person who is lucky enough to have a job and who is earning £60, £70 or £80 a week is better off to the extent of £70 per year under the budget.  The first thing he has to pay out of that is about £15 for a stamp. The next thing he has to pay out of that is an extra £10 for his car, because he has to get to work.  That is £25.  The next thing he has to pay is an extra 15p for every gallon of petrol he buys.  Bang goes the £70.  It is gobbled up.  If he takes a drink he has to pay 12p on a glass of whiskey, or 6p on a pint of stout, and if he smokes he has to pay an extra 10p for 20 cigarettes.  This is all before he starts to cater for the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that this budget is inflationary? Is it not a fact that it will generate demands for wages and, if they acceded to &mdash; and it is difficult to see how they will not be acceded to &mdash; the cost of production will go up?  That has to be added to the tax on petrol and oil, and there is hurdy-gurdy going again for the financial wizard of the century.  We will be less competitive at home and abroad, and unemployment will increase.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to see how such a budget could be introduced.  I want to put <Col N="1809" /> on record that this budget is faulty and deceptive.  Minister after Minister has refused to say how the cuts will be justified and where provision is made for inflation.  With the notable exception of the Minister for Energy, who seems to be a sort of independent republic on his own, other Ministers refused to answer. The answer is that with all the taxes and with borrowing of £515 million, the Estimates are inadequate.  Before the end of the year there will either have to be a cutback in the health services, the local government services in every Department, or Supplementary Estimates will have to be introduced.  Last year Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £463 million were introduced.</P>
    <P>There is great speculation as to when the general election will be held.  I would have a bet with anybody that the general election will be held before the normal time for the re-assembly of the Dáil after the summer recess.  If the Dáil re-assembles after the summer recess without a general election, Supplementary Estimates will be flying in and borrowing will be astronomical.</P>

      <P>All budgets create controversy. By their very nature they must create controversy.  It would be virtually impossible for any Minister, no matter what his qualifications were and no matter how excellent he might be, to devise a budget which would be pleasing to everyone.  No Minister could ever hope to introduce such a budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most budgets are reasonably balanced. While they may please a number of people, they probably displease as many others. This cannot be called a balanced budget.  There may be some Deputies on <Col N="1810" /> the other side of the House who would not agree, but practically everybody else agrees that, apart from the fully-deserved increases in social welfare, the rest of the budget has antagonised somebody.  I have been in this House for 15 years.  We had a budget every year and two budgets in some years, so I can safely say I have been here for the introduction of 20 budgets. I never experienced such widespread opposition and so much criticism of any other budget.  Government Deputies pretend that they are pleased with the budget.</P>
    <P>On the day the budget was introduced, and immediately after that, it was quite noticeable from the behaviour and the general attitude of those Deputies that most of them were not very happy about it.  They were wondering if the general election, which has been in the air for some time now, were to be held, what effect it would have on them.  Most of them were not looking forward very anxiously or eagerly to a general election soon after such a budget.</P>
    <P>After the initial shock and fear had abated somewhat, they realised it was their duty as members of the Government party, and in their own best interests as well, to make some pretence of defending the budget.  Listening to them, it was apparent that they not got their hearts in this effort and that they were not speaking what they really believed to be the truth.  Some of them got annoyed and started to blame television, radio and newspaper commentators and accused them of presenting a biased view.</P>
    <P>Newspapers and the media generally report things as they see them and in most cases give a very factual account. Nobody has pinpointed any error in any of the press reports except for Deputy Briscoe, who criticised RTE and stated they reported him wrongly when they accused him of saying that anyone who criticised the budget was anti-national.  I am not saying that he said that, because he corrected it and I accept his explanation. However, it would not be beyond the powers of the Government party to claim that anyone who differed from them was anti-national.  During the war <Col N="1811" /> years somebody suggested to the leader of the then Fianna Fáil Party that in a time of stress and strain, such as the war imposed, he might follow the example of Britain where a national Government was formed.  The reply given was that the only national Government for this country was a Fianna Fáil Government. Everything else was regarded as being anti-national.</P>
    <P>Like most Dublin people my reading is generally confined to the Dublin newspapers, <i>The Irish Press, Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i>.  When I heard the accusations about biased reports I thought I should look at the provincial papers and see if they had a different attitude and if the national daily papers had not given the true facts.  I decided there was no better one to start off with than, as the advertisement says down south, <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, the one they call &ldquo;the paper.&rdquo;  It is a Cork paper and Cork people, whatever their political affiliations, when they congregate together are all Corkmen.  A Corkman will not give a distorted view or in any way misrepresent a fellow Corkman.  In <i>The Cork Examiner</i> there were headline such as: &ldquo;Vintners Horrified at Penal Taxes;&rdquo;&ldquo;Motor Industry Shocked;&rdquo;&ldquo;Farmers Furious;&rdquo;&ldquo;CII Chief Disappointed;&rdquo;&ldquo;Tourism Dealt Another Blow.&rdquo;  I do not think the most fervent Corkman could in any way say that it was loud in its praise of the budget. It must be agreed that a Corkman would be correctly reported in his own paper.</P>
    <P>Why has such an adverse account been given in the different papers?  The papers are correct in their criticism.  Everybody expected that major relief would be given to the PAYE sector.  We all know how sorely these people feel and how they think they are being treated unjustly and compelled to pay an unfair amount of tax.  They got nothing in the budget.  The tax imposed on whiskey, beer and cigarettes can only be termed savage.  It is strange to see that the licensed trade, brewers and distillers, have been criticised for making outrageous profits, but are people aware of how much of the cost of a bottle of whiskey goes between the distillers, wholesalers and publicans?  The <Col N="1812" /> tax on a bottle of whiskey which costs £9 is something over £7 and the amount left is less than £2 to be divided between distillers, wholesalers and the retail trade.  The tax on a gallon of petrol is now 91.4p.  When people fill their cars with a few gallons of petrol they are mesmerised to see the amount that is registered on the pump.  Do they realise that the Government are taking more than half of this in tax?  We all know that an increase in the price of petrol adds to the cost of everything else.  Petrol and oil have to be used for the delivery of all types of goods and services.  When the price goes up everybody has to adjust their price accordingly.  In the final analysis it means an increase for the consumer.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated by experts that the cost of living will be increased by something in the region of 3 per cent as a result of this budget.  That was mentioned before the mini-budget.  I referred to the increase in postal charges.  In some cases these went up by 20 to 25 per cent. This must be taken into account when reckoning what the budget has meant for each individual.  The increase in petrol will have a sobering effect on our already decreasing tourist trade.  Last year I was in Exeter and people there said that they used to come to Dublin for a few days to do shopping but now the prices have become so ridiculous that they cannot afford to do so and have to be content with what they get at home.</P>
    <P>All of these points must be borne in mind by the ordinary wage earner when considering his position with regard to the budget.  Various Deputies on the Government side tried valiantly to point to some ray of sunshine or prospect of relief in the budget.  I noted that the Minister for Education claimed that the farmers in his area were pleased with the budget.  Listening to rural Deputies opposite I am beginning to think that it is only in their areas that farmers were pleased with the budget, because everybody else seems to be up in arms about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment came in and stoutly endeavoured to <Col N="1813" /> defend the budget, but one sentence in his speech demonstrates fully how insincere was his defence, when he said that the Opposition were bereft of any ideas when they say that the allocation to local authorities is inadequate.  I happen to be a member of Dublin Corporation.  At different meetings of that local authority members continually seek improvements in various fields.  But we are told that the corporation just have not got the money, that the corporation receive only a certain allowance from central government funds now that rates have disappeared, and that we must make do with what we have and be satisfied.  It is just too bad when that allocation has been expended.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment was a member of a local authority for a considerable number of years.  He must be as aware as the rest of us that the allocation to any local authority is totally insufficient. One has only to travel around Dublin to see the state of our roads.  If the officials of Dublin Corporation could get sufficient money to improve general conditions and services, they would be only too willing to do so.  Therefore nobody believes that these allocations are in any way adequate.  As a matter of fact, there have been deputations to the Minister and his predecessor.  These deputations have not always been comprised of members of the Opposition; in a fair number of cases members of the Minister's own party have been on those deputations. What is true of Dublin is equally true of practically every other local authority.</P>
    <P>The Government were supposed to have created 80,000 new jobs in the past year but, had they not created those jobs, one wonders what would be the present position with regard to unemployment, which is at present something around 130,000.  When the National Coalition were in Government I remember that Deputy O'Donoghue, when criticising the number of people unemployed continually contended that the official figures were not the true ones, that one must always add anything between 30,000 and 40,000.  On that calculation the present figure could be well over 150,000.  Mark <Col N="1814" /> you, this is the figure after three-and-a-half years of the Government who told us in their manifesto they would reduce and practically eliminate unemployment. I do not know what has gone wrong or how their figures have gone astray, because in no way can they claim that they are making a serious effort at abolishing unemployment.</P>
    <P>They told us also in that manifesto that they would abolish car tax.  According to themselves they abolished car tax but had to have a registration fee of £5 to keep check on the number of vehicles.  I suppose that is understandable.  But after some time that £5 was increased to £10, and in this most recent budget it has gone to £20.  If it continues to double one must ask whether it will be £40 next year and so on.  Indeed, at that rate it would not take very long before car tax would be fully restored.  Of course, they would then contend that the tax has not been restored.  In fact, the Taoiseach told us that there would be very little remaining after administration costs.  However, it is true to say that, whether it be called a tax or a registration fee, the person paying finds it equally painful; its name is immaterial.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to be an expert, nor would I be fully competent to examine all of the provisions of the budget.  Already every detail of this budget has been examined several times.  It has been examined by people who claim to be experts &mdash; people who may or may not be &mdash; and by non-experts.  It is true also that every section of the community has been displeased with it.  Possibly one of the reasons people are displeased with and puzzled by its provisions is that they are wondering why a Government under Deputy Haughey has done such a bad job.  Whatever defects the Taoiseach might have &mdash; and, God knows, he is human like the rest of us and has many &mdash; most people regarded him as a smart and intelligent man.  Having known him over a long number of years, I certainly thought so, too.  But, as he is a smart man and has proved that he knows how to make money, how to count it and spend it &mdash; he has all of those qualifications &mdash;<Col N="1815" /> people are wondering even more why things have gone so wrong under his leadership.</P>
    <P>We all recall his first broadcast on assuming office, but it might be no harm to remind people of some of the things he said in that first speech.  He said that, taking it all together, we have been spending at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing and that to make up the difference we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money and borrowing at a rate which just simply cannot continue.  That was his attitude in his first broadcast.  It is no harm to recall that about this time 12 months ago he said that neither internally nor externally have we been paying our way but that we have been borrowing simply to keep going.  That was how he thought 12 months ago.  Since the government realised they have been borrowing enormous sums simply to keep going, we would be fully justified in asking what has he done about this problem.  At the end of his first year in office he overspent the current account by £547 million and to meet the capital programme he had to borrow £1,217 million.  That is equivalent to a typical family increasing its borrowing by £2,500 every year.  Surely Mr. Haughey should eat his own words.  But the budget projects borrowing for 1981 at no less than £1,296 million.  Is it any wonder that the experts and the would-be experts are puzzled and apprehensive about the future?  Yet we all know and most people still agree that Mr. Haughey is a smart, intelligent man.  But where is all this leading the country?  The suggestion by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald was that the only place it is leading us is to the pawn office. Quite a number of people might agree that he is not far wrong.  If borrowing continues at this rate there seems to be no alternative.  Mr. Haughey is failing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, has a failing in that he cannot think things out or follow them through to the end.  He can see a solution and prescribe a remedy but he lacks the power, the grit and the determination to see them through.  This stems from the fact that he is so concerned with cosmetics and the short term fix that he cannot even take his own advice, never mind anybody else's.  The country is drifting and the Government are reluctant or incapable of taking any initiative or any corrective measures to deal with it.  So the only remedy that seems to be left would be for the Taoiseach to admit that he is either unable or unwilling to carry out the necessary remedy and decide to let the people, in their wisdom, decide who should take over from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened to see the Taoiseach on television defending his budget.  He had all the appearance of being very sincere and very dedicated to the ideals which he propounds.  According to him this budget is a prescription for recovery.  He felt that, although the people might criticise it initially and might try hard to condemn it, when they looked at it fully they would realise that he had been sincere and fully determined to put the country in a sound and prosperous position again.  Most newspapers have disagreed with this and most people seem to agree with the newspapers. He said he understood that the people would endorse the budget fully. <Col N="1817" /> He had an excellent opportunity of putting it to the test only yesterday when Deputy Noel Browne invited him to contest the North Tipperary by-election. This would have been an excellent opportunity for him to see what people thought of his budget.  However, the Taoiseach declined this and gave as his reason that if there was an election the elected Deputy would only be in the House about a year at most.  I remember by-elections here and general elections called very soon after.  In fact that was the case when Deputy Eileen Desmond was elected in a by-election and did not sit before the general election was called.  If the Taoiseach had intended to call a general election there could have been no better chance.  He could call a by-election and if he were to be successful in that by-election it would certainly give him and his party every incentive and every encouragement to go into a general election. We all know how elated and how delighted Fianna Fáil were as a result of the Donegal by-election.  Seeing that that happened in County Donegal, I am sure that a repetition of this in Tipperary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At least Tipperary would be able to give their verdict on the budget and if he were not satisfied with one constituency's verdict he could call a general election and let the country decide.  However the Taoiseach, in his wisdom or otherwise, refrained from taking this opportunity. One is forced to draw the conclusion that being a wise and smart man he felt that at this time there was every chance he would not succeed in either a by-election or a general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Minister of State and two Deputies left in this House and to say anything which has not already been said about this budget would require a greater intellect than I possess. The whole concept of debating a budget weeks after it has been introduced and accepted by the population does not carry much weight in parliamentary terms.  This is something I have been thinking about for some time.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was changed on the assumption that the present occupant of the post would be the person who could work an economic miracle.  Many Fianna Fáil Deputies realised that things were not as they should be and they felt the present Taoiseach would have a better chance of working an economic miracle than anybody else.  That has not happened and it does not appear as if it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House was filled when the Minister for Finance introduced this budget. There was a time when we had an annual budget with specifics laid out for the running of each Department which carried us through the financial year until the introduction of the next year's budget. Times have changed and we have budgets very often.  This budget more than likely will not be sufficient to see us through to the end of this year.  This reminds me of a story where the ship of State is often <Col N="1819" /> portrayed as the Government.  This particular ship of State not alone seems to be in difficulty but it seems to have gone on the rocks.  I could even go further and say that the captain is unable to communicate with the first mate because of the economic fog which has fallen over the country.</P>
    <P>The best summary I heard so far was during the Presidential Inauguration in America when Reverend Mooma announced in verbose terms &ldquo;Oh God, we need you now more than ever before&rdquo;.  The effect of this budget and its interpretation has been criticised by every leader of every organisation of any consequence in the country.  It is a dead duck so far as promotion or investment are concerned.  One could go through each Department and single out what is wrong, what has gone wrong, and one could legitimately ask for drastic action to be taken to improve the position.</P>
    <P>The 1977 manifesto came to my notice again recently.  It makes remarkable reading.  Page 5, section 2 reads:</P>
    <P>Four years of Coalition misrule have left the country in a sorry state.</P>
    <P>If one substitutes, &ldquo;the present Government&rdquo; for &ldquo;Coalition&rdquo; one gets almost the same situation.  Paragraph 3 reads:</P>
    <P>Unemployment has soared to record levels.  There are 160,000 out of work and no jobs for young people leaving schools and colleges.</P>
    <P>The same applies to 1981.  Paragraph 4 reads:</P>
    <P>We have suffered the worst inflation in the EEC.  Prices have gone up by almost 100 per cent since the Coalition took office.</P>
    <P>This could be rewritten but would not be accepted by an electorate that has become remarkably sophisticated and very intelligent when it comes to sorting out who means what in present-day politics. The present Government went so far as to suggest that unemployment would be reduced to 35,000 or 40,000 people by now.  That number can be multiplied by 3.5 and it is still rising.  Prices <Col N="1820" /> were to come down by 1 per cent in 1977, 2 per cent in 1978 and by a further 2 per cent in 1979.  The far-seeing person who wrote this document left 1980 and 1981 blank.  This means we could add all these figures together, multiply them by 40 and we would still not come near some of the price increases which have occurred in the past three and a half years.  The whole concept of government as envisaged by the people when they gave the present Government this tremendous majority has not seen the light of day and things are in a very sorry state.</P>
    <P>I listened to contributions from different Ministers and Opposition Deputies. Each spoke for his own area.  Naturally Opposition Deputies decried the state of the Government and called for action and the Ministers defended to the hilt their Departments and tried to present statistics that seemed to imply everything in the garden was rosy when it was not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that the Taoiseach on 9 January 1980 in his first major television broadcast gave what he saw as his major priorities for the running of this country.  One could be forgiven for assuming that by now we would have a Thirty-two County Republic, that we would have a thriving and confident agricultural industry, that we would have unemployment down to very acceptable levels and that the rate of inflation would have dropped below that in many of our European countries.  This has not happened. The fact that the Government overspent their budget estimates by £200 million last year is indicative of their mismanagement of our economy.</P>
    <P>The latest upsurge in the context of Northern Ireland with the pronouncements by Dr. Paisley seem to present better prospects for the Taoiseach in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I hope and trust that in the months ahead nothing will distract the people from realising that the real issues that face them are inflation, price increases, unemployment and so on, and that they will not be carried away by any emotional upsurges of the age-old call for a Thirty-Two County Republic, especially at a time of imminent general election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> We had a contribution from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Many people in the Department seem to view the work rate of that Minister and his Minister of State as very high and efficient but the facts in relation to the workability of telephones installed and the telephone system in general do not stand up to examination.  I have here a very long letter from a constituent.  It is typical of letters that come to public representatives from constituents in the west.  The letter describes how in times of emergency the parish priest, the garda and himself have to crank their phones simultaneously in order to make a signal strong enough to contact the local exchange in order to get through to whatever number they are trying to get.  He frequently finds that after an ear-piercing whistle the telephone is cut off and he is told to ring back for a test call which possibly never comes through.  The man had many questions to put in relation to the quality of sound also.  I have read the statistics published by the Department about the direct dialling system.  I work upstairs in a room with six other representatives and we have just one outside telephone line and the success rate in an effort to dial Galway or Tuam is nothing like it should be.  If we contact the operator we are told about pressure on the lines and that the lines are engaged.  It is virtually impossible to make any significant progress in that phone call.</P>
    <P>I know that both Ministers have committed themselves to bringing in a high level of technology and sophisticated equipment but I hope that in doing so they will back it up with the necessary trained staff to service it.  Many telephones are installed but many do not work and the maintenance people have not sufficient time to carry out the necessary repairs or to maintain all the telephones installed.  This constituent also claims that a noise cuts in during a conversation so that he is forced to speak rapidly when the line is clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter is typical of letters that come to Oireachtas representatives from the west.  This type of thing does not bear out with what the Minister is saying about progress.</P>
      <P>We have about 40,000 young people under 25 years out of work.  This is a terrible situation especially since the Taoiseach stated that we have a bright, young, intelligent and well-educated population who should be looked after and who should have every opportunity to avail themselves of jobs equal to their aspirations.  This is not the case.  My county development team produced figures which show that 2,000 jobs per year must be created in County Mayo alone to cater for people under 20 years of age. That has not been achieved and apparently will not be achieved.  It will have a bearing on the attitude of many people towards the Government when they have the opportunity to exercise their franchise.</P>
      <P>The budget provision for primary schools is also inadequate.  The INTO have drawn up a list of substandard schools and have carried out a very vigorous campaign to have repairs carried out.  Many of the schools &mdash; and some of them not very old &mdash; have rotted from their foundations.  I do not know if that is because of the lack of quality in the materials used but, whatever the cause, we have many substandard schools.  If schools are to be considered an extension of our homes children should not be sent to schools which are far lower in standard than their homes.  The Minister for Education and his Department should have another look at the amount of money allocated to the primary sector.  Primary teachers must bring children to the level where they have the basics of reading and so on, so that when they progress to second level education they will be able to take on work other than what they had from primary teachers.  Primary teachers shoulder an onerous burden of responsibility especially when one considers that pupil-teacher ratios are far too high, particularly in urban schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> The other night we debated a motion about young people and drink.  The increase in the price of drink will have a more serious effect on the numbers drinking than has been estimated by the Government.  Publicans say that there was a significant drop in the number of consumers and that this will drop even further during Lent.  The Irish Distillers Group published a letter which said that, for example, on a bottle of whiskey costing £9 the Government took over £7 in tax.  This is an enormous amount of taxation. Many old age pensioners like to take a drink in the evenings with friends but they will increasingly find it beyond their means to do so.  Social welfare benefits were increased by 20 per cent and it is very welcome.  Although that is above the inflation rate at present, by this time next year the real value of the increase will not have meant much to an old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture in the 12 western counties, confidence is at a very low level as farmers feel that they have been sold out.  Opportunities for investment on a long-term scale are decreasing and the performance of our farmers will drop as a result.  Where there is decreased output, a very unstable market and a lack of guaranteed markets and profits, people will become apathetic.  Unless strong leadership is provided and urgent action is taken the performance of small farmers, particularly in the west, will drop to a very unacceptable level.</P>
    <P>There are many contradictions in relation to agriculture.  For instance, an old age pensioner aged 69, who is a very hard worker with a reasonable number of cows on his farm, applied for an old age pension and was refused point blank.  On the one hand the Minister for Agriculture says that they should increase output and get into milk because it is the only way they can compare incomes with people from the southern counties and on the other hand the Minister for Social Welfare says that, if the farmer gives up and sits down and watches television all day with a free licence, he will give him a full pension.  That is not right.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to industry is <Col N="1824" /> serious.  There are threatened and actual redundancies in many industries.  Even if there are not actual redundancies there is a complete lack of confidence which results in a lowering of the morale of people working in industry.  This can have serious consequences for industrial production and for exports.  In relation to western development the IDA have done a magnificent job over the last few years. It has not been clearly recognised that foreign industrialists have come here not just because of the pressure and the incentives offered to them by the IDA but because of the potential in western areas to cater adequately for their needs and where a minimum amount of facilities to cater for their industry are needed. This has been proved time and time again by the introduction of highly sophisticated and very welcome industries on a large scale in western counties.</P>

      <P>It would be appropriate for me to explain, first of all, the provision in the Estimates in regard to repatriation and maintenance of the destitute Irish persons abroad referred to.  If an Irish person goes abroad, usually on holiday, and finds himself suddenly without funds, if he can contact the Irish Embassy in the country in which he is so in difficulty the Irish Embassy have funds available to them to get such a person back to Ireland.  The usual situation would be where people are, for instance, robbed while on holiday of funds that they brought to maintain them or in some other way lose the money available and they find themselves in trouble and have not the money to get home or to live in the country in which they find themselves. <Col N="1825" /> In the past the Irish Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs have provided a sufficient amount of money to enable these people to be brought home.</P>
      <P>The number of Irish people going abroad on holiday is increasing very rapidly one year on the next.  More people went abroad on holiday last year than in any other year in our history and I think that last year's record will be exceeded this year.  Quite clearly there is a need for an increase in the funds for the repatriation of such people because there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any diminution of the risks attendant on foreign travel by Irish holiday-makers either in the form of their being robbed or in the likelihood that they might lose their funds for some other reason.  Therefore, I am very concerned that the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Estimates for this year has provided substantially less money, barely more than half as much, for the repatriation of Irish people abroad than was actually spent last year. In 1980 the total provision under this heading, taking into account both the original Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate, amounted to £45,000.  This year the provision is a mere £26,000 which is substantially less, and this year's provision is not only substantially less than the amount spent last year, it is substantially less even than the amount spent in 1979 because in that year £36,000 was spent on the repatriation of Irish people abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of particular concern to me is that this House, assuming no intervening political events which upset normal processes, will go into recess some time in June and that will be before the period when the bulk of Irish holiday-makers will be abroad. The amount of £26,000 quite clearly is insufficent in view of the expenditure last year and the likelihood is that this House having gone into recess there will be no opportunity to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to make additional funds available to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department during the summer of this year might not be in a position to have sufficient funds under <Col N="1826" /> this subhead to repatriate Irish citizens. If that were to happen it would be a very serious and worrying situation because one of the attributes of sovereignty is that a country has the facilities to protect its own citizens abroad.  If we are not providing sufficient funds for the repatriation of Irish people who get into difficulty, as quite clearly we are not this year, we are abrogating our responsibilities and rendering almost nugatory the provision whereby passports are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs which invite people in foreign countries to respect the bearers of the passports and which extend to the bearers of the passports the protection of the Irish Government in whatever part of the world they may find themselves.  We are rendering ourselves liable to be accused of repudiating the responsibilities which the Government have taken on themselves by issuing passports if by reducing to almost half last year's level the funds available for the repatriation of destitute Irish persons abroad we are rendering ourselves incapable of giving to those people the basic assistance that is their right as bearers of Irish passports.</P>
    <P>I would point out for the information of the House that this is not a gift which is given to these people.  When they come home they have, of course, to refund to the Department whatever money they have been given.  Naturally there would be a delay but this takes place, and in some cases the full refund would not be made.  Therefore, a provision is necessary and the provision necessary last year under this head was £45,000 and only £26,000 is provided this year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister what arrangements he proposes to make if this money proves to be, as is likely, insufficient. Does he intend to introduce a Supplementary Estimate this summer to add to the money which is being provided here?  If he has already formed the intention of so doing he is in that sense denying the content of his original reply to this question which was that the provisions contained in this Estimate are adequate. He cannot say that he will introduce a Supplementary Estimate this summer and at the same time say that the existing <Col N="1827" /> provisions are adequate.  If he says that the £26,000 is adequate I would be grateful if he would explain exactly how he proposes to make savings on this head against the amount spent last year.  Does he propose to make less money available? Does he propose to pay only half people's fares?  Does he propose to restrict the conditions under which assistance is made available to destitute persons abroad?  It behoves the Minister to give a very precise answer to these questions because otherwise, as I have said, we will not be affording the protection to Irish citizens travelling abroad which the issue to them of an Irish passport implies will be available.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that the shadow Minister for Finance would welcome the sort of assiduous paring down of the Estimates with regard to which we in the Department of Foreign Affairs engaged with a view to cutting costs in a practical and constructive manner.  To get this matter into perspective, I am glad to say, in regard to these funds in respect of repatriation of Irish citizens that there is a very high rate of recovery from the people concerned and their families.  The actual refund recovery rate is of the order of 80 per cent.  Eighty per cent of the money that is spent by our embassies abroad is recovered.  Some of the money in this respect is recovered almost immediately. I propose to improve substantially the procedures whereby the money can be got immediately from the family here whose relative or friend is in trouble financially while abroad.  Eighty per cent of these cases are not cases of distress but of casual shortage arising by reason of some emergency, problem or delay.  If we substantially improve procedures for immediate collection at home in regard to the family, one can effect a very real reduction in the amount required under this subhead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making <Col N="1828" /> is that the recovery rate of 80 per cent overall is good, but this represents a period of time.  Because of the high recovery rate, we have evolved a procedure, which we intend to extend and develop, of immediate recovery, without any expenditure whatever, in the sense that one can give at embassy level to the person concerned and recover immediately at home, if the follow up is effective.  We see the very real prospect of a practical saving in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that what we did in regard to my Estimate &mdash; other Ministers have done so also &mdash; is to go through each one with a fine comb.  The Deputy will see where a saving can be effected here by an immediate collection from the family at home related to the person in need.  We are not talking about people in distress, who amount to only 20 per cent.  In 80 per cent of cases, they are people who can afford to pay or their relatives or friends can afford to pay.  If the immediate inquiry is made from them, one can straight away meet the cost and there is no particular Exchequer commitment.  That is one area of practical improvement which I have researched and where we can make an effective improvement in regard to expenditure.  It is far better than having an open-ended commitment to paying out automatically, accompanied by a slow and tardy procedure of recovery of the money involved. If we expedite the recovery period, we can balance it out to the extent of 80 per cent and thereby effect a saving.  We intend to develop this procedure over the next 12 months and I hope to be here this time next year to show how effective it has been.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that there was an unduly inflated figure last year to the extent of about £10,000 of the £45,000, owing to the blockade of French ports by fishermen in July, at the height of the holiday season, which caused considerable financial harassment for many Irish visitors to Europe.  That accounted almost entirely for the supplementary estimate of £9,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reassure Deputy Bruton that no Irish citizen will be prejudiced in any way in this respect.  It is a fundamental <Col N="1829" /> duty of our embassies abroad to look after our citizens.  Whether we improve the recoupment procedure in the manner I have mentioned, from the relatives and friends at home or from some other subhead, within the overall vote, that is our problem and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However the money is procured, no Irish citizen will suffer because of lack of finance if he or she approaches an Irish embassy in a foreign country.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954 (Amendment) which requires that a report on a licensed archaeological excavation be sent to the Minister for Finance.  However, it is a condition of each licence to excavate that a report on the excavation and the results thereof shall be furnished to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Regarding the four archaeological excavations referred to in the question a report was received on the excavations at Coomatloukane, County Kerry, and there is a reference to these excavations in the Journal of the Kerry Archaeological and Historical Society (No. 3-1970). Reports have not been received on excavations at Behy, County Mayo, Sullivan's Quay, Cork or Lough Gur, County Limerick. In the case of Behy, County Mayo, the excavator died some years ago but his papers are being examined by some of his former associates with a view to publication of a report.  Reports on excavations at Sullivan's Quay and Lough Gur are expected shortly.  No further excavation licences have been applied for by the licensees in the latter two cases.</P>

    <P>(i)  <i>The Public Service Pay</i> figures used in these calculations cover the pay of civil servants.  Defence Forces, Garda Síochána, teachers and &mdash; since 1975 &mdash;all staff in the Health Services.  The pay figures used do not include the pay element in grants to State-sponsored bodies and universities.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Pay in the Health Services:</i> From and including 1975.  Public Service Pay has been reclassified to include all pay in the Health Area; previously the pay element in grants to Voluntary Hospitals and Homes was not classified as Public Service Pay.</P>
    <P>(iii)  <i>The Financial Year</i> was converted to a calendar year basis effective from 1 January 1975.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The <i>1974/75</i> Government Expenditure figure used in these calculations was derived by combining expenditure for the interim financial period April-December 1974 with returns for the January-March quarter of 1975.  The Public Service Pay figure used for 1974-75 is the Budget Pay Estimate which was prepared for the year 1974-75.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>Budget Out-turn figures</i> are shown in all cases, with the exception of data relating to 1974-75. 1980 figures are still provisional.</P>
    <P>(vi)  <i>Current Government Expenditure</i> figures are as set out in Table 2 of the Pre-Budget Tables. From and including 1976, these figures have been revised to reflect the reclassification in 1981 of certain expenditure items as capital &mdash; see the note on Table 2 of the 1981 Pre-Budget Tables.</P>

All increases granted in 1980 were in accordance with these criteria.

This figure includes the increased cost of £137 million attributable to special pay increases of public service pay and pensions (that is the pay and pensions of civil servants, Defence Forces, Garda, teachers and employees in the health area) in addition to the amounts included for pay in grant-in-aid to certain State bodies and colleges.  It is not possible at this stage to predict the cost of special pay increases in 1981 and 1982.

      <P>I would like to advise the Deputy, however, that some annuitants have already satisfied the conditions for non-contributory old age pension which gives entitlement to free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance.  I should also mention that I am aware that other annuitants have, in the past, exceeded the statutory means limit for non-contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of improvements in recent years in the assessment of income from capital and extensions to the upper means limits it is possible that some annuitants who have not hitherto qualified may now qualify for non-contributory pensions which give underlying title to the free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance schemes. Such annuitants should therefore apply to have their old age non-contributory pension entitlement investigated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the credit, if any, allocated by his Department to other Departments under each Vote in the Book of Estimates in respect of payments made to his Department which exceeded the actual cost of providing postal and telecommunication services by those Departments; the periods in respect of which the over-payments were made; the amount of the over-payment in each case; and if a full corresponding reduction was made in the provision for appropriations-in-aid in the vote for his Department for 1981 to take account of the amount of credits granted to other Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department send accounts in the ordinary way to other Government Departments for telecommunications <Col N="1796" /> services provided for them and no overpayment or adjustment arises in respect of these services.</P>
      <P>So far as postal services are concerned Government Departments pay my Department the amount provided for in their Vote; this figure is based on the estimated volume of traffic for the year adjusted in respect of overpayments and underpayments for previous years.  Firm cost figures are arrived at from traffic counts taken during the year and any necessary adjustments are made in the Estimates for a subsequent year.  The adjustments in 1981 are greater than usual because postal traffic in 1979 was considerably less than expected owing to the long postal strike.</P>
      <P>The following statement shows the amount of credits allowed to Government Departments when preparing their estimate of expenditure on postal services for 1981:&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for the Environment if home improvement grants of £760 have been allocated to a person (details supplied) in County Cavan; if he is aware that requests have been made for the inspection and payment of these grants; the reason for the delay to date; and if he will pay the grants allocated on the basis that a substantial amount of work has been done as it may not be possible to complete the work as the house is occupied by elderly ladies.</P>

      <P>Grants totalling £760 have been allocated to the person named.  While there is no record in my Department of any request from the applicant for an inspection of the works with a view to payment of the grant, I regret that due to the huge volume of applications and correspondence being processed, a request from the Deputy for payment of an instalment of the reconstruction grant was overlooked.  However, an early inspection has been arranged with a view to payment of an instalment, if in order. Before the full grants can be paid, all work specified by my Department must be carried out.  The Deputy will be kept informed of developments.</P>

    <P>The results indicate a decline in the level of vacancies in, all the key occupations except systems analyst since the replies to similar questions in 15 February, 1979 and 6 March, 1980.  This decrease is attributable to a number of factors, including the recruitment of key workers from abroad and the inflow of graduates from conversion courses to the work force.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service, in consultation with the Confederation of Irish Industry, is arranging to conduct a twice yearly survey of vacancy levels in key occupations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all Government expenditure relating to the building industry is of a capital nature.  In the case of Ireland, out of a total Public Capital Programme provision of £1,733 million for 1981, £1,043 or 60 per cent relates to the building industry.  This compares with 58.5 per cent in 1977.  Corresponding information is not available for the other member states of the EEC.  The Annual Bulletin of Housing and Building Statistics for Europe, published by the United Nations, does not give this information and it seems that the EEC does not publish the information in the form requested.</P>
