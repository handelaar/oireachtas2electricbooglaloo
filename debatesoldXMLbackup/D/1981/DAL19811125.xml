      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5, 11, 12, 2, 13, 14 and 6.  Private Members' Business, No. 21 (resumed), will be taken between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy Kieran Doherty, a member for the Constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>

      <P>According to Standing Order No. 48, no Member shall reopen a discussion on a question already discussed during the preceding six months.  According to the Standing Order the motion for the issue of the writ may not be moved again until six months from the date on which it was originally moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the six months rule did not apply to a representative in this House of the constituency concerned.  I understood the rule covered such things as the putting down of questions <Col N="202" /> and other business of that kind but not the very rare occasions on which Dáil vacancies occur and writs have to be moved for the filling of these vacancies. One of the chief arguments used by the Taoiseach when we moved the writ on the last occasion was that the legislation to introduce the payment of £9.60 per week to housewives would occupy a long period between then and Christmas.  That now is not to be brought to the House before Christmas and consequently the main reason offered by the Taoiseach on the last occasion for not allowing the writ to be moved has been removed.</P>

      <P>I would bring to the Deputy's attention that in regard to the six months rule a precedent was created by a very experienced predecessor of mine, the late Deputy Hogan, when he allowed a writ to be moved again after two-and-a-half months, I think for a Cork by-election.  Whatever I may decide after two-and-a-half months, I could not allow the motion to be moved within a shorter period.  The Deputy will remember that the motion for the issue of this writ was moved on 21 October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair and I understand your dilemma.  If two-and-a-half months is your precedent it should not preclude the present occupant of the Chair from making it five weeks.  I accept the ruling but I have a feeling that, due to the attention &mdash; and we are flattered by it &mdash; being paid to our constituency by members of the Government, perhaps the Government will accept the motion now without any further ado.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> Protection of Young Persons (Prohibition on Employment of Children) Order, 1981</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 10th July, 1981.</P>
    <P>The motion seeks the approval of Dáil Éireann for a draft order under section 4 (6), (b) of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, to prohibit the employment of children over 14 and under 15 years of age during school terms except second level students participating in work experience or other similar educational courses arranged or approved of by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act generally prohibits the employment of children, that is persons under 15 years.  However, the Act provided for the employment of children over 14 and under 15 years for specified periods during school terms and also for specified periods during school holidays. When the Act was introduced in 1977 there was considerable debate on the issue of children working during school term.  Those opposed to the employment of children during school term pointed to the fact that work for the under 15s could have a detrimental effect on their education. Those arguing for such employment pointed to the economic necessity of children to supplement family incomes and the need for those who will be leaving school at 15 to get to know the world of work.</P>
    <P>The Act stipulates that children between 14 and 15 years of age can do light non-industrial work which should not be harmful to their health or moral development and must not prejudice their performance or attendance at school.  The Act therefore in my view attempted to strike a balance between the two opposing viewpoints.  On the one hand it outlawed the general employment of children between 14 and 15 on a full-time basis, yet allowed them to work limited hours if such work did not affect their development or education.  The compromise eventually agreed was that the provisions which permitted children between 14 and 15 to work during school <Col N="204" /> terms would lapse after two years unless the provisions were extended on an annual basis by affirmative order. Affirmative orders were made extending the life of the provisions in 1979 and in 1980.  The provisions finally lapsed on 4 July 1981.</P>
    <P>It is my view that children between 14 and 15 cannot work for up to two hours a day during school term without such work affecting their physical and mental development.  For this reason I am proposing that such work for children between 14 and 15 be completely outlawed. While children are compulsorily attending school, I believe that everything possible must be done to ensure that they benefit to the greatest extent possible from such education.</P>
    <P>I would point out that children will still be free to work for the periods specified in the Act during school holidays should they choose to do so.  I believe the present order considerably improves the legislation. A further problem which remains to be tackled is the problem of enforcement of this legislation and I am at the moment examining ways in which this can be improved both administratively and by way of amending the original Act if necessary.</P>
    <P>I also believe the terms of the legislation need once more to be brought to the attention of the public in general as almost everybody should in some way be affected by this legislation, especially young people, parents, employers, teachers, youth clubs and trade unions.</P>
    <P>A campaign to bring the terms of the legislation to the attention of the public was mounted when the original legislation was passed and I believe the time is now ripe once more for such a campaign. Following a review of how enforcement of the legislation can be improved it would be my intention to undertake such a campaign.  I commend the Order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say on behalf of the Opposition that we welcome this motion for the protection of young people and for the prevention of the employment of school-going children between 14 and 15 years.  When the Act <Col N="205" /> was going through the House in 1977 it was argued that, in certain cases, children would have to be employed in order to supplement the income of the home.  The most important years of people's lives are the years when they are attending school. It is wrong to allow or to encourage children under 15 years of age attending school to take up employment.  I am glad the House realises that.  At a time when we have 35,000 young people unemployed there should be no need for children of that age to seek employment.</P>
      <P>Some children receiving second level education have to attend courses to gain experience.  I am glad the Minister said it is necessary to bring this order to the notice of the public.  We are all aware that young people attending school are being employed at the moment.  Whether the parents or the employers are to blame I cannot say, but collectively all are to blame.  We legislators must ensure by every means at our disposal that these young people are not in employment because we all know it affects their education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  We seem to be in total agreement.  I am well aware of the economic necessity which may exist in many cases and which forces young people under 15 years of age to work during school terms.  On balance, however, I believe the course I am proposing is the correct one.  Young people must be able to take full advantage of the period of compulsory education.  For many it may well be the only education they will get.  I have no doubt that they will not be able to take full advantage of it if they are allowed to work all the year round which many are forced to do at the moment.  I am glad the House is accepting the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this order, has the Minister taken into consideration the fact that the son or daughter of a working-class family may need to have this kind of employment?  I worked when I was 14 years of age.  I am totally opposed to the abuse of young people in employment.</P>
      <P>When we talk about youth employment during school term, is the Minister aware that in practice the benefit of whatever is paid by the State goes mainly to the families of well-off people?  In the case of employment in State companies or other State bodies during the school term, that employment is availed of by well-off families and it is not the families of working class people who benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas what the Deputy says may have some merit, it is my belief that, during school term, children between the ages of 14 and 15 years should not be allowed to work.  Previously they were allowed to work for two hours under the Act but we know that two hours was the minimum.  It is very difficult to police that type of thing.  We are now saying that during school term parents who allow their children to work will be breaking the law.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major commitments in the Programme for Government 1981-86 is the undertaking to establish at an early <Col N="207" /> date a youth employment agency.  The Government are concerned that our young people are spared the effects of long spells of forced inactivity.  The opportunity to translate that element of Government policy to reality is something which I very much welcome.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office as Minister for Labour and Minister for the Public Service I have given a very high priority to the early establishment of the Youth Employment Agency.  A lot of work has already been accomplished and I am hopeful that, with the co-operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Youth Employment Agency Bill will be given a quick passage so as to permit the early establishment of the agency and the urgent commencement of the nationally important work which it has to do.</P>
    <P>The persistent growth of youth unemployment in Europe since the early seventies has called into question many assumptions which could previously be safely made.  Now the prospects for obtaining employment and the possibility of having what was seen before as a normal working life span are, increasingly, uncertain.  That uncertainty has been heightened by the pace of technological change and its application through all sectors of enterprise.  These developments have coincided with the emergence of an increasingly sophisticated youth population, determined to participate fully in all facets of our modern industrial society and, in particular, to realise the high expectations which it sets itself for satisfying, rewarding and durable working lives.</P>
    <P>There is a very important job to be done in seeking to align job expectations with the reality of what working life has to offer.  The educational system must be able to produce at all levels people who are equipped with the skills and aptitudes for which there is a demand in the working world.  To do this there must be a much greater degree of interaction between those responsible for the formulation of educational and training policies and those who chart the course of industrial development in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> The proposed Youth Employment Agency will have a very important task to discharge in bringing about this conjunction and so improving on the present situation where often the job aspirations of our young people bear little relationship to industrial requirements.  The emphasis of our educational system now leans heavily towards academic rather than vocational skills.  While some efforts have been made to remedy this imbalance they have lacked real conviction and consequently their impact has not been significant.  As a result, a large number of school leavers fail to secure employment because of the inappropriateness or inadequacy of their vocational preparation.</P>
    <P>An examination of our approach to date to overcoming the problem of youth unemployment quickly points up a patchwork of training, work experience and educational measures.  These stand apart from any coherently planned approach or strategy.  Their only common thread is that they aim to make young people more employable through enhancing their skills and aptitudes.  There is general agreement that there are wide variations in the effectiveness of the different programmes in achieving their objectives. Despite this there is no effective monitoring of results or, indeed, any co-ordination of the activities of programme sponsors to channel efforts and change emphasis as circumstances require. Clearly this disparate approach is unsatisfactory and wasteful of resources.  It exists in the absence of any central authority which has a mandate to bring a unified and concerted approach towards assisting in the solution of the problem of youth unemployment.  I am proposing that this task be assigned to the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>Unemployment among young people is high because unemployment is high in the community overall.  The level of unemployment has risen rapidly in the present recession which began at the end of 1979.  By the end of October, seasonally adjusted unemployment was 56 per cent higher than in December 1979. Youth unemployment has risen even faster; while seasonally adjusted figures are not available, the actual number of <Col N="209" /> unemployed aged under 25 is now over 80 per cent higher than in January 1980.</P>
    <P>It is clear that young workers fare relatively badly when there is a sharp, sudden rise in overall unemployment.  Not only are jobs lost in a recession, there is also a fall-off in the number of new jobs created as even successful firms postpone new investment.  In addition, fewer older workers are willing to leave their present jobs for fear of being unable to find alternative employment.  As a result, the number of job vacancies shrinks, and young people looking for their first job are faced with particular difficulties.  It is equally true that youth unemployment can be expected to fall more rapidly in the recovery from a recession.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it is encouraging that unemployment has been rising more slowly in recent months, with the rate of increase since the end of April being under 1 per cent per month as compared with 2 per cent per month between December 1979 and April 1981.  While the international outlook is unclear, some recovery in demand in the major European countries is likely in the coming year.  As this recovery feeds through into increased Irish exports, young people will benefit from the associated increase in employment.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the present recession, unemployment during the seventies in the western economies has been substantially higher than in the previous decade. Economic growth has been slower than during the sixties, and the international recovery from the recession which followed the oil-price increases in 1973-74 was particularly hesitant even before it was cut short by the further shocks of 1979.  Meanwhile, population shifts and social change led to rapid increases in the numbers available for work, with the inevitable result of markedly higher unemployment levels.</P>
    <P>As a small and extremely open country, Ireland suffered more than most from these trends.  Despite the boost given to agricultural and other exports by entry to the EEC, we shared in the generally lower economic growth worldwide. Moreover, our labour force grew particularly rapidly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> The number of retirements has been low, because the generation reaching retirement age is one which was heavily depleted by mass emigration in earlier years.  On the other hand, the number of children born each year rose rapidly during the sixties, and these children are now reaching working age.  Their numbers have been added to by the steady inflow of children born abroad who accompanied parents returning to Ireland after a period of emigration.</P>
    <P>Our labour force has therefore grown even more rapidly than other countries. We are unique, too, in that the numbers available for work are likely to grow steadily well into the nineties.  Our major EEC partners will experience static or declining workforces from the mid-eighties onwards.  We face a relatively daunting task in providing jobs for all our people, not just the young.</P>
    <P>In all countries for which statistics are available, unemployment among teenagers and young adults has always been higher than among older workers, even in good times.  Young job-seekers lack many of the skills and abilities which come only with some experience of working life.  A larger number of the young jobless at any time are in fact looking for their first job, making the difficult switch between the rather different rhythms and disciplines of school or college and the work-place.  They face choices between different occupations and working environments which older workers have already made, and may change jobs several times, with intervening periods of unemployment, before they find their niche.</P>
    <P>These factors are balanced to some degree by the greater flexibility of young people, who do not generally have dependants or own their accommodation. They can move more readily to areas where jobs are available, can take greater risks in search of the right job than can older workers who must have a constant concern for the material welfare of dependant families.  On balance, however, younger people are in a relatively weak competitive position in the labour market.</P>
    <P>One often ignored point I wish to make <Col N="211" /> in relation to the nature of the youth unemployment problem is to do with timing. In the normal course of events, new jobs are created and existing jobs become vacant fairly steadily throughout the year.  However, the vast majority of our young people leave the educational system in a brief spell during the summer and commence serious job seeking in autumn.  Even in a situation where all school leavers were destined to find jobs, some at least would have to wait a matter of some months until these jobs become available.</P>
    <P>While young workers who lose their jobs do not generally remain unemployed for long periods, a minority of them do face the problem of long-term unemployment. The most recent available information relates to October 1980, when just under one-third of the young unemployed had been on the live register for six months or more.  If this ratio has remained constant, we can estimate that there are up to 12,000 young people in this category at present.  Long-term unemployment is a major problem in itself, and one which has been growing in severity in recent years, and it is of particular concern for the future that our young people should undergo such a demoralising experience at the start of their working lives.</P>
    <P>In summary, we face not one, but several unemployment problems, each affecting young people to a greater or lesser degree.  We face a medium to long-term task of generating jobs for a rapidly growing labour force.  We have an immediate problem of extremely high unemployment, after the rapid rise in the live register during 1980 and 1981.  This has affected young people particularly badly.</P>
    <P>There is a need for better provision for the transition from education to working life.  We have a substantial number of young people who are out of work for long periods.  Such young people are likely to have left school early and to have few or no formal qualifications.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear, I feel that the main plank of any policy to reduce youth unemployment must be a sustained. <Col N="212" /> attack on the scourge of unemployment at all levels in our society.  For Ireland, this requires continued growth in our exports of goods and services.  Increased exports are vital in view of the sharp deterioration in our balance of payments position in the last few years.  Export growth must also be the engine for the creation of the new jobs which are going to be needed in the years to come.</P>
    <P>While the present and future activities of the IDA and other development bodies will go some way towards the necessary expansion in our productive capacity and in exports, the Government are convinced that further initiatives are needed.  The major initiatives along these lines, as outlined in the Programme for Government, will be the setting up of the National Development Corporation.  The corporation will have great long-term importance in the task of increasing productive employment.  One of its main aims will be to ensure that the exploitation of stable commercial opportunities in either the private or public sector will not be constrained by undercapitalisation. Much of the corporation's investment will be directed to new growth sectors where progress in the past has been inhibited for this reason.  The corporation will have a central development role, with powers to identify and initiate commercial investment opportunities either on its own or in joint ventures with existing State and private capacities.</P>
    <P>A major challenge facing us is the optimum utilisation of the massive investment we have made over the years in our commercial State enterprises.  The work of the corporation in promoting efficiency in this area will help develop a professional, vigorous and successful State sector which can contribute greatly to the growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>Export growth will depend to a great extent on improved competitiveness and efficiency.  The NDC, along with other Government policies for improved efficiency in the public service at large, will play a major part in our drive towards these objectives.</P>
    <P>Balanced and self-sustaining output and employment growth will do much to <Col N="213" /> improve the youth employment situation. It will still be necessary to come to terms with those features of our society and its institutions which lead to higher unemployment among young people than among older adults.</P>
    <P>Even with high rates of economic growth, the sheer number of young people entering the labour market each year, allied to the special problems of first-time job seekers, will continue to require special measures.  A range of such measures, already in existence, will cater for up to 20,000 young people this year.</P>
    <P>It is expected that during 1981-5,000 young people will take part in the National Manpower Service's Work Experience Programme; 10,000 young people will be trained in AnCO's general training programmes, with a further 2,000 apprentices; 1,700 young people will participate in AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme.</P>
    <P>A further 1,000 people have been engaged in schemes run by the Departments of Education and of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Additional funds have been provided for several of these programmes in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Allied to measures taken within the educational system, such as the introduction and expansion of pre-employment courses, these programmes constitute a sizeable effort to aid the young unemployed and those about to leave school.</P>
    <P>Even with this level of State support, the present high level of youth unemployment dictates that additional resources be made available.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of inadequate funding, a major problem with existing programmes is the lack of co-ordination between them.  Here, as in other countries, the recognition of youth unemployment as a major policy concern in the mid-1970's led to a series of <i>ad hoc</i> responses.  The range of schemes now open to our young unemployed illustrates this point.  Some training courses run for periods of up to a year, others for a matter of weeks.  Some have an element of work experience, others take place entirely in a training centre environment. In some cases the objective of schemes is <Col N="214" /> simply to provide short-term employment with a rudimentary element of learning-by-doing, and the continuity of employment offered varies from area to area.</P>
    <P>On occasions the fact that programmes with roughly similar objectives were being run by separate agencies led to competition and duplication and resulted in confusion among the very young people who were meant to benefit.  It is fair to say that we do not have a comprehensive and integrated range of programmes, and I am convinced that there is a need for such a package.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am concerned that existing schemes do not do enough to aid those in most need &mdash; young people who have left school at an early stage and face a future of uncertain and sporadic employment in low-skilled jobs.  This may result from the sheer volume of applications for participation in programmes set against the limited number of places available.  The truly disadvantaged teenagers are likely to have a range of social and personal problems and thus appear at a superficial level to be least likely to benefit from structured training programmes of the type we now offer.  As a result programme sponsors may be unwilling to take them on board.  They tend to be restricted to programmes involving short-term employment creation rather than skill acquisition and this, if anything, reinforces the cycle of deprivation.  I know that some programme sponsors are aware of this problem and have run imaginative pilot schemes for the relevant young people, and I am confident that an increase in resources will go some way towards helping disadvantaged youths.  It is also my intention to move towards greater concentration of resources in the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Schemes similar to our own, with minor variations, have been introduced by all our partners in the European communities. In board terms the schemes cover temporary or permanent job creation schemes in the public sector; similar schemes in the private sector based mainly on wage subsidies or tax concessions; education programmes for unemployed youth and pre-employment <Col N="215" /> courses in the educational system; vocational education and training; work experience programmes; early retirement of older workers to make way for young workers; and measures to stimulate labour demand in small enterprises, youth enterprises and co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Probably the most highly developed set of programmes to assist young people are those operated in Scandinavian countries. These programmes form part of a &ldquo;youth guarantee&rdquo; which takes the form of a guarantee of an opportunity of a job or a training place to young people who meet certain conditions, relating mainly to the duration of unemployment.  A similar approach is now being taken in the UK under the Youth Opportunities Programme.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that what we are proposing for Ireland in the Bill before us at least matches what is being done in other countries.  The emphasis is on a comprehensive package to assist young people and it is very similar to, if not identical with, the youth guarantee idea which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Any major new departure in an area as important as the one before us needs the widest possible range of opinions and advice prior to its initiation.  I have discussed the proposed agency with, among others, representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The views of these bodies were taken into consideration in formulating the proposals before Deputies.</P>
    <P>I also intend to submit to the board of the agency, when it is established, suggestions made to me and my Department over the last four months concerning the activities of the agency.  The interest shown in the agency up to now has, I believe, emphasised the importance attached by the community to the need to assist young people in the labour market. Other bodies and individuals who wish to do so may make submissions direct to the agency and I am sure such submissions will be welcomed.  One document which will be of particular interest to the agency is the forthcoming report <Col N="216" /> of the OECD team led by Mrs. Shirley Williams which examined our youth employment problems and our existing schemes earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Certain conclusions can be arrived at from what I have been saying up to now. Firstly, we have a sizeable number of our young people unemployed.  Secondly, labour force projections point to a continuing situation of more young entrants to the labour force than retirals.  Thirdly, what has been done up to now is not an adequately comprehensive and co-ordinated response to the problem &mdash; it does not cover the entire transition from school to full integration in the work force and it is of limited benefit to disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>The Government in its programme for 1981-86 recognised these considerations and the need for special provisions to deal with the acute problem of youth employment.  The Government therefore decided to establish without delay a youth employment agency to integrate and radically extend the schemes that exist at present under the separate auspices of a number of State enterprises. The Government intend the new agency to move as rapidly as it physically can to the point where an additional 20,000 young people will be catered for by existing and new schemes.  These measures will be designed to ensure that no young person is left without some form of work training or work experience within a relatively short period of having completed his or her education.</P>
    <P>I would now like to give the House an indication of my proposals for dealing with the problem.  The Youth Employment Agency Bill before us is intended to implement these proposals.  In brief, the Bill has two parts dealing, firstly, with the establishment of the agency itself and, secondly, with the collection of the levy.</P>
    <P>The first part embraces sections 2 to 14.  These sections provide for the formation and registration of the agency, its constitution as a limited liability company under the Companies Acts, its memorandum and articles of association, the board of directors, the holding of shares and the furnishing of balance sheets, the winding <Col N="217" /> up of the agency and the usual provisions under which directors and employees of the agency cannot be members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>The levy to finance the agency and the schemes is dealt with in sections 15 to 26, the main points being the methods of collecting the levy and the channelling of funds to programme sponsors.  The European Social Fund will also be involved in the funding of the programmes concerned.</P>
    <P>The urgency and importance of the tasks which the Youth Employment Agency will be expected to accomplish require that they should very quickly achieve an identification as the primary unit assisting and facilitating the employment of young persons.  To do this they must be seen to be competent and efficient and to have a flexibility to contemplate initiatives and embark upon new departures.  With these considerations in mind I am proposing to establish the agency as a limited company.  Approval of the Oireachtas to this approach is required in the legislation which we are now discussing.  Its advantages lie in that the agency can be quickly established and operative and can have the flexibility also not alone to assess, co-ordinate and expand existing activities but also to make a distinctive contribution in their own right towards alleviating the problems of youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>I propose to appoint a board of 11 members to direct the agency's operations. Two of these would be representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, two representative of employer organisations and two of youth interests. In addition a representative of the Ministers for Education and the Environment respectively will be appointed and, finally, three board members including the chairman, will be appointed directly by me as Minister for Labour.  I am confident that a board of this size, peopled by able and committed representatives of the relevant major interests, can make a most fundamental contribution through directing the activities of the Youth Employment Agency towards realising <Col N="218" /> fully the objectives for which they are being established.</P>
    <P>In view of the urgency of the task facing the agency I propose, with the agreement of the House, to establish them on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis at an early date.</P>
    <P>The memorandum and articles of association of the company will incorporate the following detailed terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(a)  to review the effectiveness of youth employment, work experience and training programmes with particular reference to their impact on disadvantaged youth;</P>
    <P>(b)  to extend existing youth job creation, training and work experience programmes, while providing also for increased penetration for such programmes among disadvantaged youth;</P>
    <P>(c) to arrange for assistance to be given to voluntary, social or community organisations to provide employment for young people where this is not possible under existing programmes;</P>
    <P>(d)  to arrange assistance for young people with the establishment of an enterprise in areas other than those in which existing bodies, for example, the IDA, county development teams and AnCO, operate; in particular the agency should promote, through education and publicity, the concept of self-help and enterprise amongst young people, either individually or in co-operative endeavours;</P>
    <P>(e)  to carry out and administer youth employment and training schemes where there are gaps in existing programmes;</P>
    <P>(f)  to co-ordinate and integrate the various schemes, ensure there is no duplication between them and, in this connection, to set general standards for the various schemes in relation to such matters as the ages, wages and allowances of participants;</P>
    <P>(g)  to identify areas outside the scope of existing programmes into which Government aid to young people could be extended, for example, agriculture and other primary activities;</P>
    <P>(h)  to consider the possibility of <Col N="219" /> improving the access of unemployed young people to a range of educational and training courses in the private and public sectors possibly by means of a voucher scheme for eligible youth;</P>
    <P>(i)  to submit views, as appropriate, on educational policy and its effectiveness in preparing young people for working life.</P>
    <P>In drawing up these terms of reference I have given very careful consideration to the full range of activities which the agency will be expected to undertake. They have been adopted to ensure that the agency will meet certain basic requirements &mdash; for example, that programmes are concentrated in areas of greatest disadvantage and are operated in a non-discriminatory way.  They also leave the agency with adequate scope for enterprise and initiative.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest to the House will be the facility which the agency will have to relate directly with local interests and to assist these, both financially and with advice and back-up, to devise and implement schemes at local level.  The essential test in determining whether such schemes should be assisted will be whether they can provide worthwhile outlets for youth and enhance their possibilities of obtaining employment.  In addition the agency will be able to assist young persons to start up enterprises which have potential for additional job creation.</P>
    <P>In recent years, we have depended to a large extent on foreign investment and enterprise to provide jobs.  Nonetheless, I feel that this country offers comparatively more scope than most other EEC member states for the application of native initiative and enterprise.  There is considerable potential for young people to create opportunities for themselves and others.  The lack of a good track record to date should not deter them from openly looking at the possibilities for enterprise.  I would hope that the Youth Employment Agency will play a constructive role in facilitating such a development.</P>
    <P>I should like also to mention the responsibility which the agency will have <Col N="220" /> to consider any innovative measures to augment those currently providing work experience, training, or employment outlets for our young people.  To a very considerable extent our interventions in these areas to date have closely mirrored developments in other member states of the EEC and, in particular, in Britain.  I would envisage that the agency, because of the different representative interests making an input to their work, should be able to identify gaps in the present operations and bring about required change. I am hopeful that the agency will give high priority also to devising, either on their own or in co-operation with other sponsors, programmes aimed at specific target groups and which take account of the particular and relevant characteristics of the location in which they are held.  A high degree of local co-operation will obviously be required to facilitate such an approach but I have no doubt at all that such co-operation will be readily forthcoming in the interest of tackling and overcoming youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Government's programme to which I have already referred, it is intended to defray the cost of the operations coming within the scope of the Youth Employment Agency through the medium of a 1 per cent levy on all income.  This 1 per cent charge will be collected by means of an appropriate increase in persons' health contributions. In preparing the Bill my general approach has been to build on the financing framework that already exists.  This would seem to be the most sensible, efficient and cost effective way to proceed. Following the precedents set in the collection of the contribution for health purposes the following arrangement will apply:</P>
    <P>(a)  the levy will be collected from the PRSI group <i>via</i> the PRSI system with the Revenue Commissioners being the collecting agents.</P>
    <P>(b)  the levy will be collected from the self-employed and &ldquo;excepted farmers&rdquo; also by the Revenue Commissioners, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the levy will be collected from <Col N="221" /> farmers not included above by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as drafted certain social welfare recipients will be exempt from the levy as will medical card holders who are not in employment while for those card holders in insurable employment the levy will be paid by their employer.</P>
    <P>These proposals also follow precedents set in the case of the health contribution. In addition I have decided to exclude other social welfare payments now liable for health contributions.  I will be introducing an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  I might mention also that preliminary consideration is being given to exempting low paid workers from payment of the health contribution and that whatever is decided in that instance will be taken into account in deciding liability for the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>On the basis of best estimates I expect receipts from the levy to amount in a full year to somewhere in the region of £63 million.  The mechanism proposed for channelling this money to the agency and other training and employment opportunities for young people is that a subhead will be entered in the Department of Labour Vote, of an amount equal to the expected yield from the levy during the period in question.  Thus in 1982 my Department's estimates would include an amount equivalent to the expected yield from the levy from 6 April 1982 to the end of the year which will be of the order of £40 million.  I gave detailed consideration to the question of having a youth employment fund.  I rejected this idea, however, on the grounds of the complex accounting procedures involved and also because funds would not become available until somewhere towards the middle of 1982 &mdash; and I intend to have the agency in operation long before that date.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to devote proceeds of the levy as fas as possible directly to the Youth Employment Agency in the normal manner of a grant-in-aid.  I will make funds available to the agency following its submission of an annual outline programme to the Minister for Labour and subsequently following receipt of <Col N="222" /> regular progress reports.  As regards its relationship with programme sponsors, I am of the opinion that the agency should adopt a course under which the sponsors will submit their programmes to it, discussions will then take place, and finally agreement will be given by the agency to funding to a determined level, based on certain targets being achieved.  The details of the schemes to be sponsored by the agency, numbers to be covered and similar questions are matters proper for decision by the agency.</P>
    <P>The subhead in my Department vote will also contain a provision covering the direct channelling of funds to youth training and employment programmes with the sanction of the Minister for Finance. This provision is intended to cover any difficulties which may arise in channelling funds to programme sponsors in 1982. The main programme sponsors will be AnCO, the National Manpower Service, the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment but I expect this list to expand considerably in 1982.</P>
    <P>I have considered the question whether the proceeds of the levy should be used to finance existing youth schemes carried forward at the 1981 level into 1982.  The alternative would be to use the proceeds of the levy to finance only additions to these schemes and new schemes.  As I have already indicated one of the important functions of the agency will be to integrate and co-ordinate all that is now being done for the employment of youth and to build on existing structures.  I have accordingly opted for financing both existing and new schemes from the levy.  It would be wasteful of resources and inefficient to do otherwise and it would go counter to the objective of integrating the various schemes.  The Government will top up the receipts from the levy in any year to such extent as might be necessary to meet the total costs of all schemes carried out by the agency or by other bodies with its approval.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund plays a significant role in influencing Community employment policy.  In brief, it provides assistance for vocational training and for community regions with the most pressing <Col N="223" /> employment problems.  In this regard, Ireland has been deemed a region of priority and 55 per cent of costs of our eligible training schemes are refunded from the European Social Fund.  In addition we receive about £11 per week in respect of each youth on a work experience or job creation programme. This aid has been of immense value to the development of our system of vocational training since 1973 and in more recent years in supplementing the cost of our work experience and job creation schemes.  I look forward to increased ESF support for our existing programmes in their expanded form and I am confident that aid from the fund will also be forthcoming for any new schemes promoted by the agency to deal with the youth employment problem.</P>
    <P>Due to the necessity to have applications for social fund assistance with the EEC Commission before mid-October in the year preceding the operations, we have already submitted to the EEC applications that take account of activities by the agency and by other programme sponsors in 1982.  When I discussed the applications with the director for the social fund, he endorsed fully what we were doing for youth and welcomed the new approach which we have adopted. The moneys which we are spending and which will be contributed by our own people illustrate the importance which we attach in Ireland to the question of youth employment and this approach has been endorsed by the Commission.  I should state that the level of assistance from the social fund for young people is at present under consideration by the EEC Commission and we will be making an Irish input when the matter comes before the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the agency, and the proposed expansion of provision for the young unemployed, represent a major departure.  In 1982, as I have said, I envisage a doubling of the number of young people to be catered for.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the increase in resources devoted to youth employment and training schemes should have a direct impact on the problem of youth unemployment. <Col N="224" /> It is my confident expectation that the proposal I have put before the House will achieve that aim, for several reasons.  One possible obstacle in the way of success is that in a period of limited job opportunities, those completing programmes may have great difficulty in finding employment.  On this point, I have already outlined this Government's general policies for the generation of self-sustaining employment growth.</P>
    <P>It is also my view that the activities of the agency, of themselves, will help our long-term job creation drive.  Training and work experience programmes will help our young people to build up skills and abilities which they would otherwise lack.  By so raising the skill level of our young workforce, we will improve our competitive position relative to other countries, and increase the scope for carrying out a broader range of economic activities in Ireland.  Not only will it encourage outside firms to locate new activities in Ireland, it will facilitate the development of new forms of activity from our new resources.  In this connection, the agency's role in advising on educational policy and its relationship with working life will be of major importance in developing an integrated approach to the development of our young people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer again to the social, as opposed to economic, benefits to be sought from the agency's work.  This relates particularly to the emphasis placed in our proposals on the needs of disadvantaged youth.  I see the drive towards improved access for such young people to training, work experience and employment programmes as being a major requirement for greater equality of opportunity in our society.  There are many barriers to such equality, but I am confident that the agency will share my determination to break these down and to ensure a better future for young people from the poorer parts of our cities, towns and rural areas.</P>
    <P>I commend these proposals to the Dáil with full confidence that they will be welcomed and supported.  The Bill represents an earnest of our determination to deal with the problem of youth unemployment <Col N="225" /> in a structured manner to ensure that young boys and girls leaving school will be equipped to take their place in the world of work without too long a delay.</P>
    <P>I have particular pleasure in putting forward the Bill, as its objectives and concerns are ones which I have supported both within my own party and as Vice-Chairman, for a number of years, of the Youth Committee of the European Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My party have always supported any measures to reduce unemployment and we will not oppose this Bill.  While we will endeavour to expedite its passage through the House, we have many reservations about it and many points to make on it.  I hope that as a result of our efforts here the Bill will be a more adequate and suitable measure when it leaves the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill is disappointing in many of its features.  It was circulated two weeks ago with an explanatory memorandum which was referred to in the press and in this House as completely inadequate for a Bill of this kind.  The Bill refers to the levy, its collection and the establishment of a youth employment agency.  That is all very fine from a public relations point of view.  I have said often that if this Government are good at anything they are good at their public relations image. A recent comment to me was that no Government in the history of this country have worked so hard on their image and that is evident in very many areas.  I refer in particular to the number of appointments made.  While the Minister present may not be guilty of that exercise, some of his coleagues have gone to great extremes to ensure the appointment of people to keep the Government's image right.  I am sure there are people who will help the Minister at publishing this Bill and getting across what is perhaps an exaggerated image.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not give us any information on what we might expect from the agency.  I listened with interest to the Minister's speech today.  The first point that came across clearly is that there are no new schemes envisaged.  Innovations <Col N="226" /> are non-existent.  Admittedly the hope is there that the agency may add other schemes but there are no new schemes listed.  The only schemes involved are those operated by the previous Government. I do not disagree with the Minister when he says there is a need for co-ordination and if I had had the time to carry out such co-ordination I would have done so.  However, I am not so sure that all of this is not being used to a great extent as a public relations operation rather than improving the schemes, integrating, coordinating and expanding them.</P>
    <P>There is one disturbing line in the Minister's speech to which I shall refer again. I ask him to explain in detail what he meant.  The following sentence occurs in the speech:</P>
    <P>I have accordingly opted for financing both existing and new schemes from the levy.</P>
    <P>That is the most disappointing line in the whole speech.  It now appears that AnCO and all the existing youth schemes will be funded from the 1 per cent collected from the workers, farmers and the self-employed. In other words, we are saving money for the Exchequer at the expense of these people and we discovered that for the first time this morning.  In the programmes put forward last May, two individual programmes by the Labour Party and by Fine Gael, finishing with the joint programme, the now celebrated &lsquo;Gaiety Document&rsquo;, youth unemployment was referred to in addition to the expansion of employment.  The following appeared in that joint programme:</P>
    <P>These employment creation measures will however, need to be supplemented by special provisions to deal with the acute problem of youth unemployment. The Government will establish without delay a Youth Employment Agency, to integrate and radically extend the schemes that exist at present under the separate auspices of the Department of Labour and Education.</P>
    <P>The new Agency will have authority to move as rapidly as it physically can to the point where up to 20,000 young people who are without employment <Col N="227" /> for six months will qualify for one or other of the following:</P>
    <P>Training in AnCO</P>
    <P>Participation in Work Experience Programme</P>
    <P>Employment in Environmental Improvement Schemes</P>
    <P>Employment in Community and Youth Work</P>
    <P>Employment by voluntary social or community organisations</P>
    <P>Assistance with the establishment of an enterprise.</P>
    <P>The document goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The cost of this scheme will be financed by a 1% Youth Employment Charge on all incomes, and by money from the EEC Social Fund, together with, in many cases, savings in unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech there is reference to the current year's activities and the expectation that during 1981 some 5,000 young people will take part in the Work Experience Programme of the National Manpower Service; that 10,000 young people will be trained in AnCO's general training programmes, with a further 2,000 apprentices; and that 1,700 young people will participate in AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme.  The Minister stated a further 1,000 people have been engaged in schemes run by the Departments of Education and the Environment. That makes a total of 19,700 already.  We have not been told if the 20,000 young people referred to in the Government's programme are additional to the 19,700.  When I consider what would be obtained by way of the levy, I think that could be achieved quite easily from the financial point of view.</P>
    <P>The levy will be 1 per cent on all incomes.  The Minister estimates the yield at £63 million but I think he is somewhat pessimistic.  If all the levy is collected it should exceed that figure.  Some time ago I asked questions in the House of what the levy would yield from the self-employed and I was given the figure of £8 million.  The levy on rents and other property income would bring in about <Col N="228" /> £500,000; the levy on farmers' incomes would bring in about £7.5 million; proceeds from the levy on corporation profits would bring in about £10 million and the levy on all dividends would yield about £1.5 million.  That gives a total in the region of £27.5 million.  We must add that the contributions from PRSI and the insured workers would form a large portion of that contribution.  In the contribution by employers to help ailing industries .2 per cent was estimated to raise by way of payroll tax somewhere in the region of £6.5 million.  If we multiply that by five to bring us up to the amount of the levy we are talking in the region of £32 million.  To this we must add the 1 per cent contribution from the civil service who are not included in the .2 per cent Employment Guarantee Fund levy and we are talking in the region of £40 million.  In total we are nearer to £70 million than the £63 million mentioned by the Minister.  He is being conservative in his estimate but he may be taking into consideration the difficulty in collecting the levy in some instances.  We have a long way to go to add to that £70 million. As the Minister said, the European social fund contributes 55 per cent in certain areas for training young people.  In some of the schemes it contributes £11 per week.  I shall be conservative and take a figure of £40 million.  Together with the £70 million, we are talking about funds in the region of £110 million.  That is a major contribution.  Are we not using the Exchequer funds which were made available for organisations such as AnCO? Are AnCO being funded from this levy?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had opted for financing new and existing schemes from the levy.  He should spell out clearly if this is the case.  In reply to a question I asked the Minister about AnCO he said that the estimated expenditure on community youth training was £3.125 million and the total was somewhere in excess of £30 million.  We are talking about £30 million plus being the current expenditure on AnCO and is the State's portion of that coming from the levy?  This levy is a major fund handling exercise.  The Minister said about £40 million will have been collected by the middle of next year. <Col N="229" /> Is he handing over all the money for disbursement to AnCO, CERT, the National Manpower Service or what new arrangements are being made?</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to this agency.  I welcome the participation of youth.  Is there a danger that it will involve heavy administration?  We are dealing with a lot of money which, if handed over by the Minister to the agency, would demand a high administrative network.  I should like to ensure on behalf of workers, farmers and self-employed people that the 1 per cent levy goes towards the functions it is intended for &mdash; youth employment and training &mdash; and not towards administration. Everybody who pays the levy is making a sacrifice.  In the case of PRSI it is a sizeable additional burden.  In addition to that the PRSI contribution is expected to go from 4.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent for those earning less than £8,500.  All these increases will have a damaging effect on the take-home earnings of workers.  That also applies to farmers and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The Bill gave details of the levy and of the establishment of the agency.  Was consideration given to the National Manpower Service handling this?  I found that body extremely efficient.  Could they have been used to integrate and co-ordinate this scheme?  The Minister should spell out if this was considered, why it was excluded and why he found this to be a better way.  Can he guarantee that if this is a better way there will not be heavy administrative expenses involved?  Is there another tier between the Minister, the agency and the AnCO council?  The present structure is the Minister for Labour and the AnCO council.  If the agency are funding the scheme is it the Minister for Labour, the agency and AnCO council?  Where does the National Manpower Service fit in?  Does the agency come between the Minister and that section of the Department or what is the relationship?  Has thought been given to these items?  We must be concerned about the most efficient way of having young people put into training and into employment.  We may be introducing unnecessary administrative costs <Col N="230" /> into the scheme.  We will be pursuing the Minister about this.</P>
    <P>We are asking workers to contribute substantially to this, we are talking about £100 million.  In the joint policy on youth employment which emerged from the Gaiety there was a third contributing element which was hidden and that is the saving on unemployment assistance. Obviously there will be some saving. There appear to be many tiers and that is why I asked the Minister about the matter.</P>
    <P>The hard, cold, tying hand of the Minister for Finance is going right through every section of the Bill.  The Minister for Labour cannot move without the permission of the Minister for the Public Service &mdash; for the time being both offices are held by the one person &mdash; or without the permission of the Minister for Finance. Therefore, we have the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Public Service, the Minister for Labour, an agency and the Manpower Service or AnCO or CERT or whatever group it may be.  That ladder seems to have a great many steps on it from the operating scene to the final Minister at the top.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the Minister for Finance has been given such a strong role in all of this.  I suspect that I know which member of the Government fought hardest and strongest for that and I have no doubt that it was the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly. The Minister will have heard so much of this at the Government table that I will be boring him in quoting that Minister in this House on 4 November because obviously it would be fresh in his mind. This Bill probably is still going backwards and forwards through the Government. The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism said on that date, and I quote from the Official Report, column 1148, volume 330:</P>
    <P>I want to end on a somewhat different note.  There is no use in talking about job creation in the sense in which that term was understood by the former Government.</P>
    <P>Later he said, as in column 1149:</P>
    <P>Whether we are long or short in <Col N="231" /> office, if we succeed in developing that form of job creation.</P>
    <P>he was talking about the productive area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I will be very proud.  What is not job creation, except in the kind of terminology of an advertising agency, is throwing up a building, putting a lot of desks into it, and having many school leavers behind those desks shoving papers around at one another.  That is not a job.</P>
    <P>Again at column 1150:</P>
    <P>Jobs for jobs' sake may be fine, but they have to be paid for by your neighbours. They have to be paid for by the people who are working productively.</P>
    <P>I could quote much more.  Those comments lead me to believe that here is one man in that Government who is determined that as many strings as possible will be attached to the final product of the Bill.  This measure was promised to us as a matter of urgency at the time of the Gaiety Theatre meeting and here we are in the dying days of November on Second Stage in this House.  Obviously, there was a lot of internal wrangling and disagreement in the Government.</P>
    <P>Regarding the agency, I welcome particularly the idea of involvement of young representatives.  I have no hang-up about not having an agency.  I am not opposed to the idea of an agency and perhaps it would be right to have one in this, but has the Minister looked at the possible alternatives in an effort to ensure that whatever the grouping, be it the agency, the Manpower section of his Department or anything else, it would be the most economical and involve the least loss in administration costs?  The funding also is very important.  I am surprised that the composition of the agency is smaller than I would have thought suitable for those bodies.  I would think that a body like the ICTU with varying interests would have felt entitled to a representation of three or four and certainly more than two.  It would be in the interests of the Minister and the agency that such numbers would <Col N="232" /> be accommodated because of the different interests they would represent in that important organisation.  The Bill states that the directors of the agency shall be nominated for appointment by such bodies representative of employers as the Minister may determine.  What two employer bodies are they?  There are a number of them.  How will the Minister overcome that?  Will some employer organisation be left out?  I am not saying this in the interests of the employer organisations or in the interest of the ICTU.  I am saying it in the interests of the agency.  Would it not be desirable that all the employer organisations &mdash; probably there are only three &mdash; would be represented?</P>
    <P>The representatives of young persons are to be included.  While the Minister does not say that it will be through the National Youth Council, I presume that that will be the case.  Is that where the Minister will find these young people? The Bill does not say.  I would not like it to be the sort of political appointments that have been made already by this Government in so many areas.  Yesterday we saw the most dramatic step forward in patronage ever seen in this country.  I accept that it was not by one of the Minister's party, it was by one of his colleagues in the senior party in Government. The Minister for Education, in order to protect his own interests in County Dublin, was prepared to bring his third adviser into the Department of Education.  I want to make sure that the young people appointed will be appointed from an organisation such as the National Youth Council and that they will not be cronies of some Minister or Ministers thus making that party even more of a club.</P>
    <P>The nomination of education representatives is desirable and important.  The Minister in his speech this morning referred to the importance of linking training and education with the world of work.  There is a role to play in that.  In my time as Minister for Labour we made a lot of progress on the Manpower Consultative Committee and I urge the Minister to look at the reports on that.  Some of the discussions that took place could <Col N="233" /> well be of benefit to the agency in that very important field.  I hope that during my time some progress was made on the road towards more co-operation between labour, education and industry.  It is relevant to much of what the Minister has said and to the youth employment of the future because of the need for more technical and technological skills.  Therefore, it is important that some representative of education would be included.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the necessity for a representative of the Department of the Environment.  I am not reflecting on that Department.  I appreciate that schemes exist under their aegis but I am not convinced that that Department should be represented on that agency.  I feel that that is not the area to go to and if I was looking for a nominee possibly I would consider AnCO as the biggest agency in this area who have much experience and who possibly could make a contribution. The Minister has power to appoint three members and I expect they will come from the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures have been worsening.  I believe our policies were right, although a great deal of criticism is being deliberately levelled at them.  As the Minister said, we have a growing population and there is a downturn in the population of our European partners. Our population growth is ten times the EEC average and we have a youth employment problem which is far greater than that of our European partners. There is an increase in the number of school leavers coming on our employment markets each year and that will be the case for the next decade and beyond it.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is not a saving but a very extravagant measure to cut back in this area, particularly by not filling posts in the public service.  I do not know what the situation is in the civil service but last week the Minister for Finance answered my question about unfilfilled vacancies in State bodies and he said there were almost 700 unfilled vacancies in that area since the 21 July embargo.  The Minister for Labour is the person who will have to defend the employment figures. <Col N="234" /> Although some of his colleagues will have a far greater contribution to make towards employment they will leave him to defend that situation.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see the leader of the Labour Party recently painting a depressing picture of the unemployment situation. If one continually paints a depressing picture one can only worsen an already serious situation because people must have hope.  In last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> he referred to the impossibility of the unemployment figure coming below 125,000.  Six weeks earlier in an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> he referred to a figure of 100,000.  In six weeks his predictions have become much worse.</P>
    <P>We cannot shy away from the problem of youth employment.  I am not objecting to this Bill but I hope we can improve it. The money being provided here will come from the ordinary people and it must be used well, but one must ask if it is the right strategy to leave posts unfilled, particularly at a time when white-collar jobs are scarce and we are going through a recession.  In future there will be more employment in the technological blue collar area.  Office jobs will be scarcer and in times of recession this situation will be even more acute.  These matters must be taken into consideration by the Government and they must decide whether this is an extravagant exercise. The Minister might say 700 jobs are not very many, but I do not agree, because it can make a great difference to certain areas throughout the country.  That is the situation in the public sector and I assume there are more vacancies in the civil service.</P>
    <P>What will be the cost of administering this new agency?  How many will be employed?  Is there a lopsided situation here where there is a big intake into one area, and no recruitment in another?  The Minister will say that this is the area of youth employment and that it is very important and I agree, but there are other extremely important areas which are being ignored.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies challenge some of my colleagues about not making adequate provisions in the Estimates.  The number of times we have escaped without <Col N="235" /> introducing Supplementary Estimates has been few and far between.  If the Government do not fill posts in the civil service and in State bodies and run down the number of teaching jobs, then they are creating a bigger problem for the agency we are setting up here because more young people will be without jobs.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the leader of the Labour Party's recent comments.  I remember when I was in Government in 1977 being pilloried from these benches from the then Deputy Kelly, Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Bruton about the type of jobs we were creating.  They said they were not real jobs.  Yet now the same schemes are being operated by this Minister.  I am not objecting to this, but I wish to draw the attention of the House to this typical about-turn and hypocritical approach of those three Ministers.  The difference here is that the Irish worker, the Irish farmer and the Irish self-employed are paying for these schemes.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of the levy.  The Government have made so many U-turns since last June that it is hard to know what portion of their policies is being implemented.  Daily we read of leaks to the national newspapers from the Government and it appears that the Government Information Services are working hard selling the right line and giving the right slant on Government policies.  We are all aware of the leaks about the tax package.  The latest indications are that it may be phased in, if it is introduced at all, and I should like to know how the PAYE sector will fare as a result.  Will such people who are being asked to pay the 1 per cent per year under this legislation be given a reduction as promised during the election campaign?  At that stage such people were offered a reduction in their income tax but now we are not certain if that package is going ahead.  Our people should be told what the situation is particularly if they must pay this 1 per cent levy.  We must also bear in mind that the cost of the tax package, as a result of the Government's change in policy, will not be as big as was originally anticipated. What will be done with the saving?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> The quality of the explanatory memorandum was disappointing.  Those who are interested in Bills like this are entitled to a better explanation of the various details.  Any Bill represents a difficult reading exercise and that is why an explanatory memorandum is necessary. It would be an insult to the general public to repeat the type of expanatory memorandum that accompanied this Bill. According to section 1 (2) the Minister may by regulations define &ldquo;reckonable earnings&rdquo;, &ldquo;reckonable emoluments&rdquo; and &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo;.  I should like to know what is meant by &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo;.  Does it mean gross income or is it gross income less something?  Is it more than gross income?  I have not come across that term before in any legislation. Why is the word &ldquo;reckonable&rdquo; used?  Has the Minister power to change the mechanism used for reckoning an income as he sees fit?  What is to prevent the Minister from calling it &ldquo;gross plus&rdquo;?  I am not saying the Minister will do that and I would be surprised if he did but he has a duty to explain the phrase &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo;.  What I have said about income applies equally to emoluments and earnings. I will deal with that in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 states that the memorandum of association of the agency shall be in such form consistent with the Act as shall be approved of by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service.  The Government have certainly allowed the shackles to be put on the Minister for Labour.  I would fight that a little harder if I was in the Minister's position.  The same applies in other sections.  The main section is section 15 which deals with the levy.  That section states:</P>
    <P>There shall be paid, subject to and in accordance with this Act and regulations under this Act, by or in respect of an individual who is over the age of sixteen years, a levy (which shall be known as &ldquo;Youth Employment Levy&rdquo; and is in this Act referred to as &ldquo;levy&rdquo;) to defray the expenditure of the Youth Employment Agency in the performance of its functions and such other <Col N="237" /> expenditure in relation to the training and employment of young persons as the Minister may determine with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There again we have the cold hand of the Department of Finance.  Next year it may be decided that the levy should be 1.5 per cent or 2 per cent and that should not be ruled out.  The Minister may say that will not happen today but it represents a distinct possibility because it appears that it is the Minister for Finance who has the power.  I should like to get some explanation about the payment of the levy.  This morning the Minister said that he would be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage in relation to some payments from health boards he feels may be caught under the section.  If that is the case we will co-operate with him.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 refer to the payment of levy by individuals with emoluments other than reckonable earnings and the payment of levy by individuals with income other than emoluments.  What is all that about?  Is there something sinister in those sections?  For example, what about the justified expenses of a worker? Will such expenses be included?  Is it merely a legal formality or do those sections cover some specific group?  I notice that under section 19 the Minister may, by regulations, vary the rate of levy.  I presume that he may vary it from year to year but I believe that strengthens the point I made earlier that there is no guarantee once this is introduced at 1 per cent that it will not become 1½ per cent or 2 per cent as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I should like more information from the Minister about how it is proposed to collect the levy from certain groups. There is no problem about the PAYE sector, they are the easy target, but how about the self-employed, farmers or those with property?  What I am afraid of is that an adequate effort will not be put into collecting the levy from those it will be difficult to collect from.  There is no problem about the PAYE sector and there should be little problem with others in the tax net but are there others who will not be pursued?  I fear that because the collection is so big there may be a <Col N="238" /> reluctance by the Government to follow such people.  The Government may say that it is not worth pursuing such people because they are doing so well with other sectors.  The revenue collected will amount to between £60 million and £70 million, added to by a substantial contribution from the social fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained about payment to this body by grant-in-aid.  Am I to understand that this levy will go through the machinery of the Social Insurance Fund, because he said in his Second Reading reply that he was not setting up a special fund?  Does it go on then to the agency?  While I appreciate that he has taken controls unto himself in paying it to the agency, I should like a more detailed explanation of how that income is collected and paid over.  He went into detail that accounts must be prepared by the agency which, of course, is essential.  But I am somewhat worried in all of this about growing costs of administration and unnecessary tiers being added to the structures.</P>
    <P>Section 30 reads:</P>
    <P>
      <b>30</b>&mdash;(1) The expenses incurred by the Minister or by any other Minister of the Government other than the Minister for Finance in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(2)  The expenses incurred by the Minister for Finance in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Is the levy about which the Minister speaks included in that category and is that money regarded as income collected by the Oireachtas?  I am not sure and I should like some clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 31 reads:</P>
    <P>
      <b>31</b>&mdash;This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order or orders made by the Minister either generally or with reference <Col N="239" /> to a particular purpose or provision, and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>The usual terminology applies there as to when the Act might come into operation. When is that hoped-for date?  When will the agency be established?  What specific involvement will there be in the Estimates of the Minister's Department for the provision of grant-in-aid for AnCO, CERT or whoever?  If the Minister is right in what he said in his Second Reading speech those grants-in-aid will now go to the agency rather than the Department.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage when we shall have an awful lot of work to do on this Bill.  I am somewhat afraid that the good points are being highlighted. I hope that the money promised to be collected for youth employment is not now being used unfairly, incorrectly or not in accordance with the commitments given because, if it is going into existing schemes, then an awful lot of it is being absorbed.  The Minister himself in the House spoke about 18,000 to 20,000 or so availing of the schemes this year.  The document that emanated from the Gaiety Theatre spoke about 20,000. Are the 20,000 about which the Minister speaks an additional 20,000?  In the Labour Party programme placed before the Gaiety Theatre meeting they guaranteed participation in one or other of those schemes &mdash; or a combination of them &mdash; for three years to a person out of work for three months.  Does that guarantee still apply?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to ensure that extreme care is taken so that there is no abuse of the schemes.  I am sure he is as aware as I am that there is always the danger of the irresponsible or not so good employer who might like to play a system and who could perhaps avail of the contribution when a person has been out of work for six months.  Did the Minister say, or is there a guarantee if the young person is out of work for six months?</P>
    <P>We are not opposing the Bill because <Col N="240" /> anything done in the interests of youth employment will have our support but we have grave reservations about the Bill as it now stands.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom, ar an gcéad dul síos, fáiltiú roimh an mBille seo.  Dar ndóigh, tá tábhacht ag baint leis, go háirithe toisc go mbaineann sé leis an bhfadhb is mó, fadhb shoisialta, fadhb eacnamaíochta is mó na laethanta seo, is é sin fadhb na dí-fhostaíochta, agus go háirithe toisc go mbaineann sé leis an chuid den fhadhb sin a bhaineann le daoine óga.  Mar a dúirt mé, fáiltím roimh an mBille de bharr na fáthanna sin.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and also the Minister's introductory remarks this morning. The Bill deals with the problem of youth unemployment against the background of the unemployment problem generally.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make is that those of us who work in Leinster House should welcome any opportunity of discussing the unemployment problem in general terms.  Basically we are confronted each week and month with the problems of individual factories, individual work places and individual parts of industry that are experiencing difficulties with resultant job losses.  But too rarely have we an opportunity of putting all of these experiences together and dealing with the unemployment problem as an aspect of economic performance.  While we may look to Question Time and particular questions raised about local difficulties, aggregation of these is not a sufficient substitute for dealing with the problem of unemployment.  Within the unemployment problem generally undoubtedly the part to which a great deal of attention has been devoted within the European Community, outside it and indeed in this country, has been that of the unemployment statistics comprised of the numbers of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the honesty with which the Minister presented the size of the youth unemployment problem in his introductory remarks.  There is no point in running away from this problem in terms of its size or proportion, in terms <Col N="241" /> of the challenge it poses and, in that regard, the Minister's speech is welcome for its factual content.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I should like to make concerning the assumptions contained in the Minister's remarks, ones drawn from different emphases I shall make myself in relation to manpower planning and which may differ from some of the advice available to the Minister. They are not ones of substantive principle but rather of emphasis.</P>
    <P>One cautionary note I would strike at the very outset is that all the youth employment strategies in the world, all the work experience programmes and all the guarantees given to young people are not a sufficient substitute for adequate approaches to the unemployment problem. I believe &mdash; and I place on the record of this House &mdash; that we will never see an approach toward the elimination of serious levels of unemployment, and indeed serious levels of youth unemployment, until we have made a commitment to planning our economy.  Certainly it is far from being a reflection on the Minister who introduced this Bill here today to say that his Bill would have had so very much more merit had it been preceded by adequate planning measures within the economy.  When economic historians write about the modern Irish economy they will record the impressions of the abolition of the planning process as a particularly sad part in recent Irish economic history.  It is striking to think that the First Programme for Economic Expansion 1958-1963 was criticised because of its insufficient reference to such matters as manpower planning.</P>
    <P>The third programme was praised for its concession to social priorities and particularly its observations in relation to manpower needs.  We are now, in the eighties, further away from a deep commitment to the planning process than we were in those years.  I mention this because I think that previous administrations &mdash; certainly the previous administration that abolished the formal planning Department &mdash; bear a great deal of responsibility and will be judged harshly by our future economic historians.  How can one speak about accepting the target <Col N="242" /> of reducing unemployment and using a mix of interventionary measures, a mixed economy model of the economy, without commitment to planning?  The point I am simply making this morning is that if the Minister's measures were being introduced against a backdrop of planning procedures in existence, of planning measures being assessed, it would have so much more force, because the impact on youth unemployment would then be able to be related to employment achievements generally and these could be related to different forms of activity within the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is accurate, as the Minister has pointed out, to seek to relate the youth unemployment problem to the background of employment in general by looking at the peculiar structure of Irish society at the present time.  Basically, if we are honest we must see that the last decade, in particular the recent years, has shown that the employment possibilities within agriculture have continued to shrink.  This is due to a number of reasons: the increased capitalisation of Irish agriculture, the peculiar form of response to opportunities within the EEC which has led to responses to increases in volume in turn responding to increases in prices; and there is, of course, the lack of attractiveness so often reported in different accounts of prospects of life within farming itself, with both its limited possibilities and also the question of the insecurity which attaches to a lifetime devoted to agriculture.  Whatever the reasons &mdash; and I think we can elicit and order them without much dispute &mdash; the fact is that employment opportunities within agriculture have continued to contract. At the same time there has been a somewhat disproportionate increase in the total employment opportunities within the service sector and there has been a massive increase in population, in the number of people who are within the young sections of population.  We are faced then with the reality of comparing our industrial strategy and its achievement in relation to employment against the only test of its efficacy in political and human terms: how close is it to provision of the total number of jobs required? <Col N="243" /> Here we can discern, both in general and employment terms; a shortfall between the industrial strategy's performance and the total number of jobs required, and the most serious section of that shortfall to which this Bill this morning addresses itself is the question of the implications for the employment of young people.</P>
    <P>I would like to take up a few points that have been made by the Minister and I will take the ones with which I would agree for a start.  I certainly think that he has behaved courageously in bringing in this Bill quickly, even though it can be amended in a number of ways if required. But the Bill is welcome because it expresses an emphasis with which I would most strongly agree.  That is, we cannot wait until the economy turns around, until there are some signs of recovered economic growth, to begin preparing employment strategies for young people, education and training experience programmes and measures like that.  To do so would be to commit the industrial workforce, but particularly those who may not yet have even had the experience of working within industry, to the whims and fluctuations of the economy.  It would be putting the performance of the economy, in relation to its external performance in achieving export-led growth, as the principal priority and looking at what its performance might be by way of consequences; and these would be in turn related to the employment prospects of young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has it right in that I see in the speech the tacit acceptance of the logic that times of economic recession and times when there are no prospects of significant levels of growth are times for, instead of retreating from commitments to training and development, increasing resources and investing them in training and development.  That logic is right both in the short term and in the long term.  It is right in the short term because if there is to be a return to growth, that growth will be achieved by the productive capacity of people who are working.  Their productive capacity will be in turn conditional upon adequacy and extent, the range and diversity of the training, development <Col N="244" /> and educational skills that they have achieved.  I also think that in the long term the logic is correct.  Ireland, whether we like it or not &mdash; and we often sit with the more affluent nations and like to pretend that we have arrived on the world stage in circumstances that often belie our economic reality &mdash; is yet a relatively underdeveloped economy and the long term reason for investing in training and education and development and such experience as will enhance the overall development of people who will be working in ten years' time is that this is the most appropriate strategy of a manpower kind for an undeveloped economy to have as it faces the new restructured world economy.</P>
    <P>The alternative is that the traditional economy would be perceived as having the capacity of returning to growth, that such a return to growth would create industrial conditions and employment consequences that would in turn be visited back upon our economy through a number of years.  The whole argument of the undeveloped economies of the world in relation to the new world economic strategy which is being negotiated is that they are seeking short cuts to development; and one of the surest short cuts to development is to put resources massively into the area of training, development and education.  It means simply that one is not committed historically or in development terms to forcing oneself tediously through the trajectory of experience of the existing developed economies of the world.  It means that the young population which we have now becomes a massive resource, if handled properly, to short circuit a number of the stages of achieving conditions in the economy, conditions in society which traditional and disproved economic theory would have suggested was impossible. The classical economic model of development, when it spoke in the past of employment and youth unemployment, tended to suggest that we had inexorably to move through a series of stages and that these stages were imitative of the experience of existing developed economies. It has been rejected; it has been proved wrong.  One of the ways by which <Col N="245" /> all of the new economies are assuring that they can achieve things and hope for things in the decades ahead is that where they hold the resource of young population, such as we do to an extraordinary degree within Europe, they enhance that resource with training, skills and educational experience and can move quickly past several of the stages of undevelopment which the other traditional economies had historically to experience.</P>
    <P>There is an assumption in the speech with which I want to quibble.  It is almost peripheral to the main substance of the speech but nevertheless exists within it. This is in the relationship between training and development and education.</P>
    <P>I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that where training in development and experience are envisaged, the relationship will enhance education. Unfortunately people have sought to pose traditional education experience in tension with technological experience and technological education.  I entirely reject that.  I want to relate this to my previous point about the possible overall strategy and the place of employment in manpower forecasts, within it.  As far back as 15 years ago, undeveloped countries were beginning to reject short-term training aids from developed economies. They could see that such aids locked them into an exploitable relationship with developed countries.  This came to a head in 1974 at the United Nations Conference in Training Development in Nairobi which concerned itself with technology transfer.  The message given by the undeveloped economies to the world at that stage was &ldquo;We want investment in fundamental education so that we can make the new discoveries in science, so that we can be innovative, can relate to technology, to scientific discovery in a way that existing economies cannot.  We want to have the right to do that, rather than be given pieces of technology which are obsolescent and already dated and which will commit us to an under-labourer relationship with the developed world for the rest of our historic experience.&rdquo;  They were asking for investment, so that they might have possibilities of research in <Col N="246" /> fundamental science or fundamental education.</P>
    <P>It has been one of the tragedies within the discussion of the manpower needs of our economy that people within the technological sector have felt it necessary to suggest that they are in competition for scarce resources with their traditional academic institutions.  The Minister said that the emphasis of our education system is now strongly on academic rather than vocational skills and that while some efforts have been made to remedy this imbalance, they have lacked real conviction and consequently their impact has not been significant.  It is important, however, to be careful about parts of the traditional educational system which have responded and those which have not.  The university sector, for example, will be providing, at the end of the nineties, it is forecast, over half of the engineers required in this country, presuming that enrolment in engineering training at third level colleges which are not universities will continue at the existing rate and that we will have no increase in university places.  It is the greatest foolishness to suggest that the universities lack the capacity, or the will, to provide for these placings.  This is an unfortunate tension which has no logic behind it.  It does not serve the cause of rational development of our educational system that people feel they want to make a point for the advancement of the technological centre in third level education at the cost of the universities.</P>
    <P>There is a point where the Minister's speech is precisely accurate.  However, rather than being the educational system, it is the parental attitudes which lie behind the educational system which are responsible.  There are, as is well known, three or four scholarly studies which put it beyond doubt that there is a prejudice in Ireland against industrial work.  In the rural areas the studies which are important are those of Dr. Morrin in the Galway Gaeltacht, which assessed the attitude of school leavers towards employment in the end of the sixties.  This was preceded by the work of Mary Mulligan, again within the Tuam area, followed in the seventies by a work in North <Col N="247" /> Mayo by the Irish Foundation for Human Development.  All those studies produced a set of almost common results which would make it foolish to want to replicate them in other respects.</P>
    <P>People in rural Ireland were asked the general questions: &ldquo;What do you think will change areas around here?  What hopes are there for an area like this?&rdquo; Most people said: &ldquo;Industries and work in factories&rdquo;.  However, there has never been less than 60 per cent of parents unwilling to allow their children to have the opportunity of working in factories. The common man's logic from that is that people are in favour of industrialisation &mdash; the factory system &mdash; provided other people's children go through the motions of making the factories and industrial experience work.  These three crucially important studies in looking at the transformation of our society and, particularly, the adjustment from agriculture to industrialisation, have been followed by more tentative work on limited samples in the last five years, which suggest that there is an erosion of these attitudes and a discernible change.  An extensive survey now would probably show that attitudes are changing.</P>
    <P>The studies I have quoted were of rural areas, without the experience of industrialisation, with parents lacking such experience being asked to express an opinion on the basis of something which they have never experienced.  At all times in urban areas &mdash; towns and particularly, cities &mdash; one would have an entirely different set of attitudes.  It is to those that I would like to turn to make another point.</P>
    <P>If we look at the fit between the educational system and manpower and behind the educational system, there is another cautionary note which I would urge on the Minister and his advisers. There is a body of opinion which suggests that the experience within the educational system is not as neatly related to job requirements and experience as is commonly assumed.  Much more than is traditionally believed of the requirements of jobs, is, in fact, learned on the jobs themselves.  Many people like myself <Col N="248" /> who are interested in equality in society have asked the question: &ldquo;If you have missed out in the educational system, does this inevitably mean that you have missed out in earning capacity for the rest of your life, in the lifestyle to which you will have access and the security which you might hope for?  There is no real connection.  The opening point of employment tends to look for people with particular educational skills, even though these are completely unrelated to the skills required in the performance of the job.  It is not that there is a neat fit between participation in one set of structures and an automatic participation in another.  There is a point at which real sets of prejudices are very logically intervened. One could very well argue that if we had a more pragmatic approach towards the filling of particular kinds of jobs, we could very clearly establish that this differential participation in education need not be discriminatory.</P>
    <P>I have defended the universities' contribution towards the educational system, but such a tragically low proportion of our population participate in third level education.  Our tax structure and our ability to contribute to the tax requirements of the country's revenue are very democratic. They spread across the board. However, participation in the educational institutions is far from democratic. Whereas every practical working man and woman can contribute to the revenue which will fund education, perhaps as little as one in seven of the children of people below the professional categories will participate in third level education.</P>
    <P>We see professions repeating and reproducing themselves on a mixture of scarce access to third level institutions and carefully inculcated prejudices in relation to recruitment and notions as to what is the appropriate content of a role within a profession or within a factory. All of these attitudes must be undone.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the Minister's introductory speech.  It would have been wrong to wait for the developments I mentioned earlier in relation to planning. It would be foolish to say that because the planning structures do not exist and because we cannot fit employment and <Col N="249" /> manpower needs within a coherent version of our economic options we should hold up this legislation.  I commend the Minister on the speed with which he has brought forward this matter.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to liaise as much as possible with the Department of Justice.  As a member of the prison reform group when studying aspects of crime I was struck very forcibly by the relationship between youth unemployment and the crime statistics.  It is interesting that the general curse of unemployment lies so dreadfully behind crime statistics.  When we hear that the crime rates are going up our usual attitude is to look for more sources of vigilance.  What we need to do is intervene in the life prospects of the people becoming involved in crime.  Some of the surveys carried out in the inner Dublin area show that 85 per cent of all young people involved in crime have not had the experience of even one of their parents having had a full-time occupation for three years previous to their involvement with the police.  Employment measures are very much better than measures of control.  The more resources are put into the area of employment the less likely we are to waste scarce resources in custodial responses to crime rates we might have prevented had we better structured our society in the beginning.</P>
    <P>Regarding the description of the precise measures which will be introduced under this Bill, I differ from Deputy Gene Fitzgerald in the emphasis he gives to existing schemes and the suggested new schemes.  It would not be useful to dissociate ourselves from what we have. The experience of existing schemes indicates a need for integration and for greater flexibility in funds.  We should add the new measures to these schemes. This approach is probably the better one.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as a public representative I have had dealings with the different agencies within education and training and manpower and I have always been impressed by the openness with which they deal with inquiries.  One gets the impression of a modern service dealing with a modern problem in a relatively open way.  The reports of the manpower <Col N="250" /> service, particularly during the past two or three years, show the speed with which inquiries are handled and the efficiency of turnover between inquiries and placements. If it were not for the fact that the general tide of unemployment is almost swamping this service, we could say that here we have an example of a very modern and efficient aspect of the public service.</P>
    <P>I would ask Members who might be reluctant to support this Bill to compare experience within the manpower service with the experience of looking for unemployment benefit or assistance.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the new services will have a modern ambiance and will be built on what has come to be known of the Department of Labour and the manpower service in recent years rather than on the traditional form of interview.  I have been appalled to find that in the eighties the &ldquo;hatch&rdquo; phenomenon still exists in our society, the notion that if you are in receipt of some benefit you must present yourself in circumstances which are very different from those in any other office.  I pay tribute to the exceptional circumstances which prevail in the offices of the manpower service.  I hope the new services will be administered in a modern setting so that young people can sit down and be advised and express choices within options.  I have often felt that we as politicians would have a different life if our relationships with the public had been transformed in a modern way.</P>
    <P>I note reference in the Minister's speech to the similarity between the measures he is to introduce and the measures which exist by way of a guarantee system in Scandinavian countries.  Some years ago I visited offices in Sweden administering these schemes and was impressed by the manner in which options were explained sensitively to young people in a modern setting.</P>
    <P>If we have backward attitudes in relation to the kinds of people we think should be working within factories, we sometimes have equally backward attitudes in relation to youth unemployment. There is a dangerous notion abroad that as long as young people are doing anything <Col N="251" /> then something has been achieved. This is a disgraceful heritage of poor law thinking from the last century.  In our failed social revolution we took over much of that thinking in relation to social services and we managed not to change the institutional structures.  Our idea was that people should be doing work of sufficient hardship, worse than any other work that might be available.  People often talk about the kind of tasks they feel it would be appropriate for young people to carry out.</P>
    <P>It would be a complete tragedy if we were to wait for economic growth to introduce legislation dealing with the training of young people.  Within the next two decades the world of work as we know it will change completely.  There is evidence that the trend elsewhere of people doing more than one job in the course of a lifetime will be followed here. The working week will shorten and the working day will change its structure. Great flexibility will be required in relation to changes within work and in leisure. Anybody who suggests any short-term measures of an occupational kind without a training content, or with a training content but without a sufficient educational content, will be incapacitating young people for the circumstances in which they will find themselves in the decades ahead.</P>
    <P>That is why I stress the importance of a sound educational base, because above all else there will be need for flexibility in making decisions, flexibility of choice in making the adjustments I mentioned between work and non-work; there will be need for flexibility in making choices between the form and adjustments in conditions within work.  Here I will refer to a point that is, in a way, the most contentious in the Minister's speech.  It is in relation to his reference to technology.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that even in five years we will be at the mercy of technology, as many people would like to put it.  It is possible, by the right investment of resources in education, to control technology. The Minister referred to the <Col N="252" /> National Development Corporation.  I would urge him to use what influence he has to ensure that the innovative potential of technology will be harnessed within the National Development Corporation. If that takes place it will make many things possible.  I am talking about new instrumental ways to look at work and productivity in a well-educated population creating new conditions for growth.  To do it the other way is to take the return to growth as the prior and necessary condition for performance in the economy, and to see industrial strategy as something that will be given.  The problem is to relate a human population to the skills and requirements of industry. To do that would be to lock ourselves into backwardness going into the next century, something we should not do.</P>
    <P>This is a practical implication of this legislation.  It means that when young people come for advice, for training, for experience, for development, the greatest care must be taken to have the imaginative requirements of such people met, their genuine desire to develop themselves as complete confident persons participating in society met.  It is not directly implicit in the Minister's speech, but in other speeches I have read it is inferred. I wish people would stop speaking of the gap between the aspirations of young people and the requirements of industry as it exists at present as a problem for young people.  It is a problem for industry because if you are to say that the imagination and the aspiration to live and to work in an entirely new way must go overboard so that industry will chug along through its tedious relationships with technology and in turn towards its outdated relationship with fundamental science, you are putting historical forces of a non-human kind before human requirements.</P>
    <P>I believe that investment in science and technology is not a utopian dream.  It has happened in other countries.  The previous connection between science and technology has meant that technology became available in a private enterprise model of industrial revolution and industrial development.  The result was that after its application certain kinds of <Col N="253" /> employment became possible.  It is now quite the other way: If macro-economic planning is built into a master economic plan, technology and the resources of science can be used and combined in such agencies as the National Development Corporation so as to serve employment needs.  I believe that will be the character of the next industrial revolution.  The thinking along the lines of growth occurring in improved conditions, and whether we have people doing the right and most useful things, is nostalgic of an old and exploited industrial order that is already on its last legs and that will not return.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when people speak as the Minister has done of the interaction that must exist between those responsible for the formulation of educational training policies and those who chart the course of industrial development in the years ahead, they are talking of a very big frame.  For a start, who wants to make suggestions about what the industrial investment strategy in the years ahead will be?  I suggest tentatively that when we are looking for industry in the decades ahead we have a choice to go on competing with the manpower we have, given its existing skill levels, or the possibility of speeding up those skill levels and going forth ensuring that people who will work in Irish society will be highly qualified technically but, more important, generally and in a way which will give them adaptable and adapted skills.  This would mean that on the form of industrial human labour relationships of the next 20 years we will have far greater amounts, in proportion to capital, related to individual units of labour.  The kind of industrialisation which might be captured by Ireland in its industrialisation strategy will be a qualitatively different one from that which we have been glad to accept in the past.  This means developing skills in a general and forward-looking way.</P>
    <P>I would welcome creative interaction between the world of the educationalists and of those planning manpower development, but it is time to put an end to this offensive nonsense that if you are doing something that has not immediate utility in terms of market value you are wasting your time.  To accept this thinking <Col N="254" /> is to try to run this country as some kind of Taiwan in terms of our attitude to labour.  The argument is that at any time when anybody has an opportunity to improve herself or himself, that is an appropriate and good educational exercise. The arguments are easily disputed in all the published research of people who have been given this task in Europe, in the US and in Canada.  They show, one after another, that where industrial ventures have been managed entirely by people with narrow engineering skills, and those alone, there has been massive loss of productivity in terms of ability to relate to workforces, but that people who had broader and more general educational skills were very attractive people in relation to taking complex decisions in regard to workforces, in relation to forward planning and to the whole environments in which people work.</P>
    <P>I urge as strongly as I can that there would be no commitment to narrowness in terms of education or training schemes.  For example, I will make what might be thought of as an eccentric suggestion. There are many young people now reared in a cultural environment completely different from that which preceded us.  If those young people come to some agency responsible for planning, for giving training, for developing new future skills, if they want to form theatre companies, to form bursaries for music training, for training in the many forms of dance, if they want to get involved in public entertainment, they should be helped because the strategy of approaching young people and their employment needs will be measured by its narrowness or its richness.  I should like to think that the very best in a person is what will be the important criterion.</P>
    <P>At this point I will make my own contribution in honest comment in regard to the implication of these schemes.  Unfortunately, there is some evidence that in times of recession people who have contributed, often by statutory requirement, by way of levy to different forms of training, seek to be relieved of what they regard as the burden of that levy so that the State money can go straight towards relieving them of their difficulties <Col N="255" /> without having to carry the cost of training, development and the different kinds of youth schemes.  I urge the Minister to confront that thinking as strongly as possible because it is in times of economic recession that, above all else, we need to invest in the expansion of skills rather than the opposite.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one last point to the Minister.  I had hoped it would have been possible to have some representative from the Department of Justice on the overall agency and to manage a liaison there.  When the Commission on Penal Reform was carrying out surveys into the employment background of young persons who ran into difficulties with the law one of the persons who most impressed me was a senior school attendance officer, a multi-purpose person who had to deal with the school, the mother of the child in difficulties, an unemployed alcoholic father in one case, and with the child.  It has been said that if all the agencies with which young persons deal could be integrated that would be of great benefit.  It is possible to think of the great waste of effort involved where schemes like the schemes we are discussing exist at one level and young persons in difficulties in communities exist at another level, without any precise link between them.  I share the fears about bureaucracy expressed by the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Fitzgerald, although I would not go all the way with him. However, it is important that the services we are providing should go where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>There are just a few points I feel I should make in relation to the question of education generally.  I am bothered by the tendency when the question of the young unemployed is discussed to suggest that those in particular difficulty are those who have left school at a very early age and now have a disability in relation to the marketing of the very few skills that they have having regard to the shrinking job opportunities.  This assumption is not tenable.  There should be every opportunity for a return to education for those who have left early.  After experience of employment or training of a particular <Col N="256" /> kind, re-entry to the educational system should be made possible so that people can take as much advantage as possible from the mixture of experience and training. Linked in with the Minister's proposals should be more general proposals for continuing education.</P>
    <P>I want to end on the point on which I began.  I believe we have a fractured view of the relationship between the economy and human skills when we speak about jobs in the white-collar section and jobs in the blue-collar section.  The general problem of unemployment casts its shadow across measures like this.  We have to look at the structure of the economy.  Our unemployment problems derive in substantial measure from the narrow productive section within the Irish economy generally and the vast speculative sector.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the levy here will be funded by a number of sources within the economy.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald is particularly concerned about the fact that PAYE workers will be caught with little opportunity for escape.  I am sure that many people who pay PAYE taxation will welcome the provision of opportunities for young persons to be trained for employment.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the speculative nature of portion of the economy. Between the 1970's and 1980's this section of the economy have evaded tax and have lost us employment opportunities. Senator T. K. Whitaker, scarcely a Marxist or a socialist or dangerous radical, spoke in 1973 about the tendency which had arisen in 1971 of new holding companies quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange buying companies and then, having sold these companies, moving on to other companies.  He correctly made the point that the whole exercise is predicated on inflation.  As capital values began to increase at a faster rate in proportion to earned income, the more you kept on at this exercise the more speculative wealth was created.  Senator Whitaker, in 1973, raised the question whether it was a good thing and &mdash; his words, not mine &mdash; whether it was even a moral thing.  Nevertheless, the companies that have indulged in this vast speculative <Col N="257" /> investment have been rewarded with the accolades of society.  If you consider the share gain performance as they move from company to company you will find that the total job losses the community suffered were in the thousands.  In other words, on one side there is vast accumulated private gain, largely non-taxed, and, on the other side of the account, an increase in the volume of unemployment that will have to be provided for out of the public purse in terms of unemployment benefit, retraining and the provision of new jobs.  A crucial factor in relation to all legislation like this is the speculative nature of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson in what we have heard this morning, that it is through State agencies and State initiative that the innovations will come in relation to training and development.  It is true that Irish industrial performance where it has not been assisted by the State has been seriously deficient.  This Bill is just one new State measure.  Measures like this designed to produce a better trained, more broadly educated people, will make possible the extension of the productive component of the economy and it is in that sense that I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this legislation would have much more force if it had come in against a background of planning structures and planning legislation.  It would be wrong to fault the Minister in that connection and it would be absurd to suggest that his alacrity and energy in bringing in a measure of this kind, which I welcome, should be penalised by having to wait for planning legislation.  I would urge him very strongly to consider the importance of integrating all these measures into the planning process, particularly the social part of the planning process.  Otherwise, what will happen after a few years of successive schemes like this, is the uncertainty that an unplanned largely speculative economy will offer, that maybe, when the market expands and export growth has returned, there will be employment.</P>
    <P>We have to confront the economic structures and it is in the shoddy thinking which props up the economic structures <Col N="258" /> that the problem lies.  The population is young.  The arguments are made in the Minister's speech that long after expansion has flattened out in Europe and work processes are becoming dated, we will continue to have an expanding young workforce.  At that stage the choice will be between the quality of that workforce and the skills and education and training it carries contrasted with an old shrinking workforce, or, if we had done it the other way, if we had said that the young must put up with what the economy will bear, we will have an eviscerated young workforce and we will have missed our opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I differ from Deputy Higgins when he speaks about education.  A very high percentage of our population is under 25 years of age and many of them have not yet drawn a wage packet so let us forget about education for the moment and talk about a system which will provide employment for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is vague as to how the levy will be collected from self-employed and professional people.  I have no hesitation in saying that people who pay PRSI will not mind doing so if it means providing jobs.  Successive Governments did not take advantage of the boom period in the early seventies, when we had the benefits of agricultural and other exports to the EEC, to provide for the future.  Consequently, we now have a young, growing population and no employment for them. The agencies which the Minister suggested should make application to the Youth Employment Agency are the IDA, the National Manpower Service, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education.  The National Manpower Service must play a greater role than at present.  Agents employed by the State take the names of people who register as unemployed but make no effort to ensure that such people will be given an opportunity to work when employment becomes available. The service is being used by employers who send out lists to the National Manpower Service and if an employer is looking for extra staff, a person registered as <Col N="259" /> unemployed should be given an opportunity of getting work.</P>
    <P>Recently in the north Cork area a grant of £47,000 was made under the environmental scheme.  That is a small amount of money yet it had the effect of helping to create employment.  In each local authority area there is a massive amount of work to be done but the money to pay people to do it is not available.  In the case of young people who are at present going to employment exchanges to sign qualification certificates for unemployment assistance and subjected to a means test, some are disallowed completely and others are allowed £2.50 or £3 per week. Young people want work.  This vast amount which will reach £63 million in 1982, with a contribution of £40 million from the State, must be used.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the National Development Corporation.  He should also have included the co-operative movement because we must recognise that it is through their efforts that new jobs can be created.  We have failed in the past to develop our natural resources. We could create jobs on the land, in forestry, mines, fisheries and bogs through a planned co-operative effort. There is evidence to show there is now more interest in the co-operative movement. That is the way to create jobs. Building and repair of houses means jobs.  We should be talking about basic down to earth things like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sitting on an economic time bomb at present.  Productivity has fallen, inflation is rising and unemployment is nearing 130,000.  Most of our ordinary private companies are either making a loss or heading towards it.  The mid-1981 figure for youth unemployment is 40,000 between the ages of 15 and 25.  That means that 26 per cent or 27 per cent of the total unemployment figure falls into the category of young people.  That places us very firmly close to the top of the EEC league for youth unemployment.  10.6 per cent of our working population cannot get employment &mdash; the figure at present stands at <Col N="260" /> 129,200, an increase of 2,000 on the September figure &mdash; compared with 11½ per cent in Britain.  In October 1981 the EEC seemed to be heading for the crisis figure of 10 million people who will not be able to find work.  Clearly, it is a problem with which all Governments have to grapple.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to what the Tánaiste, Deputy O'Leary, said recently, not to make any party political points, because I think this scandal is bigger than governments, but to highlight one of our problems. In <i>The Irish Times</i> recently the Tánaiste said that on the basis of present policies over the next five years it would be difficult to see unemployment falling below 125,000.  He said also again on the basis of present policies, that we will have to find a novel way of dealing with unemployment at the level we have it at today, otherwise we are talking about a lot of young people being out of work on a semi-permanent basis.  The Deputy leader is suggesting that, under present policies for which the Government are responsible, there is no answer to youth unemployment.  I stress this is not a party political point but this man is Deputy Leader, he is also my Deputy Leader as a citizen and this is the sort of leadership which young people are being asked to accept as being a glowing light which they are to follow.</P>
      <P>At least the Tánaiste admits &mdash; and I admire his frankness &mdash; that by the spring of next year this figure could be 145,000 unemployed on the basis of present policies. If the figure is now 129,000, according to official statistics, and the Tánaiste thinks it is going to be 145,000 by next spring, it means the Government are saying that unemployment is going to grow by 16,000 over Christmas.  In all the euphoria about pouring money into the pockets of our young people to take them off the streets, I want to highlight a contradiction in the economic policies and approach of the Government.  On the one hand they are raising £90 million to create employment and on the other hand pointing out that 16,000 extra people will be joining the dole queues over Christmas.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions No. 2 and 3 together.  I am satisfied, on the basis of a report I have received from AnCO, that the training needs of the west Cork region can be fully met by the existing and planned facilities in the Cork and Tralee training centres supplemented as necessary by mobile training <Col N="265" /> units and external training and community youth training programmes and that the establishment of a permanent training centre in Bantry would not be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that an undertaking was given by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, on behalf of the Taoiseach, that an AnCO centre would be built in Bantry and that Deputy Sheehan, in his election addresses throughout west Cork and especially in the Bantry area, broadcast over his loudspeakers that this undertaking would be honoured by the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this was a firm commitment given by the Taoiseach?  Is he telling us that the Taoiseach is not prepared to honour that commitment, that he is welching on another promise he gave? Because of his indifferent attitude to the intelligence of the people of west Cork, did he give this commitment without having any intention of honouring it?  The Minister said there were no grounds for having an AnCO centre at Bantry.  Is he standing by what the Taoiseach said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that no youths from Cork south-west have been trained in the Cork AnCO centre for quite a long time.  Letters returned to these young people from that centre saying they cannot be accommodated in Cork are causing a great deal of frustration.  In view of the fact that Bantry <Col N="266" /> is supposed to be an industrialised zone in the south-west Cork area, would the Minister consider investigating the possibility of establishing a training centre in Bantry?  Bantry covers a hinterland from Kenmare to the Bandon river and it is impossible for the centre in Cork to accommodate the number of applicants. It is well known that there are no facilities available for the people of that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will ensure that the AnCO training unit at Droichead Nua, County Kildare, will not be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The training unit in Droichead Nua operates out of AnCO's Ballyfermot training centre as a mobile training unit.</P>
      <P>Mobile units primarily provide training in production operative skills.  They are intended to supplement permanent centres and to provide for short-term needs in areas of smaller population.  The units are located in towns where their presence can be justified by the number of likely users at a given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit in Droichead Nua will continue there in its present form for the time being but it will be liable for transfer to other areas depending on the needs as <Col N="268" /> shown from time to time by changing patterns of unemployment throughout the country or other circumstances such as new industrial developments.</P>
    <P>Such apprentice fitter training as was carried out in Newbridge to meet local shortages of fitters in the short-term will in future be carried out at the expanded Tallaght and Ballyfermot training centres as was originally intended.  Only in larger centres such as these can full facilities for apprenticeship training be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that training facilities will continue in Droichead Nua but is he aware that the powers that be in AnCO, possibly unknown to him, have already made a decision to close down this centre?  In fact, it is being run down, machinery is being taken out of it and the manager moved back to Dublin last Monday.  Is the Minister aware that the need which resulted in the establishment of the unit in 1978 is greater now?  A total of 96 have registered in the Droichead Nua postal district region with Manpower for training and 240 in County Kildare altogether. The Minister indicated that better training can exist in the bigger units such as Ballyfermot but is he aware that the 12 apprentices from this school were the best in Ireland this year and two of them gained first and second places even though Ballyfermot claimed credit for them?  Will the Minister make a promise to me that he will have this matter investigated more fully and if he finds what I have said to be true he will retain and extend this facility in Droichead Nua?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, the training centre will continue as it presently operates in Droichead Nua and as long as the demand remains for it, and if it increases it will be left there.  However, apprentice fitter training will be carried on in Ballyfermot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give me a guarantee that if I provide the material for him to prove that there is a demand among local firms that apprentice fitter training be continued in Droichead Nua &mdash; I am not satisfied that the present <Col N="269" /> situation will continue because it is being run down &mdash; he will have the matter fully investigated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that implementation of these EEC regulations has been a difficult issue for the Irish transport industry.  However, the problems which the regulations involve for the Irish industry have been fully argued in the negotiations over a number of years to obtain from the EEC Council of Ministers and the Commission a series of deferrals and easements in the application of these regulations to Irish transport, particularly domestic transport.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In my approach to the situation at Ross Company Limited I was concerned above all to ensure that employment at the yard would be preserved without prejudice to the processing of whatever claims the workers had.  Shortly after taking up office as Minister for Labour I therefore had meetings with the receiver and with some of the trade union officials concerned to examine the problems and difficulties inherent in the situation. The workers had already been paid the redundancy money to which they were statutorily entitled and had also been paid holiday money and pay in lieu of notice.  Claims for severance money, over and above the statutory redundancy money, had been made and there were suggestions that Government funds should be used to satisfy these claims.  My predecessor had clearly indicated to a representative of the workers in May last, however, that there were no Government funds from which the payments in question could be made.  I had the matter further examined and I had to conclude that the legal constraints precluded the adoption of a flexible approach in the matter of any initiatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="284" /> Labour if he will apply the I per cent levy on incomes in excess of £120 per week in the forthcoming youth employment legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The scope of the youth employment levy contained in the Youth Employment Agency Bill will generally be the same as that used for collecting health contributions.</P>
      <P>Based on Department of Health estimates, the expected yield from a 1 per cent levy on gross incomes, with some minor exceptions for medical card holders and social welfare recipients, is roughly £63 million in 1982-83.</P>
      <P>Information on the expected yield in respect of taxable incomes is not available. The Government programme provides for a levy on all incomes.</P>
      <P>Based again on Department of Health estimates, the expected levy yield from incomes in excess of £120 per week is roughly £30 million and such incomes will be liable to levy.</P>
      <P>I intend to exempt contributory and non-contributory old age and retirement pensions from the youth employment levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree that it is desirable to exempt old age pensioners, both contributory and noncontributory. I take that he has confirmed that.  Would the Minister also agree that it is desirable to exempt those on low incomes from this charge?  I appreciate that the figure which the Minister has given would greatly reduce the figures which he has in mind, but could he give consideration to exempting from the 1 per cent those, particularly families, on low incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct that we are exempting old age pensioners from the levy.  In the case of the other category to which he has referred, this will depend, quite honestly, on what he considers to be the level.  We would have to take that into account before a change could be made.  The <Col N="285" /> product of the levy will, obviously, determine what can be done in this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the imposition, particularly on low income families, of the levy on gross income, as would apply, would be particularly serious for those with a sizeable family?  For instance, a man with a wife and five children on £120 a week will be paying £1.20 per week, whereas a single person on a similar income would also be paying £1.20 a week.  There is a considerable inequity in the way that this would bear on families, especially on the lower income levels.  That is why I ask the Minister to give some consideration to that aspect.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the collection of the levy, on the basis of the health contributions, is one which is relatively inequitable for PAYE workers, in that it is very difficult to collect the health contributions from those who are not involved and the amount collected there is considerably less than might be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that the Deputy is making.  We have this morning introduced the Bill and I understand that on Committee Stage we will be discussing all the points raised by the Deputy.  I will give the Deputy's point some consideration and also the other points raised by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement this morning to the House on the Second Stage of the Bill, the Minister stated that £63 million would be the income from the 1 per cent levy.  Further on in his statement he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that preliminary consideration was being given to excluding low paid workers.  Have the Government taken a decision on that?  It is most unusual for a member of the Government to cost something in the House and then say that preliminary consideration has been given to it.  That means that the Government <Col N="286" /> have not made up their minds about the lower paid worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The consideration being given by the Government is, obviously, in a budgetary context.  I am not in a position to tell the result of these deliberations.  If any changes are made during that deliberation, all Deputies would wish that it would be applied to the youth employment field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more relevant to the Bill which is at present before the House.  We did not realise that the Bill was coming to that stage.  Could I ask a final supplementary?  Did I understand the Minister to say that all medical card holders will be excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is aware of the nature of the distribution of medical cards, that in some counties it is 66 per cent of the population and these would be excluded, whereas in Dublin the distribution is 22 per cent of the population? Would the Minister look at the imposition here?  I appreciate the element at which the Minister is trying to get among those medical card holders and it is reasonable that these should be excluded.  However, the way the medical card system operates would bear unfavourably on certain sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy would not want me to reduce the numbers in the 66 per cent distribution area to the Dublin level and it would not be a matter for me in my Department to increase to 66 per cent the Dublin distribution. That is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I get clarification on one point?  I understood the Minister to say that the Government are considering the extent of exclusion in a budgetary context.  Does that mean that the Minister envisages the Bill being passed by this House and perhaps the other House, without any decision being announced as to who is in or out?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of decentralising the Labour Court has been considered on a number of occasions in the past and the conclusion reached was that any such change would not be warranted. Industrial relations officers of the court are allocated disputes in designated provincial areas in addition to disputes arising in Dublin.  This arrangment enables the officers to familiarise themselves with the problems of the particular areas concerned and to establish a relationship with representatives of industry and of the trade unions there.</P>
      <P>I have had no complaints which would indicate that areas outside Dublin have suffered in any way as regards the availability of the conciliation service.  The Labour Court itself also travels to hear cases in the provinces.</P>
      <P>I believe that arrangements currently in force can provide an efficient service in the Cork and other areas of the country.</P>

      <P>Flexible working hours were introduced in the civil service in 1977 on a pilot basis.  Initially less than 600 staff, mainly in the executive grades, in six Departments and offices were comprehended by the pilot schemes.  The schemes were later extended to cater for clerical and other grades and currently embrace a total of 5,243 staff in 11 Departments and offices.  Generally, where the opportunity to participate in a pilot scheme has been available to staff, over 90 per cent have opted to join the scheme.  Details of the Departments and offices operating pilot schemes and the number of staff availing of flexible working hours are given in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the relevant legislation the appointment of a person to be the ombudsman is made by the President upon resolutions passed by the Dáil and Seanad.  The question of appointing an ombudsman will be examined in conjunction with the Government's deliberations on budgetary requirements for 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there such reluctance on the part of the Government to put forward the name of a person to fill this position?  Is the Minister aware of the great need for the appointment of an ombudsman, particularly since this Government took office?  The public have many problems which need attention.  I wonder why the Government are so reluctant to appoint an ombudsman when they are appointing special advisers at enormous cost to the State who are of no benefit to constituents.</P>

To date seven such competitions have been held and a further competition <Col N="299" /> for Clerical Assistant was announced recently.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that as recently as 27 October the Commissioners sent a letter to one candidate who had been successful in the contest stating that the Commissioners recommend a person for appointment if, and only if, the Commissioners are satisfied that he is in good health and free from any physical defect or disease which would be likely to interfere with the proper discharge of his duties in that position?  The letter continued:</P>
      <P>The Commissioners, after considering the particular case, were of the opinion that his eyesight was not such as to enable him to discharge the duties of the position efficiently.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this raises a very serious question for the blind?  I know that the NLB are very concerned about the matter.

The sum of £50 million represented, in broad terms only, the amount by which excess expenditure on the global provision for Exchequer pay and pensions would be reduced in 1981 by the curtailment of claims for special pay increases and the measures announced in relation to public sector numbers.  Furthermore, the schemes of conciliation and arbitration in the public service under which most of the claims for special pay increases are negotiated, provide that their proceedings are confidential to the parties thereto.

    <Title>Youth Employment Agency Bill, 1981: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I made the point that the country is sitting on an economic time bomb.  I said that the Tánaiste during the week-end pointed to an unemployment figure of 145,000 compared with today's figure of 129,000, meaning that the Tánaiste was suggesting an increase in unemployment of 16,000 between now and Christmas.  I pointed to the statement by him that he did not believe we could create any more jobs, that the answer to our unemployment problem was in early retirement and work sharing.</P>
      <P>I should like to continue by referring to another aspect of the Tánaiste's statement during a weekend interview.  He singled out our young people and used the rather depressing words that we should think of our young people being out of work on a semi-permanent basis. I said before lunch that I did not intend to introduce party political rancour into the debate, but I find it depressing, uninspiring leadership from the Tánaiste who should be trying to lead our young people into worthwhile quality jobs.  Is it any wonder that in recent weeks we have had renewed talk about emigration, of our young people not being able to find the jobs they want at home and having to go abroad?  They are entitled to those jobs at home and Irish Governments have a responsibility to provide those jobs for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Tánaiste throws his hands in the air and says that our young people will have to become used to being unemployed <Col N="338" /> on a semi-permanent basis, what are our young people to do but the same thing, to throw their hands in the air and say: &ldquo;Michael O'Leary or the Government do not have the answer to our problem.&rdquo; That leads to increased frustration, to an increase in crime and other social problems, all the side effects of unemployment referred to in the House this morning.  This is not good enough.  Perhaps it is even dangerous.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Tánaiste's pessimistic view.  Given the right kind of leadership and commitment we can get back to growth levels of 3 per cent or 4 per cent. Throughout 1980-81 we managed to have slight positive growth.  There is no reason why with the right kind of leadership we cannot get back to 3 to 4 per cent growth and that would provide needed jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not share his pessimism either because a lot of the jobs which are being lost are in the traditional older industries and they are beginning to work their way through the system with the result that we are increasingly dependent on our newer and more successful industries &mdash; pharmaceutical, electronics, health care, the newer and brighter types of industries which we have been attracting and establishing for some years past.  The losses in the older industries must now be getting to the stage where they are levelling out. There is still some scope in this country, despite the pessimism of our Tánaiste, to attract investment, particularly from abroad.  This should be and can be done in a systematic, organised way.  Even a small increase, a tiny increase, in investment in this country would have an enormous effect on the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs.  For example, there are more people employed in Birmingham in manufacturing industry than there are in all of Ireland.  That gives an idea of how small an increase in investment we need to have an immediate effect on the number of jobs created.</P>
    <P>I reject the pessimistic, depressing, uninspiring approach of the Government to this whole question of providing jobs for our young people.  It certainly is not designed to give them the hope, the encouragement, the determination, if the <Col N="339" /> Government cannot provide them with jobs, at least to get on their own feet and go out and look for jobs and provide jobs for themselves by their own ingenuity.  A lot of damage has been done in this particular case.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the Bill very briefly. I have a number of criticisms of the Bill. I do not question its sincerity.  I want to say that to the Minister.  I do not question an honest attempt to put young people to work.  What I do question is its effectiveness and to a certain extent I have to say I feel it is a little bit of a fraud because, first of all, it is dishonest to suggest in this Bill that somehow there are new funds being made available, there is a magic £90 million being switched on which we did not have before which is now coming on-stream to allow us to provide jobs for our people.  It is dishonest to say that. We should call it what it is.  It is a tax, a straight-forward tax on people and obviously from this Bill it is a tax on people's income.  So, let us call it what it is: it is an income tax to fund employment.</P>
    <P>Considering that, we should look at some of the figures involved.  I am open to correction on this when the Minister is replying, but in the Minister's speech he mentioned a figure of £40 million from his Department from the end of April to December next year and said that this would be the amount which would be allocated for this particular purpose.  If you go through the various figures allocated at present under the same headings you come up with a figure somewhere between £25 million and £30 million. That is my figure.  I am sure there will be other figures throughout the day.  Overall, the impression to me is quite clear that what this fund is trying to do is to fund the existing operations, to fund the existing schemes.  There would therefore seem to me to be no new funds brought to bear on the problem of youth unemployment. If there is, then it is certainly very marginal and only what could be expected by way of a normal increase under those various headings next year. I suggest that it is really an income tax to swell the Exchequer and perhaps we <Col N="340" /> should be honest enough to call it that and to see it in that way.</P>
    <P>I welcome this attempt to coordinate and to pull together the various agencies and the various efforts to provide youth employment but I am not happy with the implication, the insinuation, that somehow there are bright new funds suddenly being made available to provide jobs for young people.  It seems to me to be more of a work-sharing exercise rather than creative.  It is taking money from the public at large basically to try to share out what work we have available, which reflects the attitude of the Tánaiste in that particular interview also, that there is no new work; let us just be happy and content to share the work we have and to take it from there.  I find that a very depressing attitude.</P>
    <P>I would worry lest this £90 million should really become a super dole.  I would worry lest it should become just another means of paying for social workers generally.  What I would like to know is: are jobs going to be created in the social area, like the Tánaiste suggests, and how will that affect the embargo on the public service, if that is the case, or are real lasting productive jobs going to be created by this fund?  Is it just another transfer from people within the system or is it a real attempt to provide lasting, productive work the effect of which will go on long after the money is spent?  I would suggest that if it is just more funds being added to the great growth of the State machine, going to add to the size of our public service, if it is money heading in that area, I would prefer that it were not spent.</P>
    <P>If it is to be effective the money spent under this heading will have to provide continuity in employment.  I honestly cannot see any new money in the scheme, any new wealth being created as a result of the expenditure.  It would appear to me to be just another sort of finger in the dike effort in terms of holding back the unemployment figures.  It will have a short-term effect but no lasting real permanent jobs the effect of which will go on long after the money is spent.  That has to be the real test of any expenditure of this sort.  Otherwise, it is another super <Col N="341" /> dole, a State hand-out and the great State system is already creaking and I do not believe it can take much more.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figure of £90 million, the IDA suggest that it costs about £10,000 to provide an IDA job.  If we do our sums on that we should be looking forward to 9,000 jobs.  Otherwise that money could be given straight to the IDA and they could provide 9,000 jobs with that &mdash; 9,000 per annum.  If that is the case, how can we reconcile that with the Tánaiste's view that there are not any new jobs, that we have to share what jobs we have and not be talking about new jobs or working towards new jobs?  If we are going to spend £90 million, we should be getting 9,000 new jobs a year.  I would suggest to the Government that they are not going to do that, that what will happen is that this money will be frittered away on revenue items and at the end of the periods in question we will have spent some more money but will not have created the solid productive permanent jobs we hope to create.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is that I believe from Deputy Fitzgerald's breakdown this morning that some £10 million of that is coming directly out of people employed in Irish industry. Again, these figures are very much open to correction because they are very preliminary. If you are taking a figure like that out of Irish industry &mdash; £10 million or £20 million, or whatever the figure may be &mdash; to give it to an agency to provide jobs which may end up being service jobs, are you not in effect making it more likely that the industry that gives you the money will be in greater financial difficulty and therefore will not themselves be in a position to expand their own employment?  If we are just taking money from Irish industry to give it to some new people to create some new jobs, were we not better in the first place to leave it to those industries and encourage them to provide the jobs?  That is what we seem to be doing in this scheme. We have to look at it a bit more carefully.</P>
    <P>Speaking of Irish industry, I mentioned in my opening remarks that I do not believe there are any solid figures on it <Col N="342" /> but I believe that up to half the private companies in this country are in a loss-making situation.  I saw a corresponding figure some time ago, published by the Confederation of British Industries, which suggested that a somewhat similar number of British industries were losing money.  Considering that, perhaps it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Government to take a long, close look at some sort of rescue operation for small Irish industries.</P>
    <P>Recently our farmers put together a very attractive package of interest rates. They came up with a figure of the order of 10 per cent.  I do not begrudge it to them but many small businesses employing ten, 20, 40 or 50 people who are at present crippled by interest rates would dearly love the State to help them with a 10 per cent interest rate also.  However, there are always difficulties in this area and there is no panacea for these ills. Irish industry cannot take much more by way of levies or taxation because their losses have not yet come to the surface. This will happen by way of redundancies and reduced employment opportunities, so we must be careful about putting extra burdens on business companies.  We can do a lot more by way of joint ventures with foreign companies.  I feel that Irish firms do not have the clout they should have in international markets, because by the time they get on to the world stage other firms in other parts of the world have moved up to a higher level of importance.</P>
    <P>One of the ways to create jobs is to keep moving the capital budget and the amount of money we spend on our infrastructure. It is disappointing to see suggestions coming forward at the moment that our capital programme should be cut.  If the capital programme is cut, it is cutting directly into jobs on the factory floor.  We can ill afford to cut back on investment when we so badly need jobs. It is foolish to be talking on the one hand about providing £90 million to create jobs for young people when some other arm of Government will cut £90 million or perhaps more off the public capital programme or our productive spending.  It is a contradiction to be taking jobs away <Col N="343" /> and trying to recreate them by some form of agency whose future has not been debated as it should be.</P>
    <P>We should examine where we are going.  We need to examine our needs and resources.  We will have to stop the double thinking that we can let things drift.  We must put together an economic philosophy and an economic programme. We must have a fundamental re-assessment of the economy.  Do we place our trust in the great State machine, as perhaps Deputy Michael Higgins would like, or do we place our trust in individuals, as the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly, suggests?  I see the role of the State as controlling the worst excesses of private industry, speculation and private enterprise.  In the past these excesses have contributed to our level of poverty but I do not see the State as continuing to increase its involvement in running our enterprises.  I prefer to see the State controlling the people who run our enterprises.  We have to state unambiguously, as a philosophy, that there is a poverty line below which nobody should be allowed to fall, for whatever reason.  There is a duty on us to provide housing, education and all the basic human needs which people require.  We must be a humanitarian State with a keen sense of social justice.</P>
    <P>Enterprise is at an all-time low.  Our productive base urgently needs to be expanded.  If we do not do that through enterprise, the great State machine will have greater weights to carry on its shoulders and will finally creak to a halt.  There are approximately one million people in education, one-third of our population. Sister Stanislaus wrote a very fine book recently in which she said there were one million people, 700,000 on permanent social welfare benefits, the balance making up the total figure in receipt of social welfare.  The public sector is getting larger by the day, despite efforts of Governments to try to control it.</P>
    <P>Last week we agreed to pay £27 million to people in receipt of social welfare benefits. We had to borrow the money to do that.  I do not begrudge it to them but we must be honest and try to ensure that <Col N="344" /> there is a poverty line below which nobody falls.  If we do not teach our young people to create enterprise, our economic growth will fall off and we will be looking to the various Departments of State to swell the coffers by taking on more and more people, but this will not provide us with the surpluses we need to maintain our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>This genuinely worries me.  Recently I spoke to about 200 commerce students in a university.  At the end of my speech I asked them how many expected to employ people or how many would like to be lawyers and so on?  About 5 per cent saw themselves as being directly in the employment of other people.  They were the economics graduates of our universities.  If young people in the future cannot create work for their fellow citizens it will again fall on the State to provide employment.  I do not believe the State is in a position to continue to do that on the scale which is needed.  We should somehow teach our young people the lesson of enterprise.  If necessary we should ask the IDA to launch a business school and to highlight the attractiveness of a career in marketing and selling our products abroad.  Whatever we do the key must be in this area, expanding our productive base and asking our young people to put their work into that area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to ensure that as much of this £90 million as possible will find its way to the type of philosophy I have been putting forward here today.  If there are other philosophies which work, I would like to hear them but I have not heard them so far in this debate.</P>
    <P>In this basic re-assessment of our economy we have to be honest enough to examine some institutions and schemes which we have always taken for granted and assumed served the needs of the people.  In the sixties we fostered the semi-State companies and spoke about the tremendous contributions they made to our economy.  I believe they have made substantial contributions but are they suitable for the eighties and nineties?  Do we need enterprises which would involve the State with the private sector?  Do we <Col N="345" /> need to take our trade unions off the sidelines, in their role as watchdogs?  Do we need to bring them into a more participative role, with the banks and institutions, in the running of Irish enterprises? Can we encourage the trade unions to share the risks and rewards of industry?  Can we devise a taxation system which will care for the people in our society without at the same time putting a damper on dampening enterprise?</P>
    <P>The political parties have the responsibility of making policy and we have to get the people to adopt a philosophy based on widening the productive base, looking after the disadvantaged and encouraging our young people to participate in the widening of this productive base quickly.  The first thing we must do is to get the people to adopt a basic economic Irish philosophy of that nature.</P>
    <P>From that policy I would see coming forward, sooner I hope rather than later, an economic and social plan.  Some time ago we had a Government investment plan before this House in which we hoped to spend £1,700 million in the productive sector.  I do not know what this Government's view of that plan is, or whether they intend to resurrect all or part of it, but one thing I am sure of is that this country desperately needs an investment plan within the confines of an economic philosophy with which we can all agree. We waste a lot of time and energy fighting the various conflicts in society.  What we need in the eighties is a clear objective on which we can all agree.  Then we can get down to work.</P>
    <P>In the sixties we had a clear objective. We wanted industrialisation, we needed housing and we were dashing for growth. We knew exactly what we had to do, how to do it, and we did it.  The amount of conflict in society was not very great.  In the eighties we have high inflation, slow growth and various conflicts of interest from pressure groups which all blur the economic and social objectives.  The first thing we have to do is to sort out the scandal of the huge numbers of our young people who are unemployed.  They are not given any hope for the future by this Government.  In a reply to a Parliamentary Question the other day the Minister <Col N="346" /> said an economic plan would be available for discussion some time in the spring.  I look forward to that.  At that time perhaps we will be able to discuss the objectives of this country and how, together, we will solve some of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not mind a political debate, attacking the Government or blaming politicians for not doing this or that.  That is all a useful and necessary part of politics but at the end of the day if, as politicians, we do not sort out the direction of our economy, the people will be quite right in saying &ldquo;a plague on all your houses. You have not lived up to your responsibilities to provide work for the young people&rdquo;.  As politicians that is our role in the immediate future.  I am looking for an investment plan which will tell us in clear terms how we can employ our young people and where the money will come from.</P>
    <P>I welcome this half-hearted effort to do this because it is better than nothing, but it is not tackling the root of the problem in a serious and determined way.  I will be looking for an investment plan from this Government at an early date.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate Deputy Brennan for his constructive speech.  This morning our Youth Employment Agency was dismissed as an exercise in public relations.  Such cynicism does not give our young people much hope for the future.  I am glad Deputy Brennan thinks we are sincere in our efforts to find a solution to our unemployment problem.  I am happy to witness the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency.  This is a concrete step forward and there is money to provide young people with some hope for their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question last week the Taoiseach told me there were 30,000 registered young people without jobs.  He admits that all young people do not register as unemployed.  I believe the true figure to be in the region of 45,000.  There are many reasons why <Col N="347" /> young people do not register for unemployment benefit, and one is the means test.  Young people do not think it worth their while to sign up for £2 or £3 a week. This is a problem our young people face.</P>
    <P>As I said, 45,000 young people are unemployed and the Coalition have a responsibility to do something about this situation quickly.  That is why we hope this Bill will pass through the Dáil without any undue delay.  We must prepare our young people for the future.  Deputy Brennan spoke about the needs of the young people and said they should be enterprising.  It is not easy for people who spend every day in bed to be enterprising. If we want to be enterprising we must provide them with meaningful activity. We believe the solution is the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>If there had been adequate planning in the past there would be no need for such an agency because all our young people could be employed, but because there was very inadequate planning in the past we have a crisis situation so far as our young unemployed are concerned.  We must take corrective steps because, if we do not the social implications will be worse in the long term.  A lot of those young unemployed have become very cynical, bitter and bold because after they fill up many application forms they do not get a job.  A new phenomenon is that a lot of the jobs that are advertised are not available.  This should not be encouraged. It is the duty of any employer who advertises a post to give every person who applies a fair crack of the whip.  All applicants should be interviewed and the successful ones picked on merit.  That does not seem to be the case any longer.</P>
    <P>Young people have become very frustrated with society and it is true to say that politicians have failed them.  We were all aware of the expanding population and that we had the fastest growing population in Western Europe.  We were also aware that half of our population was under 25 but we failed to cater for them.  I do not think politicians can disagree with the young people who claim that they have failed them.  We last spoke about youth unemployment here in February <Col N="348" /> when a Labour Party motion was discussed.  That motion stated:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, seriously concerned about the increasing number of young persons who will be seeking work in mid-1981, calls on the Government to review urgently and introduce adequate job creation schemes for youth employment.</P>
    <P>That motion was backed by the Fine Gael Party but the Fianna Fáil Government had a different view of the situation and decided to table the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;approves of the policies of the Government for stimulating the creation of employment for young persons and is confident that the Government will keep the operation of these policies under constructive review&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We all know what is meant when a Government state that they will keep something under continuous review.  They mean that they will not do anything. When we put it to the then Minister for Labour, Deputy Nolan, that more money should be made available for youth employment schemes and that a youth employment agency should be established he dismissed the problem of youth unemployment as part of the overall unemployment problem.  Youth unemployment is so rampant, large scale and unique that it requires a unique solution and that solution lies in the proposed youth employment agency.  The only other reason that Deputy Nolan could give for ignoring the problem of youth unemployment was that there was a baby boom in the country.  We are all aware of that but to sit back and not to do anything about youth unemployment was not helpful for the 50,000 people under 25 who had completed 14 years in a narrowly based educational system.  When they left school they found that jobs were not available.  In our educational system there is a lack of vocational training and experience as to what the world of work entails.  The proposed youth employment agency will give young people a chance to come to terms with the world of work and vocational training.  As a result of <Col N="349" /> our academically based system which is at present under review a lot of young people leave the system not knowing what to do or where to go.</P>
    <P>Only 17 per cent of those leaving school will enter higher education institutions. That represents a considerable investment in our future but we have a responsibility to cater for the other 83 per cent who do not go to third level institutions. This year, as last year, a lot of young people have come to me seeking the traditional type of employment. Invariably, young people leave school with the idea of being a nurse, a guard, a teacher or a bank clerk.  Recently one bank had 6,000 applications for 60 posts. There were more than 6,000 applications for 300 posts in the Garda Síochána and in the case of nursing one gets about 100 people looking for about ten posts.  There are no future prospects there and it is not surprising that our young people become very disillusioned.  Some of the obstacles to youth employment lie in the lack of proper career guidance.  There has not been great emphasis on career guidance or on how the needs of pupils can match the needs of the working world.  It is pleasing to note that more emphasis is being placed on career guidance and counselling but it is still insufficient in this rapidly changing world.</P>
    <P>We are not under any illusions about the youth unemployment problem.  It exists throughout Europe and various solutions have been put forward such as early retirement or a four-day week. Those suggestions must be looked at because with the micro-chip on the horizon we will have to divide the work available amongst all people.  I am proud to be able to say that.  I do not think any section of the community should have a monopoly as far as work is concerned. The right to work is a basic need and we should be in a position to provide such employment for our people.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election the National Youth Council of Ireland circularised all parties expressing concern about the growing problem of youth unemployment and urging all parties to do something about it.  The council, which is the umbrella organisation for all youth bodies, <Col N="350" /> came up with their solutions.  On unemployment they suggested:</P>
    <P>All current indications are that within the total unemployment crisis, youth unemployment is the greatest single section requiring remedy.  It is on this basis that while recognising that the solution to youth unemployment ultimately rests within an overall economic approach, special measures are required to remedy its worst effects on vulnerable school leavers and the young population in general.</P>
    <P>We knew they were talking about a severe crisis among our young people and that is why we committed ourselves to setting up a youth employment agency. The key demand of the council was:</P>
    <P>The immediate establishment of a youth employment agency with an initial operating budget of £30 million, representative of the youth organisations, the employers, trade union movement and the Government....</P>
    <P>We have more than responded to the needs of young people.  They asked for £30 million which they regarded as considerable.</P>

      <P>Priorities for Youth (No. 2); Investment for Youth.  We doubled the amount they sought in making finance available to combat the problem of youth unemployment.  I am glad to note that prior to this they welcomed this Bill as being necessary and of vital importance to their future.  The Youth Employment Agency will have the job of co-ordinating all the youth schemes at present in existence and of furthering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the National Manpower Service do a good job in their own right as do AnCO.  Equally we all know that the youth schemes at present run by the Departments of the Environment and Education are very effective but I have always felt that lack of co-ordination led to a waste of talent, money and of good resources.  Therefore one of the aims of <Col N="351" /> the Youth Employment Agency will be the co-ordination of all the youth employment schemes, a very important facet of this Bill.  Of course the Youth Employment Agency will be funded by a one per cent levy on those who can afford to pay it.  The one per cent levy will not be taken from the weaker sections of the community, such as those on social welfare benefits. I can honestly say that I have heard no complaints so far about a one per cent levy being deducted from anybody's wages.  This demonstrates the generous heart of the Irish nation, a heart that is very much alive.  People are prepared to give one per cent of their income to people who have no jobs and who cannot give anything because they have nothing to give.  Were we to say that we would set up a Youth Employment Agency without saying how we would pay for it people in general would be right to accuse us of insincerity.  But we are sincere and we are honestly telling people how we intend to provide the 20,000 jobs so badly needed for young people of a vulnerable age. Many of them find themselves in a catch 22 situation &mdash; they cannot get a job because they cannot gain experience and cannot gain experience because they cannot get a job.  We hope to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>The board of the Youth Employment Agency will be comprised of two representatives of the ITGWU, two representatives of employers, two representatives of youth interests, one each from the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education and three to be appointed by the Minister.  Therefore this board will consist of a variety of people who should represent young people's interests to the full and I have no doubt but that they will do so.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill and one which will be much welcomed by young people. There is just one suggestion I would make to the Minister, which is this, that there are no proper statistics available of our young unemployed.  Therefore it is difficult to ascertain the real extent of the problem.  I would hope that the Youth Employment Agency would devise a method by which they could ascertain <Col N="352" /> exactly how many young people are unemployed and, if there are severely disadvantaged areas around the country in which a particular problem is being experienced, that they would highlight these facts.  Otherwise these facts cannot be ascertained except through parliamentary question.  I believe this type of information should be available to the public.</P>
    <P>To dismiss this Bill as not constituting a genuine commitment to our young unemployed people is to be very cynical. I am sure that the 20,000 young people who will benefit from the provisions of the Bill and from the fund to be established next year will have some hope with this genuine commitment and, thus, some hope for their future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by saying that I come neither to bury the Bill nor to praise it.  At this stage what we must do is keep a somewhat open mind on the question as to what exactly this agency will do and how effective it will be.  I shall revert to those points in a few minutes.  By way of beginning, the first obvious question to be posed is: is there a need to do something on the employment front via State action and then go on to ask: is this agency the most effective way of doing it?  As for that first question &mdash; is there a need to do something &mdash; I am sure there is fairly widespread agreement in this House that there is indeed a need for action on the employment front but I wonder whether there is the same measure of agreement as to the form that action should take. We, on this side of the House, have pursued employment creation as a major objective of policy over a number of years.  There has not been the same unanimity on the other side as to the types of policies which should be followed. Perhaps that explains the lack of any clear direction as to what exactly this new agency will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go back to the various proposals put before the electorate in June last we find that the Fine Gael Party &mdash; in the section of their proposals dealing with employment &mdash; listed 11 steps they proposed to take, the bulk of which were in the form of reductions of taxation on <Col N="353" /> various industries and so on.  They rounded off those sets of proposals by saying that the 11 aforementioned proposals would create productive employment instead of temporary make-work jobs because they were targeted towards sectors which could sustain development. However, it was the Labour Party who brought forward proposals that spoke specifically of dealing with the employment problem especially in the youth area.  It was they who spoke about the danger of total unemployment approaching 200,000 in the relatively short period unless some emergency measures were adopted.  And it was the Labour Party who went on to put forward what they described as a guarantee to young people, a guarantee that young people without employment for a period of more than three months would be provided access to a training programme, a work experience programme or some other form of State-initiated employment for a period of up to three years.</P>
    <P>I would suggest therefore that there was quite a sharp difference in the approach of the two parties who now occupy the Government benches.  Indeed we have heard further echoes of the Fine Gael approach in statements made by members of the Government.  For instance, we can recall within the last couple of weeks the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly, being quite critical of further employment within the public service.  I think he used phrases like &mdash; people pushing pieces of paper backwards and forward to one another and so on.  Therefore, quite clearly we can see that there would be quite a reluctance on the part of at least some senior people in Fine Gael to engage in what they themselves described in their manifesto as make-work jobs.</P>
    <P>On the other hand it is the Labour Party who see some substantial role for direct State employment creation programmes. It is interesting that in the Minister's introductory remarks this morning he talked about the size of the overall employment programme.  If I recall correctly, he said that the major initiative the Government would take to tackle this so-called programme is the setting up of <Col N="354" /> a National Development Corporation, a vehicle for greater State involvement in the field of employment creation.</P>
    <P>Therefore those divergent views were there before the election and are still, quite clearly, there six months afterwards. I would suggest that they might help us to understand why there is such a noticeable lack of specific information, specific proposals, as to the manner in which this new agency will operate. Indeed, I suspect that one of the few things which they were able to reach agreement on was the title of the new body, &ldquo;Youth Employment Agency&rdquo;.  Of course, Deputy Myra Barry has helped us to recall the reason they were able to agree on that title because she very helpfully quoted from the proposals which the National Youth Council had circulated shortly before that election in which they had asked the parties to set up a youth employment agency.  In addition to the Labour Party with their quite specific proposals for a guarantee of youth employment, there were Fine Gael's proposals on employment which appeared quite early on in their document and then, about 40 pages later, they have a section dealing specifically with youth and they talked about consultation and dealings with various bodies, an informal Oireachtas youth committee and so on. There are plenty of talking shops but when they get to employment they say they will establish a youth employment agency which will provide for &ldquo;the integrated development of the concept of youth employment schemes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That might well be a positive step forward. I do not know.  I like to see myself as a reasonable person open to reasoned argument, but when I read that sentence I could see in it, if I may use a term that has been flung around so far today, nothing more than a cynical attempt to appear to meet the demands, the wishes of the National Youth Council.  In other words, they were going to have the name, they were going to have a youth employment agency and go through the institutional procedures.  But what will they actually do?  This is supposed to provide an integrated development of a concept.  It is not actually doing anything, and it is not <Col N="355" /> quite clear what concept is envisaged. From that point of view I was somewhat disappointed when the Minister, having reminded us, given us some echoes, of the Labour Party's approach to this question of employment creation by referring to a National Development Corporation and so on, nevertheless when it came to this agency, seemed to consider that the most immediate and most important task it would undertake was the co-ordination of various existing programmes and activities.  That is certainly the activity which, on a quick reading of the speech, appeared to be given the greatest emphasis.</P>
    <P>That is the basis of my opening remark. I find myself in a position in which I am not able to give the Bill a totally enthusiastic welcome because I do not see any evidence of substantial activity for this new body as yet.  Neither, of course, do I wish to condemn it because it may well be that a new body such as the proposed agency may find itself carrying out some valuable work in this field. Certainly I share the wish that we could have a substantial impact on the unemployment programme and therefore would not wish to hinder any programme brought in by the Government which would help to bring about that result. That is why I must adopt this somewhat neutral stance in my references to the proposed agency.</P>
    <P>As to the basic problem itself, I would say that there is a need to do something substantial to provide additional employment opportunities and a major part of any additional employment should be directed towards young people.  This is important not just on economic grounds and not just on the relatively narrow social grounds of the immediate hardship or lack of enthusiasm and so on which would arise within the young people themselves and within there immediate families.  If youth unemployment is allowed to grow on the scale which we have recently suffered then we will have to think seriously about the whole future of society as we know it.  I just cannot bring myself to believe that any young generation worth its salt would tolerate <Col N="356" /> for any great length of time a colossal level of unemployment and a colossal lack of opportunity in their own country.</P>
    <P>This constitutes the greatest challenge to us as political leaders for the decade ahead.  I fear that at times we spend too much of our thought and too much of our energies in rehashing and going over old battles, old differences, old issues which are no longer really relevant or important in the Ireland of today.  If we are to live up to our responsibilities to give political leadership to the people, then we have to look ahead and ask what sort of country will we have, what sort of circumstances are we creating or allowing to arise, if we are simply going to accept growing levels of unemployment, especially growing levels of youth unemployment, as inevitable. I fear that that is part of the argument which we hear from some people. They say that the world does not owe us a living &mdash; that is true &mdash; that we are a small nation which must trade in order to win for itself whatever standard of living is possible and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will be able to provide enough productive jobs in industry or agriculture.  So many people, those who would follow the make-work attitude enunciated in the Fine Gael document, would say that, while a lot of unemployment arises, this is regrettable but inevitable and unfortunate, that there is no way we can get around it and that any attempts to tamper with it on the part of the Government will ultimately make the issue worse because they will have to impose heavy taxation burdens to finance these make-work projects.  Of course we know that that is a doctrine that is enunciated not only by Fine Gael, or a substantial section of Fine Gael, but has also been put into practice in a neighbouring country in recent years, and we are able to see the consequences of it.</P>
    <P>My own view &mdash; and it is one which has a wide measure of support in all parties and in all sections of the community &mdash; is that it is possible to do something sensible, to do something constructive to create more employment opportunities.  But to do this we must be prepared to break away from some of our older practices, some of our older arrangements.  That <Col N="357" /> calls for rethinking and reorganising not just the institutions over which the State has direct control, such as Government Departments and agencies, not just setting up new agencies such as the body proposed in this Bill, but it almost certainly calls for changes in attitudes and work practices in industries.  It therefore calls for changes in the policies pursued by the trade union movement.  There are many ramifications to any worthwhile, comprehensive, sustained attack on the employment programme.  If we are to set about that task effectively it must be done in the context of some adequately spelled out set of policies for at least a number of years ahead.  That is why it is essential in our conditions that we have the Government's five year plan brought before the House as quickly as possible so that we can see more closely the nature of the whole set of policies which they would pursue.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate on another occasion to develop more fully some of these points.  I mention them in the context of this Bill because, as I have tried to make clear, there is a very important issue at stake here which may ultimately involve the whole future of the nation.  It is important therefore that we try to resolve the differences of view which inevitably exist in a democracy.  It is healthy that they should exist.  However, we should try to understand the nature of these different opinions and arrive at some agreement as to which policies will actually be pursued, and pursued effectively, until the problem is resolved.  It is against that background that we must turn to this Bill and ask what contribution will this proposed agency make to resolving this unemployment problem, and especially unemployment among young people.</P>
    <P>I have already said that one can detect different approaches to this question in the respective programmes which the two parties which now form the Government put before the people at the time of the election.  We would have expected that when this Bill came before the House there would be a greater degree of information as to what had actually happened. The Bill itself tells us virtually nothing on <Col N="358" /> that score.  It takes us through the necessary steps of setting up a company which can undertake various activities, the arrangements for financing that company and the usual arrangements for dealing with any offenders who fail to comply with the various requirements. As to the actual activities of the agency, virtually nothing is said.  There is a quite comprehensive list of the functions which the proposed agency will have conferred on them by their articles of association. We are told that they will establish, develop, extend, operate, assist, encourage, supervise, co-ordinate and integrate, either directly or indirectly, schemes for the training and employment of young persons.  That is quite a comprehensive list of the various ways in which one might set about doing something to help young people.</P>
    <P>When we ask, however, which of these things will be done by way of the agency's opening activities, or whether they have any initial agenda, some opening projects which they want to undertake, or some idea when they might commence any of these various functions, virtually no indications are given to us.  All we have before us is a proposal for the enabling legislation &mdash; something which would provide the legal framework within which the agency can then operate.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Minister's opening speech had references which were even somewhat more discouraging in the sense that, apart from being fairly confident that one of the tasks which the agency could undertake would be this co-ordination of what everybody else is already doing, when it came to any new activities, there was the suggestion that it would be the agency, when we appoint these 11 directors and so forth, which are expected to bring forward some new proposals for programmes which they, themselves, might undertake.</P>
    <P>Six months after the publication of this Labour Party programme and, indeed, of the Fine Gael programme &mdash; although I would not expect anything from the Fine Gael one because of the nature of their election programme &mdash; I would have expected some development of the Labour Party programme, especially <Col N="359" /> since a Member of that party is the Minister responsible.  Six months later we have not a single new idea, proposal or example of the way in which this body will set about providing the proposed target of 20,000 new job opportunities of one kind or another for these young people.  That is a very disappointing aspect of the present position.  I would like to feel, before the House concludes this debate on the Bill and gives its final blessing to the creation of the agency, that we would be at least encouraged in our support of it by having some firmer basis for that encouragement and that we would be given some examples or indications of the particular activities which might help to achieve this target of 20,000 new job placements.</P>
    <P>As of now, one must, at best &mdash; if one wishes to be generous &mdash; keep a relatively open mind on this subject, no more than that.  As one reads through the co-ordinating activities basically what emerges is a promise of more of the same.  Whatever is being done now will, presumably, be done on a somewhat larger scale.  If that is so, let us be told that that is so.  If not, and if there is some new development, some new forms of youth employment schemes to come forward, I am sure that this side of the House would be only too happy to welcome them.</P>
    <P>Having asked what the functions of this agency are and coming to the conclusion that we must, at best, keep an open mind on them, if we look at one or two inevitable consequences of setting up the agency, we face one or two further questions. The next necessary aspect of the agency set out in the Bill before us is the method of its financing.  As other speakers have already made clear, this proposal to raise the necessary funds by a 1 per cent levy on virtually all incomes of those at work is not exactly the most equitable form of revenue raising.  Having said that, I want to make clear that I do not necessarily reject that form of levy collection.  If one wants to raise substantial sums of money and be able to relate those to some objective&mdash;to have a form of earmarked tax&mdash;it is probably necessary to have a rather crude and, therefore, <Col N="360" /> inequitable tax, provided of course that one recognises these inequities and deals with them through consequential changes in other parts of the taxation system.  I am not necessarily opposed to a rather crude levy of this type.</P>
    <P>I might be so modest as to draw the attention of the House to the fact that some three years ago, when putting forward proposals for a possible programme to achieve full employment over a period of five to seven years, inevitably the question arose as to how one would set about financing these.  In that report the point was made that it should be related rather heavily to a financing effort by those already at work.  It is not unreasonable to say to the fortunate 90 per cent or thereabouts who have jobs that they are fortunate but that, if they are concerned for the future not just for themselves but perhaps for members of their families, or their own children, their friends and neighbours, they should think in terms of sacrificing some of their own income increases and contributing them to a special fund for employment creation.  At that time I suggested that the way in which it might be done was by beginning with a 1 per cent levy in the first year of the programme and building it up over subsequent years.  The best estimate one could then produce was that a total levy of about 5 per cent of income would be needed to finance a job creation programme. The figures would be somewhat different today because of the higher levels of unemployment by comparison with three years ago but the logic of that approach might still be valid.</P>
    <P>If efforts to build support for special schemes of this type are to be successful the agreement of the trade unions and of other interested bodies must be secured. Since the trade union movement represents the bulk of employed people, their agreement is essential.  For that reason there were references to financial arrangements of this type in the discussions leading to the national understanding and it was suggested that part of the justification for a form of income levy or income restraint was the achievement of the very desirable social objective of employment opportunities for all.  It is <Col N="361" /> right to record in this House that the trade union movement and their leadership have always expressed support for developments of that nature.  Their view is that they would be opposed to any arbitrary impositions, levies or direct and indirect taxes if they did not see some worth-while social consequences arising from the spending of that money.</P>
    <P>There is possibly a valid case for having what is admittedly a rather crude form of tax as a means of financing an employment creation programme, provided the results can be set alongside that financing in order to justify the burden.  In these circumstances I would hazard the guess that there would be the necessary degree of public support.  If, on the other hand, we found that there had been an additional tax burden imposed which had not been used to achieve any substantial additional employment creation but simply as a rather roundabout device to refinance existing activities, then there would be justifiable resentment, howls of anger and ultimate rejection both from this side of the House and from the citizens and voters as a whole.</P>
    <P>Financing arrangements for this agency are not the happiest because the crude 1 per cent levy clearly does not allow for differences in circumstances of those at work and there may be the need for appropriate adjustments in other areas of the tax code.  This is a matter which I trust the Minister will work out with his colleagues at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the financing side of this agency, we must ask how the money will be spent.  The Minister said that the 1 per cent levy would yield over £60 million in a full year and also referred to the possibility of reasonable support from the European Social Fund.  I am not sure exactly what figure would be appropriate there but if one applies the sort of grant percentages normally entailed we could add another £30 million.  We are probably talking of total resources of £90 million being disbursed by this agency in the course of a full year.  I am rather puzzled as to why only £10 million will be collected between April and December of <Col N="362" /> next year.  That would be two-thirds of a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I corrected that figure which was due to a typing error.  It should have been £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House when the Minister spoke but that sets my mind at ease.  I thank the Minister for clarifying the point.  The sum of £90 million is very hefty and must be seen in the context of the spending entailed in other programmes.  AnCO will spend this year about £40 million and programmes operating through the Departments of Education and the Environment, together with payments under the work experience programme, will cost between £50 million and £60 million this year.  That is the total spending of the various agencies associated with employment or training opportunities for 20,000 people this year.  It seems that the additional £90 million will not finance an additional 20,000 jobs and the bulk of it will be used to finance existing activities and to ease some of the Government's other financial headaches, many of which they have brought upon themselves.  That is a reasonable inference and if I am wrong I would be happy to stand corrected. I would welcome the Minister's comments on this point.</P>
      <P>I think I have said enough to illustrate why at this stage it is not possible to give an unqualified welcome to this agency. There are questions as to what exactly the agency will do by way of new initiatives in the job creation field.  There are questions about how exactly this fresh money will be employed, how much will go for these new projects and how much will be syphoned off to pay the bills for existing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had been given more information we might be better placed to be more enthusiastic in our responses to the proposed agency.  It is not unreasonable to conclude at this stage that given the passage of six months since the proposal was first put forward we would have got more concrete proposals by now, especially since it was Deputies opposite <Col N="363" /> who were stressing the urgency as well as the scale of this programme.  We agree there is urgency but why have we not yet had some definite action rather than have us talking in November about a legal framework to enable this body to set about making a positive contribution towards solving each of the very real and potentially dangerous problems of the nation.</P>
    <P>I do not question the good intentions of the Government and particularly of the Minister whom I wish well in his efforts to launch this and similar initiatives in this field of employment creation, but I must say that good intentions alone are not sufficient.  We need positive action.  Though institutional changes may be necessary as part of the process of taking effective action, institutions by themselves do not solve anything.  It is people who solve problems and we want to see the people who will do this work getting started and beginning to demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this Bill only serves to provide a debate to highlight the seriousness of youth employment it will serve a great purpose.  I am glad the opportunity has been given to the House to comment on the seriousness of the problem.  I will preface my remarks by referring to the many debates here in the forties on the provision of employment for young people.  In the fifties I heard similar discussions and in the sixties I recall Deputy Seán Lemass in Clery's Ballroom dealing extensively with the problem of unemployment and producing a plan by which he would provide 100,000 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seventies arrived and we were still faced with serious unemployment, but we were given some hope in that decade when a number of people were let loose on the country advocating our entry into the EEC.  They told us that from the moment we would become members of that Community we would join economic experts in Europe for the purpose of providing full employment for all our peoples, with special reference to school <Col N="364" /> leavers and young people generally. Many of our people tore up the paving stones in their rush to hear the words of wisdom from the mouths of the experts, economists and others.</P>
    <P>I never have been a believer in words of wisdom from the lips of economists, and here I am reminded of the story of a US employer who put an advertisement in a newspaper for an economist with one hand, for whom he had a vacancy.  There was some concern about that advertisement to which there was not a good response.  The employer was asked why he wanted a one handed economist and he said: &ldquo;I have been advised by economists in my firm, and on all occasions when they gave me advice they said: &lsquo;On the one hand this will work, but on the other hand it may not&rsquo;.  What I want is an economist who will not be referring to the second hand.  I want first hand information but I cannot get an economist who does not refer to his second hand&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have yet to hear a European economist anywhere dealing fully and effectively with youth unemployment and giving a serious answer.  Today we and our European partners are faced with many millions of unemployed throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>To be effective, this legislation depends on some money from European funds to set up this agency.  The last Government did not do anything but this Government are at least thinking about the problem and looking at ways to deal with it.  I am afraid the problem of youth unemployment is getting speedily out of hand.  This gets worse with the growth in our population, and we see every year better educated and more young people leaving our schools, facing gloomier and dimmer prospects.</P>
    <P>That is why I am seriously worried about this big problem not alone for us but for Europe.  Of course we can let the Europeans look after their own affairs. We have the responsibility to look after ours.  The task of providing jobs for our young people must be undertaken with speed and efficiency.</P>
    <P>We are at the crossroads without any ray of light and without any signpost to indicate where we are going.  Our young <Col N="365" /> people have lost confidence in a democratic parliament.  That is the grave danger I see facing us.  We must think of the younger generation who have left school and those coming to the end of their years in school.  What must their state of mind be?  They had to study hard, sit examinations and meet keen competition and then they find that when one job is advertised there are at least 20 to 25 applicants.</P>
    <P>Our educational standards appear to be getting higher each year and, at the same time, jobs are becoming fewer and fewer and more difficult to obtain.  Our young people cannot stand the strain indefinitely of seeing no prospects for the future of a job with good wages and no hope of secure employment at home. During the forties, fifties, sixties and seventies vast numbers went to the United Kingdom and were employed there, but they cannot go now because of the serious unemployment position there.  Our young people must remain at home with very little prospect of getting employment in Ireland, a land which we were told when we entered the EEC would be flowing with milk and honey in which there would be food, work, clothing and shelter for all and emigration, unemployment and poverty for none.</P>
    <P>What disillusionment and depression there must be in the hearts and minds of our young people who, on leaving school, enter their names with the National Manpower Service and then have to join the tail end of the already long queues outside the various labour exchanges.  They are humiliated.  They must surrender their independence and depend on the charity of the State.  They are deprived of the right to work, the right to independence, the right to use their hands, hearts and minds.  They want to earn their living through their own hard work and industry, their own initiative and their own drive, but instead they have to put out their hands for a paltry sum extended in charity for nothing.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later in a very determined manner they will register their resentment in some form of action to indicate their belief that Irish politicians have failed Irish youth, and that no steps were taken to give them even a ray of hope for <Col N="366" /> the future that one day they will be able to marry, have their own homes and bring up their families in the full spirit of Christian decency.  How disturbing this must be for our young people.  There is an old saying that the devil finds work for idle hands to do.  That is why we have vandalism and illegal activities, the use of drugs and drug abuse, and alcoholism.</P>
    <P>It must be very difficult for young people who are full of energy and &ldquo;go&rdquo; to have to spend 12 hours standing on street corners, or sitting at a fire, or walking the streets.  This is demoralising and degrading to the human person.  One of the great concepts of human rights is the right to work.  We must emphasise the God given right to work.  There is an endless amount of work to be done in this country.  All that is needed is the political will to provide that work and pay the wages.  In most democracies our whole concept of economics appears to have broken down.</P>
    <P>The problem of youth employment should have top priority in this national Parliament.  We have many economic problems today, including the great problem of agricultural revival but the problem of providing jobs calls for major action.  If they cannot be provided within the system, elected representatives have a responsibility to go outside the system to provide work for our young boys and girls who are in need of it.  The agency the Minister is setting up will only scratch the surface and, sooner or later, we hope to hear what plans the Government have to tackle comprehensively the serious problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>While tackling the problem of youth unemployment we must not close our eyes to the problem of adult unemployment which also has grave social consequences for younger people.  The mental decay which has already set in on unemployed adults is being passed on by word, example and deed to unemployed youth. The big problem which faces the Government is to break the back of unemployment. Economic experts said this morning that by the end of 1982 the numbers of unemployed will be vastly increased. There appears to be endless money available for preparations for war.  Even in the <Col N="367" /> United States, where there is a grave unemployment problem, money is readily available to provide nuclear weapons, arms for the destruction of mankind and the destruction of God's gifts to man.  But there does not seem to be money available to provide employment for adults or youth.  If a world war broke out in the morning there would be plenty of money available for weapons of war and the destruction of mankind, but in peace time there appears to be no assistance to deal with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We are heading for economic and social decay.  The whole quality of life changes with the arrival of dole forms and standing in dole queues.  There is nothing more degrading, especially for well-educated youth, than seeking work in vain, with no prospects for the future. The Government and trade unions should examine the problem in relation to early retirements in order that some vacancies may be made available for young people.  We should have a policy for those who retire early because we never seem to plan for leisure.  The retired person should be helped to plan the rest of his life.  People are living longer now than half a century ago and that is all the more reason for planning for retirement.  There should be a separate programme for those who retire early so that the benefit of their experience and wisdom as workers can be put to good use during their retirement. As soon as people retire they enter a new stage in their lives.  Unfortunately, many of them are unable to manage on their allowances, pensions, gratuities, superannuation or whatever they have to live on when they retire.  In many cases on retirement they have to seek some form of employment which means that it is of little advantage to youth.  There should be planning on a large scale in regard to how and by what means retired people are going to fulfil their lives as able-bodied citizens, because many who retire at 60 are as efficienct at their work as they were at 25 or 30.  Many of our population are living to the age of 80. What plans are we making for those between 60 and 80 to live their lives in a <Col N="368" /> productive manner and make a contribution to the economy so that those valuable years will not be lost entirely? These are problems which have to be dealt with in relation to the whole question of the provision of jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows we have one of the saddest records of mental handicap.  Our mental hospitals are full.  If we contact the various health boards we see clearly that there is a large number of young people who are either voluntary patients or have been referred by their GPs for some form of mental treatment.  In many cases the cause of mental disorder in young people is that they are unemployed and unable to cope with pressures and the grave consequences of lack of a future.  At this stage they take to the roads, protest and become agitators. They lose confidence in themselves and in the democratic parliament.  They view politicians with suspicion because they feel we are not delivering the goods.</P>
    <P>All Governments have failed miserably to provide jobs for our young people. We see the serious economic position that exists in the Six Counties where some people of 50 years of age and over never had any form of productive employment in their lives.  Time is running out for us because a well educated youth of today will not take what the semi-educated youth of 30 years ago took.  Work is a human right.  If we are concerned about maintaining human rights the best guarantee we can give our young people is the right to work.  I hope any steps taken by the Minister will be in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that during 1981 it was expected that 5,000 young people would take part in the National Manpower Service's work experience programme, 10,000 young people would be trained in AnCO's general training programmes, with a further 2,000 apprentices, 1,700 young people would participate in AnCO's community training programme and a further 1,000 people would be engaged in schemes run by the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment.  These are all right as temporary, emergency, stop-gap projects, but when these training <Col N="369" /> schemes are completed, will permanent jobs be available?  There is little use training young people if there are no jobs where they can use their skills.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, youth employment has become a very serious problem.  The IDA have created a number of jobs but whether they balance the jobs lost is questionable.  Is there an ultimate goal at the end of these training schemes?  Where are these young people going?  Will they have permanent jobs when they are trained?  Can they be confident that they will be provided with full-time secure employment, with decent working conditions and proper wages?</P>
    <P>The aim of most of our youth is to set up their own homes.  In Ireland the family is the fundamental unit of society and we must help in the foundation of that family by providing a secure job for the head of the family.</P>
    <P>I do not know what projects the Minister has in mind or what type of work will be undertaken by the agency but am I correct in saying that the agency will provide constant employment, paying not less than the trade union rate prevailing in the area?  I hope early and effective action will be taken to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the financing of the scheme, with special reference to the levy and the European Social Fund.  I am not happy &mdash; and I have never been happy &mdash; about levies, whether they were agricultural levies or levies on the ratepayers or taxpayers.  Whenever levies are mentioned I am gravely suspicious.  I would have given little thanks to the European Community for providing all the funds necessary for the effective working of the agency proposed in the Bill.  It is right to express a measure of thanks and a nod of affection to the Community but the European Social Fund will only scratch the surface again in relation to this problem. When workers and farmers not included by health boards are asked to pay the levy I am disturbed.  It disturbs me to think that those in employment will have to contribute to the operation of this agency.  If any other way was found for dealing with this problem other than <Col N="370" /> by way of a levy on a section of the community it would be more welcome.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that those in responsible positions, particularly those who can be heard in Brussels, have made a sufficiently strong case for the weakest and most impoverished country in the EEC for help to establish the agency in order to provide employment for our young people.  Are we a part of Europe or are we the poorer relation of France and Germany, the richer European countries, who want to give us the deaf ear and the blind eye or is the real spirit of economic revival and assistance all gone? Is that all in the past?  Is that all dead? No other member state has the same case as Ireland for financial assistance because they do not have as many worth-while employment projects as we have.  How many additional jobs can be provided if we work towards giving an efficient transport service?  How many jobs could be provided if it was decided to manufacture all the requirements of CIE here?  Jobs were lost in the past because it was decided to pull up railway tracks and dismantle railway stations while other European countries were putting down rail tracks and building railway stations to take the heavy volume of traffic off their roads.  We tore up our railways, caused unemployment and put our heavy traffic on the roads even though we did not have the roads suitable to take a small number of the juggernauts that now mow people down.  We should have a transport service that will employ thousands in the movement of all heavy goods by rail.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to change their attitude completely in relation to economic planning because we cannot afford to embark on the policies of Mrs. Thatcher.  Her policies will not work here.  They may in the UK but because of the nature of our youth employment problem we must adopt a different attitude. Restricted measures in regard to transport, building, agriculture, the marketing of our agricultural produce, the building of houses and maisonettes for our people, old and young, are not acceptable when there is a great need to provide full-time and useful employment. We must give our young people <Col N="371" /> hope and encouragement and an adequate wage.  Our building industry is capable of employing thousands more.  It is capable of taking on young painters, carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers and stonemasons.  What about the revival of our arts and crafts?  There is no care, no thought, no attention and yet many of our young people could be effectively employed in that industry.</P>
    <P>In our towns and cities additional staff could be taken on in shops and business premises if the demand was greater but our economy is slowing down at such a rate that all sections of the community are suffering.  It all reverts to the purpose of the Bill, the provision of employment for our young people.  We should not give them useless jobs; we should give them worth-while employment; we should train our young people for jobs for the future. In relation to peat and fuel development, the full development of our coal deposits and mineral resources, a vast number of jobs can be made available.  However, we are scratching the surface in relation to the European Social Fund for a few paltry pounds.  We are like Lazarus waiting with our mouths open for the crumbs to fall from the tables of the rich men.  We are allowing the main artery of our nation to go freely into depression, gloom and decay.</P>
    <P>What has been done about preventing the decay of the great skill of mining? How many apprentice miners have we? In the coal mining district of my constituency there has been a great tradition of mining.  Old miners always spoke with courage of the water filling in various mines and of the skill of propping up the mines and keeping the trolleys filled with anthracite and coal on their way to the top of the shaft.  Young people heard old folk discuss in their homes the skills associated with mining.  We have, in our Leinster coalfields, some of the best coal and anthracite to be found anywhere in the world.  What is the European Regional Fund, Social Fund or any other fund doing about giving us money to get the miners working, to train young miners and get the coal and anthracite out of our mines?  We may talk about all of this <Col N="372" /> until it is too late because there is little time left in which to do something about it.  I sincerely contend that time is running out quickly for democratically-elected parliaments.  We, Members of Parliament, democratically elected, must pinch ourselves into a sense of realisation that in the minds of young people in this country and in Europe we are becoming ineffective.</P>
    <P>For that reason let us hope that the Youth Employment Agency about to be established by the Minister, even though it will only scratch the surface, will do something to provide our young people with the thousands of jobs the Minister has in mind.  I hope it will not meet the same fate as did the 100,000 jobs prophesied in Clery's ballroom by the late Seán Lemass.  The problem confronting this Government is the immediate creation of jobs.  They have that responsibility. They will be looked to for advice, guidance and leadership in this respect. I wish this agency success and good luck. I am not happy about the method of financing the agency.  Nevertheless it is worthy of trial.  It is better than nothing, which is what we have at present in regard to the problem of youth employment.</P>
    <P>If this agency are not successful after a very short time, then let us examine the problem again.  I fear we must take more serious and drastic measures in order to provide the necessary employment for our young people here at home.  Our nation depends on our young people.  I am the sole surviving member of the Dáil of 1943.  Are we going to leave parliament with no goodwill but young people doomed to life on the dole queues?  Or will we take courage in both hands and have confidence in the fact that Ireland is a young, developing country?  Think of the amount of work that could be given on afforestation in the valleys and mountains. Think of the additional young trainees who could be taken into our forestry training colleges.  One is reminded of the wonderful work undertaken in afforestation in the Mississippi valley.  Then one sees the waterlogged land around the Shannon valley where afforestation would change the whole face at that valley.  Yet nothing is done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> In areas such as housing, telephone development, the development of modern postal and telecommunications, there is in every Department room for the employment of some thousands of our young people; but we seem unwilling to avail of this.  Of course the Minister will contend, quite correctly, that they have not the money to do it.  I shall answer that by saying that money appears to be a licence to live, a licence to exist.  There are a few private individuals responsible for issuing these licences to live.  I am afraid that sooner or later a Government, with the will to provide all our people with employment, will have to look with a very jealous eye on those responsible for the creation of currency to implement national development schemes.  We cannot allow the present situation to continue in which, if we borrow money at 20 per cent to create employment, that must eventually be repaid.  I would expect some breakthrough in the provision of money for national development and of employment for all our people.  Everybody knows that every time one borrows from a bank it constitutes a means of creating currency.</P>
    <P>If, within the present system, this Government foresee that they cannot provide money for jobs for our youth and for the adult unemployed, they cannot allow the nation to fold up.  I am afraid we shall then have to consider seriously moving outside the system because we must survive as a nation.  And we cannot survive without our young people; they are the salt of the earth.  Whatever else may be said about our young people today, I contend that they are as good as if not better than any generation we have had.</P>
    <P>Instead of unfairly criticising our young people we should encourage them, because Ireland is theirs, not ours.  The present generation of young boys and girls have to stand up to the pressures of the modern, materialistic world.  We did not have the distractions of drink and drugs, the craze for gambling, violence and terrorism. The young people are well worth what the Minister is doing for them. There are great boys and girls in this country today.  One has only to go to any <Col N="374" /> of the community services centres to see this.  They are visiting the sick; they are in the Simon Community, the Samaritans and the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  They go to Macra na Feirme lectures and take part in the activities of Macra na Tuaithe. We have a fine generation of young people.  Let us help them and encourage them.  Let us give them good example and provide them with work and wages so that they will be able to take their place in their own homes with their own families as men and women of a proud nation, with full and secure employment in the full terms of Christian decency.</P>

      <P>It would be naive to imagine that any Government measure could solve a problem such as this overnight.  The creation of this new agency will not solve the problem of youth unemployment.  We might as well face up to that.  I will come later to what I think should be done in the whole area of unemployment.  But this Bill gives us an opportuntiy to look at the whole area of unemployment and I welcome any measure that tries to do something about this continuing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest problem facing this Government is the problem of unemployment. Full employment has been the goal of all political parties in this island, but it would seem that the trade unions, the employers, the politicians and all the political parties have abandoned this goal.  It is all very well to talk about full employment, but we do not seem to be getting anywhere near it.  At the moment there are 130,000 people unemployed.  If things go on as they are, there will be 145,000 people unemployed next April or May, according to the Tánaiste.  We have a history of high unemployment with the Irish average being far in excess of the EEC average.  In the thirties, forties, fifties and sixties the problem was solved by mass emigration.  Some of our finest people had to go abroad.  Despite that we still have the highest level of unemployment.  Since I became interested <Col N="375" /> in politics the unemployment figures have been the one thing that kept my mind on the job.  We all tend to blame someone else, but the people who are to blame are the elected people in Government. The majority of people have no say in the election of a president of a trade union or a president of an organisation. But they do have an opportunity every four or five years to elect the people they want in Government.</P>
    <P>If we are really serious about the goal of full employment there will have to be a change of heart on the part of the people and the State.  The Irish economy has come a long way in a short time.  Let us take 1960 as a benchmark.  People who were around in 1960 could not have dreamt of the progress that would be achieved by 1975.  I was a schoolgoer at the time and I can remember that there was high emigration in my area and very little employment.  People did not have a motor car; now people have two motor cars.  People did not have televisions. Farmers did not complain about paying income tax; they had no income on which to pay income tax.  People did not take to the streets and march in PAYE demonstrations because they were paying too high a level of tax; they did not have a job or if they had they were lucky.  But in a few short years all that has changed. People's expectations have now risen to such a level that they expect progress to continue without effort on their part.</P>
    <P>We, the politicians, the leaders of the people, have, perhaps, encouraged them in the belief that this prosperity is going to continue unabated.  We are the givers of good news and good things.  We are all at it.  I have done my political stunts in my day.  I may have &mdash; but not deliberately &mdash; given people the impression that I could do something for them that, in the event, I could not do.  The progress which we have seen since 1960 is almost unbelievable to the people who were around then.  Unless we get a grip on ourselves, Ireland as we know it and the institutions as we know them are not going to continue.  In 1960 people did not remain in education up to 20 or 21 years; they emigrated at 16 or 17 years.  Now we <Col N="376" /> have highly educated young people for whom emigration is not open and they expect and demand a living in their own country.</P>
    <P>By the nineties there may be 300,000 people unemployed, most of them between the ages of 18 and 30 who have gone, at least, through second level education and, in many instances, third level education.  Some may not have had a job for years.  Will they pat the backs of the politicians of the seventies and eighties who made decisions for all types of motives?  They will ask what good were these politicians for them and will not accept the rubbish which was handed out to them.  As I said many years ago, unless Irish society, and particularly our political leaders, take it upon themselves to redirect the goals of the Irish people, in a few short years the people will not tolerate this treatment and one will see a different institution or system altogether, because they will say that the present system has failed.  If I am still around, if and when that does happen, in whatever capacity, I will be able to say that I thought things should have been done a little differently.</P>
    <P>My general approach to the Bill is that I welcome it.  The Minister, the Government and all the Members of this House would like to do something to correct a situation which may become intolerable. If we continue to sectionalise Irish society by putting the farmers against the PAYE workers, playing off one against the other, we will get nowhere with this problem in the background.</P>
    <P>Ireland has special problems which no other country in the EEC has.  We must recognise those problems.  We cannot expect ever-improving standards of living unless we realise the constraints under which our system works.  Between 1973 and 1979 our population rose by 9.5 per cent, which is 6.75 times the EEC average. The Irish birth rate is the highest in Europe, at 20.7 births per 1,000 population. Between 1971 and 1979 was the first inter-census period here which saw nett immigration to the country rather than emigration out of it.</P>
    <P>Our age dependency ratio is also the highest in Europe.  Our young people <Col N="377" /> under 15 years of age constitute 31.3 per cent of our population.  The rest of Europe have only a 22 per cent level in that age group.  Combine our high birth rate with all the other factors mentioned and you will see that this problem will not go away overnight.  It will not go away because we set up this or that agency, but will continue.  To get to grips with this problem there must be a radical reappraisal of what we are about.  These figures are frightening.  They have frightened me for the last six years.  We can no longer export these people to somewhere else and say &ldquo;They are your problem now.  They must get jobs over with you&rdquo;. Present world economic conditions no longer allow for that.  We must provide for those people here.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the advent of free education, expectations are higher.  People are going to school for a longer period and expect a certain type of job.  In addition, in the past eight years there have been two depressions or recessions.  We are living in changed economic conditions due primarily to the price of fuel oil.  The whole problem of employment must be looked at on a global basis.  No capitalist will come to Ireland to create employment prospects here as against going somewhere else unless there are reasons why he should come.  In the past couple of years we seem to have forgotten that we are in the world trade for capital, and must try to get these people to come here. Ever-increasing numbers are coming on the unemployment register through technological changes.  A machine can do the job of five people, so five fewer people are employed eventually.  Different levels of skill will be needed for the new economic conditions but, generally, changing technology has meant more people being thrown out of work.  We must cope with that problem also.</P>
    <P>If we continue to introduce work practices and other aspects of industrial life which prevent people from coming here to finance new projects, that will accentuate our problem.  If excessive wage agreements make the cost of Irish goods uncompetitive compared with that of our competitors, there will be a loss of jobs. There is no point in saying that the trade <Col N="378" /> unions are committed to full employment if the trade unions look for excessive wage increases at the expense of jobs for other people.  This is a fact.  It is generally accepted that, in the last national wage agreement 7 per cent was what the Irish economy could stand, yet we settled for 16 per cent.  We must consider that in comparison with what happens in other European countries with whom we are competing and realise that our export markets will be lost and more people will lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to this wage agreement, the Government asked their three economists to put forward a reasonable figure and they suggested 6.5 per cent as the most the economy could afford.  It now looks as if the wage settlement will be twice that figure.  People here do not want strikes and put pressure on the Government to settle, even though the settlement increases the rate of inflation.  It must be recognised that excessive wage increases are at the cost of jobs of fellow workers and of people now coming on the market.  It would seem to be the norm that the settlement figure in national wage agreements is double the figure we can afford.  We all pay lip service to moderation until pressure is put upon us.  We all aspire to the goal of full employment but we are not prepared to accept lower wage levels.  Here in Leinster House we also look for increases.  There is much waffle about achieving full employment but we do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>For employment to increase in a free enterprise economy it is necessary to have a reasonable growth rate.  It has been the belief of economists that budget deficiting increases the growth rate and, therefore, employment.  Any theory stands only until the facts refute it.  It has been proved beyond all doubt that in an open economy budget deficit financing will not bring about increased growth rates or further employment.  It leads to an increase in the balance of payments problem and to many other problems. Instead of creating jobs at home, budget deficiting helps to create jobs in Japan and other countries because we use the extra money on the purchase of imported goods.  We must accept that the answer <Col N="379" /> to our problems does not lie in budget deficiting.  Such a measure does have some benefits and at some stage I believe everyone here was in favour of it.  However, it no longer works.</P>
    <P>Major improvements in employment have been achieved by the IDA and I compliment them on their work.  They have been helpful in setting up new industries but, as in the case of any organisation which has existed for a long time, people are inclined to leave them alone and say that they must be doing a good job and that their budget should be increased each year.  I believe we should examine their activities because many of our industrial policies are wasteful.  Our greatest resources are based on agriculture and the fact that we are surrounded by the sea and it is alarming that the number of jobs in the food processing industry has fallen.  Our industries should be agriculture-related, yet many of the new industries which have been set up are completely alien to our circumstances. We are grateful to the firms that have established themselves here but they did not do so for love of the Irish people but because we offered them more than they could obtain elsewhere.  We could benefit more from the setting up of an industry by an Irishman because it would be his total enterprise on which his livelihood and that of his family would depend.  It is not the same in the case of foreign firms and we must examine the favourable grant facilities available to them.</P>
    <P>During the past few years it seems to have been the aim of the IDA to approve a certain number of jobs each year and they have always reached target.  I am suspicious of anyone who consistently meets his target because it is not possible always to do so.  There is a big difference between job approvals and actual jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the result of a study of the position since 1973, of the jobs approved by the IDA and those actually created.  For instance, in County Kildare the IDA approved a factory which was supposed to produce 1,400 jobs.  It has been in production for two years but there are only 200 jobs and it will never see 1,400 jobs.  In another Kildare factory <Col N="380" /> 2,000 jobs were supposed to have been created but redundancies brought the number down to 400.  We have to look at the millions of pounds paid out to attract firms here and we must consider whether it has been a total waste.</P>
    <P>The IDA give out re-equipment grants to firms who in normal circumstances would be re-equipping anyhow.  The grants do not have the slightest effect on further employment prospects.  The IDA have built advance factories which are lying idle.</P>
    <P>We will have to have a hard look at the policies of the IDA.  I agree that they have done and will continue to do useful work but could not the money given out in grants by them have been spent more usefully otherwise?  For instance, could we not encourage people in the food processing industry rather than bring firms in here who have no business being here at all, such as the business of candle-making.  Would it not be better to have encouraged industries based on our cattle and pigs?  Our national budget is not so large that we can say to the IDA: &ldquo;Here is so much, do what you like with it.  You are still doing a good job, bang away at it&rdquo;.  I suggest we should be getting a better return for our money.</P>
    <P>This is a normal Bill.  It is just an enabling measure for the setting up of a limited company to be known as the Youth Employment Agency.  Most of the sections provide for the setting up of that company whose business will be set out in their memorandum.  The Bill does not give us any idea of the work they will do. The Bill enables the Government to collect 1 per cent from practically every worker in the country, an estimated £63 million in a full year.  In other words, the Bill provides for the raising of this money from the taxpayer to pay for existing schemes.  I am not sure extra work will be done because apparently the main purpose is to raise money to pay for existing schemes by another form of direct taxation to be known as a levy.  A spade should be called a spade: this is another form of direct taxation.</P>
    <P>The money will go into the Exchequer but the full amount collected may not go to the employment agencies.  It will be <Col N="381" /> available to the Minister and no-one else because section 19 provides that it will go directly into the Exchequer like the proceeds of other forms of taxation.  One must therefore ask why the agency cannot be funded by a grant from the Exchequer.  The Bill enables the Government to collect money.  Section 24 sets out what is being done.  If the Bill provided that all the money so collected would go to the agency I would welcome it but I doubt very much if it will all go to the agency because I feel sure that every year some of it will remain in the Exchequer. That is why I suggest that it should be treated as direct taxation.</P>
    <P>This very likely will have an effect on wage levels because people are mainly concerned about their take home pay and they will not be fooled when the Government call this a levy.  This new form of direct taxation will yield £63 million in a year and we are told we can expect £30 million from the European Social Fund, bringing the amount up to £93 million. If all of that money were to go to the Youth Employment Agency they could do a very good job with it, but I will be amazed if the £93 million will be given to the agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill which shows recognition of a particular problem.  We must all accept that a serious youth unemployment problem exists but I am afraid it will continue because I do not think the idea of this agency will solve it without a complementary commitment by all in society.  To solve it, we must all be willing to accept new work practices and perhaps ideas such as early retirement and work sharing.  Work sharing means income sharing.  Irish society has changed so much that we find every section looking for more and more for less and less.  I do not believe any political party will solve the problem overnight unless the evil is rooted out.  We are elected to do so.  If we do not find the way there is no point in blaming somebody else.  We have the opportunity to do so. I wish the Government success &mdash; as I would wish any Government &mdash; in trying to alleviate a very acute problem.  If not, the consequences of our inaction will be disastrous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I am not surprised that he is already active in the field of youth employment. This Bill is evidence of his concern for young people and their problems.  In the European Parliament he was a member of the Committee on Youth Employment and Cultural Affairs.  When I went over there I heard many references to papers he had prepared and committees on which he had worked.  I am glad he is now able to pursue that useful activity with a concrete proposal for effective legislation.</P>
      <P>There are many different ways to solve this problem.  Perhaps the way the Minister suggests is not exactly the way I would choose.  Youth unemployment is often talked of in a patronising way, as if it were any different from any other unemployment.  This problem is more obvious and more significant when an economy is slowing down and industrial output is falling, and when we cannot capture markets we could capture if we were more competitive.  If new jobs are not being created, and if jobs vacated by retiring people are not being filled for one reason or another, it is natural that people leaving school and coming on to the labour market will be more in evidence in the area of unemployment than older people who had established themselves in better days.  While youth unemployment is a special problem to some extent, it is also part of a much bigger problem of general unemployment here and in Europe.  The fact that unemployment is emerging in more competitive and more highly industrialised countries is rather frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the more highly industrialised countries are facing redundancies and unemployment, and if they are failing to compete in world markets &mdash; countries whose productivity is 20 per cent to 30 per cent better than ours &mdash; we can expect to have serious unemployment difficulties.  Until we face up to this, and take steps to solve our problems of competitiveness and productivity, the problem will continue and the people who will suffer most will be the younger people.  As the years go on, more and more young people will be on <Col N="383" /> the labour market without jobs years after they have left school.  That is a frightening prospect and it is one with which we have not been familiar in the cities or in the countryside.  We did not have many people who were unemployed for years.  That is the prospect we will face if we do not take corrective measures to ensure that our industries and services become more competitive in order that we can sell more and thereby create employment.</P>
    <P>I hope this Youth Employment Agency will not mean the setting up of a new department which will use an excessive proportion of the funds being made available for administrative purposes. We must guard against that carefully.  We cannot afford to expand our public services and to create jobs which are not productive and which will not create real wealth and have the spin-off effect of creating growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>We must beware of the temptation to use available money to create mickey-mouse jobs and mickey-mouse solutions to the problems of the unemployed.  The funds available must be directed primarily towards the creation of employment which, in the short term, will create genuine wealth and, in the long term, lead to growth in our economy and to stable employment.  On entering the EEC when we found ourselves with access to funds from the European Social Fund, we tended to rush out and put into operation some ill-conceived ideas.  This was a waste of money and did not lead to the creation of employment or wealth.  We must guard against doing that again.</P>
    <P>We must establish a programme to prepare youth for employment and to provide them with training which will enable them to understand what employment and industry are about.  We cannot look forward to the creation of jobs in the public service in the same numbers as in the past.  I do not have to go into the whole story again.  The creation of jobs in the public service as a solution for unemployment amongst younger people will not work in the years ahead.  The Minister recognises that.  I hope he will create a genuine programme to train <Col N="384" /> young people for useful employment in industry.</P>
    <P>This is not a small or insignificant amount of money.  The idea of a levy is an intelligent approach to the subject.  I see it as being different from normal taxation. The money will be raised for a particular purpose.  The people making this contribution will know exactly for what purpose the money is being raised. It will be a contribution from those who have jobs to help create employment and opportunities for those who have not got jobs.  If it is seen only as a temporary levy on their pay packets which they will make up during the next round of wage negotiations, the effort will be wasted.  That would cause increased wages, increased industrial costs, lack of competitiveness and reduced employment, which would cancel the intended effect.  It is fair and reasonable that the Minister should ask employed people to make a specific contribution to solve the problem for another generation who are less fortunate.</P>
    <P>We know there is a high proportion of young people coming on to the labour market.  Industrialised Europe will quickly get over this because their birth rate is so low.  In four or five years the number of young people coming on to the labour market in many sectors will not be sufficient.  We cannot look forward to this.  We recognise that improved technology will make it more difficult to solve the problem.  We should not be afraid of improved technology because it will enable those in employment to produce more and the goods they produce should be cheaper and, therefore, available to more people at a reduced price.  In order to achieve full employment and to maintain our existing employment we must have a growth rate of 4 per cent to 5 per cent.  Nobody is optimistic enough to forecast that growth rate in the years immediately ahead, which means that our rate of unemployment is far more likely to increase than to stabilise or drop.</P>
    <P>To create jobs for young people we must increase our growth rate by much more than this.  We cannot ignore the technology that is there because that would lead to lower standards of living. We must look for the most advanced <Col N="385" /> technology and give our young people the training not only to use it today but to enable them to adapt to flexibility in industry.  The Minister should concentrate his efforts on preparing people for a working life in a world of rapidly changing technology and renewed opportunity. I am not too pessimistic about our youth. In many ways they are fortunate in the place and the time in which they live.  We recognise there are tremendous pressures not only on young people but also on their parents.  This pressure is more evident on parents of big families in rural Ireland who see their children coming to school leaving age and worrying about jobs for the older members of the family. They worry also about the discontent of young people when their hopes are not realised.</P>
    <P>While young people may say they have every right to a job, they must also recognise that they have an obligation to work. At no time in the history of civilisation could people say they were destined to do a particular job or to enjoy a certain standard of living.  In an ever-changing world young people will have to accept the jobs which are available on the labour market.  They must recognise they are going into a world in which they must compete.  There is no possibility that we can close our economy and insulate ourselves from the necessity to compete in world markets.</P>
    <P>In Strasbourg recently I was approached by the president of a multi-national electronics manufacturing company. He said we should recognise that the vast benefits that came to us through our industrial development programme and the establishment of branches of multi-national industries here was at grave risk because unemployment is rising in Europe and there is pressure within individual nations to protect their own national industries.  Even if they do not pass laws to do that, by one means or another state and semi-state bodies, who control so much of the purchase of computer and electronic equipment, will protect the industries in their own countries. In those circumstances the prospects for job creation become less bright than in the past because those multi-national <Col N="386" /> companies will be quick to recognise any move towards protection and will locate their industries in countries which provide them with more opportunities and bigger markets.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful to protect and cherish the idea of a free market in Europe.  If there is any form of protection, countries like Ireland will suffer most.  We have been fortunate in attracting investment from abroad and, because of the advanced nature of technology which those industries brought to us, they have survived the blizzard of inflation to which they have been subjected in recent years.  Our service industries have survived it to some extent because they can pass on their costs.  The public service have also survived the effects of inflation because they can demand and get higher wage increases.  I do not believe our manufacturing industry can survive much longer.  We must control our inflation or see jobs lost.  That has already happened in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We cannot divorce any discussion on youth unemployment from the utilisation of our natural resources.  We must educate young people to exploit our natural resources.  It is obvious that some agricultural land is not worked to its full capacity.  We could increase our agricultural production by 10 per cent per annum and we have guaranteed markets for it.  We have a declining number of people employed in the food processing industry and we cannot expect to rapidly increase that number because our productivity does not match that of European countries.  We will have to increase the amount of agricultural produce we process in order to maintain the number of people already there.  The same is true of our waste and marginal lands, which should and could be used because we have a climate which enables us to convert these lands to the production of energy.</P>

      <P>Last night I said inflation was the farmers greatest worry.  It is now 22.2 per cent.  Fianna Fáil cannot be blamed for that, although they can accept some responsibility.  The Coalition have added 5 per cent to inflation by direct taxation and other measures taken in the July budget.  Nobody in farming can plan a future because the cost of inputs is growing faster than price increases.  If we keep increasing our prices we will price our produce off the European and world markets.  Last night the Minister said we had no entrée for our dairy produce into the United States or for our beef into Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of closing the Tuam factory in 1982 we should build up the confidence of beet growers west of the Shannon, expand our beet acreage there, and try to encourage farmers in counties which do not grow beet to take it on.  The weather has been bad for the last two years but even in future good years inflation will choke initiative.  We should ask ourselves why the upward trend in milk yield has not continued.  Why have cattle numbers decreased?  There was a big decrease from £6.17 million in 1979 to £5.82 million in 1980.  I believe 1981 will see a bigger decrease, possibly 750,000 or 1 million fewer cattle, in our herds.  That is the saddest feature of all.  It is very sad to think that in 1980 we have fewer cattle <Col N="388" /> than we had in 1970.  That is a decade gone to waste.  Our breeding stocks are being sold off and the Minister has a duty to see that this trend is arrested.  In the short time he has been in office I have not seen him make any move in this direction. It is time he gave us some idea that he realises the size of this problem.</P>
    <P>I do not see any Government plan to increase the use of fertilisers to allow us to grow grass and to keep more cattle. Drainage should be speeded up to provide more arable land.  We now hear of a dispute between our live exports and cattle supplies for factories.  I believe a little live export helps keep prices right. Farmers will remember the prices they got from the factories because they were at their mercy when Mr. Clinton was Minister.</P>
    <P>We should be able to build up our herds to supply the factories and live export demands.  The real future for our processing industry lies in processing at home.  I want to remind the Minister that the constituency he and I represent has 1,000 people employed in the meat processing industry and that one-sixth of all cattle slaughtered in this country are slaughtered in Kildare.  This is an area where the Minister should remove any curbs on the expansion of our beef processing industry.  I suggest that an adjustment in the refunds for exporting boned-in beef to European third countries would help and enable the factories to compete on more equal terms with live exporters.  This would increase employment in our boning halls.  Instead of employing 1,000 people as at present &mdash; the majority are only sending out carcase meat and some of it into intervention &mdash; we could improve our processing industry fivefold.  We could easily have 5,000 people employed in this industry and even more if we followed this to the end with vac-packed or cooked meats.</P>
    <P>Schemes will have to be introduced to encourage farmers to put cows in-calf and rear young stock to build up our herds. It is very hard to expect people to increase the use of fertiliser if they have not some confidence in the future.  We cannot blame them for marching to highlight their plight.  Last week it appeared <Col N="389" /> the Minister had no answer to this long-term problem.  The big protest started and this week answers are beginning to surface.  Perhaps it is only a coincidence but it appears that if you shout loudly enough you will get answers.</P>
    <P>We have read and heard more of suggested help in the media than we were told about in this House.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be in a position to tell us more.  Grain growing farmers told me of the difficulties they are in.  The tillage industry is in the doldrums.  It should have potential.  There must be a future for growing vegetables.  Horticulture has a lot to offer.  The Minister knows the new Kildare co-op which has been established to sell our potatoes. This is an initiative.</P>
    <P>We should encourage diversification in agriculture.  Can we give these people any hope of a guaranteed price for their produce? We know we are good at growing vegetables but can we sell them?  Can we process them and put them on the European market?  I see a future in this respect in cutaway bogs and in areas which become depressed when there is no future for them in the energy field.  Their future should lie in growing and processing vegetables.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss the problem of development farmers, people who borrowed to improve their methods of farming or bought extra land to make their holdings viable.  Some years ago all agricultural advice told the farmer to borrow and increase his cow numbers.  The agricultural instructor would say 40 cows were not enough; the herd should be increased to 80; that the farmer should knock down the old byres, get a new silage layout and get slatted floors in the milking parlours.  He was told the banks would be very co-operative.  When the farmer went to the bank and asked for a loan of £30,000 he was told to borrow £40,000.  A farmer nearly wanted a wheelbarrow to take home the money that was showered on him.  I realise nobody put a gun to his head and forced him to take this money, but the advice from all sides was to go ahead.  These people are now in trouble and need help.</P>
    <P>The people who are in trouble are the <Col N="390" /> farmers who were prepared to work. They did not bury their talents in the ground.  The satisfied farmer sat back and left well enough alone.  It has always been the dissatisfied farmer who changed the course of history and made an impact.  It is the dissatisfied farmers who brought Irish agriculture into the twentieth century. I hope the Minister will have news of an interest subsidy which will help the 100,000 farmers who are in trouble today. I also hope the guidelines will not be too stringent.  We heard there would be a limit of £50,000 and it has been suggested that it might be £100,000.  Will the acreage stop at 200 acres?  Will a farmer get an interest subsidy on a loan only if he is buying extra land to make his holding viable?  What about the farmer who wants to buy a farm for a son who stayed at home and worked the family farm? These are questions to which I would like to hear answers tonight.</P>
    <P>During the last election there was a promise about the removal of rates.  We progressively adopted a policy of removing rates from agricultural holdings and there was a promise given by the incoming Government that they would adopt an understanding attitude and that local authorities would have an understanding attitude.  So far no proper directive has been issued to the local authorities and the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Agriculture should get together and tell the people what they mean by &ldquo;understanding attitude&rdquo;.  Some rate collectors are not inclined to believe that inability to pay is a proper excuse, it is not enough for them.  They have suggested to some farmers that they sell off some of their land.  If this is the policy it is sad to reflect that the day of the battering ram is not finished in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Fisheries I am aware of the big upset it is to any country's economy when third country imports are allowed into the Community. The Minister has to contend with imports of dairy products from New Zealand and cheap animal feed.  He must try to reduce these and it is his duty to see that the term &ldquo;Community preference&rdquo; is not just an empty phrase.  I have not stressed these matters tonight because it is the <Col N="391" /> popular thing to do.  I know that there is a big problem.  The farmers have decided that after representations at all levels they must march from all over Ireland to Dublin next Friday to highlight the drop in their income, and their incomes have dropped by 6 per cent.  Income from farming from 1979 to 1980 dropped by £48 million while non-agricultural incomes increased in the same period by 25 per cent.  Farmers will come in bigger numbers than the turnout in Newtownards on Monday last, not as a third force but as the primary producers of Ireland. They have no fault to find with social welfare recipients or industrial workers who can give themselves increases of 18 per cent, 22 per cent or 25 per cent each year.  They realise that they need that, but they cannot afford to have a drop in their income or their incomes lowered each year.  They feel they must bring home those facts to the Minister.  They have a genuine complaint and I wonder if the Minister realises that.  Does the Minister know that the average earnings in industry in 1979 was £96.90 and in 1980 it had increased to £113.46?  In the same period the CPI for food increased by 36 points while non-food items increased by 63 points.  I wonder if the Coalition realise that Irish agriculture is in such a bad mess.</P>
    <P>In the Government amendment, which is not being moved, the term &ldquo;measures being taken&rdquo; was used and I hope that is an indication that, while nothing has been done up to now something will be done. Did it take a group of people starting out from the Talbot Hotel in Wexford to bring this matter home to the Government? Did it take a tractorcade coming to Dublin to get something done?  Farmers I have spoken to have told me that they want a fund to help those in trouble. They want money at reasonable interest rates.  The Government have not shown any competence to bring down inflation yet, but what about devaluation of the pound?  The Government should tell us the pros and cons of that.  I hope the motion brings home to the Minister the need to deal urgently with the despair and despondency that farmers feel.  I trust <Col N="392" /> the Minister will act now and play his part to give hope for a future in Irish farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate and the constructive approach to it.  It is a timely debate particularly when we are starting negotiations on the mandate and on prices in Brussels.  Although a Supplementary Estimate will be moved tomorrow I believe the debate on this motion will serve a useful purpose.</P>
      <P>The motion put down by Deputy MacSharry speaks of the need to halt the decline in farmers' income and to restore confidence in the agricultural sector.  Let me say at the outset that it is very much the Government's intention to have confidence restored to the sector as quickly as possible and to pursue every possible course with a view to finshing a solution to the farm income problem.  Not indeed that the problem has arrived over night, as Deputy Power would give us to believe, and it is ludicrous for the Opposition to suggest that the problem is a recent one.  The present crisis in the agricultural sector had been developing over the last three years.  The figures are there and they speak for themselves.  Since 1978 real farm incomes have fallen by approximately 50 per cent.  Cattle numbers have been declining, cow numbers have fallen, sheep numbers are lower and pig numbers have also declined.  Those are the rather harsh realities the Government had to face.</P>
      <P>This compares with a situation in the mid-seventies when farm incomes increased substantially creating a new confidence throughout rural Ireland. New farm homes were being built at an unprecedented rate, new farm buildings were being erected and many farmers were embarking on major farm development plans.  In the rural towns and villages there was clear evidence of this new prosperity, new shops and garages, new community centres and in a great many areas, new schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in our history the living standards of farmers and their families were on a par with those of the people in the town.  The farmer's wife <Col N="393" /> expected the same facilities and comforts as the urban housewife.  There was a new enthusiasm for agricultural education and many young people saw agriculture as providing a secure and rewarding occupation for the rest of their lives.  It is rather tragic that, although the Opposition now tries to show such awareness of the problems of farmers' incomes and the decline that has occurred over the last three years, they did not take the necessary steps to solve the problems which they created when they were in office.  If they had shown more concern when they were in office the problems we now face would not have materialised; at any rate they would have been much less serious.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognise the importance of agriculture to Ireland.  It goes without saying that farming and its related industries are of paramount importance in achieving economic and social progress which is desired by us all and its importance to the whole economy cannot be over-emphasised.  A healthy agricultural sector stimulates the growth in other areas, particularly industries dependent on it.  The Government are deeply conscious of the contribution agriculture can make in helping to bring us out of the present economic difficulties. However, they are also conscious of the fact that the resources available to them are not unlimited and that money provided for agriculture may have to be withheld from other deserving areas.</P>
    <P>On coming to office the Government took full stock of the situation which had been allowed to develop and drew up plans not only to help alleviate this situation but to restore agriculture to the rightful place it holds in the national economy.  As the Minister already indicated, a number of measures have already been introduced.  Last evening he announced the introduction of a new national interest subsidy from 1 December next.  The subsidy will apply to participants in the farm modernisation scheme who are not in the development category.  The terms of the new subsidy will be broadly similar to those of the EEC interest subsidy scheme for development farmers.  The subsidy will be at 5 per cent and will apply to borrowings for <Col N="394" /> approved investment in land reclamation or drainage, farm buildings and fixed equipment, which were grant-aided under the farm modernisation scheme. The sum which will qualify for subsidy will be the amount of the approved investment by the farmer for these purposes less any grant paid by the Department of Agriculture or the outstanding capital balance of the loan, whichever is the lesser.  The subsidy will apply to loans arranged between 1 January 1976 and 31 December 1980.  The maximum loan eligible for a subsidy will be £50,000.</P>
    <P>This new subsidy will be of considerable benefit to many thousands of farmers. About 70,000 farmers are in the categories covered by this provision which will therefore be available to a very sizeable section of the agricultural community.</P>

    <P>Deputy MacSharry made reference yesterday to a statement I made in relation to the July budget.  At that time I stated that the scheme would be available by 1 September.  I would point out to Deputy MacSharry that it was announced in or around 16 September, so we are talking about a fortnight's delay only. <Col N="395" /> The hold-up was not on my side; it was occasioned by the negotiations in Brussels. As the Deputy knows from experience, these things must be cleared in Brussels.  Deputy MacSharry said also that Deputy Michael Smith had had previous negotiations with the banks and financial institutions.  I should like to make it quite clear, without taking anything from what Deputy Michael Smith had done at that time, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>During those negotiations I would point out that it was essential that we had a proper lending policy to accompany these 5 per cent interest subsidies. That is why negotiations were taken up with the financial institutions.  It is important to place on the record of this House the agreement reached with the financial institutions at the time.  I should like to read them out one by one.  Where a number of loans are involved and eligible for subsidy there should be amalgamation and restructuring into one long-term loan &mdash; this to do away with the situation in which there were a lot of scrappy short-term loans &mdash; and then the repayment of all loans eligible for subsidy up to a 16-year period with a one-year moratorium.  It is essential that the banks extend their ten-year period to 16 and absolutely essential that a one-year moratorium be available as a breathing space for most farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, what happened over the years was that a lot of farmers took out short-term loans.  That was very bad <Col N="396" /> planning.  It was agreed also that all surcharges and penalties on repayments should be removed forthwith.  That was very important.  God knows the problem was bad enough without adding surcharges and penalties of from 2 to 6 per cent.  Furthermore, agreement was reached that all qualifying loans should carry normal interest rates, which is also important.  Those are the negotiations which will apply to the 5 per cent EEC scheme and apply also to the national 5 per cent scheme.  There are so many schemes in existence now people are inclined to become confused between them.  As soon as all of these schemes have been worked out and finalised it is essential that their terms be put in writing and explained thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Further measures are in the course of preparation and will be introduced as soon as possible.  In a very short period of time expenditure on agriculture is being increased by over £70 million at a time when there have been cutbacks in practically every other sector.  This underlines the commitment of the Government, their concern to assist farmers and to restore the necessary confidence to the sector.</P>
    <P>The measures already taken and the measures to be taken in the future will help to halt the decline in the economy at large and in the farming sector in particular. Our major concern is that the agricultural industry should once again be allowed to play an important role in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the downward trend in the national breeding herd.  Maintaining and increasing cow numbers is essential to the whole future development of the agricultural industry. It is important to our dairy sector and is essential also to our cattle and beef sector. When one remembers that cattle and milk account for approximately 70 per cent of our total agricultural production the importance of the breeding herd becomes immediately apparent.  I am particularly concerned therefore to learn that in certain parts of the country farmers are selling off their breeding stock.  I would urge them to think twice before they proceed on this course.  I can vouch <Col N="397" /> that it is the Government's intention to do everything possible to correct the downward trend and to promote the expansion so necessary to the development of the whole agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I have said before, and reiterate, that central to the whole of our economy is our national herd.  It has come to my notice within the past fortnight that we are exporting in-calf heifers to some foreign lands.  Unfortunately, some of our meat factories are also slaughtering in-calf heifers.  This constitutes a retrograde step.  We as a Government fully realise the importance of the national herd to our economy.</P>
    <P>I announced last week the new European Investment Bank loan which will apply to farmers at an interest rate as low as 6 per cent.  Moreover, it carries a fixed interest rate for the first two years of 6 per cent, for the next two years of 9 per cent and for the last ten years a fixed rate of 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power asked if I could go somewhat further.  As a former Minister he knows perfectly well that there is a certain distance one must travel before making announcements.  However, I can say that further measures are being taken in regard to the promises made by the Fine Gael Party prior to the last election.</P>
    <P>Apart from the actions which the Government have taken, or plan to take, as part of their programme for the development of the agricultural sector, the Government will of course be looking to Brussels to help in whatever way it can in the present difficult suituation.  No effort will be spared in negotiations on the agricultural prices package for the coming year.  We will be ensuring that the best possible deal will be obtained for Irish agriculture.  These discussions have, in fact, already started and the position of Irish farming has been made known loud and clear.  Although farm incomes have fallen badly in recent years I would urge farmers not to become disillusioned with the common agricultural policy.  It has been particularly good to the Irish farmer in the past.  I am convinced that within the framework of that policy we can negotiate a deal which will get agriculture on the road to recovery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> Deputy MacSharry spoke last evening of the efforts being made in the context of the mandate debate to have the principles of the CAP modified and changed. I can assure him that the present Government will not be prepared to accept any such changes and we have and will continue to point out that the objectives of the CAP are enshrined in the treaty and must be pursued.  The priority consideration as far as we are concerned is the income crisis and we are demanding that account be taken of this fact and action be taken to alleviate the situation.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the Commission's report on the mandate and its later guidelines for the future development of the CAP have certain negative undertones. This is despite the fact that in recent years there have been improvements in the budgetary situation.  These improvements have been brought about not by eroding the principles of the CAP but by careful market management and through improved prices on world markets where the Community, as a major exporter, can itself exercise a major influence.  I see no reason to give way to despondency either because the Community is closer than it was to the limit on its overall resources or because it has increased its degree of self-sufficiency in farm products.  The present budgetary limit must sooner or later be changed if the Community is to survive.  Europe's food will continue to be needed, both in Europe and elsewhere. Indeed it is not long since there was a shortage of sugar and the CAP proved its value to Community consumers. We need not look too far to find food shortages at present.  And I do not have in mind the less-developed areas of Africa.  There are food shortages in Eastern Europe.  The Community should be glad that it has ample supplies of food and Community leaders should think very carefully before they make any changes in the common agricultural policy that would seriously damage food production.</P>
    <P>A major deficiency in the mandate report is its failure to give adequate recognition to the income difficulties farmers are experiencing.  Over the past few years real farm incomes have fallen <Col N="399" /> throughout the Community and the problem is particularly acute in this country. The basic problem facing the CAP is not one of budget resources or market balance, rather it is the question of how to ensure decent living standards for the farming population.  The Community has that responsibility under Article 39 of the Rome Treaty.  The Government will continue to insist that the commitment be honoured, in the short term as well as in the long term.</P>
    <P>Suggestions for changes in the market systems for individual products are made in the mandate report.  There is in particular the idea that the degree of support should be degressive beyond certain target quantities of production.  It is important that the Community should not impose a permanent strait-jacket on its farm production.  <i>Ad hoc</i> remedies for particular market problems have been found and have worked in the past; that general approach could be used again where and when needed.  The Government will accept no arrangement which would deny Irish agriculture the opportunity to prosper and develop.  It will, therefore, continue to be totally opposed to any milk levy based on a farmer's additional production.  For a country whose agriculture depends heavily on milk production and where milk productivity is still well below the Community average, the long-term effects of the so-called super levy could be disastrous.  The idea that a producer moving from, say, 600 to 700 gallons per cow should pay a heavy tax while one producing steadily at over 1,000 gallons should not, strikes me as a monstrous inequity.</P>
    <P>It would not be fair to say that the mandate report completely ignores farm incomes.  Direct income subsidies are suggested but they would apply only to the smaller Community farmers and they would be only partially financed by the Community.  That suggestion, to my mind, amounts to divesting the Community of its responsibilities.  It would put the more prosperous member states in a better position than others, to support their own farmers.  Even if such actions were to be fully funded by the Community, <Col N="400" /> I would still have objections.  It is better that farmers should gain their income primarily from the market rather than through direct aids of one kind or another, and I think most farming organisations would agree with that.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect of the mandate report that is particularly objectionable from an agricultural viewpoint.  This is a point raised specifically by Deputy MacSharry last evening.  It is the suggestion that compensatory payments to the United Kingdom might be met from reductions in the advances to other member states from FEOGA, the agricultural fund.  To me, that suggestion would involve a gross contravention of the principle of financial solidarity, one of the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.  The Government are totally opposed to the idea; so also are some other member states.  Perhaps we have heard the last of this suggestion &mdash; if not, Ireland will have no hesitation in standing out against it.  If some relief has to be provided to any member state, it should ge provided openly and directly &mdash; and not through a flagrant breach of a basic Community principle.</P>
    <P>Discussions of the mandate report have been going on intensively since last July.  One point that has emerged is that some member states favour a fixed limit on FEOGA expenditure.  To me, that is like cutting off the patient's feet so as to make him fit the bed.  Community agricultural policy is not static.  It has to deal with constantly changing situations both inside and outside the Community.  It needs further development and improvement. The CAP cannot and should not be kept within a fixed budgetary limit. Policy decisions on agriculture as well as the day-to-day management of the markets can themselves contain whatever degree of prudence is appropriate and necessary.  But the budget must fit the policy, not the other way round.  It is plain to me and to many other states that the attempt to curb the expenditure of the CAP is an indirect way of stopping the flow of finances to the agricultural community within the Community itself. It is clear from what I have said above that there are many aspects to the CAP; <Col N="401" /> we have prices, incomes, co-responsibility, cost of the CAP, etc.  All these different aspects are being considered in both the context of the mandate and the Commission guidelines for the future development of agriculture.  There are member states who are anxious to see major adjustments to the CAP.  They want to see the principles changed and the support mechanisms altered.  The different interests have been making their views known.  The Irish Government has been making its views known very clearly and insisting on a deal which will enable Irish agriculture to regain confidence in the Community and develop from the present serious situation it finds itself in. It has been made quite clear that we will not accept any deal or any proposals which undermine the CAP and we will be pointing out the obligation set out in the Treaty to ensure that farmers receive a fair standard of living.  On the national front as I have said, the Government have already taken certain measures and will be taking further measures.  I know that the farmers themselves are already doing everything possible to expand output and productivity and I am convinced that together we will be able to get out of the current difficulties and restore development in Irish agriculture which will benefit not only the farming Community but the whole Irish economy.  In the time available to me I would like to answer some of the arguments put up by the Opposition.  We are in office five months and the present Opposition must bear the responsibility for the very serious difficulties with which farmers are faced.  It has been suggested that but for the march to the Talbot Hotel in Wexford no measures would be taken.  Let me point out exactly what measures are being taken. We have the EEC interest subsidy of 5 per cent in operation and payments will be made in the next two to three weeks. Yesterday the Minister for Agriculture announced a 5 per cent national interest subsidy and this will benefit many farmers. If a farmer has borrowings he will qualify under that scheme, but it is impossible to assess at this stage the number of people who will qualify.  I am sure Deputy Smith will agree with me because I understand <Col N="402" /> he has done some research into that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying anything. I am just stating that when I took office there were no files available to me. I do not wish to take from anything Deputy Smith did.  In addition we have the tax-based lending which is being negotiated at the moment and is no secret.  The IFA and farmer organisations met the banks yesterday for discussions and there are reports in the papers today. This is a very complex issue and a very difficult one and this is the work of the present Government.  Let nobody fool themselves that these schemes can be got into operation at the drop of a hat.  We saw that they were necessary and initiated them.  The tax-based lending scheme is an addition to what was already promised. We found it necessary to supplement the other two schemes.</P>
      <P>Let me further point out that people who qualify under the EEC scheme and under the national scheme will also qualify in regard to the tax-based lending scheme.  This is something that is not understood and many farmers are holding back and not applying under the other schemes.  But as there is a recoupment under the EEC scheme in particular the Department of Finance will insist that, first of all, assessments be made under that scheme before any moneys can be paid out under either of the other two schemes.</P>
      <P>There is quite an amount of misunderstanding about the special loans scheme from the European Investment Bank that I announced.  People believe that we only got £2.5 million.  That is not correct.  The amount signed for on that day was £2.5 million but as the money is required applications can be made and the money will be forthcoming.  There will be other schemes available.</P>

      <P>It is a very worrying factor at the moment.  I welcome the march.  It may be of assistance to us in Europe and also at home.  It is not the first time that there was a march and it is most unlikely that it will be the last.</P>
      <P>Another worrying point is the question of inputs into agriculture.  People are saying that farmers should cut down on inputs.  Let me state, as a practicising farmer, that this is the area where a great number of farmers may dig their own graves.  Let us look at the sales situation; tractor sales are down 60 per cent; farm machinery sales are down 50 per cent; farm building materials are down 60 per cent; compound feedstuffs are down 15 per cent; cattle feedstuffs are down 22 per cent; fertilisers are down 15 to 25 per cent and lime is down 50 per cent.  This is a serious trend.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that certain cutbacks are necessary, but under no circumstances should there be any cutbacks in fertilisers, lime and feedingstuffs.  That would be false economy.  If the stock are there, they should be fed and if the land is there, it should be fertilised.  This is vital, on the one hand to our whole economy and, on the other, to the farmer.  They must not allow the fertility of their farms to run down.  In the last ten years, in particular, the fertility of our soil has been built up and in order to retain that buildup, it is essential that a high level of fertilisation be used.  Mr. MacSharry made a point which I would also like to deal with.</P>

      <P>In my first contribution in the House, I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on the agricultural industry, to the extent that it was my livelihood before I came here and, indeed, I may have to return to it in the future.  I want to acknowledge its kindness to me and the support which I have received from my colleagues in the industry who husband the country's greatest national resource, both in their own interest and in the national interest.  We owe a very deep debt of gratitude to our farmers for their hard work in difficult times, sometimes with very little reward.</P>
      <P>As a product of that great tradition &mdash; perhaps an unworthy one &mdash; I hope that my membership of this House will help to further the cause of this important sector of the community and that the industry will again prosper, so that our idealistic young farmers, graduating through the ranks of Macra na Feirme, will be given the opportunity of earning a decent living and contributing to our overall prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the brief time available to me in this debate, I will speak, not as a farmer but as a member of this House, with the responsibility of developing agriculture as an essential part of our overall economic development.  In fact, part of our present difficulties in agriculture are due to our failure to treat the industry as an essential part of national development. This is a great pity, because the agricultural industry is the base from which all other developments should evolve.  I have particularly in mind the scope and opportunity for developing a successful food processing industry.  This is an area which has been totally neglected and reflects very poorly on our capacity for organisation and management.  When one thinks of the vast amounts of vegetables imported daily into this country and the opportunities for processing the products of our beef industry, is it any wonder that we have failed to tackle in a <Col N="406" /> realistic way the problems of unemployment?</P>
    <P>We must get away from the concept that agriculture is for farmers and of benefit only to farmers.  The farmers are the people who have the skills and expertise to operate the industry.  The State has the responsibility to create the economic climate in which that industry can operate and expand.  The State must also devise and implement policies to exploit these resources, in the national interests.</P>
    <P>In the present situation, it is the farmers, and not the farms, that are being exploited.  I do not know of any sector more willing to respond to the challenge of developing and expanding than the Irish farmer.  Since our entry into the EEC, our farmers have responded to the incentives to modernise the industry and some of our top farmers are, indeed, the most progressive in Europe today.</P>
    <P>The agricultural advisory services have also responded to the challenge and assisted farmers in the preparation of development plans for the individual development of the various farm units.  It is ironic that, because farmers responded to that challenge and because they had the courage to borrow to put the plans into operation, they now find themselves in serious financial difficulties.  It is a shame that, in isolated cases, the agricultural advisory services are being made the scapegoats for some farmers in difficulties, when the reality of the situation is that the plans drawn up by the agricultural instructors were soundly based and costed at a time when inflation and interest rates were within the scope of the individual farmers.</P>
    <P>The only scapegoats in this entire operation are the farmers themselves. They are in an almost irretrievable situation. They are drifting in a sea of raging inflation and are calling to the only people who can help them &mdash; the Government and the European Parliament &mdash; to come to their rescue.  I appeal to the Minister here tonight not to stand idly on the shore because at this stage the farmers are suffering from exhaustion.  Some are already becoming submerged in the sea of inflation and I appeal to the Minister to put out his hand even at this late <Col N="407" /> stage to help them ashore.  Their plight is not of their making; they are the victims of the malignant consuming disease of inflation from which other sectors &mdash; and I do not object to this &mdash; have been immunised.  In the case of the farmers we must provide the cure and take whatever precautions are necessary to ensure that the disease does not occur again.</P>
    <P>Farmers do not want subsidies or assistance in the usual meaning of these terms.  All they want is the creation of an economic climate in which the industry can prosper.  If we create that climate, the farmers will do the rest.  In so doing they will generate economic activity from which the entire economy will benefit.  In this, my first speech in this House, I would urge the economic planners to get back to the drawing board and to recommit themselves and the nation to the basic economic fact that our greatest material resource is still the land.  There is tremendous scope for its development and such development would provide jobs for our other great resource, the thousands of boys and girls who are desperately seeking jobs and who have very few prospects in the present economic recession.</P>
    <P>The very appearance of this motion on the Order Paper is our recognition of the plight of individual farmers and of the agricultural industry.  When a new Government come into office it is only fair to expect the Opposition to give them sufficient time to become established. Adopting a constructive approach, Fianna Fáil allowed this Government to do so and we were hopeful that the new Minister for Agriculture would come to grips with the serious situation.  We waited for action, but it was not until this motion was tabled that there was activity within the Department.  Perhaps we should have tabled the motion a month earlier.  The necessity to do so is an indication of the failure of the Government to recognise during the past few months that a crisis exists in agriculture.  It is also a recognition of their failure to bring forward positive proposals to meet the short-term needs of farmers who are now under such severe pressure.  It is only since this motion was tabled or, to be a <Col N="408" /> little more generous, within the past six or eight weeks that the Minister has awakened from his day dreams.  No doubt he was assisted in that awakening by his back benchers and by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  I served on the General Council of Committees of Agriculture with him and always recognised his sincerity as a man working in the best interests of farmers.  Government back-benchers must be increasingly aware of the extent of the crisis and the disillusionment of the farming community.  Even farmers who support the Minister's party are extremely critical of the lack of action.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, referred last night to a speech made some months ago by the Minister for Agriculture at the Strokestown agricultural show.  In the course of that speech the Minister said that, given the present situation in a section of public finances, it was not open to the Government directly to compensate farmers for the drop in income which they had experienced in the last two years.  He stated that the cost of direct compensation was greatly in excess of any expenditure which the Government were likely to be able to undertake.  No doubt these would continue to be the views of the Minister and the Government were it not for the farm revolt, which is now obvious, and this motion which we have tabled in an effort to make the Government take the necessary action.  Before the last general election the farmers were led to believe that if they assisted in getting Fianna Fáil out of office everything would be rosy.  They even believed that the present Minister was some kind of messiah, a saviour of the industry.  Regretfully his approach to the management of his Department is a replica of the Government's approach to the economy in general &mdash; a cold, harsh monetarist policy, putting bookkeeping before people.</P>
    <P>As far as agriculture is concerned, it will be nothing short of a disgrace if the people who kept the economy going through the years are discarded before the need to keep balanced accounts.  It is frightening that in a few months we are <Col N="409" /> again talking about rescue measures for agriculture, a far cry from the chants and demands from other organised sectors to tax the farmer.  Another harsh reality is that in the case of the majority of Irish farmers, family incomes are below those of workers in the agricultural service industry and other sources of employment. For administrators at national and European levels to allow this situation to develop is nothing short of a disgrace.  It is a case of putting the cart before the horse, a policy that will lead to the collapse of the industry.  In its wake many thousands of jobs will be lost.</P>
    <P>The root cause of the present crisis in agriculture has been diagnosed by various people, politicians and economists, and the one point on which we are all agreed is that inflation is one of the major factors.  It has caused input costs to erode profit margins leading to a decline in farming incomes of 60 per cent in three years.  I do not think that any other sector in the economy would tolerate such a drop in incomes.  That is why farmers must be described as being extremely tolerant.  They have always been tolerant but they now find themselves on the roads heading for this city to express disapproval of the Minister's handling of agricultural problems.  I agree with the Minister that perhaps it is not any harm from the European view point that they are expressing their disapproval in this way, It is not any harm anyway, because the Minister and the Government have been forced to embark on a course of endeavouring to provide some assistance to try to get farming out of recession.  We thank the Minister for that because it is a welcome move.  We will appreciate anything the Minister can do to help and he will have the full backing and encouragement of every member of Fianna Fáil in his endeavour to save farm incomes in the briefest possible time.</P>
    <P>I do not think that can be achieved or that inflation can be controlled in the short-term, much as we should like to see it, because Government policy is heading in the opposite direction mainly as a result of the July budget.  Inflation has been increased by 5 per cent and all immediate indicators show that if the <Col N="410" /> Government continue to pursue their present economic policies inflation will be increased by 8 per cent early in 1982. So the prospect of restoring farm incomes is not on in the short-term.</P>
    <P>All of this is happening under a Government who put forward as their main objective the control of inflation.  In the House and during the election campaign they were extremely critical of the rate of inflation which they said Fianna Fáil allowed to develop.  They are now appreciating the realities of running the country, of handling the economy, and I ask the Government and the Minister here tonight why it is that they are not able to keep the promise they made during the election that they would control inflation. Why have they introduced policies which are continuing to increase inflation?  We will not have an opportunity to hear the Minister replying to that question.</P>
    <P>There are two problems worrying agriculture. There is the short-term remedy needed to tide over farmers who have heavy borrowings.  I have not had time to examine in detail to what extent the new interest subsidy will be of direct benefit to farmers.  I doubt if it will produce the measure of relief which farmers need who find themselves in that position.  The other aspect, which I believe to be of greater importance, concerns farmers who have not to repay heavy borrowing. I refer to the vast majority of small farmers whose incomes have been declining steadily due to escalating inflation being encouraged by the Government.  The only answer to their problems is a realistic policy of price increases for all agricultural produce to enable farmers, like every other sector, to be compensated for inflation.</P>
    <P>Last night in the House Deputy MacSharry forcefully made the case that the Taoiseach should go immediately to Europe to make a special case for assistance to Irish farmers.  I join with him in asking the Taoiseach to do that, not only in the interests of farmers but of the nation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry time does not allow me to develop a number of other points.  There is need for a long-term commitment to the development of agriculture, a plan <Col N="411" /> which would not be interfered with by changes of Government or anything of that nature, a financial plan to ensure we will not have the peaks and the troughs in agriculture which have been bedevilling the industry for years.  Under the agricultural leadership of Deputies MacSharry and Smith there was a total commitment to the development of that industry.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years when agriculture was in trouble, regardless of their political views, the farmers of Ireland realised that as Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, more than any other Minister in the history of the State, was available at all times to meet them and to discuss their problems and, more important, to negotiate on their behalf within the European Community.  I want to put it on the record of the House that, regardless of their political views, the vast majority of farmers recognised him as an honest Minister, a committed Minister, a man who got the best possible deal for Irish farmers in extremely difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said has been objective. I have endeavoured to be sincere in my comments on the absolute necessity to develop agriculture.  As somebody said in an earlier debate, I am glad to have got over my first hurdle as a Member of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Funds for the common agricultural policy have been flowing into Ireland by the hundreds of millions.  This money has gone into private pockets. One would have expected it to be used to increase the volume of productivity from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national cattle herd is now smaller than it was when we first joined the EEC. Cattle sales rose from £104 million in 1969 to £599 million in 1979.  Cattle have been sold on the hoof to North America, and the activities of a cattle baron called <Col N="412" /> Purcell are mainly the reason for this situation.</P>
    <P>Some members of this House sold cattle to this man and in so doing helped to put over 2,000 workers in the meat processing industry on the dole.  Cattle were exported on the hoof to North America with the aid of EEC money intended to subsidise food for poor countries.  The misuse of this fund has caused the national cattle herd to be run down below its 1972 level.</P>
    <P>If one takes a figure of 100 in 1970 as the volume of agricultural production, in 1980 the figure was only 127.  In money terms it is another matter.  The 1970 figure in net value of agricultural production is £262.2 million.  The 1980 value of net agricultural production is £1,163 million.</P>
    <P>The 1970 real value of 100p was 28p only in 1980.  When one examines the big jump in cash returns and measures this against the small increase in output, it is clear that a great deal of money was going into private pockets which should have been used to increase productivity from the land.  This is happening at a time when workers are being asked to reduce their standard of living.</P>
    <P>The numbers in the national cattle herd, on which a thriving export market in processed meat should depend, giving thousands of badly needed industrial jobs, have fallen considerably.  The numbers in the national cattle herd were down from 5,956,000 in 1970, to 5,826,000 in 1980.  When the figures for this year come out, it will be discovered that the numbers will have fallen to a considerably lower figure.</P>
    <P>Farmers are now looking for a Government grant of £90 million to rebuild the national herd.  This will have to come out of the taxpayer's money.  The national cattle herd will have to be rebuilt.  Farmers cannot afford to borrow from the banks and pay their high interest rates, so the taxpayer will have to find the money.  The taxpayer will also have to find at least another £10 million to support the 2,000 meat processing workers selling cattle for export on the hoof has put on the dole.  The threat of further unemployment is haunting workers in other meat processing factories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> What is the workers' record for increases in productivity when measured against the 1970 figure of 100 and a 1980 figure of 127 for agriculture?  Using a 1970 figure of 100 in all cases the increase in productivity in the food industry was to a figure of 142; in metals and engineering to 165; in chemicals to 305; in drink and tobacco to 157; in non-metallic mineral products to 184; in paper and printing to 116; and in textiles to 129.  In almost all cases, and in face of rising unemployment, people on a wage or salary have registered a substantial increase in productivity. Surely they are entitled to ask what has happened to the hundreds of millions of EEC money which poured into private pockets.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that about 70 per cent of the total EEC budget goes to subsidise agricultural prices.  This has not led to a substantial increase in productivity from the land, or to lower food prices in the shops. The fact that 70 per cent of the EEC budget goes to subsidise agriculture means that much less is left for the social and regional funds.  Together, in fact, they get only 8 per cent of the total EEC budget.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that we have a huge import bill for food which we could very well grow ourselves.  The hundreds of millions we pay out for our food imports is responsible in part for our present serious economic plight.  Surely we should be able to produce more cheaply close to the home market than it is possible to produce, ship half way around the world and sell to undercut us on the home market.  How can we expect to sell on the international market when we cannot even hold the home market?</P>

      <P>If we are to interpret their interest in the plight of Irish farmers and Irish agriculture in general from their attendance for this debate we will find that there is ample reason why we should be faced with a farming revolt.  The fact that last night the Minister for Agriculture withdrew the Government amendment is tantamount to an admission that nothing has been done by them during their period in office.  It is also asking the House not to endorse the measures he claimed were introduced.  Fianna Fáil put down this motion because we were anxious to highlight the major difficulties which beset agriculture.  We are not <Col N="415" /> trying to claim that all these difficulties started overnight.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy D'Arcy on his appointment and I sincerely hope that his tenure in office will be at least as long as mine.  He came into office with the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes, and they were heralded as a team which, together with Deputy Nealon, would create a better future for agriculture.  I am not trying to single out individuals for blame but Deputy D'Arcy must be aware of the depth of frustration and anger, because it is one thing to have the answers, to problems but it is another to veer from where you claimed the answers were.  It was a case of three wise men on the road to the East who accidentally ran into the Taoiseach who, after an injection from him reduced the suggested pay norm from 9 per cent to 6 per cent and who in turn met a hurricane of protest from the workers who faced rampant inflation which was caused by the Government when they were put into office.  We had a U-turn, the first of many.  Deputy D'Arcy said we could not afford last year's national wage agreement.  We were told the Fianna Fáil Government were not doing anything with the problem and that the Opposition had all the answers.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable in the course of the Minister's speech that he left out only one paragraph, which I will now read:</P>
      <P>The real solution to the farm income problem is to break the spiral of inflation. This the Government sees as its main priority.  But this cannot be controlled overnight.  We must ease the pressure on farmers, especially as regards the cost of inputs if the industry is to get on its feet again.  This is a major aim of the Government and anything that can be done to control inflation will be done.</P>

      <P>If it requires a supplementary estimate, we will pass it and allow the Minister to pay these grants.  There have been times in the last couple of months when I felt we had no Minister for Agriculture but two Ministers for Finance.  I am not sure whether it is hostility or a lack of comprehension as to the real value of agriculture, but the Department of Finance seem to continually look at agriculture to see where they can effect savings.  It is time to quantify what it means to the economy and an addition of £300,000 to our national herd could make a great difference to our balance of payments.  If the pace of development in agriculture which was there up to the end of the seventies could be reactivated, it is possible that some of the financial difficulties with which we are faced at present could be overcome.  I would like the people in the Department of Finance and the present Minister, who seems to be a ruthless monetarist, to look seriously at the prospects in that sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>I agree with the fine and honest contribution made by Deputy Hyland.  He said he might have to return to farming sometime.  On the basis of his performance here and in his own constituency, if he does return it will be his choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy mentioned there were no files on the efforts made by the previous Government with regard to farm borrowing difficulties.  That is blatantly untrue.  One of the schemes the Government are now announcing was completed by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, the other was announced at the latter end of May.  It depended on getting agreement from the banks on their contributions towards a solution to the problem.  We said on many occasions that the banks had a responsibility for the people who were in financial difficulties and that they had a role to play.  When a solution was found the <Col N="418" /> State would have to make a contribution which would inevitably help the banks. As I said, we wanted to ensure that the banks would play their part in arriving at a solution but we are now out of office and we have not seen very much progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not the time to deal with other matters which were raised in this debate but I might have an opportunity to deal with them in tomorrow's debate on the Supplementary Estimates. I am glad the House has agreed to this motion without putting it to the vote.  We will be anxiously watching developments during the next few months and we will put down this motion again if the need arises.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Bantry AnCO Training Centre.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Question No. 2 on today's Order Paper read:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Labour if an AnCO training centre will be built in Bantry, County Cork, and the steps already taken in preparation for this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately we got the bad news that no such centre was contemplated or being developed.  Despite the Taoiseach's promises during the election he has left the people of Bantry high and dry.  I find <Col N="419" /> it difficult to give adequate expression to the anger, deep resentment and frustration of the people of Bantry at the blunt refusal of this Government to honour their pledge which was unequivocal, unambiguous and unconditional.  It is shabby, shameless and indifferent to cold shoulder the needs and aspirations of the people of Bantry in this way.</P>
    <P>This close and well-knit community have been dealt many a blow in the past, fracturing and demoralising it in some cases, but they have always come back Phoenix-like out of the ashes.  It is no exaggeration to say that hopes and expectations were high in the town that a constituency which returned two Fine Gael Deputies would not be insensitively ignored by the leader of the Coalition.  A local businessman said to me on the phone this evening that the present leader could not be so destructively city-orientated and biased against the country as to by-pass the problems of a small community like Bantry.  That man now knows the truth.  I told him I will spend the remainder of my life in this Parliament, whether it is a week, a month, six months or the full term, insistingly and vociferously showing the falseness, the shoddiness and mean-spiritedness of the hollow vote-catching promise of Garret FitzGerald to the people of Bantry and the community of west Cork.  I suppose during elections we are all tempted to make promises but I do not think any of us has undertaken the promises like Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  It was a cynical exercise for short-term political gain. It was a complete disregard for the truth and for the integrity we expect from a leader.  If there was any doubt about that commitment, or if the Minister for Labour has any doubt, there is a tape recording available in Bantry on which the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Keeffe, speaking on behalf of the Taoiseach the Sunday night before <Col N="420" /> the election, is saying the Taoiseach would honour his promise to build an AnCO training centre in Bantry.  We then had what can only be described as a circus act for the following three days.  Deputy Sheehan had loud speakers blaring this good news around the town of Bantry and the whole catchment area to, I must admit, a gullible public.  He finished with the statement that &ldquo;You can trust Garret FitzGerald&rdquo;.  They know now that you cannot trust Garret FitzGerald and that he should never be believed because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting the slogan and he was not the Taoiseach.  The end of the slogan was &ldquo;You can trust Garret FitzGerald&rdquo;.  We all know that he cannot be trusted and that the people of Bantry were fools to believe him.  He made that commitment without taking into account any social or economic considerations. He made a snap decision to build the centre and he gave that commitment. The then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, also met the Bantry action group but he refused to treat the electorate in this cavalier fashion.  He promised that if Fianna Fáil were returned to Government a full investigation would be made of the feasibility of such a centre. Because of his honesty we now have two Fine Gael TDs for south-west Cork, and one of them is in this House tonight.  We have in this House through alert and vigorous parliamentary action been able to put the brakes on several madcap Government schemes such as the economic consequences in the west of Ireland as a result of the closing of the Tuam factory and the decision of the Minister for Education to raise the school entry age.</P>

      <P>As there is no sympathy from the Fine Gael benches for this project I should like to appeal to a Minister who is a member of the Labour Party, a group which claims to protect the less privileged and less well-off members of our community.  Surely in a place like Bantry the greatest economic injection would be the establishment of a factory there.  Is the Minister aware that a great incentive to any potential industrialist would be to have an AnCO training centre on his doorstep so that he can recruit highly-trained staff from that centre.  From time to time he would have the expert personnel to give refresher courses to his employees.  Surely the Minister for Labour must see the value of that type of centre in a place like Bantry. <Col N="425" /> He must remember that Bantry is 60 miles from Cork and 90 miles from Tralee.  When Deputy O'Leary was Minister for Labour he stated that an area should not be more than 30 miles from an AnCO training centre.  Surely that justifies the establishment in Bantry of such a centre.</P>
      <P>We have available at least 1,000 children from the Bantry catchment area leaving school annually with either Intermediate certificate or leaving certificate and they could avail themselves of such a training centre.  I cannot calculate how many of those children cannot avail of the opportunities that are presented to them because of the cost of going to Cork, Limerick or Dublin.  In my view the figure represents a high percentage of those leaving school.  They cannot afford to go to those centres to get better training and a guarantee of a better future for themselves.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 527, 528 and 529 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Fish statistics are not available in relation to 200-mile zones but rather are based on ICES, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, zones which are the internationally accepted statistical areas.  The Irish 200-mile zone forms only a portion of ICES zones VI and VII in which there is no constantly resident mackerel stock.  However, the so-called &ldquo;western&rdquo; mackerel stock which is found in ICES zones VI and VII and VIII was, on the basis of data supplied by member states, estimated at 1.7 million tonnes by ICES in 1981.</P>
    <P>As regards control measures so as to manage and conserve our important mackerel fishery and ensure an equitable distribution of the catch among the Irish fleet, I have continued for 1981 the mackerel fishing licensing arrangements which set maximum weekly landings per boat. The overall control of all mackerel fishing within the 200-mile limits of member states of the EEC is, of course, a matter for resolution by the EEC through the adoption of total allowable catches which are devised on the basis of scientific advice.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ban on the use of purse seines in the Celtic Sea for herring fishing and the limitations on fishing activities within 12 miles from baselines applied as conditions for sea fishing licences in respect of purse-seiners, there are no proposals for further limitations on the use of purse seines for herring and mackerel fishing.</P>

      <P>There was a delay in payment in this case after the middle of October as the claim was originally made under his old insurance number.

      <P>The person concerned was born on 18 January 1916 and accordingly will not reach the qualifying age for old age contributory pension until 18 January 1982 when he attains age 66 years.  At that stage he will be qualified for pension based on the aggregation of his British and Irish insurance records which gives him a yearly average of more than the minimum of 20 contributions required to qualify for the pension.  His entitlement to retirement pension, which is payable at age 65 years, has been investigated but, as the yearly average of British and Irish contributions of 21 is less than the minimum of 24 required to qualify, he is not entitled to such pension and he has been notified accordingly.</P>

    <P>The pattern appears to be that nearly half of the trainees obtain permanent employment on completion of their training.</P>
    <P>The programme must also be regarded as successful.  It has two particular advantages: (i) It has enabled AnCO to provide extra training in areas which are remote from training centres.  (ii) It has assisted in the provision of community facilities/amenities.  Since 1979 to date 315 projects have been completed.</P>
    <P>There was a drop in the number of young people trained on the CYT Programme in 1980 as compared with 1979 but it is expected that the figure for the whole of 1981 will be roughly the same as that for 1979.</P>

    <P>In 1980 a system of temporary supplementary premiums was introduced, details as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Arising out of the commitment to further job creation measures in the 1979 national understanding, temporary supplementary premiums were payable in respect of eligible employees recruited in the first half of 1980.  These were funded from the Employment Guarantee Fund, and were intended to act as a further incentive to employers to recruit unemployed persons, particularly the long-term unemployed.  A temporary supplementary premium of £10 per week was payable in respect of all eligible persons recruited and a further temporary supplementary premium of £10 per week in the case of those persons who had been on the live register for at least 26 weeks in the 12 months immediately preceding employment under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Payments from this fund amounted to £234,000 (estimated) in respect of first-time job seekers.  Total payments were £417,472.  The numbers involved are already included in the table.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that 3,600 students in 180 centres in vocational, community and comprehensive schools would participate in the 1979-80 Pre-Employment Programme. This envisaged 20 students per centre per course.  A similar total number of 3,600 students in 109 centres was expected to participate in the 1980-81 Pre-Employment Programme.  Fifteen of the 109 centres operated more than one course.  It is not possible to indicate the actual number of students who participated in the programmes or to give the actual total expenditure involved as details of the number of participants and returns of costs have not yet been received from all vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools concerned.  The estimated total cost is £2,376,300 for the 1979-80 courses and £2,881,805 for the 1980-81 courses referred to.</P>
