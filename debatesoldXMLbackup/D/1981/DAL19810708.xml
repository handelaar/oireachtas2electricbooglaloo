      <P>Mr. Joe McDonnell who was on hunger strike in the Maze prison died shortly after five o'clock this morning.  Our deepest sympathy goes out to his widow whom I met last Friday, and to his family and friends as it must go out to the family and friends of every victim of the continuing violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Mr. McDonnell's death comes at a time when the work of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace in providing the basis for a solution was at an advanced stage.  A solution is more than ever necessary now to bring an end to the sad cycle of suffering and death in the Maze Prison.  It is in the interests of Ireland that the tragedy of Joe McDonnell should not be used on any account or by any interest as an occasion to delay the finding of such a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly said that a solution can be reached through a flexibility of approach which need not sacrifice any principle.  The onus of responsibility for showing this flexibility rests on both sides and there has indeed been evidence over the past few days of a clearer and more widespread recognition of this fact.  But the greater responsibility must, as always, rest on those with the greater power.  We, for our part, have been in <Col N="180" /> touch with the British authorities on many occasions to impress on them the need for an urgent solution.  Indeed, I have been in direct contact with the British Prime Minister on the matter.  The House will understand that I cannot say more at this critical moment.  We will continue to do all we can to help in bringing an end to the dispute.</P>
    <P>While efforts continue to find a solution, before further deaths occur, inside or outside the prison, I would urge that all concerned&mdash;and these number many throughout the length and breadth of Ireland&mdash;should do nothing to damage the interests or the good name of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I also would like to offer our sympathy to the relatives of the latest hunger strike prisoner who died in the Maze Prison, and to say how deeply we regret that the very sincere efforts which were being made by a number of people failed once more to secure a solution to this tragic situation. We must all encourage those who have been engaged in seeking to find a solution to continue their efforts because, as I have repeatedly stated, the tragedy of the hunger strikes has most serious and far-reaching implications for political life in this country as well as the enormous implications it has in terms of human suffering and misery.  I have on many occasions emphasised, in particular to the British Government, the urgent need to find a solution.  I believe that all the elements were present on this occasion which would have enabled a solution to be found and brought forward so that this latest death and others could have been avoided.  I believe that a solution could have been found and should have been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge even now that the situation be not allowed continue any further and that whatever is necessarily involved in finding a solution should be undertaken. I do not know&mdash;because I do not have intimate knowledge of the details &mdash;whether it is possible still to pursue the efforts undertaken over the last week. But if it is possible, I would urge, with all <Col N="181" /> the sincerity at my command, that these efforts be now intensified and that nothing should be allowed stand in the way of a solution.  I believe there is now a serious moral obligation, especially on the British Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest to everybody concerned that a solution must now be brought forward in the interests of the prisoners concerned, in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland and in the interests of the future of Anglo-Irish relations.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was making a few comments on the Bill in connection with CIE.  I congratulated you last night on your appointment, when you were not occupying the Chair.  I want to congratulate you again today and to say that I know we will be given fair play by you. CIE must modernise if they are to survive but I am rather worried that all the modernisation is taking place around Dublin. I am worried about the lack of development in the West of Ireland.  CIE closed down a lot of branch lines had to be closed down because people were not <Col N="183" /> prepared to travel in carriages which were not heated.  If CIE want to close down a branch line all they have to do is to put on a bad service.  As a result of this the roads in the west of the country are unable to carry the amount of road transport using them.  CIE have closed down almost every branch line in that large area.</P>
      <P>It is important that CIE do everything possible to improve the system in Dublin city but they should not forget that Dublin is not Ireland.  The Taoiseach forgot that people exist in the west of Ireland. Last night I complimented the new Minister for Transport on his appointment because he is as near to the west of Ireland as I can get.  The last Minister for Transport and his Minister of State were from the west and they did an excellent job.</P>
      <P>It would be irrelevant to talk about the present bus strike but I believe, as far as all State bodies are concerned, industrial relations are the cause of a lot of trouble. I believe that arrogance on the part of management in dealing with their staff, not consulting them, not letting them know the real situation and not warning them in time about changes which are to take place is the cause of many of those strikes.  We see what happens when a lightning strike occurs over somebody being changed from one job to another. I do not believe this would happen if there was proper consultation between management and staff.  I come from an area where there are quite a number of factories.  I have not had any experience of bad industrial relations because management and staff have consultations with one another.  This is very important. If the public are to have any confidence in a State-sponsored body industrial relations must be improved.  Although the workers may be partly to blame for some of those strikes I believe management are more to blame because they make snap decisions without prior consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is vitally important for management to be in touch with the people on the ground floor to ensure that they are happy in their work.  If there is anything wrong they should find it out in <Col N="184" /> time and snap decisions should not be made without consultation with the workers.  I believe this is what happens in many of the State-sponsored bodies.  I believe, because of the amount of industrial unrest within CIE, that people have lost confidence in that organisation.  If a man who has a lorry decides to take it off the road and deal with CIE, he does not know if a lightning strike will be called and his business will be at a standstill. The management of CIE should consider those things.  If CIE are to continue as a transport company something must be done to stop lightning strikes or the people will have no confidence in that transport organisation.</P>
    <P>It is important for CIE to modernise if they want to provide a good service.  It is important for the people to realise that CIE are not a profit making concern. There is a social side to CIE.  They must provide a service in areas where it is impossible to provide any other service. It is important for CIE to provide a good rail service so that some of the heavy lorries on our roads can cease operating on them and the goods can be sent by rail instead.  I believe that CIE should not close any more branch lines.  I never approved of the closure of the canal from Ballinasloe to Dublin because it could have been useful.  CIE, because of the high price of petrol and oil, have a great chance of becoming competitive against road transport.</P>
    <P>Even though the Bill is a good one &mdash; it was drafted by the previous Minister &mdash; it is no use investing the money it provides if we do not do something about industrial relations.  It will take vastly improved industrial relations in that company to rebuild confidence in our national transport system, and unless we get back that public confidence CIE will not be able to provide the service for which they were founded.  Having said that, we will all agree that CIE must have more money to help them to operate, but I am urging the Minister to do all in his power to get improved industrial relations.  Everybody blames the workers but there are two sides to every story and I have no doubt that there is a bit of arrogance on the part of the management in this company.  I <Col N="185" /> hope the Bill will get through the House quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Through this Bill the House is being asked to provide additional money for CIE which will not be able to function without it.  For that reason, all Deputies will be prepared to support the Bill, at the same time offering criticisms of CIE.  One of the morning newspapers today quoted a comment by a Deputy that CIE are usually the victims of knock-out criticisms, that Deputies have gone out of their way to be highly critical.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record that I was a Member on the occasion when CIE were conceived.  I remember the debate here on the proposal to take over the old Great Southern Railways and to give life to the new company.  The Bill was introduced by the late Seán Lemass and I recall the long determined criticisms offered, particularly by the late Jim Larkin, senior, the Lord have mercy on him.</P>
      <P>I can also recall the solemn promises and undertakings given by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce that the bringing into being of CIE would give the country a cheap and highly efficient transport service of which there would not be any cause for complaints.  He said the new company would provide the people with efficiency at a cheap price.  As the son of an employee of both the GSR and CIE I have always been concerned about the economic and financial mistakes made by CIE.  We all make mistakes in business and privately but we should all learn from our mistakes.  Repeated or recurring mistakes in a public company are not in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The present CIE board, their predecessors and their successors, unless drastic action is taken, will have recurrences of the economic and financial mistakes of the past if the board of management do not begin to learn from past mistakes.  If they do not we will not have an efficient transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of CIE's greatest blunders was the closure of branch line stations and the dismantling of branch lines.  Economically it was wrong to do that, particularly in the west, because such dismantling <Col N="186" /> denied the people the benefits of a public transport service.  It prevented the industrial development of those areas.  It brought about high charges for road freight transport, particularly in areas where there were no roads that could carry the freight fleets.</P>
    <P>When the GSR operated, all connected with the railways were highly dedicated transport people.  When a division occurred here on the 1943 Transport Bill, as an Independent Deputy I had difficulty in making up my mind whether, in the interests of public transport, I should vote for or against the creation of a monopoly.  Sixty-four Deputies voted against it and sixty-four for it.  I voted against and we put the Government out. I have never regretted that decision because as the years rolled by I learned that it was wrong to give a transport monopoly to CIE.</P>
    <P>When the old GSR operated, a number of private bus owners also provided a highly efficient service, far more efficient than the State company do today.  In the midlands, for example, you had the old Slievebloom bus company which provided at the time a very efficient transport service for midland people to and from Dublin.  In the anxiety to create this great transport monopoly all those people were bought off the road, bus companies and those who operated private transport services for passengers or commercial goods.  It was not for the good of the country that private enterprise was put off the map completely.  We may well pay tribute to those who provided a highly efficient transport service, extremely limited during the war and immediately after it, companies such as the Slieve-bloom company operated by the Dooley family in the midlands and numerous others that were gobbled up.  They were told they could no longer enjoy the right to operate public transport.  This was all done in the name of democracy and freedom under which the individual and private enterprise should have the right to operate freely without let or hindrance. This country would have been far better off today and we would have fewer transport difficulties and a much better transport <Col N="187" /> service if the buying up of private enterprise and its dismantling in relation to public transport was not encouraged and developed in the creation of a monopoly.</P>
    <P>Monopolies are dangerous in any country or State because when nobody else can operate a service the general public suffer, the ordinary passenger requiring a public service to get to and from work as well as the industrialist and the businessman who requires public transport to transport merchandise from one area to another either by road or rail. In the event of a breakdown in industrial relations, such as we see at present and have seen in the past, the country can be brought almost to a standstill in regard to transport.  If private enterprise were operating at least some transport would be available to provide the services to which the people are entitled.  A majority of Deputies on all sides must agree that monopolies are wrong and should not be encouraged to the extent of destroying private enterprise which is the life and soul of the country.</P>
    <P>I expressed these very opinions in this House in 1944.  That is a long time ago but those opinions are as relevant today as they were then when CIE was being conceived.  It would be wrong to say that CIE had not fulfilled a very important role &mdash; they have.  They fulfilled the role that Parliament gave them by the creation of a monopoly so that when they were out of business due to strikes or failure in industrial relations it was the country that suffered, the businessman, the factory owner and above all the ordinary citizen who requires public transport service.  Parliament had not the wisdom at the time to see that.  Probably this Parliament has not the wisdom to see it today but which is more important, provision of a public transport service or the creation of boards of directors, giving them powers and responsibilities and handing over to them tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money and saying that it is for a transport service which you must run but we will not interfere with your day to day working.  Did Parliament really consider that it was in the interest <Col N="188" /> of democracy and of those advocating private enterprise that it should hand over taxpayers' money to a number of people who have no responsibility to the House or the country as to how the money is spent on public transport?  This House issued a blank cheque.  We are now providing a further cheque in the spending of which we have no say no more than we have had as to how money was being spent since 1944.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, particularly from the west, appealed here to save the railways. Did their appeals not meet the deaf ears and blind eyes of faceless company directors? How long will Parliament or the people put up with what can be described as a disabled, semi-paralysed public transport service?  This is not the fault of the workers employed therein.  I can remember those who were actively concerned in all branches of the Great Southern Railway and those who enthusiastically took on the new tasks they faced with the birth of CIE.  They included people like the late Mr. J.B. Martin who was responsible for the Dublin United Tramways Company at the time &mdash; I remember calling to see him many times when he had his office in O'Connell Street &mdash; and other early founders of CIE allegedly obtained from the Great Southern Railway.  These were transport experts.  They knew their job and they recruited staff to do a proper job.  They had the interests at heart of the ordinary man and woman who required transport service.</P>
    <P>Today little is thought of the person standing in the bus queue or of the place marked X where once stood a railway station and where once steel railway lines provided public transport.  These rails were torn up in Ireland and sold to Europe, and today trains in Europe are moving over them hourly or half-hourly. Can anyone say this was not a blunder in regard to the public transport service? Yet those responsible for it came to this House and to various Ministers with responsibility for transport services and said, &ldquo;We need money, more money and more and more money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What control had this House over the expenditure of that money?  That money <Col N="189" /> was spent while this House sat idly by and allowed a group of people who did not have any responsibility to the House to bulldoze railway stations out of existence, pull up steel tracks and deprive our people, mainly those living in the west of Ireland, of a rail service.  As a result those people were responsible afterwards for depriving many areas of full participation in industrial development.  I can recall an incident many years ago &mdash; something similar happened within the last six months &mdash; and the details of it should be of interest to the Minister.  I am referring to the discussions which took place when the Tullamore-Banagher branch line was being closed down and when the Birr-Roscrea line was being torn up.  Public meetings were called throughout that area and CIE sent down one of their experts to inform the people of their decision.  The expert sent to the meetings in Birr was the late Mr. Leslie Luke. When he was asked to give CIE's reason for closing down these lines depriving the people of Offaly and North Tipperary of a public transport service they enjoyed under native Governments and under a foreign Government, he said this was being done in the interests of efficiency and to exercise economies on the part of the State.  He went on to promise that there would be a road transport service cheaper than CIE were then providing. It has transpired that some of the road freight charges from Tullamore to Dublin are the same as the transport cost from Shannon Airport to New York.  Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that we have various organisations such as the local chamber of commerce, and business people making the case that the cost of transporting merchandise from the midlands to Dublin is on a par with the cost of transporting merchandise from here to the United States?</P>
    <P>Business people are expected to put up with that situation.  They do not have any say and can only rely on Members of Parliament to air their complaints and do something about them.  It is our duty to do something about this matter because if we fail in our duty we must remember that a day of reckoning will come, perhaps not in this life.  We take on a responsibility <Col N="190" /> at election time to look after the interests of our people and surely we will have to give an account of our stewardship if we fail in that regard.  Public representatives on all sides have failed to provide a proper, efficient and cheap transport system as was promised in this House by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce on the birth of CIE.  People like the late Mr. Luke were let loose around the country to dismantle the services then in existence.  The scripts they were given to read out at meetings have turned out to be false silence our people.</P>
    <P>At one of the meetings I have referred to, which considered the CIE depot in Birr, it was clearly demonstrated to us that not alone would the depot be left in Birr as compensation for the dismantling of the Birr-Roscrea line but it would be developed, the staff would be increased and it would prove a greater asset to the town.  We were told it would be a greater business asset than the railway from Birr to Roscrea, which was the only rail link to Dublin.  How long did Mr. Luke's pledge and promise last?  It lasted until recently when the transport depot was built in Athlone and another built in Thurles.  In order to justify the depots at Athlone and Thurles CIE turned their attention to cutting down the services at Birr and held a threat over its future although that was part of an undertaking given as a gob-stopper, as a pacifier, as a silencer to the people of Birr some years ago.  I am the only Member living who was present at those negotiations and I was happy in the past six months to be able to place those facts before CIE officials, who did not deny them.  They gave an undertaking that for the time being nothing would happen in relation to the Birr depot but they have not fulfilled their promise to expand, extend and take on more workers at the Birr depot.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been wiser to develop an existing depot rather than concentrating on the building of new depots at the expense of what was already in existence?  I should like to warn the Minister for Transport and Power, as I have warned his predecessors &mdash; I hope <Col N="191" /> this warning carries on to future Ministers in this post &mdash; that any attempt to close down the CIE depot in Birr will be resisted having regard to the history of that depot and the fact that the people in that area were cheated out of their railway station and cheated out of a transport service they enjoyed when the Birr-Roscrea line was in operation.  We will also resist it because they brought up and put out of business a transport service provided by the Slieve Bloom Bus Company thus depriving the midlands completely of a proper transport service they had enjoyed down the years.  If the Minister reads the history of CIE he will see that promises and pledges were broken when the monopoly was first created.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to those involved in CIE whose fathers and grandfathers also worked in CIE in the forties and fifties and who were associated with the Great Southern Railway.  They were men who were only interested in doing a job well.  They were not interested in limiting hours.  They were not interested in anything but serving the country and the people and providing this country with a good service. They did an excellent job.  They were not too well treated by CIE either because when it was time for them to retire they were thrown on to the retirement scrap heap with what can be described as paltry pensions.  How many times did I speak in this House about the manner in which CIE were squandering tens of thousands of pounds worth of taxpayers' money without consultation? Yet the older workers, those who were being retired, were given paltry gratuities and pensions which amounted to half-pence in comparison to the pounds of today.  Ireland never experienced anything like the manner in which the old CIE workers were treated by CIE in relation to pensions.  Where was this House to provide the money to give them their pensions at the end of the day? There were always excuses.  There were always limits and prohibitions in relation to the CIE worker who gave his life in service and dedication to CIE.  He deserved much better that the scale of pensions which was meted out to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> I have great admiration and great respect for railway workers and CIE workers.  But again there is a great danger. The gap is widening between the board of directors and the ordinary workers on the tracks, repairing the bridges and standing at the stations and on the buses.  How are we going to close this gap?  The industrial relations in CIE over the years have been disastrous.  What has been done about it?  Very little, if anything. I hope that during the period of office of the present Government an effort will be made to bridge the gap between the board of directors and the workers, the bus drivers, engine drivers, railway guards, station masters, cleaners, and porters.  CIE could be a better employer if there was a better degree of understanding and reason on the part of the directors towards the less fortunate people who are doing all the work and trying to keep things moving while CIE divorce themselves from the real facts.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin city, Waterford and elsewhere are going to have to put up with a continuance of this disorder within the company until the company are brought to realise that they have a responsibility towards their workers. Above all they must realise that they have a responsibility to the public to provide a service as this House has authorised them to do.  The directors of CIE are ignoring their responsibility to provide, as the late Deputy Lemass said, highly efficient and cheap transport.  I recall questioning the late Deputy Lemass in this House when CIE were initiated.  All he could see was a bright and pleasant future for everyone connected with CIE, particularly the country, the economy and the public.  The public have suffered and are suffering.  Private enterprise is gone in relation to transport and there appears to be complete chaos and disorder in relation to the administration of the company.</P>
    <P>How many members of the public do we hear frequently complaining of the dirt in railway carriages and comparing them to trains on the Continent?  Let anyone travel on the Brussels-Strasbourg train via Luxembourg &mdash; I am sure the Ceann Comhairle has travelled on that <Col N="193" /> train &mdash; and nobody could deny that it is highly efficient and spotlessly clean. Have CIE completely thrown in the towel and given up the ghost in so far as keeping trains and buses clean is concerned? Have they cut down on the staff of cleaners? There are 130,000 unemployed people in Ireland.  If we are going to give money to CIE we want to know how it is going to be spent.  Why do they not increase the cleaning staff to give the people hygienic and clean transport on rail and road.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the extent of the road freight section of CIE, nor am I happy with the present situation regarding railway carriages.  Vast numbers of new carriages are needed which can and should be manufactured here to provide work for those who need it.  I hope and trust that there will never be any question of CIE being allowed to purchase wagons, coaches or railway carriages unless they are built, in so far as is humanly possible, by Irish labour in our own country.  There is little use in our passing money to CIE to allow them to make purchases from abroad.  That keeps overseas workers, who have no allegiance to this country and care nothing about it, in employment while our own people are walking around in need of and searching for work.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will arrange an early meeting with the board of CIE who seem to have forgotten that there are people here.  Parliament also fails to remember that there are people in the country.  We speak of companies, State and semi-State, and we speak of wealth and riches and property and values.  But all those pale into insignificance in comparison with the importance of the individual, the man and woman, the boy and girl, living here who are entitled to the services which CIE do not seem to be capable of providing.  If CIE cannot provide the services, if they cannot hold the workers and pay them and if they cannot bridge the gap between workers and the boardroom at Kingsbridge, surely we have the right to say that must end.  We have the right to insist on a return to sanity and common sense and to ensure that a transport service is available for <Col N="194" /> the people.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect the directors of CIE to do a somersault with regard to their policies unless this House, through the Minister, puts certain facts before them. Many of these people are living in cloud-cuckoo land; they have never experienced the hardship of paying very high freight charges, they have never had to wait in all kinds of weather without the benefit of shelter for bus and train services that are not punctual.  With regard to the train service, the carriages and coaches are relics of the last century and they are not even kept clean.  It appears to be the policy of CIE to save money at the expense of the ordinary people of the country.  However, the people are asked to put their hands in their pockets and pay increased transport charges to CIE. The taxpayer is asked to pour money into the coffers of CIE irrespective of whether there will be any return for that money.</P>
    <P>This cannot continue if there is not an efficient service available for the people. Such a service is not available at the moment and it is unlikely to become available unless drastic changes are made in the boardroom at Kingsbridge.  One of the tasks of the Minister in that connection is to get rid of the nonsense and the false economies adopted by the CIE boardroom.  That must be replaced by common sense, intelligence and some consideration for the public.  In particular, the industrial sector must be considered. We are told frequently that CIE lose money on their services.  Of course they do when they have a road service and a rail service competing with each other.  It is robbing Peter to pay Paul but both Peter and Paul have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>The backbone of any country is its transport service.  We have got only a skeleton service and what a maimed, poor service it is.  I should like Members of this House to show concern about this problem.  We should consider what are the basics of a real transport service.  The problems that exist have been cloaked over.  The files of complaints at Kingsbridge have been put away&mdash;they are covered in dust and cobwebs.  It is about time something was done to provide the country with an efficient transport service. <Col N="195" /> In 1943 or 1944 we were promised in good faith that such a service would be provided.  However, faith without good works is useless.  The faith was there but the works did not materialise.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bring together the directors of CIE and have serious consultations about the administration of the transport services.  I hope he will consult with all interests involved with regard to private transport.  It should be put on the line to CIE that if they cannot provide a service private transport should be allowed to give the people the service they need.  That is a task the Minister should undertake and he should use the opportunity afforded him by this Bill to do something about the matter.  He should also consult with the trade unions who represent the workers and he should take the steps necessary to bridge the gap between workers and management.  That must be done if we are to have a healthy and sound transport service.</P>
    <P>In some areas of the country CIE stupidly dismantled services and did not replace them.  If private enterprise is prepared to take on that task they should be encouraged to do so.  In addition, there should be a full investigation into road freight charges which are completely out of line.  More people would avail of CIE services if they could get value for money. All CIE are concerned with are charges and raking in money.  It would be the best transport service in Europe if they gave the same thought to providing road and rail services as they give to filling the coffers and tackling the ledgers in the boardroom at Kingsbrige.  It is time for a change in public transport and that the man in the street was considered instead of letting him walk or thumb lifts.</P>
    <P>It would not be right to compare the record of Great Southern Railways with that of CIE.  We are living in a different time and age.  However, they gave a better service.  It would be far better to have a reasonable charge for carrying freight on the railway lines rather than by road. In most cases the roads are incapable of carrying heavy merchandise.  Were there ever consultations between Ministers of Transport s to how this might be done? <Col N="196" /> Have we the organisation or ability to handle it?  Our roads are becoming like blasted country lanes.  No road here could compare with any in Europe.  Yet Eurotrucks with all their capacity travel on our roads.</P>
    <P>What did we get from the EEC to develop transport services?  What case was made to provide money for a highly efficient transport service here?  We may have volumes of reports and typed memorandum but I doubt if we will get much money to help us give the people an efficient transport service.  Can anyone deny that the people are entitled to such a service?  They have been cheated out of it and denied it.  CIE blindfoldedly decided to discontinue and dismantle services where they existed.  I appeal to the Minister to take a new look at the record of CIE and if necessary introduce legislation to ensure that people get the road and rail service for which they have paid dearly.  They are not getting value for money.</P>
    <P>I make these points for the record having viewed with a certain amount of grave apprehension the activities of CIE in the past.  Can we hope in 1981 that some steps will be taken either by private enterprise or CIE to give value and service to the public?  Are we satisfied that the money that will be given to CIE will be put to good economic use or will it go down the drain as all the moneys that have been voted to CIE have since 1943? Some time somebody must say &ldquo;halt&rdquo;. What we want is value, service, speed and efficiency.  The businessman can no longer wait.  Our roads are overcrowded. We must look at methods of transport. The position in Dublin is chaotic.  We must have a look at the transport system from Bray to Balbriggan or Skerries.  We must look at the central depots in Dublin. We must have a look at how, where, why and how much CIE have spent in rural Ireland.  Then we must put that side by side with the destruction they carried out by closing branch lines.  If such lines were in existence today they could be in operation. Let us say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; and endeavour to forget the blunders and mistakes of the past.  Let the House seriously consider an <Col N="197" /> entirely new look at transport here where we lack cheapness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to be anything but courteous to CIE.  Those who are doing business with them are entitled to a high degree of courtesy.  Perhaps it exists but it is no harm to ask that it be extended in order to encourage business, that they express appreciation for current business and try to restore lost business.  There are many items of general administration which need serious thought.  I hope the House will be given an opportunity at a later stage to have further and fuller discussions in which all Members of the House can participate fully.  Every Deputy must agree that an efficient transport service is desirable for his constituents and for the people in general.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few brief comments on this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his new office.  Listening to his party colleague relating 40 years of history of our transport system, one understands the complexities and problems facing the Minister. Some time ago people did not realise the importance of our transport system in the development of our industry.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why mistakes were made.  It was interesting and educational to listen to the comments made by a Deputy who has been in this House for so long.</P>
      <P>When the McKinsey Report has been examined I am sure we will have an opportunity to debate it.  As a city Deputy I do not wish to say anything which would be unhelpful to the Minister, but I hope he will find a speedy solution to the present strike.  We are lucky in having fine weather, but that may not last.  I am sure the Minister is doing his best but the quicker a solution is found the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE require money for the Howth-Bray electric service, for the purchase of mainline carriages, for the renewal of the urban and provincial bus fleet and for the provision of commuter rail services.  The former Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and his officials put a great deal of effort into the drafting of this Bill.  The Howth-Bray service will be of tremendous advantage to this city.  It has been said that we may <Col N="198" /> be forgetting other parts of the country, but I do not think we will ever be allowed to do that.  The figures speak for themselves. Abour 35,000 people travel daily on the mainline service within this city. It has been suggested that that figure will rise to 80,000 in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I have a personal interest in this.  With electrification there is less noise and less pollution.  Some people have suggested that all problems can be solved by providing more roads and bypasses.  I dispute that.  I said that in the House before and at meetings of Dublin Corporation.  This Bill does away with the myth that roadways are the solution.  They are not the solution.  Better railway services and better traffic regulations will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Because of our oil dependence providing motorways affects our national debt. They wreck the environment and they cost us more in the long run.  In Germany they realised the folly of that policy and abandoned carriageways when they were half built.  I am very pleased to see the Bombardier company in operation and the Inchicore Works.  They create employment and give satisfaction to CIE management and workers because of the fact that equipment is being provided in our own country.  In a number of years because of inflation £20 million has been swallowed up.  This is also happening in other areas.  If more Irish companies were involved perhaps we could have more control over inflation.  Inflation eats into contracts astronomically, and money which is badly needed for other services is swallowed up in the interval between the negotiation of a contract and the completion of the work.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the provision of a computer rail service between Maynooth and Connolly station.  I want to know what the intermediate stations will be and I am particularly concerned about the Drumcondra station.  I should like the Minister to put on record what those intermediate points will be.</P>
    <P>The importance of the role CIE have to play and the importance of our transport system have been well aired in this House since I came here in 1977.  We all have a great responsibility to assist people <Col N="199" /> to get into work and home again, and to realise the importance of transport in relation to our industries in a growing economy like ours.  The necessary money must be provided.  The previous speaker mentioned the day-to-day expenditure by CIE.  We all have reservations about how they spend money.  In the McKinsey Report totally conflicting views were held by various interested parties.  It would be of considerable benefit if conclusions were reached on that report and if certain points of policy in relation to CIE's future were clarified once and for all.  There are many criticisms of CIE, some justified and some not justified.  As early as possible we should have a debate in this House to clarify the future role of CIE and where exactly the transport of the country is going.</P>
    <P>As a last point, I wish the Minister well.  His is a difficult Department, one of the most senior in the Cabinet and may have been ignored as such sometimes in previous Governments.  However, the last Government and this Government regard it as being of vital importance to all the people in the country.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the provision of this Supplementary Estimate for some £11 million of which £9 million is being allocated to CIE.  First, I should like to congratulate our new Minister for Transport, Deputy Cooney, and to wish him boundless success in all that he undertakes in his new role.  His return to this House has met with unanimous approval throughout this country because he is recognised as a man of shining integrity, high principle, great ability and outstanding courage.  It is a matter of personal gratification to me to see him returned to this House and occupying his new role as Minister for Transport and to know that his services are still available to us here and to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary concern in intervening in this debate is to bring to the notice of the Minister the grave concern of my constituents in South Tipperary about the worsening public transport service as it affects them at present in respect of rail transport <Col N="200" /> but primarily in respect of CIE bus transport.  It seems that under a new time schedule some of the CIE buses which operate on the main roads in South Tipperary, especially from Limerick <i>via</i> Tipperary to Cahir, Clonmel and Waterford, are no longer stopping at the recognised traditional stopping points as in the past. This has caused great hardship to large numbers of people especially in the rural parts of my constituency.  The Minister and the House will appreciate the shock and dismay which attends groups of people waiting at crossroads for some considerable time, perhaps in inclement weather, to find that the public transport bus whizzes past them and leaves them standing and denies the opportunity of doing their business in respect of that day.  Much of the business&mdash;indeed, all of the business&mdash;would be of importance and much would be of great urgency, and it seems to be intrinsically wrong that our bus services, especially the service known as the Expressway service, should pass by people in rural Ireland in this disdainful manner.  On that basis I submit that it is no longer a public transport service.  It affects people going shopping and on errands, and also to my knowledge people on more urgent and important business who are seeking transport to Waterford or to Rosslare to go abroad. I am asking the Minister to have a very close look at this situation as a matter of urgency and to see to it that my constituents are not denied public transport, that the CIE bus will stop at all reasonable recognised stopping points such as crossroads, villages and the like, and that any person who is in need of transport will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Another matter has concerned me for some considerable time and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, will have been aware of my concern in this regard also.  It is the failure of the powers that be to provide transport for all those persons who are in receipt of free travel vouchers from the Department of Social Welfare.  To my personal knowledge many of my constituents, old people, disabled, widowed and the like, although in receipt of free travel vouchers and entitled to free travel, are denied any public <Col N="201" /> transport in respect of many roads in my constituency.  Invariably this has come about as a result of the unwillingness or the inability of the private operators to continue this service for the people with free passes.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister does not have any direct control over the operators of private transport but he will, I am sure, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, realise that it is unjust and wrong that we have so many people who are entitled to free travel and are denied it because of the inability of private operators to provide a service.  It may well be that these private operators have good grounds for declining to continue these services.  It has been alleged that they have not been paid sufficient by CIE, or the appropriate Department, for this purpose or that moneys due to them were difficult to secure and were paid only intermittently and usually after long, protracted negotiations. This is not good enough, but in the situation where private operators are unable or unwilling to provide this essential service for all those in receipt of free travel.  I submit that there is a bounden obligation on the Minister to come to the aid of those people and to provide an alternative.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am pleading on these main grounds: the inadequacy of the existing bus transport service, the failure of buses to stop as required, the rush through from town to town, the disappointment meted out to so many people and the resulting disruption of their business activities and affairs which is very serious.  I would hope that we will have a resolution of that problem.  I am loath to criticise CIE to any great extent because it must be understood clearly that this State body have been left in a pauperised condition for some years past under the previous Fianna Fáil regime.  It is evident that the first act of our new Minister, Deputy Cooney, was to bring in here a Supplementary Estimate for some £11 million with £9 million of it for CIE to try to reactivate this company.  It is no wonder that we have seen a worsening situation in respect of the services which CIE provide.  We see this refusal <Col N="202" /> on the part of the Government to provide it with essential funds in the refusal in the first instance of the previous Minister, Deputy Reynolds, to provide supplementary funds of this kind long ago.  On the other hand there was the refusal of the previous Government to allow CIE to increase charges in order to place themselves in a reasonably solvent position. In these circumstances it is understandable that the company's activities would virtually grind to a halt and that we would all witness this serious deterioration which has taken place in CIE.  There is a worsening of rail transport and a deterioration in the appearance of our railway stations, which are now becoming places of dereliction and ruin.  Many of them are eyesores.  There is a failure to maintain rolling stock and a worsening of rail services, public bus services and school bus services.  All these things have been adversely affected in recent times.  It all comes back to the question of providing the necessary moneys to CIE to do the job.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the failure of CIE, especially in respect of their policy in the past of tearing up our rail lines and disrupting our traditional railway services. The uprooting of the railway lines in very many areas was a retrograde step. In my constituency there are abandoned railway stations and sections of rail line which will be there for ever as monuments to the stupidity of CIE and their advisers.  The bringing in of these so-called experts, McKinsey and the like, and the acceptance of their recommendations for efficiency and economy was a most unwise act.  These specialists from abroad have no real feeling for the Irish people; their roots are not here.  They act ruthlessly in the interests of efficiency. However, in the matter of a public transport service, while it may seem economically and financially wise to do certain things, such as the uprooting of miles of railway track, the abandonment of railway stations and so on, they are socially unjustifiable.  Untold damage was done and we have monuments to the ignorance and stupidity of these experts in the abandonment of our railway stations at a time when our roads are becoming incapable <Col N="203" /> of containing the growing volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that he has a duty to divert in so far as he can more and more of the heavy vehicular traffic and the goods which it carries to our railway system and thereby ease the bottlenecks in our cities, towns and villages. Those of us in public life are only too well aware of the untold damage and astronomical costs involved for our local authorities in trying to maintain our roads and footpaths as a direct result of the colossal damage being done to these roads by heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>I am loath to enter the area of management and labour relations and I will make only a few comments on the subject. Some people are calling for draconian legislation to deal with the growing incidence of disputes, especially in respect of our State bodies.  Those of us who have been in the House long enough realise that you cannot legislate to keep people at work.  Neither can you legislate to prevent people from coming out of work if they feel the reasons are grave and compelling enough to do so.  At the same time we all have a duty to admonish people to show restraint and responsibility and not to take precipitate strike action until all other means of conciliation and arbitration have been gone through.  I wish the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Labour, well in their efforts to bring this dispute to a speedy and satisfactory end.  We are all acutely aware of the hardships and sufferings of the people who depend on public transport.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give an indication that the public transport service in my county will improve for the general public who want to avail of it and for all those people in receipt of free travel who are denied it on certain important routes at present.  I hope he will find a <i>via media</i> between the obligations of the private transport operator and the State-sponsored operator to ensure that a service will be given to these people who are denied it at present.  I have a strong feeling that, if the private operators were properly compensated for their work and <Col N="204" /> promptly paid, all might be well.  I am sure they have good grounds for the curtailment in one instance and the withdrawal in many instances of these services. They are in the business of making money.  They cannot be expected to operate at a loss.  I would ask the Minister to call these private operators in to see what their grievances are and what has caused them to withdraw service to the public, especially to our social welfare beneficiaries who are in receipt of free travel and are now denied this service.  I believe he will find these people to be co-operative and understanding of their obligations to the public and that a satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will do much to reactivate our railways.  The deterioration we have seen is to be greatly deplored.</P>
    <P>A drive in one of our trains at present, while the beauty of our countryside still happily remains the same, shows scenes at our various station houses of doom and gloom, delapidation and ruin.  This must have a very bad effect on all working there and must create dispondency amongst employees.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to support the expenditure of this money.  It will give new heart and hope to CIE to do what requires to be done.  It will also give great hope to the many thousands of workers attached to CIE, whose futures were blighted in recent times, by being threatened with redundancy and dismissal because of the running down of operations, due to lack of proper funding.  I congratulate the Minister for his courage and initiative in bringing in this Bill.  I am sure that he will have regard to the wishes of the Members of this House who value highly the service which CIE, a State body, should provide for our people.  We want to see them provide that service and it is right and proper that they be given the money and the tools to do the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election. I am sure that he will prove, with the passing of time, to be a very popular choice.  I also congratulate the Minister <Col N="205" /> for Transport and Telecommunications on his election to that onerous post.</P>
      <P>Our public transport is in a mess&mdash;that goes without saying.  The tone of the debate so far has indicated that Members of this House feel this to be the case.  In particular, I was struck by the contributions of two senior Members, Deputies Callanan and Flanagan, who brought a sense of reality to the present chronic situation.</P>
      <P>The public are not too demanding. They will put up with a reasonable service but are not at present receiving such a service.  They ask that the service be efficient, consistent and functional.  At the moment it is none of those things.  They are entitled to ask why they are not getting value for money.  As I see it, there are three vested interests involved in our public transport&mdash;first, the people who are dependent on public transport to travel about, whether it be to their homes or their places of work or business; second, the taxpayer, whose lot it is to subvent the losses incurred by the State-sponsored bodies involved in teansport and, third, the employees; in particular, we are referring today to CIE and their employees.  None of those three groups is happy with the present situation.  The public are of the opinion that they are not getting a reasonable service; the tax-payer certainly does not feel that he is getting value for money and the CIE employees, undoubtedly, are suffering a very great sense of frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather difficult to define the exact reasons for the problems which confront these three sectors.  At least, an attempt should be made to find the causes for the problems.  So often, we hear unqualified criticism of CIE in its activities and of its employees.  We should be a good deal more constructive.  Like Deputy Flanagan, I feel it is a pity that more Members have not expressed their views.  The remarks which Deputy Callanan made are largely correct.  He diagnosed the major problem within CIE as being one of poor management &mdash; in particular, poor management at the very top.  The present management in this major State company would not to tolerated in private industry.  We should look to that <Col N="206" /> area, if we want to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>The moneys being voted today are badly needed.  This raises the question of another deficiency within this organisation, a deficiency which has been present for thirty or thirty-five years.  That is vast under-investment in rolling stock.  Pre vious speakers have quite correctly referred to the state of railway carriages and buses.  Their condition in many cases is scandalous and is due to some not having been replaced for as many as thirty or thirty-five years.  It came to light in a debate here last year that over half the railway carriages for passenger services at present in use with CIE are over 20 years old.  Some of the best buses in operation, mechanically speaking, are also in excess of 20 years old.  Mechanically they are good but, obviously, they are not quite up to standard in other aspects.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the more recent addition to CIE's bus fleet, the Van Hool McArdle edition, has not been a success and has given rise to endless problems for the staff who must use the vehicles.  I hope that the Bombardier buses referred to in this Bill, which will be built at Shannon, will prove more trouble-free and give a better period of service.  CIE must be thoroughly reorganised and restructured from top to bottom.  If ever there is a question of doing anything with CIE, we are immediately met with opposition from all sectors within the company, from the very top down.  There should not be that resistance to change.  If our public transport system is to improve, we must have change and innovation.  Such resistance to change is not reasonable or correct. If we do not have this badly needed reorganisation, the position can only go from bad to worse.</P>
    <P>A more common sense approach should be adopted towards restructuring our whole public transport system.  Our problem stem from the fact that we never had a national transport policy.  It has always been a nitsy-bitsy affair, starting off in the twenties, into the thirties and followed up in the mid-forties by the setting up of CIE.  Even with the setting up of CIE, we never had a national transport policy.  It is very hard to operate a <Col N="207" /> national transport system without one. There is an urgent need for all concerned, from the lowest to the highest grade in CIE and, in particular, with the involvement of the Minister for Transport, to see that we have a co-ordinated and logical system.</P>
    <P>Our public transport is at the stage where it needs to be up-graded.  Successive Governments, in an attempt to effect economies, have merely reduced, withdrawn or eliminated services.  The closure of railway lines, with withdrawal of bus services, the reduction of staff have been the only remedies and have not really been remedies or economies at all.  They have been counter-productive.  In essence, over the past ten years the staff within CIE have been reduced by something like 6,000</P>
    <P>But still losses continue to spiral even taking inflation into consideration.  The policy of reducing staff and services is not the solution.  The public are prepared to use public transport on an ever-increasing scale but what is provided does not encourage them to use it.  Deputy Flanagan put his finger on it when he said that we only have a skeleton transport system and that that was why the public will not avail of it.  One can get from A to B but not from C to D because the service are not sufficient.  We need a restructured co-ordinated service.  We should employ more people in CIE.  There is no logical reason for resistence to change or to reorganisation when it can be proved that it will lead to a better service and increased numbers in employment.  I base my argument on the fact that the number of people using the mainline rail service between 1970 and 1980 doubled.  That illustrates the goodwill of the public in using the transport system as dilapidated as it is.  That occurred in a period when the number of private motor cars at least doubled.  The former Minister, Deputy Reynolds, did an excellent job in his capacity as Minister but he gave as one of the reasons for the decline in CIE's fortunes the fact that there were more private motor cars on the road.  Although the number of motor cars more than doubled in those 10 years the number of <Col N="208" /> people using mainline rail services also doubled although the standard of railway carriages had steadily deteriorated.  One could count on one hand the number of new carriages bought during the last ten years.</P>
    <P>We can see why CIE are losing money on the Dublin city bus services.  Between 1960 and 1980 there was a drop of almost 50 per cent, perhaps more, in the number of people using the Dublin city bus services and a hugh loss was incurred.  Prior to 1970 the bus services were a profit making venture.  Last year's figure shows that something in the region of £16 million were lost on this service.  That is a lot of money to lose on a bus service in a thickly populated centre.  The reason for this is traffic chaos.  I pay tribute to the two former Ministers for Transport, Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Reynolds, for their implementation of the findings in the Transport Consultative Commission's Report.  That was one of the better projects to come from the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto which agreed to set up this commission to specifically examine the problems of Dublin traffic and transport in general.  The first report which came out last year dealt with Dublin and Dublin city.  We have not seen the benefits of that report as yet but they will be seen within the coming months and years.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dublin city bus services what we need most is bus lanes.  They have been implemented successfully on a fairly small scale to date.  I would like to see an elaboration of that system.  The traffic regulations in the city will also have to be seriously enforced.  Due to the Commission's report and the subsequent setting up of the task force a large number of extra traffic wardens have been recruited and more members of the Garda Síochána have been put on traffic duties.  That is a move in the right direction. We must cure the traffic congestion in Dublin if we are to make any headway in making the Dublin city bus services viable.  Both Deputy Faulkner and Deputy Reynolds deserve our compliments on that move.</P>
    <P>The measures taken are not the full answer.  A solution to the problem in CIE would be to localise the managements of <Col N="209" /> the various serctions of that company. The Dublin bus services should be run by an autonomous bus authority.  We certainly need a separate body to run this service.  The bus services in Cork could also by run by a separate body.  Bus services are completely different from all the rail services and should be run separately. Cork city bus services last year lost about three million pounds and a city of 150,000 people should be able to keep a viable bus service in operation.  The railways might benefit from a specialised team to manage them in conjunction with road freight.  The railways and road freight work in harmony and compliment one another.  That is as it should be and a separate management should look after that sector.  The provincial buses should also be looked after separately.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Callanan and Deputy Flanagan argued that competition from the private sector is good and there is a lot to be said for that argument.  Competition is the life of trade.  If private enterprise can provide a bus service of a high standard at a reduced rate, let us have it.  So far, the only solution offered in this House to CIE's problems is to reduce the service or employment or else to increase fares.  We are told today that there is a projected increase of 23 per cent in fares which should have been granted months ago but was not because of the election.  If somebody else can do the job as well as CIE and we do not have to suffer that increase, they should be allowed to provide the service under strict control.  The State bodies will say that these people are cowboys who will cream off the best routes.  That need not be so.  The Department of Transport are there to see that people operate in a proper manner.  If they do not do so their licences can be withdrawn overnight.</P>
    <P>Everybody is entitled to compete in an open market in a free society and, as Deputy Flanagan has said, there are too many monopoly situations here.  We need competition if we are to stimulate the economy and reduce losses.  People should not be given a blank cheque and a tap on the back and told not to increase losses next year.  That should not be the limit of the reprimand.  Losses are <Col N="210" /> increasing out of all proportion.  We are all very much aware that CIE provide a social service and we do not expect them to make a profit but there is a limit to the losses we can sustain.  If such losses were reduced it is possible that we could give old age pensioners or social welfare recipients a larger allowance and taxpayers would have to pay less.  It is our duty to see that losses are reduced.  Objections to competition are frivolous when one considers that money saved could be used to good effect elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is a willingness among the public to use public transport if they are provided with a proper service.  Who wants to spend £2 on a gallon of petrol to do a journey which would cost a fraction of that sum on public transport?  There is no comparison between the cost of coming to Dublin by train from Cork or Waterford and the cost of the journey by private car.  The public will gladly avail of these facilities.</P>
    <P>Cork is one of the luckier centres in that there is no mention in the McKinsey Report of its service being cut off.  However, there is an insinuation in that report that train services from Dublin to the smaller centres will be chopped.  Such smaller centres probably include Waterford, Sligo, Galway and possibly Limerick. We would probably end up with a railway line from Dublin to Cork and Belfast if the McKinsey Report were implemented.  That is not acceptable. The people are prepared to bear the cost of a railway system which will lose a certain amount of money.  It is accepted that railway system throughout the world are loss makers but they are a social amenity and a counter to pollution.  Their retention is absolutely necessary in the light of ever-increasing oil costs.  I would utterly reject the implementation of that section of the McKinsey Report advocating the closure of many of our railway lines.  The closure of a number of such lines during the fifties and sixties was an unmitigated disaster, as was the decision to sell the ground.  The track and the right of way should have been retained for future contingencies such as the hugh increase in the cost of oil.</P>
    <P>The question of diverting more freight <Col N="211" /> to the railways should be examined since it is the logical way to save fuel.  The closure of railway lines and the selling off of property is not the solution and I take issue with the suggestion made by Deputy Flynn that CIE should examine their resources with a view to selling some of them in order to raise revenue.  CIE have sold too much of their property, probably at less than market value.  I agree with Deputy Flynn's statement that CIE and the Department of Transport should carry out a survey of property on hand. Members of this House should be made aware of this so that we are in a position to debate it.</P>

      <P>It would help if we knew what the resources of CIE are.  I suspect they do not even know themselves.  This goes back to the question of management. We should not tolerate a situation where a company which is incurring an annual deficit of close on £100 million and which has a turnover of several hundred million pounds should be run by a board who meet once a month and whose chariman acts in a part-time capacity. That this should be the case difies understanding.  The part-time chairman has other business interests and acts in his capacity as chariman of CIE for a limited number of days per week.  The gentleman concerned is an excellent individual but I object to the terms of his employment.  It is beyond my comprehension that any Minister or State body should make such an appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here the annual report of CIE for 1978.  There are seven members of the board and I have never heard of six of them.  They are running the company which is incurring a deficit of £100 million <Col N="212" /> a year.  They come from all walks of life and perhaps some of them are political appointments.</P>

      <P>The Chair will give me credit for a little discretion.  It is incomprehensible that we should tolerate a situation where the company which is the largest employer in the country has a board who meet once a month, many of whose members may not have great experience of transport.  A company of that nature should have a highly professional staff especially at the higher levels. I would expect the board to consist of executives with perhaps one or two nominees representing other interests in transport.  All of them should be employed full time.  Many of our present problems stem from the fact that CIE are highly unprofessional at the top, and management must suffer as a result.</P>
      <P>We have always been committed to the retention of the railway system as it is. We reject anything in the McKinsey Report which advocates the discontinuance of certain rail services.  I have heard only six or seven speeches on this Bill, but the only person I heard referring to that report was Deputy Ahern.  I would like to know if, at an early date, we could have a discussion on that report, because the sooner we get rid of it the better.  It is doing a lot of damage to the morale of CIE workers.  We did not have a decision on the 1970 McKinsey Report.  It was put on the shelf and left there and I am afraid the present McKinsey Report is getting the same treatment.  I note Deputy Reynolds is smiling, but it must be admitted that the McKinsey Report came out six months ago but was not debated in this House.  The Government of the day told us they were allowing a public discussion, but that was because they did not want to have to make any decisions.</P>

      <P>It is time it was discussed in this Parliament because it is here the decisions will have to be made.  I am not saying the McKinsey Report should be thrown out in its entirety.  It cost over £600,000 but in my view any Member of this House could have written it for nothing. From their speeches it appears that Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Callanan have more commonsense than what appeared in the 12 reports which issued over the last nine or ten years.  I do not believe any action has been taken on the recommendations in any of those reports, except for the minor initiatives taken as a result of the Transport Consultative Commission's report brought out last year.  We have had 12 major reports on public transport but no solutions or initiatives taken on suggestions made in those reports.  We are still in a state of limbo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A debate in this House on the McKinsey Report would be healthy.  We will have to face up to the enormous losses, which are increasing year after year, in the public transport sector.  CIE is like a monster which is being fed out of public funds and is out of control.  The public are not willing to accept that situation.  If there are cutbacks because of the state of the economy, the public are entitled to know why CIE cannot work on a leaner budget.  CIE are losing £250,000 a day, and I hate to think what they are losing during this strike.  That daily loss fits in with the estimate we arrived at in this Dáil some months ago.  Last year the loss was £73 million, the previous year it was <Col N="214" /> £57 million and this year it will obviously be in excess of £90 million.  This is an enormous amount of money to lose.  We know CIE provide a social service, but it is not unlimited.  It is frightening to think that these losses will continue to increase year after year.  We will have to take drastic decisions and the sooner the better. I am not suggesting that these drastic decisions should include reducing services but I think heavy investment is the better alternative.</P>
    <P>Money is provided for three things in this Bill.  First is the financing of the rapid rail system between Howth and Bray&mdash;the building of that line and the provision of carriages, which unfortunately have to be purchased abroad.  Second is the provision of money for mainline passenger coaches.  We are all delighted to learn that these coaches will be built at the Inchicore works by CIE workers.  This is what we have been asking for for the past four years.  Third, money is being provided for the building of buses at Shannon.  This is very necessary because the buses CIE received from Van Hool McArdle did not give anything but trouble and are badly in need of replacement.  We are all agreed that these buses are badly needed.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an improved standard of carriages on our main railways because the present carriages are dreadful and are so old and dilapidated that they cannot be cleaned.  The Minister said that the rapid rail stock will have to be imported because it is needed urgently and time does not permit this stock to be built at home.  I look forward to the rapid rail system and its extension to places like Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clonsilla. We all welcome the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements being made to implement a suburban railway service to places like Celbridge, Maynooth, Lucan and Leixlip.  That is a forward looking idea which will help to iron out some of the growing pains which will be encountered when the rapid rail service comes into operation.</P>
    <P>Sometime ago I mentioned the present position of the board of directors of CIE and lamented that these people are part-time directors meeting once a month.  An additional factor was introduced <Col N="215" /> last year, that is, four worker directors. I am not sure how that has worked or how these worker directors have influenced the working of CIE because I cannot see any visible improvement in the transport situation.  There is one way Members of this House can get this information and that is by way of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, of which the Minister was the vice-chairman and I was a member. We must keep tabs on what is happening in our State-sponsored bodies, how the money is being used, how it is being lost and, in very few cases, how it is being made.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep tabs on what is happening that Joint Oireachtas Committee must function in a more organised manner.  I do not want to enter into a discussion of a Committee of this House&mdash;I am referring to it only in the context of CIE &mdash; but if we are to keep tabs on what is happening in these companies a better system must be devised to enable us examine their affairs.  What is happening at present is that CIE were examined two and a half years ago.  A lot of other companies have been examined in the meantime, a lot more still await examination and they will all have to be completed before we can revert to CIE.  It is most unsatisfactory that one's examination of a State body might have taken place three or four years ago and one is not in a position to re-examine it.  The examination of each body should be held at least annually.  Perhaps the Minister, who is in charge of many of those State-sponsored bodies being examined by that Joint Committee, would bear that point in mind: that the work turnover should be much faster.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else I welcome the moneys being provided in this Bill, which are badly needed.  We should like to see some decisions being taken, at least the emergence of a national transport policy, something on which we could build and plan.  To date we have not had such a policy.  Understandably the public are becoming very impatient, and are entitled to be, at CIE's continuous losses and <Col N="216" /> our seeming inability to do anything about them.  There is a large task ahead of us and I wish the Minister every success in the job confronting him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few points I want to make on the detailed proposals of this Bill.  The Second Stage of the Bill has been used by a number of Deputies to make comments on CIE and the transport sustem in general and it is not my intention to be repetitive in any way. However, at the outset I should say there is probably no aspect of society and the economy in which the chaos that ensues from the obdurate refusal to accept the concept of planning in our affairs is more evident.  CIE's difficulties do not exist in isolation.  As has been correctly pointed out, they stem from deficiencies in planning in relation to transport.  Indeed, it does not stop there because as I listened to Deputy Deasy I was reminded of the absence of other, deeper parts of planning. One cannot speak about a transport policy unless one speaks also of some demographic plan for the country.  In turn this feeds back into the whole attitude we have to planning.  To put it very simply, the great, immediate problems of transport in a city like Dublin stem from the absence of a regional strategy.  But technically, great congestion within the world of transport within larger cities is a form of urban diseconomy.  It is one of the prices paid for mindless economic expansion that is not taking place within a coherent economic plan.  Side by side with the urban diseconomy that is congestion within transport within the major cities there is the cutback of transport facilities within depopulated rural areas. Therefore we have historically as evidence presented to us in relation to transport two straight incontrovertible examples of the absence of planning in our affairs&mdash;crowded cities with inefficient transport systems and, on the other hand, depopulated rural areas in which transport <Col N="217" /> facilities have shrunk in some cases to the point of non-existence.</P>
    <P>Having made that preliminary point it is worth while in a debate such as this tracing its origin to its substantial core. With the greatest admiration and sympathy in the world for the speeches to which I listened in this House I can trace a compassion, a nostalgia and indeed affection for the world of transport, but there is not at all clearly evident any commitment towards acceptance of planning within the world of transport and, within that concept of planning, towards putting social criteria first.  It is in fact a piece of whimsy about transport on an occasion provided by the discussion of a Transport Bill.  I recall that the last time I spoke in the Seanad on transport was April 1974.  I remember even in that House at that time people speaking with affection for railways, railway people, houses and so on.  But people avoided altogether the cause of our problem in relation to affairs such as transport, that is, the hostility existing towards planning as a technique, the low place social values and aims occupy in our intentions as a nation.</P>
    <P>I want to speak very precisely to the Bill before us.  One speaker after another has spoken about the mixture of aims CIE must pursue; there are economic aims and social aims.  But not one speaker suggested that CIE should begin with social and economic aims and make an adjustment between those two.  Rather it is in the explanation of CIE's losses that the social aspect is fired in when, having had a mish-mash of performance on economic criteria, we cannot explain things fairly thoroughly and it is fired in as a kind of latter day excuse: well, of course, it provides a social function.  I want to be very positive on this matter.  It would appear to me to have been logical to expect that a transport policy would derive from this kind of procedure.  For example, we should have asked the National Economic and Social Council to examine the social needs that will derive from our future population.  We could ask the same body to assess the short, medium and long term needs of our existing <Col N="218" /> economic expansion.  We could have asked the same body to prepare a document on the transport needs of our development strategy regionalised.  We would be able then to express these as aims.  We might debate them in the House.  For example, we might decide that we were going to express a precise relationship between these different philosophies of transport.  It is at that stage that it is appropriate to go to a consultant and ask how a precise aim can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Rather what we have had are consultants being engaged to assess achievements, or assess the achievement of a particular short, pragmatic aim without its being related to an overall philosophy and plan for transport itself.  The result is that the public can look on and hear of astronomical sums of money being spent, for example, on sonsultants' fees.  The first reaction is to say something like we have just heard; we could have written it ourselves.  I do not want to contrubute to the irrational rejection of expert opinion but I do want to say that it makes no sense whatsoever to ignore altogether the questions of the philosophy of transport or transport policy and simply deride the purpose of a consultancy exercise from one pragmatic set of questions in isolation, which is ridiculous, judged by any planning criteria.</P>
    <P>If such a strategy as I have outlined for evolving a transport policy was followed, moving from the stated intention of different aims, social and economic, there would be an accountability within the performance of transport that would recommend itself to the Department.  The question of social performance could be measured exactly.  I can think of the reasons for social performance which have been debated in the history of the State much better than they have been recently.  Now the question of CIE providing a social service is fired in as an explanation for poor economic performance. As public representatives we should be able to see in the performance of CIE how that company are achieving their social, economic and expermental aims.</P>
    <P>The social criteria of CIE have been spoken of at length.  I would, however, <Col N="219" /> remind people that it is the most vulnerable sections who have been assured a participation in society or in the history of the evolution of transport.  The people who are lame cannot drive easily, the young, by definition, cannot hold a licence, there are people who are too old and too infirm to drive.  I do not want simply to indulge in nostalgia but I can recall a time when the regular participation of such groups was afforded by a rail link.</P>
    <P>On every occasion when CIE justified the closure of their railway lines, they offered to such people the suggestion that there would be bus replacements.  The adequacy of a bus replacement for a rail service in a rural area was rarely understood. People went to their local stations and waited there.  There were people, where I was reared in County Clare, who travelled to Limerick with their eggs and flowers.  It was their regular interaction with a large section of population.  They were then told they could walk or limp one and a half times the distance to get a bus to bring them to a large city.  This was supposed to be the substitution for the rail service.</P>
    <P>When that service ended much more than the withdrawal of a service was involved.  These people were effectively cut off from participating in society in a way that was valuable to them.  It was, in fact, a form of crude philistine-ism within social policy simply to talk about juggling around with the replacement of one form of transport service for another.  Indeed, long after that, one gets an idea of our derisory commitment to a social criterion within transport in the attitude we have had even to people entitled to free transport at particular times.  Ministers from different administrations received letters from me asking them to lift the restriction on the travel of old age pensioners at times when they were restricted.  There have been some welcome changes made in this but it is not complete yet.  It was disgraceful, when people in the different old age institutions around the country would have welcomed visits from the people who were able to travel to them, to preclude those people from travelling <Col N="220" /> at particular times.  This was an indication of a Scrooge mentality within a derisory commitment to a social purpose within transport.</P>
    <P>All of those half apologetics about the social purpose of CIE are thrown out in the end.  I appeal to the Minister to use bodies like the NESC to elicit a social purpose of strategy for CIE and then let us move on to the economic and developmental requirements of transport.  We will then be able to make rational choices and we can hire people who will be able to tell us how we will achieve our aims.</P>
    <P>There has been an impressive generosity towards the workers of CIE in some of the speeches I have listened to.  Many of the workers in CIE are proud of their relationship with that body.  We sometimes forget the importance of CIE as an employer and the fact the the employees of CIE were dispersed across the country in a way which worked against the concentration of industrial employment.  It was one of those useful service employment structures that worked against the concentration of industrial employment that I spoke about earlier.  The workers in CIE have very frequently spoken about innovations they would like to make.  Those workers read and hear about changes instead of being asked to participate in the evolution of proposals for the railways and the buses.</P>
    <P>I believe morale is low within CIE because of the hierarchial and authoritarian structure of the management of that company.  That hierarchy is an expression of the values of the society that needs hierarchy because it does not trust democratic diffusion on participation within work contexts and every-where else.  It is also reflective of the authoritarianism which is the related black curse of our society that runs with hierarchy in a structural sense, people telling lesser people, telling even further lesser people what is likely to happen. The inter-face of the public with the workers of CIE is an inter-face with people who have been deprived of the possibility of participating in decision making and have had to make the best of the services, make excuses for them and still try to achieve a compassion.  There is a <Col N="221" /> striking contrast between some of the people I have consulted with about transport at the very highest levels and the bus conductors I have seen helping on to buses women with prams and go-cars and who have been trying to look after the needs of the elderly and of children.  The most compassionate people within CIE are the people in the lowest paid employment, the people dealing with the public on a regular basis.  Part of the problem within CIE is that world and experience of compassion is cut off from its flow to the very top of the administrative hierarchy within CIE.</P>
    <P>With regard to participation, we are really seeing another value of society leaning on a semi-State body.  People in today's debate have said they deplore the attacks on CIE and their workers in particular. This is not occuring in isolation. It is occuring within the context of the attacks on the public service in general. We must see CIE as one of the largest employers in the State within the public service.  The public service employees have been attacked so regularly by people that it is no wonder that morale is low, especially within CIE.  We are reflecting the distorted, stunted personality that has no concept of the social. People speak in an interesting way about the expansion of the world of the motor car.  The world of the motor car, which stands in competition with CIE, is the world of the private that stands in contrast with the world of the public because public transport, by definition, is something social, it is something public.</P>
    <P>By definition, public transport is something social, public.  The world of private motor cars, private transport, is the antithesis of that.  We have been hearing people who participate in and extol the virtues of the private enterprise economy and its transport needs, and the social response to them.  They have been casting their jaundiced vision on something that is a social activity, public transport, and bringing to bear on that criticisms that are not appropriate to the nature of CIE.</P>
    <P>In a simple way I will make some precise suggestions in regard to the Bill, which is about the raising of the ceiling for guaranteed funds.  I urge the Minister <Col N="222" /> to press for a debate on transport philosophy and transport policy.  It is important to disaggregrate planning within CIE.  Sensible suggestions have been made not only about regionalisation but about localisation in transport planning so that we can be responsive to the needs of areas in a way that will make sense to the people we are catering for.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the democratisation that worker-participation within the board brought about in CIE could be expanded in a much more meaningful way if we could evolve local planning which would involve workers at different levels so that they might feel part of the process of the expansion of CIE.  Enough has been said about the old philosophy of closure or retention.  The debates on CIE here and in the newspapers over the years have been concerned entirely with closures &mdash; things were being closed and Deputies were fighting to keep different lines and stations opened.  &ldquo;Closure and Retention&rdquo; could be the title of that debate.  In my opinion this is inadequate. We are in an entirely new atmosphere from the point of view of CIE, for a couple of reasons.  The changed nature in regard to energy sources has given public transport potential that it never has had and there is the change in the demographic structure of the country which has created an entirely new set of possibilities for the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>We discussed the question that I have labelled loosely as &ldquo;closure and retention&rdquo; at a time when the country was losing its population.  Now our population is increasing.  As the last speaker said, there is evidence that the public now have new attitudes, positive at that, towards the use of public transport.  This by itself creates a new atmosphere in CIE.  Positive proposals are coming that will reflect these new developments. There is the recent study, funded and supported by three regional development organisations, on possible rail developments in the west.  I refer to the report of Dr. McGreal of Maynooth.  The regional development organisations not only supported that study but indicated the practicality of it and the positive contribution it could make to infrustructure and <Col N="223" /> regional development in the west in particular. I urge the Minister to indicate a commitment to it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the necessity for a coherent relationship between transport philosophy and transport policy and the planning aspect of CIE.  Another point reflects our old world chaotic absence of planning.  It is the relationship of CIE and the Department of Transport, and the relationship of that Department with other Departments.  It is crazy in the eighties to find the Department of the Environment supervising and controlling, for example, the development of local authority estates, and long afterwards one has to make representations for a bus service.  Surely, as we come near to the end of the century, we can envisage a situation where there would be communication between local authorities and the Department of the Environment and other Departments with responsibility for transport.</P>
    <P>The same question arises in relation to port development.  In relation to expansion of port facilities there is a necessity for liaison between the world of transport and the harbour authorities.  In education there is the need for increased school transport and here again there is need for a better relationship.  The same applies to the Garda Síochána who control traffic.  Being local for a moment, we must try to eradicate deficiencies where they exist, such as the absence of a bridge in the city which I represent.  I hope this pressure will continue because all these deficiencies affect transport.  Side by side with the absence of coherence in planning, sometimes we notice the unnecessary divisions as between different agencies of the State and local agencies.  There is need for flexibility here.</P>
    <P>For instance, at the very early planning stage of local authority estates, CIE should be asked to respond to the transport needs of the new dwellers.  That should happen, but what happens is that with all the Departments in separate existences and operating in different periods, the world of representational politics steps in and thousands of letters are written about estates without transport. <Col N="224" /> Much of this would be unnecessary if we had a commitment to living in a modern way.  Commitment to a modern world is not commitment to paying a modern fee for a modern consultancy agency.  It means thinking in a modern way, anticipating difficulties and relationships between the different Departments.</P>
    <P>I have been moved to make these points on the occasion when CIE are acquiring more borrowing powers through the funds that will be guaranteed for them.  This is an occasion when we should state here the kind of accountability many of us want in regard to transport. Enough has been said already about industrial relations in public transport.  If a coherent future can be mapped out for transport and if we organise a flexible relationship between different Departments, if we provide for less hierarchy and authoritarianism, there will be within unionised workers in CIE an enthusiasm for innovation and change.  That will come when they are not being attacked, when their morale is not being lowered, when they are not being alienated, but when they have been given something positive, purposeful and socially progressive to aim for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who has neither a bicycle nor a motor car, but who has used CIE buses and trains all my life, I want to say a few words on the Bill. We have heard the cliche used here repeatedly that CIE are providing a social service.  The fact that a cliche was used does not make the argument untrue or invalid.  It cannot be said long enough or clearly enough or loudly enough here that that is the function of CIE.  CIE's job is to provide a public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a danger to CIE these days.  We are living in a time when economists are talking about the need to create real jobs and to have real jobs in our society propped up.  What they mean by &ldquo;real jobs&rdquo; is to adopt a purely economic criterion for employment, that is jobs in what are called growth areas. There is a tendency on the part of those economists to press for the adoption of their policies to the detriment of jobs in <Col N="225" /> public services such as CIE.  I object to that purely economic criterion because we cannot measure the value of the work done in CIE in purely economic terms. One must adopt wider criteria, a wider yardstick.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy spoke about political appointments in CIE management over the years.  The Chair asked the Deputy not to name names.  I do not propose to do that but it is well known that political appointments to CIE by successive Governments have bedevilled CIE because their management has been the rest home for lame ducks, people who could not survive in the outside commercial world but found a safe haven, a refuge, in CIE. That is no good because CIE management must be in the forefront of the modern world.  It is no place for lame ducks but for people who are keen and, above all, imbued with philosophy in regard to transport, people who are aware of the pitfalls and the difficulties in the public service.  Unfortunately such a system has been adhered to more in the breach than in the observance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to enter into theological dispute with the Deputy but I do not think it can be properly described as a Catholic form of divorce.  I am aware of the many problems and anomalies that arise from the process of religious annulment and the difference between the annulment expedient of State and Church.  Presumably this would be one of a number of issues which the Committee of the Oireachtas would consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that this is just another example of refusal to grasp what Jack Lynch called the nettle that should be grasped?  Is it not a fact that nearly 20 years ago&mdash;was it 1967?&mdash;there was such an all-party committee and while its recommendations were not acceptable to most of us its conclusions were that there was a need for divorce?  Why are the Government continuing to put off taking a badlyneeded decision in his regard.?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of what course of action should be pursued in relation to a subject as complex as this is one that I think would be best dealt with in the first instance by an all-party committee of the House.  I would be concerned that that committee would be established speedily, would take its work seriously and issue its report speedily so that the House would face up speedily to whatever decision it reaches.  I do not see this as an expedient for putting this matter off and I shall endeavour to ensure that the task of the committee is such as to give this House the necessary advice as to the course of action to be pursued as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a need for civilised and comprehensive divorce laws to take account of the suggestion of Deputy Loughnane in terms of the distress and hardship caused by the present annulment system which is divorce under a <Col N="228" /> different name and which causes tremendous problems as regards inheritance and succession laws and which in my humble experience seem to favour the wealthy rather than the poor.  According to my knowledge of this area poor people experience tremendous delay and difficulty in getting annulments while wealthier people seem to be able to do it with greater speed and alacrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the anomalies that exist including others to which the Deputy has not referred, such as bigamous marriages, which hitherto have not proved acceptable to being dealt with by the State and which bring the law of marriage into contempt.  There are many anomalies here.  That is why it is not a matter that can be dealt with in a simple way.  It needs to be dealt with by an all-party committee to examine each of these different aspects and come up rapidly with conclusions as to what is the best way of tackling a situation which is now very much entangled and which for many of the people concerned and for their offspring, is very unsatisfactory.</P>

I would point out that during the election campaign the former Taoiseach attempted to put across the idea that the cost of living increase in the report in question was 2½ per cent.  He annualised this to 10 per cent.  It turned out to be 3.9 per cent.  After adding the 2 per cent that was held back for the period in question, it should be a 5.9 per cent increase in one quarter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach give us the reason he felt it appropriate to divide responsibility for Industry from responsibility for Trade?  In particular has he taken into account the consequences of having the IDA reporting to one Minister in one Department and CTT reporting to another Minister in another Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various considerations involved here, as Deputy O'Malley will know from his own tenure of the office in question.  The Minister for Trade is, in this country, responsible for foreign trade which involves responsibility for attendance at EEC Councils on trade matters.  The Foreign Affairs Council normally, in my experience, has on its agenda trade matters, which is a very heavy burden.  The difficulty experienced by a Minister in coping with that area as well as with IDA activities is considerable. But there are a number of considerations involved in this.  It seemed that it was the best allocation of responsibilities in an area where there are alternative divisions and Deputy O'Malley is entitled to his view as to another appropriate division.  The total body of work involved between the two Ministries is very extensive and it is difficult to get the optimum division.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Taoiseach for the compliment that he has paid me in saying that it was impossible for one man to do what has been done by me and, of course, many of my predecessors. Would the Taoiseach accept from me, as someone who is familiar with that scene in the recent past, that it is extremely unwise to divide responsibility for industrial policy from responsibility for trade policy?  Trade policy covers internal trade as well as external trade and we will almost inevitably have a situation where there will be tensions between two of our most important economic agencies, the IDA and CTT, where no such tensions existed in the past and where there was very considerable co-operation.</P>

      <P>No, I am not indicating that.  The previous Government were never consulted in advance on similar occasions.  The only precedent for that was when our Government were in office and then there were such consultations in regard to Sunningdale.  However, that precedent was not followed during the previous administration when consultations did not take place.  What I am indicating is that as part of the process of negotiation and discussion initiated by my predecessor, which I propose to follow up as rapidly as possible, that process of co-operation could usefully involve the development of consultation on matters of this kind prior to their announcement, consultation, of course, which <Col N="243" /> would have to be an obligation on both sides.

With regard to the question of commenting on the proposals or reacting to them, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that when the British Government published a paper on 21 February 1979 on the government of Northern Ireland a statement was issued which simply stated that the Government had noted the paper published by the British Government and would be observing developments closely with a view to assessing whether any combination of the elements outlined would be likely to meet the basic criteria of acceptability to both sections of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, together.  The <Col N="247" /> Coalition Government's policy document published on 29 June, 1981, contained an outline of wide-ranging measures relating to the housing sector, including the proposals referred to by the Deputy in these questions.  Detailed aspects of these measures are being examined by my Department as a matter of urgency in consultation with other Departments concerned.  Pending Government consideration of the outcome of this examination, it would be premature to supply the details requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his party in the policy document which they put before the people clearly spelled out the commitments that are listed in the questions the Minister has replied to. There was a commitment that the costings had been carried out and that the promises would be put into operation. The Minister should tell the House and the nation exactly when the promises will be brought into force and he should answer the questions that I asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that we listed costings for these various measures except the one dealing with the new mortgage scheme for house purchasers because it is impossible to assess, until we see how many applicants there are, how much the scheme will cost. It is being examined as a matter of urgency.  I hope to bring some legislation in this session before the House to deal with these matters but I would not be firm about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having them checked out at present to see if they are accurate.  To the best of our knowledge they are, but obviously a party in opposition does not have the full facts.  If the Deputy puts down a question in two weeks' time I am sure I will have the information at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied to six questions together.  Has he given consideration to Question No. 6 dealing with pay-related mortgages for first-time purchasers?  What way is it to be financed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find that laid out very clearly in a document published long before we published our programme for the election.  We published this document last November.  It stated clearly that we hoped to attract funds at present going by way of investment to other developments to the housing sector by establishing a housing agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been helpful if the Minister gave the information to the House rather than having to drag it out of him.  The document suggested that the money would be raised through bonds through a housing agency.  Would the Minister not accept that the proposal would prove to be unattractive because there would be no return on the bonds for up to 25 years and that the estimate of the cost of this scheme is in the region of £100 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that under the present system applicants for SDA loans have to wait for an unreasonable length of time before getting <Col N="249" /> approval for such loans because local authorities &mdash; I mention Cork County Council &mdash; do not have notification of the allocation of capital from the Department for a particular month?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not spell out details of the home improvements scheme.  He committed £1,000 for energy conservation and £1,000 towards reconstruction.  Surely he has the costings on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the document to the electorate under the heading of house improvements and energy saving grants it was stated that it would cost £6 million in 1981 and that there would be a saving on home improvements grants of £19 million.  Would the Minister explain those figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the introduction of a scheme for purchase and lease back for the elderly, will this system not result in a reduction in the number of loans available to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why it should.  It is an attractive scheme which is long overdue.  There are many single elderly people living in accommodation which is far too big for them.  They own it but cannot afford the upkeep of it.  It is a reasonable proposition for the State to offer to buy the property and either rent it to them or give them the money to invest themselves and take over that property to add to the State's housing stock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not satisfactory for the Minister to say that firm promises and commitments made to the people have not been costed, that the details are not available in his Department and that he is not prepared to tell the House or the people exactly what it will cost.  Could I suggest to the Minister that the figure he is trying to keep from the Irish people is somewhere in the region of £200 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment (i) the estimated cost for (a) the remainder of 1981, (b) 1982 and (c) 1983 of his promise to introduce a scheme to abolish rates on agricultural land; (ii) if he will give details of the scheme; and (iii) when it will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative arrangements for the new reliefs are at present being examined and a decision about them will be announced as soon as possible.  The net amount of rates payable on land in respect of the balance of the current year is estimated to be £15.315 million.  The cost of relieving these rates for the remainder of the current <Col N="251" /> year would therefore be £15.315 million less any saving arising from the application of conditions such as those set out in the Government's statement of aims.  The cost in respect of 1982 and 1983 would depend on the level of local authority rate poundages in those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to indicate to the House how the scheme will operate since it is suggested in his policy document which is tied to a five-year development programme with ACOT?

One thing coming clearly out of the replies received to the questions I put down is that commitments and promises were made to the Irish people and we are now being told they are being costed.

This scheme will apply to full-time farmers who submit and have approved by ACOT or some other agency a plan for the development of their holdings.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Road restoration charges in each county are a matter for decision by the county council as a roads authority.  I am aware that Galway County Council did propose to charge £2 per metre for road restoration to all group water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council, however, in a recent letter to my Department indicated that they are offering to groups an alternative arrangement which provides for an agreement with each group individually based on an estimate for road restoration costs applicable <Col N="254" /> to the group and taking account of any savings which the group could achieve.  My Department in a letter to Galway County Council have welcomed this alternative.</P>
    <P>Full particulars of charges by local authorities for road restoration works in relation to group schemes are not available in my Department.  However, in general I believe charges made are considerably below the actual cost and I am not aware of any case where a charge of £2 per metre is made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that usually group water schemes are carried out in very remote areas by people who have waited a long time for a water supply and cannot afford to wait any longer for the local authority to provide that supply?  They decide to provide it themselves at a cost of hundreds of pounds.  Does he not feel that local authorities should accept responsibility for the restoration of a road since the people have accepted responsibility for the provision of a water supply which the local authority could be expected to provide in some cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about the value of group water schemes. The practice as to how much is charged and what the county council do in regard to the restoration of roads varies from county to county.  I believe some counties do not make any charge and others, as in the case of Galway, make an effort to charge £2 per metre.  It varies considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this £2 per metre being charged by Galway County Council as a road opening licence is adding £500 to the price of houses in many of the schemes?  Is he further aware that these schemes cannot operate because Galway County Council have no money to restore the roads and, as a result, they are going to the Department of the Environment seeking money?  Is the Minister prepared to provide this money for road restoration?</P>

As I said&mdash;perhaps Deputy Donnellan did not hear me&mdash;Galway County Council are no longer charging this £2.  It has been scrapped.</P>

I instanced an example of that, Galway County Council, who endeavoured to impose a charge of £2 per metre which was not accepted by my Department and which is now being withdrawn.  I agree with Deputy Power that these group water schemes are of tremendous value to the country and the economy of the country as a whole.  He asked me if I would accept responsibility in my Department for the cost of road restoration for the whole country and I said that <Col N="258" /> I would not because here in this House I do not know off the top of my head what the cost is and I am not going to enter into a commitment of that nature without knowing what it costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment for lunch I was on the point of saying that the management of CIE have a great responsibility towards the effective running of that company.  Indeed, the efficient management of any company, above all a State company, must plan ahead and must learn to motivate workers with qualities of leadership and ability. <Col N="263" /> Management must look for changes in transport systems of other countries and other societies to see if some of these changes can be adapted to our own society here in Ireland.  It is sad that the management of CIE through the years have failed all too often in these areas and have been lacking very much in the qualities I have described.  They have failed to show the leadership, initiative and enterprise necessary to tackle some of the problems and issues outlined during the course of this debate on this Bill. We have heard from speakers on both sides of the House how political appointments have found their way into the management of CIE.  I deplore this, because we need the very best management in this area and we have not had that in the past. I know that it is very easy for somebody like me to indict management in all areas right across the board.  It is a very handy way of looking at the overall situation and trying to pinpoint flaws and difficulties. However, in this area of management I am on very solid ground in speaking on this because it is a key area and the people concerned in management have not had the necessary philosophy of transport or, indeed, at times a basic understanding of the issues and problems involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some good things about CIE which I must welcome.  I am trying to be fair and truthful in what I am saying.  I welcome the innovation of the election of workers to the board of CIE.  That is a positive step forward which I must applaud and I want to go on record here as saying that this is something that I have advocated through the years.  It is a good thing now that we have workers from the floor on the board of CIE to talk on the issues of the day and to help in advising that board on how CIE should play their role in Irish society and how they should go forward.  It is a big improvement on the old system of Ministerial appointees being nominated to the board of CIE, which was called industrial democracy by parachute.  These nominees of the Minister's were dropped in through the sky-light and they had no control at all and no involvement with the workers on the <Col N="264" /> shop floor.  I would like to see the Minister concerned adapting that to local areas like Cork, Limerick, Galway, Wexford, Dundalk and Drogheda and thoughout the country.  There should be some local consultative committee or body in these areas to advise the management at that level on issues concerning them.  There should be joint management-labour committees not only at national level in CIE but also at local level and embracing trains, buses and road freight.  I hope the Minister will take some notice of that.</P>
    <P>There is need in CIE for a proper consultative advisory service and for a grievance procedure at national and local levels. There is a basic right of workers nowadays in any company, semi-State or private, to have a say in the running of that company, enterprise or undertaking and that should also be at all levels.  It is important for the Minister to be aware of this and to endeavour to have democracy running right through CIE.  There is an old saying in Irish, &ldquo;Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí&rdquo;&mdash; praise the youth and they will respond.  If you encourage the workers you will have a lot to gain from them. You are tapping a potential that has not been tapped in the past and you can get the workers to respond to you and tell you how they would like to organise things by harnessing their potential for good in the company.  In the past that aspect of the workers' determination of their working environment and conditions has been totally ignored.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will respond to my initiatives in those areas.</P>
    <P>In our society we are inclined to hive off difficult areas and areas which do not make profits.  It is a handy way out.  Areas where profits can be made are kept by private enterprise and private enterprise is propped up with all sorts of grants and subsidies from the State.  In this area CIE are fulfilling a social function.  It is difficult to use the same criteria for private enterprise because this work has been given to CIE as a means of providing a public service.  Other more lucrative and profitable areas of society are kept under the control of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I am not going to comment in any great <Col N="265" /> detail on the history of industrial relations in CIE.  Suffice to say I am unhappy about some aspects of their policy.  For instance, during industrial disputes the policy is to issue protective notice to blue collar workers.  In the present dispute bus drivers and conductors have the threat of protective notice hanging over them. This notice is never extended to management or to white collar workers.  This is discrimination and would not be tolerated in any other society.  If protective notice is to be issued it should be done across the board.  The day is gone when you can tell workers that they are the casualties and will have to go.  The Minister will have to look at this situation because I intend to speak about it often in the House.  There should be no discrimination against any kind of worker. The present system is not just or fair.  I have spoken to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Kavanagh, about this and I hope to speak privately to the Minister for Transport also.</P>
    <P>It is a time of great challenge for CIE. Something should be done about the bus and rail systems because, at a time when oil and petrol costs are going sky high, and when our roads are clogged with traffic, we must look to our road and rail systems to see what we can do to exploit those systems to our advantage. Although our rail system has been stripped in many cases, it is still intact in many areas.  I do not think we have the will or the determination to face up to the challenge.  It is important that we have new thinking in these areas to meet the challenges which are before us and to use whatever systems are available to us. Other countries have adapted their rail and bus systems to suit themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned certain things on which he looked back with nostalgia. Perhaps there is a place for nostalgia and sentiment in any person or, indeed, company.  I have a fondness, when travelling up and down to Dublin by rail, for looking at those Victorian railway stations built by the British.  They are stations of great beauty and character. They are of beautiful design and stonework.  We have not refurbished them too well.  Much of the work done <Col N="266" /> by CIE in this regard has not been good, although some of the engineers, architects, tradesmen and supervisors have been very good conservationists.  Some of those stations, from Heuston down to the smallest station, are works of beauty. Our stone bridges, perhaps built under a different regime, are also very important. They give character to cities and towns and it is important to preserve them.  I hope the Minister will look at that area.</P>
    <P>There is one other area which is often ignored &mdash; our canal system.  We have woefully neglected that area which could have a great tourist potential.  It is a more leisurely throwback to a bygone age. Nevertheless, in other countries they have used networks of canals for tourists as well as for internal travel.  We should not fill our canals with concrete and cement.  We should broaden and clean them so that people may use them.  We are supposed to be backward in terms of visual art.  The Minister is well aware of what I am talking about and how we should use the canals to beautify our countryside and provide amenities.  I hope he will do something about providing a potential attraction for continental and British tourists who used to come here up to a decade ago and are, unfortunately, at present conspicuous by their absence.  I hope they will come back again to fish and to boat on the waterways.</P>
    <P>I also have to record another sad fact. An English historian, who has an interest in social history, came to me some years ago to complain that the annals and records of canals here are stored in vaults at Heuston Station, in damp and dirty conditions. They are the records of people who worked on canals, bargemen, labourers and all those people who gave their time to transporting goods and people on our waterways.  They are a very valuable social documentary.  I would ask the Minister to rescue those books and papers and make them available to the National Library.  It could be even better if we could set up a transport museum and exhibit them.  They should not be gathering dirt, damp and cobwebs.</P>
    <P>This morning the Bombardier plant at Shannon was mentioned.  I believe Irish workers can build buses as well as anybody <Col N="267" /> in the world.  It is unfortunate that the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, has some bad memories of his trip down there to drive the first bus.  I will not go into those memories.  There are always teething troubles.  I have been impressed at the quality of the work carried out at the Bombardier plant.  Their achievements should be praised.  The company have received bad press and television reports because of an unfortunate few incidents. We cannot see the wood for the trees. They have turned out a lot of work in a short time and the craftsmanship and skill shown by those workers are a credit, not only to the region, but to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion by Deputy Deasy that there should be a full discussion in this House on the McKinsey Report.  I agree with that so I will not comment on it now.  Somebody said recently it would make a fine bonfire. That is a frivolous way of dealing with it. It cost an awful lot of money and it should be discussed in full.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this Bill.  I add one small rider &mdash; that the money being provided will be wisely and well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Bill.  One must accept that a new Government, only recently in office, are compelled to adopt this measure to provide for the on-going finances of CIE.  However, a major review of our transport policy must be undertaken, and undertaken fairly quickly.  All too often, the impression is given by senior CIE officials, among others, that in some way our transportation services must be regarded as some kind of industry which should, at least, break even, if not, indeed, make a profit.  That I could never accept.  Transportation services must be regarded as a social service. CIE have run deficits and continue to do so and this may be due to their pricing policy&mdash;the level of fares which they have been imposing over the years. People living in the area I represent find the burden of bus fares into and out of Dublin city alone a crippling burden. Many cannot afford journeys into the city <Col N="268" /> centre on more than one or two occasions weekly.  Incredibly, bus fares have reached a situation where they can present a real financial hardship, running into pounds per week, which simply cannot be afforded.</P>
      <P>The level of the service appears, in many respects, inadequate.  Many potential users of CIE are put off the service by reason, firstly, of their pricing policy and, secondly, of the lack of speed of the service.  Two essentials which any member of the public asks for in a transport service are speed and cheapness.  We have been falling down on both these counts.  I strongly suspect that if the prices charged by CIE on their bus routes, particularly in the Dublin city and county areas, were slashed, and substantially slashed, far from producing a reduction in their revenue is would bring about an increase in revenue.  Furthermore, if a fast and adequate service were introduced on many routes, many who now travel by car would be impelled to use the public transport service.</P>
      <P>We should use every device possible to ensure that the maximum number of people at present using their cars would divert to public transport.  In Dublin city and county now at peak hours our transportation is literally grinding to a halt, bringing this city to a halt.  Journeys which should take ten minutes are taking an hour.  The expenditure in terms of resources of petrol and energy and with regard to the balance of payments must be overwhelming.</P>
      <P>Increased finances should be made available to CIE for substantial improvements in the frequency of their services and to enable them to substantially subsidise their fares, particularly to the newly developing areas in County Dublin. This would increase the use of the public transportation system which would, in turn, relieve the burden on our roads and the appalling loss of time and wastage of energy of people driving to and from work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn very briefly to the question of rail links to the newly developing areas in County Dublin and, in particular, to the new town of Tallaght in my constituency, which I am sorry to have to say is <Col N="269" /> very poorly served by public transport. We have the paradoxical situation in the provision of bus services that those newly developing areas and new estates which have mushroomed so much over the past decade in County Dublin are the areas worst served by buses.  On the other hand, the more settled areas have relatively speaking, a first-class service, established over the years.  The new towns being built on the periphery of the city and county get a second-class service &mdash; inadequate schedules, inadequate buses, inadequate timings, but at a very high cost.  The paradox is that those people require the service far more than people living in the old, settled areas who are better equipped with alternative transport.</P>
    <P>Many of these new estates are two miles from the nearest bus route, served, more often than not, by a country bus rather than an urban city bus.  Most people living in these estates do not have motor cars and must walk up to two miles to reach, at that stage, a very inadequate system.  The new town of Tallaght with 50,000 inhabitants and tending to increase, desperately needs the provision of a rapid rail link into the centre of the city.  Dublin County Council have made provision for the land to be reserved for a station and I would urge the Minister to ensure that, during the currency of this Government, the finances be made available to CIE with all possible speed for that essential link for Tallaght and the other new towns in the west of County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I am well aware that CIE are providing school transport services which, everyone must agree, cannot be very lucrative for them. On the other hand, I wonder if there is interference by any other authority which is preventing CIE from running a very lucrative road haulage system.</P>
      <P>In the town of Mallow, where I come from, from October until mid-January the large haulage trucks draw beet to the sugar factory and CIE are noted for their absence from that very lucrative business. CIE must not allow that financially rewarding business to be taken over entirely by private enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the various Deputies who contributed to this wide-ranging debate for giving consideration to the Bill and its implications.  I thank them, on a personal note, for their good wishes towards me. These will be needed when one considers all the problems raised in their contributions.</P>
      <P>Every measure touching CIE which is brought before the Oireachtas provokes a wide-ranging debate, wider than the strict terms of the Bill might at first sight suggest.  It is only right that the debate should be wide ranging and that this House should have the views of as many Deputies as possible and on as wide a number of aspects relating to CIE as possible.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate it became clear that there is a widespread wish for a fundamental examination of CIE and of a transport policy generally.  The point was made by Deputy Deasy that we need a transport policy.  Deputy Higgins, in the terminology of his profession, a sociologist, put the point more graphically and, when describing the urgent need for basic planning, said it was not enough at this stage to take the McKinsey Report as the base for new thinking on CIE.  I took him as saying that we need to go behind that and set aims and objectives in the context of Ireland's social and economic needs and then relate our transport policy to those aims and how best they can fulfil those needs.  He does have a point because the McKinsey Report is an examination of results and is suggesting changes on a present base which may be an altogether improper base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consideration of the McKinsey Report is going on apace.  I take the point that this House should have an opportunity at some stage to debate it.  It was suggested that the opportunity should come early but I would not like to commit myself to an early debate on something so basic, because it will take some time to get all the views of the parties who have a deep interest in this subject, to consider their views and to formulate my own views.  It may also be necessary to <Col N="271" /> look at the matter in the very basic terms proposed by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>The general level of criticism one hears levelled at CIE and their operations &mdash; the critical perception of the public has been heightened in recent days by the present unfortunate bus strike &mdash; imposes an obligation on me and on this House to consider the whole transport policy of the nation from stage one.  That, of course, is an immense task.</P>
    <P>This debate was useful in pointing up and highlighting the need for some radical changes.  Deputies touched on the various symptoms of dissatisfaction. Deputy Reynolds mentioned that CIE morale was low and queried the attitude of CIE management and unions towards each other.  Other Deputies made similar points.  The collective worries of Deputies in this area is pointed up by the present strike.  Deputy Reynolds asked if we cared about this strike and its consequences, and how we showed our care. I would like to assure him that all Deputies, myself included, care very deeply about this strike and about the real hardships it is causing to a large number of people in this city and we show our care by engaging in the negotiating processes in an urgent way.</P>
    <P>As Deputies opposite know, the responsibility for those negotiations lies with the Minister for Labour.  I want to assure the House that he is engaged in the negotiating processes in an active and urgent way.  There was an implication yesterday that these processes should be by-passed in favour of some sort of direct consultation.  But Deputies opposite must know &mdash; bearing in mind that they were members of a Government which by their dogged insistence on negotiating procedures left us without telephones and post for nearly half a year &mdash; that you cannot throw the book of procedures out the window because by that type of action you could be inviting industrial anarchy. There are procedures and they have to be observed.  They have to be used vigorously and energetically, intelligently, and with skill and sensitivity.  That is the task of my colleague, the Minister for Labour, and I am satisfied that he is doing <Col N="272" /> that with all urgency and with the necessary degree of commitment and skill.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to ask if anything can be done to ameliorate the hardships being endured by the public at the moment.  The Government are sensitive to this need.  The calling in of the Army to assist in ameliorating the plight of Dublin citizens has not been excluded, but I do not want to go any further than that at this stage.  I want to take this opportunity to appeal to Dublin motorists to come to the assistance of their fellow citizens who normally travel by bus, to give them lifts, and I would ask bus travellers to stand at bus stops to indicate their willingness to get a lift.  I appeal to the community of Dublin to show solidarity towards each other in this time of hardship.  If a high level of solidarity can be shown, considerable amelioration of the hardships imposed by the strike can be effected.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record that the Government are seriously concerned about the strike and are doing, and will continue to do, everything that can be done to have the strike settled as quickly as possible and to ameliorate its effects on the public.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the industrial disputes which seem to cause the greatest hardship to the greatest number of people mainly emanate from the State and semi-State spheres where the people are in protected employment and guaranteed safety from the cold winds of recession.  I find that a disturbing comment to have to make.  It is a matter of great regret that there is not greater acknowledgement by people in those spheres of their protected positions within the community and that there is not a greater recognition by them of that protection by reciprocating in a higher level of service to the community they serve.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, this is not the first strike by CIE workers.  In the last number of years there have been a number of disputes, most of them unofficial but, so far as the suffering public are concerned, the hardship is the same.  An organisation which produced in the last four years 102 unofficial disputes, even though the majority of them were for <Col N="273" /> only one day, is symptomatic of a malaise which is recognised by the public and has inspired Deputies here today to seek a fundamental reappraisal of that organisation. The starting point for the reappraisal has been the consideration of the McKinsey Report and the options those considerations throw up.</P>
    <P>Having listened to Deputy Higgins, I begin to wonder whether we should go further back and look at the problem in a more basic way.  There are many options to be considered and Deputy Deasy touched on some of them when he spoke of hiving off the rail and bus services into separate units.  That is an option which may have to be considered.  The management and control of such units would have to be considered carefully in the light of certain specific social and commercial objectives.  A serious task faces the Government and will in due course face the Oireachtas in deciding the changes to be made in our transport system so that we may have a system which serves the needs of the people and on which they can rely.  Such a service must be provided as cheaply and efficiently as possible.  This is all fundamental. In the meantime we must carry on with what we have.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies touched on various aspects of the present operations of CIE. The concern expressed by Dublin Deputies was essentially related to the bus and rail services.  As I pointed out earlier, the capital expenditure which is required is related to the electrification of the Howth-Bray line and the acquisition of more mainline carriage units.  There is also the commuter rail service from Maynooth. These extensions, are of course, desirable because if the services are free from interruption and efficient they will provide a preferable mode of transport for most people.  They will encourage people to leave their cars at home and travel by train.  The implementation of these new developments is a matter of urgency.  I know it was being pressed urgently by my predecessor and I will continue with the same urgency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern asked what stations will be served by the Maynooth commuter <Col N="274" /> line.  I understand they will be Maynooth itself, Leixlip, Clonsilla, Blanchardstown and Ashtown initially and at a later date Coolmine and Drumcondra.  Deputies McMahon and Taylor raised the possibility of a similar service to the Tallaght area.  A proposition to provide such a service is at present under examination and will be dealt with speedily.  All these things are in the future although the electrification of the Howth-Bray line is continuing apace and will be completed comparatively soon.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on providing a commuter rail service must be seen in the context of Dublin traffic.  I share the concern of Deputies that something radical must be done about the traffic problem. At the moment it is being considered by the Dublin Transportation Task Force and they are developing remedial measures such as the bus lanes which have been very successful and are to be expanded.  This task force is also preparing for the establishment of a Dublin transportation authority which will bring together all the agencies having responsibility for different aspects of Dublin traffic and they will have the power to enforce their views by statute.</P>
    <P>The stage has been reached where really radical measures are needed to unclog Dublin traffic.  I know that the physical lay-out of the city and the situation of the port and access roads compound the difficulties but in addition there are far too many private cars whose occupants could be enticed to use public transport.  If they cannot be enticed to do so consideration might have to be given to measures that would be a financial deterrent to using cars in the city centre. We have a hen and egg situation because unless we get rid of the cars the buses will not be able to move efficiently while, on the other hand, unless there is an efficient bus service people will not leave their cars at home.  That circle must be broken and we must attract people to the buses. The new factory at Shannon will make buses available and we must ensure that they can run speedily and to time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor said that bus fares are too dear and that if they were slashed CIE would have an increase in their <Col N="275" /> income due to increased usage.  I would agree with that assertion if the traffic situation were such that buses could run quickly and to time.  In that situation there would be an immense growth in traffic and it would then be possible to consider altering fares.  I do not think that an alteration at present would make the slightest difference to the volume of passengers because the main inhibition is the slow service and irregular schedule.</P>
    <P>Likewise many people travelling from the provinces to Dublin would be very glad to come by train if two conditions could be fulfilled.  Firstly we should have a higher standard of rolling stock.  I disagree with Deputy Flynn, who said that air conditioning was a bit extravagant and that our climate does not require it. Anything that enhances the standard of our carriages and makes them more comfortable should be pursued to attract the customer.  This Bill will enable CIE to update their rolling stock as a matter of urgency as the present standard is deplorably low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a professional railway carriage designer but I imagine that it would add to the comfort of the train.  I would like to see the carriages properly cooled in the summer and properly heated in the winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be advised by the professionals, the people who build the carriages at Inchicore.  There is a great craft tradition and a great pool of expertise in Inchicore and I would leave the design and building of the carriages <Col N="276" /> to them.  They will build what is best.  I have no doubt that the people in the west who have good carriages only on Sundays would welcome good carriages every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a commitment to make them available in the west at the earliest opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Flynn did not give that commitment last month.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the skills in Inchicore will be used on work on the new carriages, which will be of a high standard so as to provide an incentive for people coming to Dublin to consider the train option.  That would help to keep cars out of the centre of Dublin.  The second incentive for such people is to know that when they reach Dublin a reliable fast transport system will be available.  That too is tied up with removing cars from the city and leaving roads as free as possible for buses.</P>
      <P>The frustrations of Dublin bus crews are immense because of the heavy traffic and its interference with their schedules. People who have been left waiting often vent their frustrations on the unfortunate bus crews.  One can sympathise with the crews' feeling battered and bruised and if their morale is low following these experiences.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy McMahon and Deputy Higgins raised the question of extending bus services on a regular basis to the more extended areas of the city.  I am aware that there is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction with bus services to new estates and I am aware of the hardship caused to the residents.  It appears to be very bad planning not to arrange for something as basic as transport services for these estates when they are first planned.  It gets back to the availability of capital for CIE.  One of the objectives of this Bill is to cure that lack so that CIE can provide extra buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn deplored what he called CIE bashing and I share his apprehensions. Constructive criticism is necessary but a constant barrage of unperceptive bashing is not good for the morale of <Col N="277" /> management or workers and it compounds the situation in that company.  In CIE there is a good <i>esprit de corps.</i>  It may be latent but it is there.  I know many people who are second and third generation CIE employees and that spirit is there, although latent at the moment because morale is bad.  It could be ignited very quickly if they saw that the Government were concerned about their affairs and were concerned to defend them from unfair criticism which does not take into account the difficulties which our failure to provide the re-organisation and the capital has led them into.  If they felt that concern, we would get willing and quick co-operation from all the employees in CIE.  This goes back to the fact that some fundamental thinking on transport and transport policy is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn was disappointed that the input of Irish industry into the new goods being manufactured on foot of this further investment would not be 100 per cent.  Both I and my predecessor can confirm that the maximum Irish input has been sought for any manufacturing process or any reconstruction or assembly process that will be engaged in following this investment.  We will continue to monitor that scene and if the present level of Irish input can be improved it will be improved urgently.  As Deputy Flynn suggested, the good offices of the IDA will be utilised if appropriate.  We will arrange for close liaison between CIE and the IDA to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan was anxious for better quality carriages and I share his view for the reasons stated earlier.  The Deputy also spoke of the need for consultation between staff and management and wanted better relations.  The Deputy expressed puzzlement as to why so many industrial disputes seem to affect that company.  This is something I intend to look at to see what can be done urgently in the short-term.  I am sure that concerned people have had the same ambition but it is something that must be constantly followed up.  It is my role to keep in close contact with the company to see that there is a constant review of relationships there to ensure that circumstances <Col N="278" /> that give rise to disputes are noticed early and that appropriate action is taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made an interesting contribution as a Deputy who participated in the debate when CIE were set up in 1943-44.  It was interesting for him to recall that at that stage the essence of the debate was the question of whether a monopoly should be created and given to this State company.  The Deputy voted against it then and felt that the historical outcome has vindicated his view that a monopoly was not appropriate.  Who at this stage could say that he was wrong? Does this add to the suggestion in the McKinsey Report that a break-up of that monopoly might now be the answer?  We cannot give that answer until we give fundamental consideration to the whole question of transport policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned also that there should be a continuing emphasis on the railways as the area for development in transport more so than roadways.  He was worried about the environmental effects of large scale roadworks in builtup areas and of the social effects, the damage they can do to a whole community and to individuals.  There is no doubt about it that large scale roadworks inevitably have that effect.  In this age, in which everything is <i>en masse</i>, we are inclined to lose sight of the individual; he is inclined to be disregarded.  The individual worker becomes part of the union, the individual householder becomes part of the country and, if a roadway has to affect him, so be it.  But we must continue to pay attention to the needs of individuals. I share Deputy Ahern's concern that roadways, while they can be justified on economic grounds and possibly on purely cost grounds, can have social consequences that cannot be quantified.  If they can be avoided by greater emphasis on railways, I would share that general philosophy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the McKinsey Report and the need for debate on it. He spoke also of the present management structures in CIE, more with reference to the board of CIE and the fact that it has a part-time chairman.  He was critical of the fact that the chairman is <Col N="279" /> part-time.  Of course, the chairman of CIE is much more involved than most chairmen of State boards in so far as he gives more of his time to the affairs of CIE than normally do the chairmen of State-sponsored boards.  Deputy Deasy, and I think other Deputies also, made the point about the need to strengthen the boards of State-sponsored companies. He made the point also, as did Deputy Flanagan, of the lack of parliamentary control over the affairs of State-sponsored companies, having regard to the immense amount of public moneys they are involved in spending.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy made reference to the Joint Oireachtas Committee, which is of course the first step by Parliament in exercising a review relationship with the State-sponsored section.  The Oireachtas, during the course of the last Parliament, appointed a Joint Committee of both Houses, when one of the bodies reviewed was CIE.  However, Deputy Deasy made the point that it is now something over two years since CIE was reviewed by that committee and that it would be necessary to have the companies reviewed on an annual basis by the Oireachtas Committee. Quite obviously that committee, as presently constituted, could not possibly deal with all the State-sponsored companies on an annual basis.  It would have to be expanded considerably and might have to work through sub-committees. Again, that is something that might be considered.  Nevertheless, as a member of that committee, I think it was a worthwhile one and provided the necessary link between the Oireachtas and the State-sponsored section.  But what I should like to see done in the course of this Oireachtas is that there be a procedure devised whereby reports of that Committee would be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and debated, because much of their work is wasted and their watchdog role on behalf of the Oireachtas is pointless unless the Oireachtas pays attention here in a formal way to their reports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins indicated in what were graphic terms&mdash;because he spoke in the language of the discipline and as a sociologist&mdash;the <Col N="280" /> need for fundamental planning in regard to transport policy generally. I accept his point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy, like other Deputies, was concerned about the management problems of CIE and of the need to consult workers.  He indicated the gulf that would appear to exist by the fact that protective notices which have been served consequent on this strike were served on certain sectors only, and that clerical workers and those at higher management levels had not been served with notices.  Of course the situation in a strike such as we have now means that from day one there is no work for bus crews but there may continue to be work for other levels.  However, as the days and weeks go on obviously the situation will develop in which protective notices must be served on them as well.  I take the Deputy's point that it does seem to be discrimination, having regard to the colour of the collar, and that this can cause a certain amount of unrest.  I do not know what is the answer at this stage but I take the Deputy's point that it is something to be looked into.</P>
    <P>I must say Deputy Kemmy struck a very sympathetic note with me when he mentioned our canals.  We have a lot to answer for by allowing the Royal Canal to fall into its present state of disuse. Indeed I regret to say that most of the damage was done in my native county, Longford, where many of the bridges were removed, flattened, a culvert put in and the canal finished for navigation.  It was short-sighted at the time.  It is something with which I must familiarise myself.  I think there is a sort of tug-o'-war as between a number of bodies as to who should have responsibility for either the praise or blame for what happened to the canals then.  This is something that will have to be clarified.  Certainly I share his view that our canals constitute an environmental asset and as feats of engineering are quite outstanding.  They deserve to be preserved so that they will be available for generations to come to provide whatever amenities they can to enhance the quality of life here.  Of course they have great tourist potential. I know that some work is in progress on <Col N="281" /> the Royal Canal at present and I would be concerned to see that that would be expanded.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear also Deputy Kemmy's comment with regard to the records.  This could be very interesting social history.  I will certainly look into that and will direct the attention of the State Archivist to these records.  I have no doubt that with his expertise they could be rescued and collated in whatever way is deemed proper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor spoke of Dublin traffic&mdash;I have dealt with that&mdash;and of the need for radical changes.  I want to assure the House that it will be my intention to continue the work started by my predecessor with regard to the Transportation Task Force to ensure that they are encouraged to devise initiatives and innovations that will improve Dublin traffic, even radical ones that people might not care for at first sight, and press on also with the Dublin Transportation Authority so that if radical innovations have to be introduced there will be a body there to give them statutory effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor was concerned also with the Tallaght situation.  I think I mentioned that one of the proposals before me is for a commuter line to Tallaght.  It seems an appropriate area in which to introduce such a facility.  Having regard to the size and continuing growth of that whole area of the city, that has to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock raised the question of CIE and road haulage.  Of course that opens an immense question and goes back to the fundamentals of transport policy.  CIE were in road haulage in certain ways and are still in road haulage in a differing way.  It may be that their involvement is the proper one for CIE and that for the private sector the haulage that the Deputy sees at Mallow and the other beet factories may be the appropriate way with which to deal with that product.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy spoke on the situation as it affects him in South Tipperary.  He said that the bus service in South Tipperary is not good and that buses do not seem to recognise pick-up points.  He was possibly talking about Expressway buses <Col N="282" /> which have not pick-up points because they are express buses going on long distance journeys without intermediate stops.  I will look into that for the Deputy and see if the position can be improved. He said that holders of travel vouchers from the Department of Social Welfare were not being transported by certain private operators.  I regret to hear that but I promise the Deputy I will look into that position and see what is happening and the improvements that can be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested that I visit Inchicore.  I look forward with pleasure to visiting the Inchicore Works because, as I said already, I am aware that there is a great residue of skill there and I am very anxious to see the Inchicore works and meet the craftsmen employed there. I have covered most of the points raised in the debate.  I want again to thank Deputies for contributing to the debate. Their contributions will be taken seriously and will be considered in regard to some very fundamental thinking about our whole transport policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loftus raised the question of the implementation of various traffic management techniques.  I assure him that all of those techniques will be considered by the task force and implemented. Some of them, such as bus lanes, have been implemented and any others which are suitable will be implemented as well.  He asked about the possibility of allowing taxis to use the bus lanes.  At the moment we do not have standard type taxis and it would not be possible to permit that because it would not be possible to enforce it against other cars.  The Deputy also made a considerable point about the value of CIE property and if its use was maximised a lot of the capital problems in CIE would be solved.  CIE are conscious of the need to maximise their property but they are conservative in parting with property because they have been criticised for parting with property a couple of decades ago and there is a need for that now.  They will have to be conservative.  The amount of property which could be freed for that purpose would not be significant having regard to the total capital requirements of CIE.</P>
    <P>The next step which faces us is the <Col N="283" /> consideration of the McKinsey Report. I look forward to that debate with a mixture of apprehension and anticipation because it will certainly throw up problems with whatever solutions it may also throw up.  There are immense social and economic considerations in this but I believe the time has now come when they will have to be grasped and radical changes will be called for.  It is heartening to know that there is an interest in the House on a non-party political basis and I have no doubt that, with the goodwill of all sides in the House and all sections in the community, a solution will be found.</P>

      <Col N="284" /> Braitheann tionsclaíocht agus eacnamaíocht na tíre go mór ar chumas agus éifeacht Bhord Soláthar an Leictreach-ais. Ó bhunú an bhoird sin nuair a cuireadh tús le Scéim na Sionainne go luath tar éis bhunú an Stáit féin, is mór mar a chuir BSL le dul chun cinn na tíre.</P>
    <P>Mura mbeadh an tslí ina mbíonn an bord ullamh chun freastal ar riachtanaisí fuinnimh a bhíonn ag dul i méid i gcónaí ní thiocfadh an borradh agus an fás sin, san eacnamaíocht, ar a bhfuilimíd ag braith chun fostaíocht a sholáthar dár ndaoine óga.  Is chun deimhin a dhéanamh de go mbeidh sé ar chumas an bhoird leanúint leis an dea obair sin atá an Bille seo á chur ós comhair na Dála agam inniu.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £1,200 million to £1,400 million the limit on total expenditure by the ESB for capital purposes.  Deputies will be aware that the primary function of the ESB under the Electricity Supply Acts is to ensure the adequate supply and distribution of electricity throughout the State.  The board have a number of other subsidiary functions but we are concerned here with the board's main responsibility, to ensure that electricity will not be in short supply at any time.</P>
    <P>The history of electricity generation since the establishment of the ESB more than 50 years ago has shown that although there were periods when demand levelled off, overall there has been a steady increase in electricity consumption over the years.  This is illustrated as follows.  In 1930 the ESB had 50,000 customers and sold 43 million units of electricity.  In the year ended March 1980 the ESB had one million customers and sold 8,560 million units of electricity.  This means that a 20-fold increase in customers created sales almost 200 times greater.</P>
    <P>To meet this demand there has been an essential and continuing capital investment in electricity generating plant and networks.  Today generating capacity stands at 3090 MW. compared with something in the region of 85 MW when the ESB were in their infancy.  This reflects <Col N="285" /> our increasing reliance on electricity in industry, commerce and the home and demonstrates its essential function in the economic and social expansion of the country.  Electricity now accounts for about 31 per cent of our energy requirements.</P>
    <P>It is in the nature of things that demand for electricity can be expected to increase, but planning to meet that demand is now more complex that ever. The long lead time of eight years or more required for the construction of base load plant means that we are now building to meet expected electricity demand at the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>Planning over such a long period requires flexibility.  This is why flexibility is an integral part of the plant programme currently approved in respect of the ESB. The plant programme envisages an additional capacity of 1,435 MW, towards the end of the decade.  About 32 per cent of this is in the form of combustion turbines. These are intended to meet peak demand.  Because of the relatively short lead time of about three years their construction can be put back in tandem with any fall-off in electricity demand, for whatever reason.  This is the flexible element of the plant programme.</P>
    <P>Of course increased investment in plant entails expansion and improvement of transmission and distribution networks. A significant proportion of the ESB's capital investment goes into such works.</P>
    <P>But there is another direction which our energy strategy must take.  We must decrease as much as possible our dependence on oil.  At present, generating capacity is about 54 per cent oil-fired.  In the knowledge that oil is rapidly becoming scarce it is only prudent that we should not keep all our energy eggs in that particular basket.  This is why base load plant recently constructed and currently under construction is intended to be fired by fuels other than oil.</P>
    <P>A significant diversification away from oil will have been achieved when the 900MW coal-fired station at Moneypoint has been commissioned between 1985 <Col N="286" /> and 1988.  Construction of an additional 80MW of peat-fired plant and the prospect of over 45MW of plant burning low grade native coal will ensure maximum use of native resources and make a further contribution to the programme of diversification.  Thus, towards the end of the eighties we will have reduced to just over 40 per cent the amount of our generating capacity which is dependent on oil.</P>
    <P>While the plant programme which I have outlined is the mainstay of our strategy in relation to diversification for electricity generation we would be lacking in responsibility if we did not assess the prospects of alternative energy sources in the face of finite and shrinking conventional resources.  The ESB are playing their role in this regard.  A practical example of this is the board's current windpower programme.  Four medium sized wind turbines will be sited in four different locations to gain first-hand knowledge of the economics, efficiency, reliability and availability of wind energy in the Irish environment.  The programme will cost an estimated £630,000.</P>
    <P>An alternative source being examined is biomass.  This project is EEC supported and is being carried out in conjunction with Bord na Móna and the Forestry and Wildlife Service.  The ESB in fact have been successfully using wood waste and thinnings combined with slack in their smaller stations.  In the field of wave energy, the board participate in tests being carried out in Japan and Britain and monitor developments world wide.  A number of rivers have been surveyed for small hydro potential and work on a project for the Ballisodare river is continuing.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the ESB have played an important role in energy conservation in the domestic and industrial sectors.  Since 1974 the ESB's advisory service for industry has been helping industry to achieve economies in energy usage through conservation and efficient usage.</P>
    <P>In the domestic sector, the board have launched publicity campaigns with various conservation themes, including the issue of leaflets and booklets on the efficient <Col N="287" /> use of energy.  It is interesting to note that many of the applicants for grants under my Department's attic insulation scheme are the result of promotional activity by the board.</P>
    <P>Since the early seventies the ESB have been interested in the prospects of district heating and a project demonstrating the commercial use of residual heat derived from electricity generation is now well advanced at the Lanesboro power station. This extracted heat is sold to tomato growers to heat specially constructed glasshouses adjacent to the station.  District heating studies are being undertaken in the Dublin inner city areas and the Mahon Peninsula near Cork city.  The ESB have been commissioned by Dublin Corporation to study the possibility of incinerating refuse to fuel the Ballymun district heating system.  This system at present uses oil.</P>
    <P>There is also the prospect that natural gas will be piped to Dublin and other centres of high population density within the next couple of years.  All these developments taken together should contribute towards bringing down the level of peak demand for electricity.  This, in turn, should contribute to a reduction in capital investment on new plant in the long term.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable regret that the electricity interconnector with the North has been out of action since 1975.  The interconnector proved its value when it was in operation in the early seventies.  If it had remained undamaged it would have enhanced our security of electricity supply, provided considerable savings in fuel consumption, created the prospect of significant savings in capital investment in plant and provided profitable opportunities for trading of electricity. I am sure it is the will of this House and of the people as a whole that those responsible should realise the immeasurable damage to the economy their action has caused.  The Government are determined to pursue their efforts to achieve maximum security of supply and efficiency of operation which interconnection with other electricity grids can provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Deputies will be aware of the capital and labour intensive nature of the electricity supply industry.  For example the capital budget of the ESB in 1981 is expected to be about £209 million.  The bulk of this is for construction of plant but some £70 million will be spent on improvement of networks.  The number of new jobs arising out of that expenditure is expected to be in the region of 1,350.</P>
    <P>The expected breakdown of capital expenditure in the period 1982 to 1985 is as follows: generation projects £700 million; transmission, £150 million; distribution, £200 million; premises and general, £50 million.  The existing statutory limit on capital expenditure by the ESB was increased by £500 million to £1,200 million under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1979.  This was sufficient to meet the ESB's requirements for about two years and the stage has been reached where capital expenditure by the ESB in excess of the present limit is unavoidable.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, that the limit should be raised to enable the ESB to get on with their capital programme.  The increase now proposed will meet the ESB's requirements for only about a year.  However, the ESB have put proposals to my Department that future statutory limits should be expressed as a borrowing limit as in the case of other State bodies such as Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis Éireann and not as an expenditure limit.  The proposed increase in the expenditure limit is therefore an interim measure until my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance, have considered the ESB's alternative proposals.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba Mhaith liom an deis seo a thógaint chun comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as ucht do thoghadh inné.  Tá an-áthas ormsa gur toghadh tú agus fáiltím romhat ins an Chathaoir annseo.  Ba mhaith liom chomh maith comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht a thoghadh agus as ucht an deis atá tugtha <Col N="289" /> dó bheith páirteach i gnothú agus forbairt polasaí fuinnimh, obair fíor-thábhach-tach atá le déanamh aige agus obair an-suimiúil ar fad.  Tá mé cinnte go mbain-fidh sé taitneamh agus sásamh as an méid is féidir a dhéanamh ar son na tíre san Roinn ina bhfuil sé ag gníomhú.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and I personally welcome it since I think it was my Bill.  It meets a particular purpose that has to be met&mdash;and urgently, as the Minister has explained&mdash;but for reasons he mentioned it is an interim measure and probably by the end of the year or next year there will be perhaps a more comprehensive and definitive Bill coming before the House in regard to the limitation on the capital expenditure of the ESB.  I refer to limitation in relation to the normal procedure followed in cases such as this whereby limits are laid down which generally ensure that the affairs of the State company involved&mdash;in this case the ESB &mdash; come before the Oireachtas every two or three years.  The Minister has taken the opportunity in introducing the Bill of giving us a fairly wide-ranging account of the activities of the ESB and other activities which impinge on those activities.  It is useful that he has done so.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should begin with a query that I want to put to the Minister and on which he may be able to give some information. I understand that the result of a ballot by the group of unions in the ESB was expected about the end of last month on proposals for a comprehensive agreement which involved in many ways quite new concepts in industrial relations.  If the Minister can give any information on the outcome of that ballot I would appreciate it.  The potential of the comprehensive agreement is very considerable and its importance for the ESB and for the economy in general cannot be overestimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an assumption in the past and there is an echo of it in the Minister's speech, although he does qualify it&mdash;correctly in my view&mdash;that growth in demand for electricity was a necessary concomitant of growth in the economy. That may not be so in future and certainly is unlikely to be so to the same extent as in the past.  There are other reasons for <Col N="290" /> saying that but if one considers the development of natural gas one can see by definition that if natural gas is developed on anything like the scale envisaged it must of necessity mean lower demand for electricity than would have otherwise come about.  I mention this because it affects the planning of the generating capacity of the ESB in the future.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, when one talks about the generating capacity of the ESB one talks of something that is (a) very expensive; one talks of millions of pounds and (b) something that has a very long lead time.  It is true, as the Minister said, that part of the programme on which the ESB are embarking is designed to give a degree of flexibility in that regard.  That is as it should be.  But I mention this point because I wish to urge the Minister to satisfy himself that the necessary account is being taken in the planning of the ESB generating capacity of the changes which are likely to occur as a result of the development of natural gas and any other developments that may take place.  I am not saying that adequate account of that has not been taken but the programme was drawn up without regard to the developments that are now about to take place in regard to natural gas.  The question is whether the degree of flexibility which is built into the ESB programme is sufficient to ensure that we do not embark on very heavy and unnecessary expenditure in the provision of generating capacity which will perhaps turn out to be considerably surplus to our requirements. That situation must be re-examined and the re-examination must take place in the Department of Energy and not merely in the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy are now geared to carry out such an examination effectively.  It was not always so.  One of the aims in setting up the Department was to ensure that the Department dealing with the ESB and other State bodies was geared to deal with them on a level of professional competence that had not been possible in the past.  It is not putting the case too far to say that for many years past the relevant Department dealing with, say, the ESB and to some extent with Bord na Móna was in no position <Col N="291" /> when proposals were put forward by the ESB for the development of generating capacity and other long-term developments to assess those plans and proposals. In effect, it simply acted as a conduit pipe passing on the proposals to the Department of Finance where they were assessed primarily on a financial and, to a lesser extent, economic basis.  The Department dealing directly with the ESB was not in a position to assess the proposals put forward.</P>
    <P>That position, I am glad to say, is changing, and changing fast.  The effect of the change is certainly of benefit to the taxpayer but is also of benefit to the ESB and similar bodies.  The ESB are finding it more satisfactory to deal with a Department which is geared to talk to them than was the case in the past and to discuss on their merits proposals which the ESB put forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of his speech the subject of interconnection. I agree with all he has said on that topic.  However, I should like to enter a small <i>caveat</i> in relation to a reference to interconnection which was made in the agreed policy document referred to yesterday as the &ldquo;Gaiety Theatre document&rdquo;. There seems to me to be a reference in it to the effect that the Coalition Government are going to go ahead and restore the interconnector and ensure its protection.  There is an inference in that, which I hope was unintentional, which was echoing some of the propaganda we get from time to time from certain sources on the other side of the Border. It cannot be stressed too often that the destruction of the inter-connector on each occasion it was destroyed took place on the Northern side of the Border, not on the Southern side and not in a way that could be controlled in any way by the security forces answerable to Dáil Eireann and the Government elected by Dáil Éireann.  The question of restoration of the interconnector is not one within the control or the competence of the Government.  If it were it would have been restored a long time ago.  I fully support what the Minister has said about the desirability of restoring the interconnector <Col N="292" /> and I fully support what he has said about the considerable sums of money which could be saved to people in both parts of Ireland if the interconnector was operating but I reiterate that the responsibility for the destruction of the interconnector and the responsibility for its restoration does not lie with the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the ESB involvement in the development of alternative energy sources and I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the board on the work done in this regard.  I hope it is not unfair to say that the ESB was not over-enthusiastic about the development of alternative energy sources for some time but the board has tackled the problem in a workmanlike way and in a manner that will be of considerable importance in the future.  The Minister has detailed what the ESB is doing this year in regard to wind power. I do not know what the outcome will be of the work being done by the ESB and other bodies, including the Department of Energy, on the development of wind power.  Nobody knows that but I am aware that that work is necessary in order to establish what potential there is for the development of wind power in Irish conditions. Those conditions are quite different from conditions experienced in other countries.  We are aware of this from practical experience because some of the wind generators which were designed for and suitable to conditions in other countries are totally unsuitable to conditions on the west coast.  Indeed, they collapsed under the conditions prevailing on the west coast.</P>
    <P>We have to establish the kind of wind generator that will be suitable to our conditions, the kind of electricity generation one can expect in such circumstances and the most appropriate area for development. One possible area, of course, is feeding into the national grid and that is being explored by the ESB.  However, on the face of it that is unlikely to be the major use for wind power.  The generation of electricity for an average sized farm, particularly one operating a milking parlour and the other paraphernalia of a modern farm, seems to have considerable <Col N="293" /> potential.  Water-pumping and drainage also seem to be an area of considerable potential.  I should like to pay tribute to the ESB for the manner in which it is tackling this problem.  It could be argued by the ESB that it is not really part of their function to develop alternative sources of energy but while that might be strictly true the ESB is one of our major State agencies with a degree of professional competence available to it as well as financial resources which are unique.  As an agency of the State it is perhaps better placed than almost any other body to tackle a problem of this type.</P>
    <P>Over the years the ESB have been willing to take on tasks which, strictly speaking, are not within their basic terms of reference but which in the national interest should be tackled.  In this connection I might mention that not so very long ago I had occasion to be abroad and to meet some of the representatives of the ESB, in the Middle East particularly, where they were carrying out consultancy work.  I was particularly impressed with the calibre of the people concerned and of the work they were doing.  We tend not to know very much about this here and we undervalue the contribution that the ESB have been making in this area. If I mention one aspect of this it will underline the value of the contribution that is being made.  I do not think I am disclosing any secrets when I say that the previous Government were very concerned about the fact that in certain areas of engineering we had a considerable shortage of engineers.  As a result there were bottlenecks developing in areas where there were pockets of unemployment which could have been relieved if we could supply one of two engineers and hundreds of people could have been employed.  We studied this matter.  A very considerable effort on the part of the previous Government went into this to try to identify the problems and to see how they could be tackled.</P>
    <P>In the course of this effort it was learned that a number of foreign firms were recruiting engineers even before they had graduated, even though we had a shortage of engineers here.  We surveyed <Col N="294" /> the availability of engineers in all walks of life and the output of engineers of our various institutions of third level education and the output of technicians. One of the matters that we quickly came up against was that the ESB had a considerable number of well qualified engineers operating abroad and we had a shortage of engineers in our own country and were trying to devise methods of getting more Irish engineers available to our economy.  On the face of it the ESB should have been told to stop their operations abroad and bring the engineers home and thereby help to relieve unemployment. But in fact when the whole thing was assessed and the value to the overall national economy was assessed it was found that despite the difficulties that I have mentioned the contribution of the ESB engineers abroad was immeasurably greater than if they had been brought home, considerable as the contribution at home could have been.  I mention this to underline the importance of the work that is being done by the ESB abroad although it was not started upon for that reason at all.  The importance of that work is not generally realised here at home.  The whole policy was started during the recession in the mid-seventies when the ESB found itself with a surplus staff and set up consultancy work abroad merely to find employment for that surplus staff and the whole operation has developed since then.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to the biomass experiment to which the Minister referred.  Again there is work being done in that area which is not generally known but which also has very considerable importance and has been partly assisted by the European Community because of its potential importance for the whole community.  Basically what is involved is the effort to grow trees which would be capable of being mechanically harvested in three to four years and would grow again and be harvested again in another three to four years without re-planting, and so on for about 20 years.  The timber so harvested would be used to generate electricity.  That is basically what is involved.  Within that simple outline there are of course a number of areas of <Col N="295" /> uncertainty, areas for working out and determining the optimum method of approach, for instance, the type of tree, the soil, the type of mechanical harvester, the type of generating station most suited to the combustion of this type of timber for the purposes of generating electricity, and so on.</P>
    <P>A lot of work has been done in all these areas but further work needs to be done and is being done.  Again I congratulate the ESB on the work they have been doing in this area.  They have not of course worked alone but in conjunction with Bórd na Móna, an Foras Talúntais and I think NBST.  The work is very worthwhile and has considerable potential for the future.  I suppose the potential that is most appropriate in the minds of some people would be that the cut-away bog would be used for this purpose so that areas which have traditionally been supplying fuel would continue to supply fuel to the whole nation through the ESB. But the growing of biomass is not of course confined to cut-away bog.</P>
    <P>In talking of some of these activities of the ESB the Minister mentioned the Lanesboro' project.  Here I want to strike a different note to the one I have been striking up to now in regard to the ESB. I am not happy that the Lanesboro' project has been tackled with the same degree of urgency and commitment that has characterised some of the other activities of the ESB.  I hope I am not wronging the ESB in saying that but it seems from what I have known of it that the progress in that area was much too slow or too leisurely. We were talking about a development over the next five or seven years and that should have taken place by now or certainly by next year at the latest.  I would urge the Minister to pursue that aspect of the ESB's activities to see can it be speeded up and brought to a successful conclusion more quickly.  I know it is all experimental but that is an area where the ESB, the Department of Energy and the European Community are subsidising the operation.  So it is not as though the people who are taking glass houses in Lanesboro' to be heated by surplus heat from the Lanesboro' power <Col N="296" /> station are being asked to make huge and risky commitments.  If such people feel that that is so, it should not just be confined to people within a short radius of Lanesboro'.  It might be thrown open to people from any part of the country who would be interested in tackling this experiment to their benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the likelihood or the possibility of the piping of natural gas.  The situation should be that later this month it should be possible to determine the successful tender for the laying of the pipeline from Cork to Dublin.  The tenders were opened before I left office and I know there is more work to be done analysing them to find out the full story of each one.  However, it seems to me that the work done to date on the project has been very satisfactory.  I do not want to go into detail on the matter now.  Apart from the fact that it would not be in order, I think it would be premature, but I can say that all the indications are that as a result of the approach I adopted as Minister for Energy the taxpayer is likely to save many millions of pounds&mdash;perhaps £50 million.  I am anxious to see that project to ahead as quickly as possible, hopefully without cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The provision of natural gas as another widespread source of energy in the Dublin area and in the towns adjoining the pipeline from Cork to Dublin, with extensions to other towns and areas, represents potentially a very substantial change in the pattern of energy consumption. As I said earlier, it is of great importance to the forward planning of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that there have been discussions in connection with the possible extension of the pipeline to bring natural gas to Belfast.  I was interested to note recently a statement made in the British House of Commons to the effect that as a result of discussions at ministerial and official levels there seemed to be at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for the laying of a pipeline to Belfast, that it was to be examined in detail by technically qualified people and, that as a result, the proposals of the British Government for closing down the town gas industry in Northern Ireland were being postponed for six months to enable this <Col N="297" /> work to be carried out.  I think in the rush of recent events that announcement may not have obtained a great deal of publicity but I think it is one of some significance.</P>
    <P>Another activity of the ESB which the Minister touched on and which has considerable potential relates to Arigna.  I do not think the Minister mentioned Arigna but I am sure that is what he had in mind. I am talking about the development of native natural resources.  Up to now the ESB have been so dependent on oil that the escalating price of oil has affected very considerably the cost of industrial production and of commercial and domestic heating and cooking.  Already a change is envisaged primarily arising out of the use of natural gas by the ESB for the purpose of generating electricity. As a result the percentage of units generated by the ESB from different energy sources for the year ended March 1980 was 64 per cent from oil, 16 per cent from peat, 11 per cent from gas, 8 per cent from hydro and 1 per cent from coal.  I do not have the final figures for the year ended March 1981; the Minister may have the verified figures but, as I understand it, they are likely to work out at oil 55 per cent, peat 16 per cent, gas 20 per cent, hydro 8 per cent and coal 1 per cent. The switch there is a reduction in oil use and an increase in gas use and that is as it should be because we are talking about using natural gas which is a native resource.  There is a question as to whether that is the best use of our natural gas but I am not going into that matter now.  I am simply adverting to the switch in the use of native resources from imported resources.</P>
    <P>All of this brings me back to Arigna because the ESB have a considerable role to play in that regard.  We must accept that on land at any rate, whatever about offshore, our resources of coal are limited, certainly in quality.  Recently a study of those resources was completed and a further more detailed study is under way on the question of the most effective way of developing our coal resources.  What has emerged so far is that we have quite extensive coal resources in different parts of the country, most of which are low grade. <Col N="298" /> One of the areas in which we have substantial resources of low-grade coal is the Arigna area.  There the coal is approximately 55 per cent stone and it is almost impossible to imagine it being usable for the generation of electricity.  The application of flouridised bed techniques in conditions appropriate to the burning of that coal in the Arigna area &mdash; I say that because the flouridised bed technique is international &mdash; meant a good deal of work by the ESB and the consultants they employ to devise the right method of utilising the crow coal available in the Arigna area.  In effect, that has been done and the technique I have mentioned has been achieved.  The ESB were given approval in principle for the building of a generating station at Arigna for the purpose of utilising that low-grade coal. It is estimated there is a supply for at least 25 years in that area to keep the generating station going.</P>
    <P>That is not the only coal resource we have.  The ESB, in developing the necessary technique for burning low grade coal at Arigna, are performing a useful function which could be extended and applied to other low grade deposits of coal to enable us to concentrate on utilising native resources for the generation of electricity.  The degree to which we can do this means we can save on imported oil or imported coal to which the ESB have to switch to avoid undue dependence on oil.  It is always possible that we will discover our own oil and I hope we will do so in the not too distant future.  If we do, no matter how much we discover, it will be a finite resource.  It does not mean that we can let it flow or burn it insatiably for the purpose of generating electricity.  That would not be the correct use of it.  We have an obligation to utilise all the possible sources of energy available to us within our jurisdiction.  If we have the cushion of our oil it will make it easier to tackle the problems of developing our own resources.  Whether we have our own oil or not the obligation will be on us.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned the major native resource we have which is used to a great extent by the ESB and that is turf.  I did not mention it because we are all familiar <Col N="299" /> with that operation.  As I indicated, the ESB generated approximately 16 per cent of its electricity from peat in the year ended March 1980 and the year ended March 1981.  We hope to see that stepped up.  Bord na Móna are engaged on a development programme of their own. We hope also to see more turf made available through the scheme of grants designed to encourage the private producer of turf.  To the extent that we use more turf for domestic, commercial or industrial purposes we are reducing the demand for electricity and imported oil.</P>
    <P>In all these areas the ESB have a vital role to play, much wider and of greater significance in regard to our overall energy policy and use of native resources than might be apparent at first glance, particularly if one glances at the degree to which the ESB are at present dependent on imported oil.  That does not give the whole picture.  I have tried to outline some aspects of the situation to show the vital importance of the ESB and their activities in the development of our own native fuel resources.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to get his Department to pay attention to the plans of the ESB for the installation of generation capacity, in the light of developments, particularly of natural gas, which I have outlined.  With the best will in the world the ESB have to be prejudiced in favour of the development of a generation capacity which people outside the ESB might think excessive.  The factors that go into that are many, not least the experience of the ESB over the years where the pressure for growth and to produce more electricity has been enormous.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, the pattern the ESB have known all along is likely to change because of the development of natural gas and so on.  It is necessary that people other than the ESB examine their programme critically.  It has also to be taken into account that they &mdash; the Minister mentioned this &mdash; have to ensure that at any given time there is no shortage of electricity.  Therefore, they have to cater for tremendous peaks of demand in <Col N="300" /> the depth of winter not only domestically and commercially but with industry at maximum demand also.  To do this requires a considerable amount of spare capacity, the minimum being the equivalent of the largest generating station because if that goes out the ESB have to be able to cater for it.</P>
    <P>I had occasion some time ago to see an electricity generating station operating in Denmark.  This station had interconnection to Sweden, Norway and Germany all at the same time.  That kind of interconnection where one would be able to switch when the load is heavy in one country and at a lower peak in another is a tremendous luxury.  We do not have that luxury.  We do not even have interconnection with Northern Ireland.  I hope in due course that not only will we have an interconnection there but with the rest of the EEC either through Britain or directly to the continent through the south of Ireland or perhaps both.  However, it is probably so far away that it will not affect the plans for installed generating capacity of the ESB over the next seven or eight years.  Nevertheless, it is something to be borne in mind and pushed ahead with as soon as possible. With the best will in the world it will be a slow process.  I am aware that there are working parties operating on this.  There may be a report due shortly from that working party.  I will not go into that but would urge the Minister to keep up pressure in that area, because to have interconnection with the rest of the European Community could save us many millions of pounds in the cost of installed generating capacity.  It is well worth our while to push ahead with that.  If we have an interconnector we can sell electricity as well as buy it.</P>
    <P>It would be a bit unrealistic of me, in discussing this ESB Bill and the programme for generating capacity in the future, to sit down without referring to the nuclear option.  The proposal for a nuclear power station at Carnsore originated with the ESB, naturally enough, because they are the only body who are supplying electricity here and therefore are interested in this area.  The procedure which would be necessary if there were <Col N="301" /> to be any progress with a proposal to erect a nuclear power station has been outlined on a number of occasions.  Basically it involves the publication of a report by an inter-departmental committee which has not yet been completed. Hopefully it will be a factual report on the various aspects of electricity generation by nuclear power including not just safety aspects but financial and economic aspects.</P>
    <P>With the provision of that hopefully factual information, it would then be possible to have legislation enacted in this and the other House which would provide for the setting up of a tribunal of inquiry. The powers of that tribunal would incorporate the powers vested in the local authority in Wexford under the Planning Acts and one or two other Acts as well. When the public inquiry takes place interested parties will be able to make their submissions.  A report will then be prepared and submitted to the Government of the day.  Then and only then will a decision be made on whether or not a nuclear power station should be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>It is clear enough from the figures available to us on the likely demand for electricity and the likely sources of supply that the urgency which some people thought existed in regard to the provision of a nuclear station does not exist at present.  We have a greater amount of breathing space in which to consider this matter.  I have no desire to preempt any decisions which might be made in that regard.  However, I want to draw attention to one aspect of this matter which does not often get much of a public airing. Usually when this matter is referred to we are told about the safety aspects and people get very worked up on one side in particular, and sometimes on the other side.</P>
    <P>The safety aspects are very important but there is another aspect which has to be considered also.  Even if the safety aspects were satisfactorily dealt with &mdash;and that includes the disposal of waste, and so on&mdash;the proposition would not make any sense unless it were an economic proposition.  This brings me back <Col N="302" /> to what I said earlier when I referred to the fact that we have no interconnector. We tend to forget that we are a small island.  I am talking about the whole island now.  A nuclear electricity generating station, if we had one, would be more than adequate at full strength for the whole island.  To be economical it would have to be able to supply electricity outside this island for considerable portions of its running time.  If it were not able to do that&mdash;I have not got the final figures&mdash; I doubt very much from what I know that it would be an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>There is a growing case for interconnection to a source which has a nuclear power station available to it and taking electricity from that source.  In economic terms it is doubtful that a nuclear power station can be justified in this country.  I am not offering that as a definitive opinion because I do not know, but I suspect it strongly from what I do know.  I mention this topic merely because it would be unrealistic for me to conclude on this Bill without referring to it.  I want to underline this: the fact that I have referred to it does not mean I think a nuclear power station is likely to come about here in the near future.  On the contrary I believe that is not so.  Apart from any safety aspects I have considerable doubts about the economic aspects of it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to reiterate my support for this Bill and my admiration in general for the work the ESB have been doing over the years, and are doing now.  I want to refer also to the importance that I believe attaches to the role of the ESB in the whole economic life of this country, a role which is far greater than would appear on the surface. I have considerable pleasure in supporting the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the many tributes paid to the ESB in this House and outside it.  Since the foundation of this State they have rendered a national service and discharged their duties in a manner which has won the admiration and affection of all our people.  They have made a wonderful contribution.  Having regard to their record of work, service and dedication, <Col N="303" /> any legislation introduced to deal with the ESB should meet with the approval of every Member of the House and the entire population.</P>
      <P>It is right to salute the founders of the ESB and their technicians, advisers and engineers of the highest standard who have won respect and admiration far away from Irealnd where the ESB have been carrying out extremely constructive work at international level.  Due to the vision of those early pioneers in the ESB a tremendous amount has been accomplished and achieved within a very short time, because 50 years in the lifetime of any country is a very short period.  For that reason I salute the ESB past and present and express the hope that all their future efforts will be crowned with success. Their great contribution to this country and in recent years on the continent of Africa and elsewhere is remarkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to a very important point.  Since we became Europeans&mdash; I should not say that because we were always part of Europe geographically&mdash; in recent years all our minds are directed towards the activities of Europe as members of the Community.  Many in public life seem to be directing their attention and energies far from the shores of this country, at the same time forgetting that we are Irish, that we have our own country to look after, our own nation to develop and likewise our own energy resources to develop.  We Irish are an extremely generous people when it comes to helping others, when it comes to speaking and assisting in the propaganda of other countries abroad, but we seldom display the same courage in the development of our own resources and our own country.  Every Irishman, no matter what kind of European label may be tagged on to his coat, has an interest and duty to look after the development of his own country.  The former Minister for Energy will forgive me for making this comment, but it appears that much energy had been devoted towards our European co-operation and advancement and development of the Community <Col N="304" /> as a whole while at the same time forgetting our own national interests.</P>
    <P>Some time in the future we will be brought to a realisation that our first duty is to our own country.  It is a fact that we must import oils.  I gather that in recent times the energies of the ESB have been devoted to cutting down on imports. Governments present and future in planning for the next decade and into the 2000s, will, I presume, likewise devote their energies towards cutting down as far as possible on imports.  We should be able to cut down very drastically on imports of oil without our people suffering inconvenience.  It is to be hoped that we will have our own energy for heating and light and that we will examine new methods of producing our own fuel for transport.  If the present Minister is not already aware &mdash; I am sure that the former Minister is &mdash; I can tell him that at present one or two nations in this world do not have to import any petroleum or oil whatever because they are able to manufacture their own oil from sugar cane.  If that is possible in these countries &mdash; two of them in particular &mdash; has it been examined at any stage here?</P>
    <P>There is a close relationship between sugar cane and the sugar beet that we process in this country.  Has any investigation been carried out into the suitability of sugar beet for the manufacture of petroleum?  Have the ESB, with their high standard and supreme quality of engineers and technicians, given any consideration to that aspect?  It may be that they have and found it to be unsuitable or uneconomical.  I do not know.  But I cannot recall reading any report or comment regarding the association of sugar beet with sugar cane from which in at least two countries a supply of petroleum of a very superior quality can be manufactured. These countries have no transport problems because this type of fuel is cheap for them.  It may take, say, four tons of sugar beet to produce about one ton weight of the petroleum and perhaps it would be completely and entirely uneconomical for us.  Nevertheless, it is worthy of some investigation.</P>
    <P>The cost of oil will never again be as low as it used to be.  If we are anxious to <Col N="305" /> cut down on our imports of oil we have to depend on the ESB to present us with a new situation in the provision of energy for heating and cooking for the normal family, for transport and particularly for industry.  In recent years since our farms have been modernised the farmers have been depending completely on electricity for milking machines and agricultural equipment.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a complete review of the whole structure of the ESB. We are now presented with supplies of natural gas.  When the pipeline from Cork to Dublin and, it is to be hoped, from Dublin to Belfast, is completed the contribution of natural gas will have changed the situation rather drastically for the ESB.  For that reason the ESB will be embarking on a new period of history. Before I leave the question of natural gas, which we all welcome, I pay tribute to everybody who has been connected with it.  I hope and trust that when the tenders have been examined and work is put in hands the responsible authorities will provide a map for the public showing the course of the pipeline, the towns and cities, as the case may be, which will be supplied with gas from the main line.  If this is done, there can be planning not alone at regional level, but also at county level and local authorities will be able to help and advise, particularly the district offices of the ESB.  With a measure of co-operation we should be able to cut down drastically on our imports of oil.</P>
    <P>The ESB have been working closely and satisfactorily with Bord na Móna. Everybody &mdash; not just in Parliament &mdash; should be four square behind the ESB in their efforts to utilise our natural resources.  How often must we plead in the House for the full development of our own natural resources?  The good Lord may not have blessed us with an extraordinarily exciting climate.  Nevertheless, our weather is never too hot or too cold, too dry or too wet.  For that reason, we are in a great position to develop the natural resources we have, namely, our fuel which is buried in the bottom of the earth.  While the rest of Europe and, perhaps, the rest of the world, with the exception of the Third <Col N="306" /> World countries, has developed all its natural resources, we, with native Government since the early twenties, are approaching the year 2000 with the greatest part of our mineral deposits undeveloped. What has been done in the last 50 years is merely scratching the surface.  I wonder what the future holds in relation to the development of our mineral resources.  I am anxious to know what contribution will come from European funds in order to develop our coal, bogs, light and heat.  The less we depend on the outsider, the better.  We have to stand on our own two feet in relation to this matter. The ESB and Bord na Móna have made a wonderful contribution. Together they have changed the face of my constituency.  If I were asked to paint a picture of the constituency of Laois-Offaly from the late thirties and forties and compare it with today, it is doubtful if any of the present generation would believe the transformation which has taken place as a result of the activities of the ESB and Bord na Móna and the co-operation between them.</P>
    <P>We have the ESB power station at Shannonbridge which has been extended and is one of the greatest developments which has taken place.  I wonder what has happened to the report of the late sixties in which the area of the Blackwater bog was recommended as one of the most suitable sites, on a par with Mount Lucas and Littleton in County Tipperary, for the construction of a briquette factory. For some reason or other, whether it is the present development of the power station at Shannonbridge or whether it was the policy of Bord na Móna and the ESB to spread their custom around in order to provide employment and to satisfy local demand, there was never any mention since of the construction of the briquette factory convenient to the Blackwater bog in the Shannonbridge area.  Could there be a more important area for development?  The Brosna River has been drained in recent years, where there is the greatest vein of turf and fuel in Ireland.  The ESB have one of the most satisfactory power stations standing on lands on which I often spent pleasant evenings, before there was ever any question <Col N="307" /> of a power station being constructed in these areas.  The amount of employment which has been given by the ESB in the Shannonbridge area has enriched probably every home in the locality.  The activities of Bord na Móna have, likewise, enriched community living in the area.  It meant more houses, more people, more schools, more children, more playgrounds, a greater demand in the local shops, a demand for more shops and consumption of more food.  It has completely changed the face of the Shannonbridge area from the time when I first visited it in the late forties.</P>
    <P>Nobody could compare Rhode, County Offaly, today with what it was like in the forties.  It can now be described as a town with vast new housing estates, lively activity and a growing parish, simply because the ESB constructed a fine new generating station in the locality. This was in the midst of one of the greatest bogs in County Offaly.  These bogs have been used for feeding the ESB generating station.  The amount of employment which has been given in that locality has changed the whole face of that area. There is a briquette factory at Mount Lucas in the heart of County Offaly. Before it was constructed there was no activity to be seen.  From time to time the gentry might be seen walking the bogs among the heather for the purpose of shooting and raising the necessary wildlife in order to enliven their sporting activities.  Today there is a vast difference and a great change because one of Ireland's great turf producing briquette factories is there, giving employment both permanent and temporary.  For that reason, the whole face of that locality has been changed completely as a result of the activities for the development of what was down in the ground and what was considered, many years ago, to be bogland. The bogs in those areas have been turned into gold for many families.  It is pitiful to see hundreds and thousands of acres of undeveloped, virgin bog which neither the ESB nor Bord na Móna have worked on.  What has been done in one area can be done in other areas.  There is a great future programme for both Bord <Col N="308" /> na Móna and the ESB to undertake jointly plans which may result in the cutting down of our oil imports and the obtaining of all our requirements from native turf.</P>
    <P>The town of Portarlington, once a town with few industries, was greatly improved by the arrival of the ESB and the construction of the great power station there, with the ensuing increase in employment and business for the community.  Perhaps the most dramatic change in my constituency brought about by the ESB is the new twin tower ESB station at Lumcloon, near Cloughan, County Offaly.  I often stood on the very land which that power station now occupies.  During the ESB chairmanship of the late Mr. Browne, I can recall making representations to a number of local farmers, one of whom is still alive at 95 years of age, in an attempt to encourage them to give their land to the ESB for the construction of this power station.  There was great hesitation then, because people did not realise the importance of these great electricity generating stations.  Four farmers eventually agreed to give their land and when the ESB completed the contract at the Lumcloon station, the town of Ferbane and the village of Cloughan were changed as a result of the employment given in what was the heart of the boglands. Because of the development of Boora Bog, it was eventually necessary to build a new Catholic Church in Boora to accommodate the local people.  Business was vastly increased.  The young people there had a hope which their fathers and grandfathers never had and a pay packet coming in each week which was far removed from the £2 or £2.10s for the sale of their grandfather's cow at the fair of Banagher or Birr.  These developments should continue at an even speedier rate because we have all the resources in other undeveloped parts of my constituency and of the country in general.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Bord na Móna and the ESB for the changing face of the counties of Offaly and Laois, of Coolnamona town below Portlaoise, where an individual was seldom seen but which is now a hive of activity because of its peat moss industry. In addition, in recent years, drainage <Col N="309" /> of the River Brosna in Offaly has helped the drainage of the bogs.  There is little use in draining bogs if there is nowhere for the water to go.  Here again, the Board of Works made their contribution. With Rhode and Portarlington, Shannonbridge and Mount Lucas, with the new briquette factory at Derrinlough, near Birr there has been a change in the heart of the country where nothing could be seen but a desolate and lonely expanse of bogland and heather.  Derrinlough can now be described as a hive of industry, producing briquettes for the home market and for export.  I am extremely proud to represent the constituency of Laois-Offaly, and that I have lived to see such extraordinary development, unbelievable when compared with the lack of development in the early forties.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise something which has been covered already by the speech of the former Tánaiste.  I refer to the necessity for the construction of coal-burning stations.  If native coal is to be used alongside turf, it is vital that we mine our coal and anthracite deposits. There are coal mines in my constituency which have coal for at least 200 years, in many parts of the Rossmore Collieries, at Woodhill, Doonane and Mayo in County Laois, bordering Carlow and Kilkenny but within County Laois.</P>
    <P>According to a survey undertaken many years ago by the British Government, some of the most productive coal areas are in County Laois.  The ESB and other Government agencies may think it uneconomic to take part in the development of that coal-mining industry.  May I place this project before the Department of Energy and, in particular, before the present new, young and energetic Minister?  Coal-mining has long been a tradition in the Rossmore area of County Laois.  Old miners still tell of their efforts down under the ground, mining coal and anthracite in the past.  Their fathers were coalminers and their sons and grandsons still are.  However, there seems to be a very limited amount of this work available now.</P>
    <P>I want to pay special tribute to the assistance given by the former Minister for Energy, Deputy Colley, during his <Col N="310" /> period of office.  He may recall the deputations of which I was a member.  He was extremely helpful in the re-opening of the coal mines in the Rossmore area, which gave a new ray of hope to the young miners of the area.  It takes a great man to be a coalminer.  It is skilled, traditional work which every man could not undertake.  The young and old miners, some of whom visited Deputy Colley when he was Minister, love the mines and can talk of nothing but the shafts, the flooding of the mines, the ways of raising coal.  Is it not regrettable that, whilst we see the development of coalmines in parts of Luxembourg, Germany and Britain, the people of Luxembourg, Germany or Britain do not seem to have cared about the development of our coalmining industry?  If we do not look, we will not get.  In the period which lies ahead, if we are eventually to have a drastic cutback in our oil imports, we must have energy.</P>
    <P>We must do something about the energy situation, irrespective of cost. What is cost when it comes to developing our natural resources and taking out of the earth what God gave us for man's use and benefit?  It must be remembered that national housekeeping is only bookkeeping and the same can be said for banking. The custodians of our national housekeeping do not appear to put sufficient emphasis on the development of our energy resources simply because we do not have the necessary financial wherewithal.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to our people and to future generations to develop our bogs and to mine the anthracite and coal, which are in abundance in the Leinster coalfields.  When the Castlecomer mines closed I did not believe that was the end of the coal in that area.  The old miners said there was coal there and I believe them.  Recent surveys tell of anthracite and coal in these areas.  If only we had a Coal Board with the enthusiasm and dedication that exists in the ESB.  We do not have a Coal Board.  Neither Bord na Móna nor the ESB are responsible.  I suppose it is not possible to get private enterprise to invest in coal development because of the cost of opening shafts, providing security and the cost of insurance <Col N="311" /> and protection of the workers, but the State has a responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>We have a young enthusiastic Government anxious to undertake new tasks and new responsibilities.  This is an area in which they could become involved.  They may say that our fuel and mineral resources have not been developed in the past but they should not be too critical because some efforts were made in that direction.  With new life, energy, faith and hope, there is no reason why they cannot develop our bogs and mines and so make a contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>We need the coal and anthracite which lie under the ground.  There are many virgin bogs all over this country.  Bord na Móna say that because of financial restrictions they cannot do what is necessary but must work to a plan.  The more money we invest, the more employment we create.  The greater the contribution of coal and turf to our economy, the fewer balance of payments problems we will have.</P>
    <P>I do not know what plans the ESB and Bord na Móna may have for the development of our fuel resources.  When the Bord na Móna Estimate is discussed in this House I hope Deputies on all sides will ensure that serious efforts are made to develop every bog in this country. These bogs could provide fuel which could be converted into briquettes and, if necessary, transported to our ESB stations. It is wrong to have such wealth under the soil while there are so many people, 140,000, unemployed.  How many more people in rural Ireland could Bord na Móna employ?</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the scheme which will provide grants to private bog owners to develop their bogs.  Some of these owners will avail of these grants, and I would like to see Bord na Móna qualifying for the extra money.  They have the machinery, the skill and the qualified personnel to help private bog owners.  Their staff could work as agents for the development of private bogs because this work must be undertaken on a large scale and using the most modern machinery.  This machinery must be used <Col N="312" /> by experts and such skills can only be provided by Bord na Móna.  I hope another look will be taken at this area.</P>
    <P>Before the change of Government I intended meeting the then Minister, Deputy Colley, about this matter because of discussions I had with Bord na Móna workers in my constituency and with a number of private bog owners.  The owners told me they could not undertake the necessary preliminary work because of the lack of skilled workers and up-to-date machinery and that the grant would not enable them to engage the services of such skilled workers and hire the necessary machinery, which is not available to the general public.  This means we must get Bord na Móna involved in this scheme.  They have seasonal and permanent workers who could be engaged developing private bogs and if this were done the temporary workers would be permanently employed.</P>
    <P>There is endless work to be undertaken in rural Ireland.  Any Government who do not undertake these tasks will have to account to the public every three or four years.  The development of the midlands and every part of Ireland depends on political will.  If the political will exists, anything can be done.  A country with 140,000 unemployed, with undeveloped bogs and untapped mines, with energy problems and with a home market which can use any energy sources produced, should be able to utilise these resources and so solve its problems.</P>
    <P>We have thousands of acres of cut-away bog suitable for planting a certain type of tree needed by the ESB.  I realise this pilot scheme is in its infancy but steps can be taken to prepare the cut-away bogs for these plantations.  With the co-operation of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Bord na Móna and the ESB there is an unlimited amount of productive work available.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the matter of industrial relations within the ESB.  We have now reached a stage where people cannot do without an electricity supply and in the event of an unofficial strike the whole country can be brought to a standstill within 24 hours. The farming industry can be paralysed; <Col N="313" /> cows cannot be milked and there is a high death rate in hatcheries.  Every form of agricultural activity now depends on electricity. Heat is also necessary in the home, especially for the sick and the elderly, and it is tragic that they are sometimes deprived of it.  The wheels of industry grind to a halt when the current is cut off.  Steps must be taken by the ESB to see that this never again takes place. There is too much to lose.</P>
    <P>There must be an improvement in relations between workers and management. Poor industrial relations are caused by lack of understanding and commonsense and by a failure to give and take.  One side cannot settle an argument or a dispute without the co-operation of the other.  The people will never again tolerate directors sitting in boardrooms taking all and giving nothing.  They have a duty to protect their employees and to look after their interests.  The disputes which happened in the past must be looked on as history and avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to nuclear power and there has been much talk in recent years in connection with the ESB's proposal to embark, with Government approval, on the construction of a nuclear power station.  Every Member knows my views on that subject &mdash; I am strongly anti-nuclear.  Deputy Colley did not wish to give a decision on the matter without going through the rounds of a public inquiry at which different interests would express their views and following which a report would be submitted to the Government for a decision.  Why waste all that time and personal energy?  Nuclear energy is dangerous.  It takes five years to construct a nuclear power station and it has a life of only 20 years.  Such a project would be uneconomic and would not make sense.  An accident could occur, such as that at Harrisburg, which would involve loss of life, grave danger to the health of many thousands of people and the destruction of bird and fish life.  Who would take the decision to go ahead with such a project in the light of all the possible dangers?  It should also be remembered that the number of jobs involved <Col N="314" /> would be very limited.</P>
    <P>The Government of Austria decided, following the building of a nuclear plant, to hold a referendum on the subject.  The people voted against nuclear power and the plant cannot now function because of their rejection.  We will not put the people to the trouble of having a referendum on whether or not to have nuclear energy. It will be rejected out of hand if I have anything to say about it.  A nuclear station here would put the environment at risk, the very air we breathe and the water we drink.  The whole environment could be destroyed by the nuclear hand of death if somebody forgot to pull a switch or pulled the wrong switch.  Let us not take the risks of Harrisburg or the risks that have been taken in other areas where nuclear stations have been erected.  I have read every document issued by the Council of Europe on nuclear plants and I am convinced that the quality of life in the locality of such a plant is at grave risk. I appeal to the Government to reject out of hand the erection of a nuclear station and not waste any more time with inquiries. I am sure the House will agree that we are living in an age in which we must consider a degree of economy.  I recommend that the Department of Energy exercise economy by not wasting time or money on inquiries about nuclear stations.</P>
    <P>If he can do so, will the Minister say what is the position in relation to the study being undertaken in connection with the Leinster coalfields, apart from the coalfields in my constituency that I have already mentioned?  Is this a study from which there will be a 500-page highly technical report above the heads and intelligence of the ordinary man to digest or will it be a report which will facilitate the immediate development of the Leinster coalfields?  Will we have to await this report for another three, five or seven years and when it is received will it be left on the shelves of Government offices to be taken down and read for the convenience of a variety of politicians? The Department of Energy should take the necessary steps to ensure that the production of the report is not delayed and that decisions are taken to implement <Col N="315" /> whatever part of the report is practical. This is vitally important.</P>
    <P>The ESB are charged with the responsibility of providing heat and light to homes.  I have pitied and sympathised with young married couples who, having erected and furnished their homes, then find that in rural Ireland vast sums, ranging from £500 to £1,500, have to be paid to the ESB for connecting the current to the house.  This has meant considerable hardship in some cases.  People who are being encouraged to set up homes and rear families in rural Ireland should be given more consideration and they should get lighting and heating without first having to pay for the poles and the wire.  The Department of Energy should introduce a scheme through the ESB so that people setting up house need not pay for the wire and poles but would only have to pay for the supply when they started using it.  If the ESB are to give a service it behoves the State to ensure that people only pay for the lighting and the heating.  There should be an additional subsidy to the ESB to eliminate this penal cost so that people can have electricity supplies connected to their homes without additional penury.  Many young people have to borrow money for this or else spend a long winter in cold and darkness. Steps should be taken to eliminate such hardship.</P>
    <P>I salute the ESB on their contributions to date.  They have a new future ahead of them.  I admire the quality of our engineers at home and abroad.  Irish engineers from Bord na Móna and the ESB go abroad and are looked upon as the pride of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope future years will prove fruitful for the ESB in relation to the development of our bogs and alternative power requirements.  I do not know if the Minister referred to how far they have gone in researching power from tidal waves, or what are those prospects.  For example, has there been a full examination carried out of what additional power might become available through harnessing of additional rivers apart from Poulaphouca <Col N="316" /> and Ardnacrusha on the Shannon?  There must be other sources of energy capable of development by the ESB to contribute to our energy requirements.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute also to the industrial concerns and trade unions who co-operated in the appeal for the saving of electricity.  The former Minister, Deputy Colley, toured the country in a campaign to advise people not to waste electricity. I do not know whether other Deputies have referred to that campaign but I think it was effective and has borne results in many industries and private homes in which a saving on electricity has been effected.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the day &mdash; though it is extremely doubtful that I shall live to see it &mdash; when we can stand on our own feet without the necessity to import oil, the day when we can meet our energy requirements through the fullest possible development of our peatland and our coal and anthracite resources which are there in abundance.  Do not mind the reports that contend it is not of high quality; one does not know its quality until it is mined, and a market can be obtained for it no matter what its quality. In the meantime it would create worth-while employment giving young people an assurance that they could obtain a day's work in the vicinity of a coalmine or an undeveloped bog.  Before long I hope we will see an effort being made by the ESB, in conjunction with Bord na Móna &mdash; a survey having been carried out &mdash; to develop all our bogland.  Such would constitute an enormous contribution by the ESB towards this nation, to Irish men and women, giving us the power necessary for our factories, industries, farms, homes and so on.  However, a lot more awaits doing.  This is where the Government can give a courageous lead by entering into consultation with the management of these boards, saying, &ldquo;Present us with the plans, we will give you the money, get on with the work&rdquo;.  I would also hope that our Ministers travelling abroad, particularly those who are Members of the European Parliament, will stress continuously the need for more money from our wealthy partners because we are the poor relation and <Col N="317" /> must be looked after.  If wealthy European countries are prepared to share in the transition of the face of this country no better way can they do so than through the development of our bogs and coal resources thereby cutting down on our oil imports in accordance with the policy laid down by the Department of Energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one commitment, that I shall not speak as long as the previous speaker.  He dealt with many aspects of our energy problems not peculiar to this Bill.  Nevertheless I agree with most of what he had to say.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to welcome the new Minister for Energy here but I should say I was disappointed that this ministry did not carry the full rank of Cabinet member.  It is now one of the most important ministeries in this and in every other country throughout the world.  Therefore, I was indeed disappointed that the new administration did not see fit to have a fully fledged Minister for Energy.  However, better times may lie ahead.</P>
      <P>I want to wish you, a Cheann Comhairle, well in your new office.  I can assure you that I will not be one of the people who will give you any undue cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a few observations on this Bill, its introduction rendered necessary because of the continued expansion of the ESB and our continued industrialisation over the last 20 or 30 years.  The ESB are in the fortunate situation that, unlike other industries, they have unlimited demand for their product, namely electricity, with which to generate power for industry, agriculture, horticulture and indeed hospitals and clinics throughout the country. Therefore, they are more fortunate than other industries in that they do not have to worry about a recession, a declining market or any of the other enormous problems confronting other industries here and throughout the world.  The ESB were fortunate in that they were founded at a time when the country began to develop, when our economists felt it was time we modernised our economy, ensuring that the talents available to us were <Col N="318" /> fully utilised and additional ones encouraged and developed.  The ESB were fortunate also in that they had an important role to play in the development of our economy.  They have been successful in that role for many reasons, the first being that their product was in ever-increasing demand.  Anybody requiring power had to get it through one of their networks and had to pay for it.  That is why they have expanded and developed as has no other semi-State enterprise.</P>
    <P>There have been many references also to Bord na Móna, who have expanded and developed side by side with the ESB because their activitives are complementary to each other.  That is why those two great State industries made such rapid strides over the last quarter of a century. The importance of the ESB and Bord na Mona has become apparent to all of us now more so than ever.  This importance has been emphasised even more because of the world oil crisis we have experienced in recent times.  Most Members will recall that perhaps 12 or 14 years ago the ESB found it was uneconomic to produce electricity from our bogs, rivers, coalfields or any other source.  However, the wise Arabs changed that situation.  There has been a complete transformation of the energy field worldwide in recent years.  We realise now it is no longer profitable to buy oil on the high seas.  It was bought for as low as $7 a ton, transported here, used for heating our homes, generating our power stations and so on. We could not produce energy from our bogs or other resources as competitively, bearing in mind oil purchased for as low as $7 a ton on the high seas.  All that has changed and every country has to find other means of producing energy.  We are fortunate in having at our disposal many ways of producing energy which if properly harnessed could provide us with our energy needs for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned the hydro schemes which were first set up in the late twenties.  Those schemes were successful. I am very surprised that very little attention has been given to those hydro schemes in recent years.  The Minister referred to the micro hydro schemes which are being operated by private <Col N="319" /> enterprise.  I am surprised that there is not more emphasis on this in the Minister's speech.  He may refer further to the importance of generating electricity from micro hydro schemes.  We have an abundance of water in our rivers and waterways throughout the country which should be looked at.  There is no difficulty in establishing those micro hydro schemes to generate electricity which can be fed into the national grid.  This is an example of private enterprise complementing state enterprise.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there is no mention in the Bill of financial assistance for private enterprise in areas where they propose to establish micro hydro schemes. We have thousands and thousands of old corn mills throughout the country which are idle.  The water courses with them are available and could be utilised now.  We have a plentiful supply of turbines.  If those turbines were brought back into use and more turbines manufactured, I am confident we would have another source of power supply which nobody thought about a few years ago.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will refer to the importance of the micro hydro schemes and outline the plans he has to compliment the efforts of those people.  I feel this area needs attention.  As far as I know, a survey has been made in recent years but I believe a great deal more needs to be done in this field so that we can avail of the enormous amount of power which can be generated by those hydro schemes.  The turbines to power those generators can be manufactured here.  Recently I heard of turbines which were manufactured 50 years ago which are still in operation and capable of producing power.  We should encourage people to install more of this equipment to ensure that further sources of energy are available to the ESB.</P>
    <P>We know what happens to the ESB when there is industrial unrest.  The ESB have no reserves to call on when there is a complete power failure.  Deputy Flanagan mentioned the farmer unable to milk his cows, the housewife unable to provide heat for the chickens in the hatcheries, the workers in the factories <Col N="320" /> without power and the patients in hospitals. There is a never-ending list of problems which occur when there is a power failure.  The Minister of State is new to his office and has not had time to examine all the problems associated with energy. That is why I am disappointed he does not hold the rank of a full Minister.  However, as he is charged with responsibility for energy, I urge on him the importance of exploring all the avenues made available in this field.  Our climate ensures that we have an everlasting water supply.  Our biggest trouble seems to be that we have too much water and that we have too many drainage problems.  The state resources are not adequate to keep our land drained to ensure it is used to its full potential.  This is one area where water can be used to its full potential.  I appeal to the Minister to regard it as an area which has huge potential, because private enterprise can play its full part and complement the activities of the ESB.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some broadening of the terms of reference governing the financing of the ESB.  I would like to see the ESB brought more under the umbrella of the Dáil because it appears the board operate on their own and have enormous powers which cannot be questioned even in this Parliament.  That matter needs to be looked at in future.  The situation exists because nobody realised when the ESB were first established that they were creating the monster the ESB have become today.  This monster has played a very significant role in our economy and Irish society generally.</P>
    <P>We all welcome any opportunity for co-operation between the electricity board in the North and our ESB here, because that is a step in the right direction. They are both producing something which can be used throughout the whole of this small island.  We would like to see greater co-operation in this field so that in an emergency we will have available unlimited supplies to keep the wheels of industry revolving.  I feel that in these difficult times there is need for this House to have greater control over the entire operations of the ESB, although I am satisfied this is one semi-State body that has worked well because the ESB have <Col N="321" /> been successful in having in their ranks men who are dedicated to the task, who had the necessary skills to create expansion and to ensure that the Board kept pace with their obligations and duties to our expanding economy in recent years.</P>
    <P>We do not know a great deal about wind power.  Experiments are being carried out and small generating plants are being installed.  We hope this will be successful because this is another way of generating electricity at low cost.  That is what we want because we know it is very expensive to produce electricity from turf fired stations or oil-powered stations.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish turf-fired stations has proved to be a wonderful asset. Like Deputy Flanagan, I come from the midlands where we have thousands of acres of bog and where thousands of valuable permanent jobs have been created by the ESB and Bord na Móna.  No words of mine are adequate to praise the work carried out by the two organisations during the years.  They have become an enormous help to stabilise the rural population. This House should pay a tribute to the founder members of the two bodies because of the contributions they made. Many of them have gone to their eternal reward but they did excellent work.  We cannot take such institutions for granted and therefore we should say how delighted we are with the way Bord na Móna and the ESB have been able to expand their activities.  Bord na Móna have succeeded in finding world markets for their products.</P>
    <P>Peat briquettes have been referred to and Deputy Colley spoke about obtaining energy from biomass.  Two private individuals in the midlands are researching the possibility of manufacturing wood briquettes and we may be seeing such products on the market before long.  People in the joinery industry decided to do something with the bits and pieces of timber left over which were not suitable for the manufacture of chipboard.  Now those two individuals in the midlands have established a small plant for the manufacture of briquettes from such waste.  It is experimental and I suggest the Minister would request the ESB or the Department of Energy to give some <Col N="322" /> assistance to this research work.  Those people have been prepared to install machinery and they need encouragement. In Europe they are experimenting with all sorts of alternative sources of energy.  They are setting up big open furnaces to bale sugar cane stocks which can be used for the production of heat. Therefore, it is important that we make every effort to provide money for research into the manufacture of the timber briquettes I have been speaking of which could be manufactured from sprigs, branches and even the leaves of trees.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if a survey has been made of our rivers and the possibility of setting up micro hydro schemes.  That is another area that needs attention if we are to utilise all our raw materials for the production of energy. We will all welcome the day, if it ever comes, when no longer will we be dependent on the Arabs to sell us expensive oil with which to generate the energy to power our factories and heat our homes.  There will always be a need for some oil for cars which we see on our roads in ever increasing numbers.  But we need more experiments like that at Lanesboro and we need greater awareness of the possibilities of such experiments. Every encouragement should be given to enterprises like that at Lanesboro which is using by-products to produce steam which can be used locally in horticulture houses.  We spend millions each year importing vegetables and such experiments could save us millions in our balance of payments.  We hope that money will be made available for such efforts.  We all know that there is not a bottomless pit of financial resources &mdash; we will know more about bottomless pits before the Dáil goes into recess, but, the ESB should receive all encouragement in their programme of development and expansion.  We have here the necessary expertise and the necessary raw materials.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke of nuclear power and expressed strong opposition to it.  Its development is only in its infancy, although it is being used in Britain, throughout Europe and in Russia. <Col N="323" /> Greater research will have to be done to ensure that ultimately nuclear power will be as safe as the internal combustion engine which was invented in the eighteenth century in the face of fierce opposition when people said a man's body was not capable of withstanding the energy thus generated.  In 50 or 100 years nuclear energy will be as safe as the internal combustion engine which was so feared nearly two centuries ago.  In the meantime, we have unlimited supplies of peat, of wind, which we are never short of, and water, but I do not see any need to fear a holocaust if nuclear power was introduced here.</P>
    <P>Future generations will probably live to see nuclear power made safe for mankind and properly harnessed and available in every progressive and expanding country requiring power.  We have been told that oil will run out.  We know the bogs will run out and possibly in 20 years we shall have no further peat reserves. That is why we must turn the clock backwards &mdash; history has a knack of repeating itself &mdash; and go back to hydro-schemes. We can do a great deal more in hydro development.  I believe the Shannon can accommodate further hydro-schemes.  It was the first scheme to be established and I do not know why further such schemes were not developed.  In a changing situation it was necessary for the ESB to look at all the options open to them.  This is one option I am sure they will fully investigate as time goes by.  Possibly in our time we shall see the end of peat and that is why it is important to encourage the development of biomass.  It is something that can grow rapidly in this country; it can be machined and used.  That is why experiments being carried out by private individuals in regard to timber briquettes are so important.  If these are successful such a development could operate side by side with the production of biomass.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the ESB must be given every encouragement to expand and develop.  They have now become part and parcel of our economy and of our daily living.  They have been taken for granted for too long.  Like Deputy Flanagan, I conclude by saying that I hope we <Col N="324" /> shall see continuing improvement in industrial relations in the ESB.  Thank goodness they have now come a considerable way without any industrial unrest in that industry which is so vital for all our needs.  We hope goodwill and understanding will prevail at all times and that we shall see an end to industrial unrest in the ESB and Bord na Móna.  I compliment Bord na Móna on being one of the most successful semi-State enterprises we have.  We hope their work will continue until all our bogs have been utilised for the benefit of the national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who stood here half an hour ago covered the ground very well.  In supporting the Bill and realising that it is designed to provide finance for capital projects in the ESB I cannot allow the opportunity to pass without reminding the Minister that a very serious situation is now arising &mdash; I am not exaggerating &mdash; in that people cannot afford to pay ESB bills.  I have seen people on fixed incomes having to &ldquo;go without&rdquo; in order to pay the ESB. The fear in their minds that they will be cut off and be left without electricity is a very real fear.  It causes much unrest and disturbance among the people concerned. If costs continue to rise under the fuel variation clause there will be a situation where people will say they cannot afford to pay and will resort to some other means of getting light and heat.  I wish to have note taken of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great need for a subsidy to enable people, particularly young couples, who want to build houses and who find that in order to get electricity they have to get one or two poles at a cost of £500 for just one pole, to do so.  It is extraordinary how that cost could be so high.  Unless it is subsidised I believe people will have to try something else. This is a real problem.  Recently in a small co-operative housing scheme in my area all the costs were estimated at the outset but the one that spiralled was the cost of supplying electricity from the public lighting system to that area and its installation in the houses.  Had that cost been known before the project was undertaken it would not have been undertaken <Col N="325" /> because extra finance had to be sought to cover that expenditure.  It was the last straw that broke the camel's back.  These were people who could only barely afford to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I make these points because there is need to speak about them now.  The increasing cost of electricity, if it continues to increase as it is at the moment, will create a very serious situation.  I may be digressing somewhat from the business we are discussing which concerns capital projects but it is rather surprising that the position should be as I have indicated.  I would welcome an opportunity at some stage of going into this matter because ESB customers pay their bills.  It is amazing in a body which is long established and has a great volume of customers and corresponding revenue that some of this money cannot be utilised for some of this capital work.  How are costs increasing? Is management at local level what it should be?  Are the services being rendered compatible with the amount paid for these services?  These are questions that require examination.  Is it right to have a situation in which a person is ready to have a connection made to his home but because an application may have been a little late in arriving the local official can say, &ldquo;We have a programme to carry out and we will not deviate from it no matter what your circumstances may be.  You must wait for two months until we are ready to provide a service for you.&rdquo;  That kind of service is not good enough for the public and there is severe criticism of it.  I should like the Minister to take a serious look at the points I have made.  Perhaps these matters are a problem only in my area but they are definitely a problem there and that is why I have spoken about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very short.  First, I sincerely congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment which is well due to him.  I hope his tenure of office will be of great benefit to him and that he will enjoy it but he will forgive me if I say I hope it will be a short one. I also congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election to that office. <Col N="326" /> Deputies who have contributed have made comprehensive speeches but my contribution will be brief.  I also vow that I will never speak after Deputy Flanagan again.  I will be more careful in the position I take.  The Bill is welcome and is an indication of the tremendous amount of work the ESB have undertaken in recent years, particularly major capital works. Two years after the limit of the board was extended it must now be extended again. I note that the ESB, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Energy, will have another look at how they might finance capital works.  I am aware that in the main the money is required for the large capital projects which the ESB have in hand but I should like the Minister to stress to the ESB the need for the development of existing capacity and enlarge the capacity in existing stations.</P>
      <P>To be somewhat parochial I should like to ask the Minister the position in relation to Bellacorick.  Much has been said over the last five years about that station.  Up to 1957 that area was a wilderness but the station now plays a vital part in the economic and social life of the area, particularly in relation to the town of Cross-molina. The economy of that town depends on the works being carried out by Bord na Móna and the ESB in the power station in the Bellacorick region. On the occasion of a recent visit to this station I got the impression that the staff felt it could play a greater role in the ESB network than it enjoys.  In an area with many square miles of bog the ESB should have closer consultation with Bord na Móna as to the development that can take place.  Having discussed this with the staff I believe there is a greater need for such consultation.  There are great prospects for that station.  I am aware that biomass experimental work is in progress at Bellacorick but fears have been expressed by a number of the operatives at that station as to what might happen there.  The Minister should request information in relation to this from the ESB and I would be grateful if he would pass it on to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The station I have referred to is a monument to the foresight, determination and dedication of the late Seán Lemass. <Col N="327" /> It plays a tremendous part in the social and economic life of that area.  On the occasion of the opening of a festival in Crossmolina recently I was glad to see that the local station had played a tremendous part.  Officials of the station had on show a scale model of a wind turbine. That represents a step in the right direction. Such work should have been done a long time ago but I should like to compliment the ESB on their drive to find alternative sources of energy.  As other Deputies have stated a number of our natural resources are finite and while they can still be developed we must seek alternative sources of energy.  Such alternative sources must be found in areas like Mayo where the excuse has been that the bog is not deep or large enough.  With the huge increase in the cost of imported oil bogs in the Ballycastle and Glenamoy area and in the area between that general route and Bellacorick should be developed. The bogs in the area bounded by the three towns, Charlestown in County Mayo, Tubbercurry in County Sligo and Ballaghadereen in County Roscommon should be investigated now because of the increased cost of importing oil.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about labour relations in the ESB but to be fair it must be stated that those relations have improved considerably.  The board are at pains to improve them.  Others could look to the ESB for guidance in relation to labour relations.  I am referring to the big construction sites which suffer a fair amount of labour relations trouble.  I am surprised that those in charge of those sites did not ask the ESB, having regard to the experience of the board, for guidance. The ESB has been involved in many major civil engineering construction works, particularly at Turlough Hill, and those sites were relatively free of labour relations problems.  It is amazing that the ESB was not consulted on their role in regard to labour relations and on how they were able to carry out projects like Turlough Hill without any loss of working days.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would like to state that during the day it has been somewhat tolerant on what, strictly speaking, were transgressions. The Chair's faith in the speaker has not been unfounded in that the speaker moved away with a certain rapidity which allows me to give to Deputy Calleary a slight licence which he is enjoying.  I know he will not create a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair but I am anxious to point out that labour relations should be a matter of concern for us all.  I agree with a lot of what was said by Deputy Sherlock.  The ESB has a monopoly in the provision and installation of current.  I have had similar experiences to him in dealings with the board.  Because they enjoy a monopoly the board should be at great pains to ensure that the estimates they give to people are proper and they should detail how the estimates are arrived at.  I am sure the Minister has come across problems in relation to such estimates.  It is strange how bills are presented to people for two or three poles at a cost of between £600 and £800.  It is because nobody else can carry out this work that the board should be fair in the preparation of estimates.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand some of the delays by the ESB in making connections to houses.  I know there seems to be a rule all through the country, that they have plans and that they work in an area and will not deviate from that area except for ordinary repairs no matter how urgent the situation is.  But again because they have a monopoly they should take greater care and pay more attention to connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of subsidies was raised. <Col N="329" /> In the early part of June Deputy Colley, as Minister for Energy, was able to persuade the EEC to bring in a subsidy which will be of great benefit to people in rural areas because they will only have to pay approximately 20 per cent and the EEC and the Government can pay up to 80 per cent between them.</P>
    <P>There is very little more that I can say. The operatives and the people who work in Bellacorick feel that they can play a greater part and look forward to playing a greater part in the generation of electricity. It is a station that can be expanded and its capacity increased with very little extra cost.  There is a tremendous amount of fuel there.  I know that there have been problems.  But having said that, and taking into account the tremendous cost involved, I feel that it is much better to spend the money in areas like Bellacorick and in all the other smaller stations to keep people in employment and to increase the employment potential in those areas.</P>
    <P>Let me, like the other speakers, offer my sincerest congratulations to the ESB staffs, from the chief executive officer down to the newest recruit, on the tremendous job they have done.  Let me also congratulate and thank the various executives who through the years, through their expertise and their dedication, have made the ESB the tremendous force that it is in Irish life today.  I also would recommend the Bill to the House and have no hesitation at all in agreeing to it.  I hope it gets a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few brief words on this Bill.  First I want to congratulate the new Minister and wish him well in his job.  I would also like to congratulate the outgoing Minister for Energy.  No man was more dedicated to his job or did more to study the whole question of energy.  This is a subject which we could talk about for a long time but I do not intend to do that because I understand that it has been debated very thoroughly here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very keen &mdash; and I know that Deputy Colley was very keen &mdash; on the whole question of energy from our bogs and for the ESB to continue to get the <Col N="330" /> utmost amount of energy from our natural resources, the boglands.  I hope the Minister will continue this trend and come in with a bog development Bill.  I believe the outgoing Minister had this Bill ready to introduce.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about solar energy and alternative energy from wind.  I come from an area where there is a factory in a small place called Woodford.  I would like the Minister to take a look at this. They have done a lot of research on energy from wind and alternative sources of energy.  There are 20 or 30 people employed there in a very isolated part of the country and they are doing a good job in research.  I understand that in this country for nearly two-thirds of the year we have wind.  The only danger with alternative energy from wind is that there are certain periods of the year when there is frost and no wind so that we would have to use other sources of energy.  I would like the Minister to go down to Woodford to see what is going on there. His predecessor took a great interest in that development which is taking place in my area.</P>
    <P>The main reason I stood up this evening was to remind the Minister of what this company is doing in research and to ask him to have a look at this, to support this company and give it grants to carry out research which is in the interests of the country because otherwise we will be talking about other, maybe dangerous, sources of energy.  I will not go into them but I heard Deputy Colley speaking on them this evening.  It is to his credit that he did not rush into anything that might be bad for the country as a whole in future years.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I believe that the ESB are doing a good job.  But it is still very costly to bring electricity to certain isolated areas which still have not got electricity.  Everybody should be entitled to electricity.  The Minister should &mdash; and I believe he will &mdash; have a look at the cost.  A Bill was brought in three years ago which helped in the really isolated areas but it is still very costly.  There are also problems with group water schemes in relation to getting three phase current. It is impossible to get it from the ESB. <Col N="331" /> When people have a group water scheme with pumps operating and they need extra current the ESB should be able to supply it.  It is not that easy to get it from the ESB and it is very costly.  These are things that the Minister should consider. Like all State-sponsored bodies, and like CIE which was discussed last night, the ESB are providing a service for the people and the funds for it are coming from the public purse so they should be able to provide an even better service.  They are certainly providing a good service and I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the ESB.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest things to the credit of the outgoing Minister is his efforts in bog development.  We have a whole area of natural energy here.  I was in on the bog development Bill which the former Minister had in mind and I know what was in it.  It would be a terrific substitute for other energy.  I would like the Minister to continue along those lines because the amount of employment which would be created by developing these bogs would more than justify expansion along these lines.</P>
    <P>Energy is of vital importance.  I heard the outgoing Minister stating the cost and suggesting that there might be a link up between this country and other countries whereby when climates are colder in one place than in another energy could be bought or sold.  This is the type of thing that the ESB should be looking into. They have done a lot of research.  But there is a wide field of research which the ESB must continue to do, particularly in relation to our natural resources for supplying energy.  I could go on and on but I do not intend to because I do not believe in long speeches.</P>
    <P>In my county there is a company who are doing everything possible to provide alternative energy from wind and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the necessary grants are paid to them.  Grants were paid to them by the previous Minister. The company are carrying out valuable research and I hope the Minister will be as liberal about the payment of grants to them as was the previous Minister. <Col N="332" /> I welcome the Bill and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Edward Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank in particular Deputy Colley for his comprehensive contribution to this debate and to thank him also for his kind words of congratulation and good wishes. It would be remiss of me not to say a word of praise for the work of Deputy Colley as Minister for Energy in the establishment and development of the Department of Energy.  The staff whom I met are a very good staff and I am confident that the direction in which Deputy Colley was bringing the Department was, by and large, the correct one.  I wish to thank him for his involvement in the Department when he was Minister.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an interim measure.  A comprehensive Bill will be put before the House when the Department have reviewed the financing of the capital expenditure of the ESB.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley raised the question of the result of the ballots from the group of unions involved in the ESB.  The proposals put to the unions and considered by them were comprehensive and wide-ranging with wide and possibly beneficial repercussions.  I have not yet got the result of the ballots of all the unions and, therefore, it would be unwise of me to make any further statement on the outcome. I am sure Deputy Colley will understand my position and will not press me on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley commented on the historical assumption that the growth in the consumption of electricity could not in future be seen to be a reflection of growth within the economy.  It is my view that that would be the case in future.  When the Cork-Dublin gas pipeline is installed and is seen to be working fully, a broader look will have to be taken at the relationship between growth in electricity consumption and growth within the economy. It is estimated there will be a drop of 1 per cent in the consumption of electricity in 1981 as compared with the 1980 figure.  I believe this is a direct reflection <Col N="333" /> of the negative growth in the GNP.  That cannot be denied by any fair-minded person or expert observer.  I consider it is a direct reflection of the direction in which the economy has been and is going.  We hope the downward trend in the economy will be reversed and that a solid and consistent growth rate will be re-established in the very near future.  That growth rate will have a very considerable influence on the number of people employed in industrial and commercial concerns and also on our farms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also referred to forward planning and the matter of expenditure. I should like to refer the Deputy to my speech where I made it quite clear that planning is an important aspect of the functions of the ESB.  I pointed out the long lead time of eight years or more required for the construction of base load plant.  I stated there was flexibility in the plant programme currently approved in respect of the ESB and that that programme envisages an additional capacity of 1435MW towards the end of the decade, about 32 per cent of which is in the form of combustion turbines.  This is intended to meet peak demand.  I stated that because of the relatively short lead time of about three years, construction can be put back in tandem with any fall off in electricity demand for whatever reason.  This is the flexible element in the plant programme.  I am sure Deputy Colley realises there is a certain flexibility in the capital expenditure of the ESB that can be pushed forward or held back in accordance with the energy needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Department of Energy are well qualified to forecast energy needs and are well equipped from the point of view of manpower and technology to monitor the energy needs of the economy.  I will be considering this matter in depth to ensure that the Department are fully staffed and have available the most modern technology and machinery to ensure that information will be available to me at short notice and will be given by well qualified people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley raised the question of the interconnector and he entered a caveat in relation to the electricity link <Col N="334" /> with Northern Ireland, referring to the Coalition programme.  Point 8 of the Industry, Commerce and Energy Programme stated that a gas main will be constructed to transport Kinsale gas from Cork to Dublin and that the 300 MW electricity link with Northern Ireland will be repaired and protected.  I take the point made by the Deputy that the interconnector was damaged on the Northern Ireland side of the Border and that the security forces under the control of our Government were not involved in any way with its protection and, therefore, could not be blamed in any way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the interconnector between Northern Ireland and the Republic and also the east-west interconnector prospects, negotiations at top official level have recently reached agreed draft report stage.  I have not had a full opportunity to examine the report but I understand that there is considerable economic and strategic justification for an east-west link.  I am considering the most appropriate next steps to advance the matter.  This is true even if, as is my earnest hope, the North-South interconnector is restored and put into operation.  This would enormously enhance the continuity and security of supply in both parts of the country and would save consumers millions of pounds.  I hope those concerned will appreciate the grave damage they are causing and will desist from interfering with its repair.  I look on it as a priority to take whatever steps I can with the relevant electricity authority in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the repair of the North-South interconnector and on the steps that would have to be taken to ensure its security.  There would be great economic benefit for the country and for the ESB in having it repaired and made secure.  This will receive my full and urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley and others referred to the question of alternative energy sources.  I take his point and join with him in saying that the ESB have thrown the great weight they have in expertise behind the number of projects which would not necessarily come under a strict interpretation of the Act under which <Col N="335" /> they work.  I thank them for their goodwill and dedication in carrying out experimental works on behalf of the people. The consultancy services of the ESB contribute to their finances.</P>
    <P>Biomass is at an experimental stage and I should not like to go beyond saying that the earliest and most practical biomass possibility in Ireland, is trial burnings of forest thinnings and waste sawmill products for firing by ESB stations.  I intend pursuing this possibility to the fullest practical extent and to explore more fully its possibilities.  I should also like to have an in-depth look at the possibility of short rotation forestry as a high priority in the biomass programme.</P>
    <P>The district heating scheme was referred to by Deputy Colley.  This is an important experiment.  I am confident that it is showing a degree of success and may prove to be fully viable as an economic venture.  I share his view that there are other locations where similar type projects could be replicated.  I am awaiting results of a survey on this matter which is almost completed and the initiation of suitable projects will be supported by my Department.</P>
    <P>One of the major tasks facing my Department relates to the laying of the natural gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin. The tenders for this are being evaluated at present in the Department.  It is hoped in the near future to be able to come to a conclusion on this.  The tender selected will be put to the Government who will decide to award the contract to whichever company or group of companies are acceptable to them and are technically capable of carrying out the project.  It is hoped that wayleave acquisition will proceed speedily through the coming autumn with the goodwill of landowners along the defined routes.  I am anxious that the commitment, preparation and tasks, including the conclusion and implementation of a comprehensive works agreement, will be competently advanced at the Dublin city end by the Dublin Gas Company.  I should like to state clearly that it is vital to the whole project that the Dublin Gas Company <Col N="336" /> speedily conclude a comprehensive works agreement.  This is a <i>sine qua non</i> of their being supplied with natural gas. This is a matter which at present is receiving my urgent attention and because it is at negotiation stage I am sure the House will understand if I make no further comment on it.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the natural gas pipeline to Belfast is an interesting prospect.  I welcome the statement made recently in the British House of Commons by the Government who had obviously been in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities.  They are pursuing their own study and will continue the discussions carried on over a number of months to try to realise the possibility of an extension of the Kinsale gas supply to Belfast.  That statement also indicated that the town gas utilities in Northern Ireland &mdash; the principal one would be in Belfast &mdash; may defer a closure or a number of closures for a few months pending the outcome of the examination into the possibility of extending the natural gas pipeline to Dublin.  This is a welcome development on the British side.  I should like to see the natural gas pipeline going to Belfast and being a co-operative project between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland authorities.  It would be a welcome and pleasant task for us to bring the pipeline to Belfast.  It would be a project which would be seen as a great co-operative effort between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>The question of dependence on oil was raised by Deputy Colley.  The percentage of units generated from different energy sources was as follows: to the year ending March 1980 oil, 64 per cent, peat 16 per cent, gas 11 per cent, hydro 8 per cent, and coal 1 per cent; to the year ending March 1981 the consumption of oil was 55 per cent, peat 16 per cent, gas 20 per cent, hydro 8 per cent, and coal 1 per cent.  I referred in my speech to the long-term planning of the ESB generation plant.  I said that, towards the end of the eighties, we will have reduced to just over 40 per cent the amount of our generating capacity which is dependent on oil.  We are going in the right direction <Col N="337" /> rapidly in the context of what must be seen as a massive investment programme. We will be going from a position of dependence on oil of 64 per cent for generating electricity in the year ending March 1980.  By the end of the eighties that dependence on oil will have been reduced to 40 per cent.  That shows a commitment on the part of the ESB and the Department of Energy.  The whole question is being examined and conclusions are being reached.  The ESB are going in the right direction in relation to the use of oil and a further reduction in the use of oil for the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>The question of coal reserves was also raised.  The position is not very clear, as Deputy Colley knows.  It will take at least two years for the survey of the Leinster coalfields to be completed.  At this point I could not take up any position with regard to the development of our coalfields. The Arigna area has been a success. I do not wish to go any further into the extent of viable coal reserves pending the outcome of the survey of the Leinster region.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned the need to have generating capacity reserves. Obviously he is aware of the need to have spinning reserves equal to the largest electricity generating unit.  That will always be the case if we are to ensure a continuous supply of electricity.  Deputy Colley referred to the nuclear option.  I share his views in that I too have doubts about the question of a nuclear station being built here.  I should like to refer to the Government's policy in this regard and in particular to point 5 of the Government's programme which refers to a <Col N="338" /> nuclear power station.  Point 5 states that no nuclear power station will be approved as long as any doubts remain about the environmental hazards or waste disposal risks of such a project. The Government's position is quite clearly defined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley and Deputy Flanagan can be assured that we will take a long hard look at the nuclear option.  In the context of the expected growth in the economies not only in Ireland but throughout Europe, a decision on the need for a nuclear station can be put on the long finger.  There is no rush whatsoever to make a decision with regard to the establishment of a nuclear station at Carnsore.  In any event, this will be a Government decision taken only after a public inquiry and long consideration of the technical problems and the capabilities of such a nuclear station.  The decision will be examined at length and in depth by the Department of Energy in consultation with other Departments and scientific bodies who will have an input into such a decision.  These examinations will have to be carried out before the Government will take any decision on a nuclear station.  I do not expect that there will be any quick move on that front. There are other urgent problems in my Department which await my attention and which will have my attention before the question of the establishment of a nuclear station will be considered and a decision made by the Government.</P>

      <P>The measures referred to are designed to prevent traders from illegally claiming MCA subsidies on cattle exported from Northern Ireland.

      <P>While the measures should help to reduce cross-Border smuggling from here they cannot, in view of their nature, prevent all smuggling of cattle across the Border to Northern meat factories.
