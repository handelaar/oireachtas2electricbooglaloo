    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 7 and 6. I will make a statement at 3.30 p.m. today concerning the recent meeting of the European Council.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, yesterday in the Dáil the Taoiseach, when asked about the possibility of arrangements for an economic debate, gave hope of such a debate and stated that it was a matter to be discussed between the Whips, although at the time I suspected that this was merely a blind and that discussion would prove fruitless and that it was merely intended to put us off the track at the time. That proved to be the case, and when the Whips met, the debate was accordingly refused. I expected that. I wish to point out that the Taoiseach had earlier said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed to ask my question, please? It is relevant to the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely related to the question of the Finance Bill, which is <Col N="238" /> on the Order of Business. The Taoiseach, had, however, prior to making that obviously misleading suggestion about the Party Whips, said that we will shortly be discussing the Finance Bill which will enable Deputies to cover economic matters. I am sure that the Taoiseach and the Chair are aware that the ordinary rules of the House restrict debate on the Finance Bill in a particular way, so that only taxation proposals will be discussed, not expenditure on administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amount of disorder in this House because the Chair will not allow Deputies to finish their questions. I want to ask the Taoiseach whether, in view of his refusal to allow an economic debate and in view of his statement that economic matters could be covered under the Finance Bill, he will agree, by agreement, that the restrictive provisions on the debate on the Finance Bill will be removed and that all matters on the economy can be debated on the Finance Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the Opposition can discuss anything they like on the Finance Bill, but it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally, the Second Stage of the Finance Bill is always an occasion for Deputies to talk about the economic situation as a background to the Finance Bill. Let me also point out that the Opposition have had 60 hours of a debate on this year's budget. Every aspect of the economy could be and was discussed. The Opposition have two Private Members' Time spaces available to them in which they can discuss the economy. We have also had a major social welfare debate in which, again, the general state of the economy could be and was discussed. Our position in the Government is that we have a number of measures which we must get through before the Recess. The debate on the Finance Bill will start on Tuesday week, 7 April, and must be finished by 9 April. It is just not possible for us to devote any additional time at this stage to a general economic debate. No reasonable person would suggest that this is depriving the Opposition in any way of giving expression to any viewpoint they wish on the economy. There are still a number of opportunities open to them to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is aware of the rules of the House. There is apparently agreement on all sides of the House that this Finance Bill debate will not be restricted in accordance with the normal rules and that the economy in general can be discussed. I want to make it clear, so that we do not find ourselves during the debate being restricted by the Chair despite the agreement of the House. The point must be cleared now, that the Taoiseach's remarks hold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £20,194,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31 December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> With your permission, A Cheann Chomhairle, I propose that the usual practice of discussing the Fisheries and Forestry Estimates together be followed&mdash;in which case I shall move the Forestry Estimate after the debate concludes.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Estimate shows an increase of £2,492,000 over last year's vote. The overall increase is due mainly to increases of £1,100,000 to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for Capital Development (grant-in-aid), £675,800 for Inland Fisheries Development, £576,000 for main fishery harbour works and £287,760 for salaries, wages and advances. Reductions occur in the grant for Administration and Current Development to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (£288,300) and in the provision for grants, under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968 (£5,000).</P>
    <P>The value of domestic landings of sea fish in 1980, excluding salmon landings, amounted to £28.9m as against £24.9m in 1979, an increase of 16 per cent. In addition, there were landings into foreign ports amounting to at least £6m. The total quantity of fish landed at home in 1980 was approximately 135,000 tonnes. This is a record figure and represents an increase of 49,000 tonnes over the 1979 catch.</P>
    <P>The value of exports of all fish and fishery products in 1980 reached the record figure of £41 million as compared with £33 million in 1979, representing an increase of 24 per cent, not a bad achievement in a difficult period.</P>
    <P>Over 60 firms are involved in fish processing operations, employing about 1,600 people. A total of 24 projects, incorporating either new processing plants or extensions to existing ones, have been approved for grant purposes in the calendar year 1980, involving a total state investment of approximately £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>Provision of improved harbour works where they are needed for fish landings, berthing of boats and other necessary facilities at fishing ports is progressing steadily. For Killybegs, a contract is being placed for the dredging of the harbour to provide adequate depth in the harbour generally and additional depth in specific <Col N="246" /> areas to meet the needs of the bigger boats which have recently been added to the fishing fleet. Work is well advanced on the construction of the auction hall and port offices. Tenders will issue shortly for the civil engineering works in connection with the installation of the syncrolift unit for the repair of boats. The machinery for the syncrolift has been supplied. Development of the White House property to provide for the erection of a larger ice plant and automatic telephone exchange and for the resiting of oil installations is well advanced.</P>
    <P>Work on the infrastructure for the industrial estate on Dinish Island, Castle-townbere, is now completed apart from the provision of an effluent disposal plant for the island. Tenders have been received for this plant and the work will commence this year. Completion of a 38 K V electricity supply to the area to cater for all foreseeable electric power needs is expected to be completed early next year. Construction of a fish processing plant on Dinish Island by Eironova Ltd., an Irish subsidiary of the Spanish firm Pescanova, is completed. I understand that the plant is ready to commence operations. The syncrolift unit is now fully operational.</P>
    <P>At Howth development of the fishery harbour is well advanced. The dredging and rock blasting within the new fishery harbour area has been completed. Reclamation of the foreshore on both sides of the west pier has also been completed. The extra space thus obtained will be utilised for siting an auction hall, syncrolift unit, net, gear and repair facilities for fishermen. The whole area included in the scheme will be landscaped to fit in with the existing environmental aspect. To date expenditure on the scheme is £3.5 million and during this year it is expected that a further £2 million will be spent. Hand in hand with the fishery harbour development, excavation work is being undertaken to provide a site for a yacht marina in the eastern side of Howth Harbour.</P>
    <P>I intend in the very near future to declare Rossaveal a major fishery harbour centre. With this in mind I set up in June 1980 the Rossaveal Harbour Development <Col N="247" /> Advisory Committee, on which all interested parties were represented, to recommend for my consideration appropriate works in order of priority for the development of the infrastructure of Rossaveal harbour. I expect that the committee's report with recommendations will be available in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>Work on the large-scale improvements at Cahirciveen and on improvements at eight smaller fishing ports, will be continued during the year and it is hoped to start works for which I have approved grants at Greencastle, Burtonport and Portevlin Co. Donegal, Killala, Co. Mayo and Schull, Co. Cork, as well as lesser works at 28 other fishery ports around the coast.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1981 for administration and current development amounts to £3,496,200 and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to £6,000,000. Additional funds are available by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund, a line of credit from financial institutions and the board's own resources to meet the demand by fishermen for loans for boats, gear and so on. In addition to subvention towards the purchase of boats and gear the board's grant-in-aid for capital development also covers the provision of services to the fishing industry such as ice plants and training and grants for mariculture. The reduction in the grant for current expenditure arises because provision is not included to meet boatyard losses as was the case in previous years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the mariculture grant scheme administered by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and geared to the development of fish-farming projects has been a very significant development in this sector. Under the scheme, grants of up to 30 per cent of capital expenditure may be made available, thus giving a tremendous boost to this fast-developing industry. I intend to make an order bringing into effect the revised legislative procedures outlined in section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, in the near future, giving the industry the direction that it urgently <Col N="248" /> requires. Last year the value of production was £1.5 million; this year it is expected to reach £2 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that Mr. Brendan O'Kelly announced last year that he proposed to leave the board to return to the private sector. The board has now decided, with my approval, to appoint Dr. Tony Meaney, hitherto resource development manager, to be his successor as chief executive officer. I would like to wish Dr. Meaney well in his new appointment. I will be making an announcement shortly about a new chairman of the board.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that a Council decision of 30 May 1980 set a firm date of 1 January 1981 for agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy. I regret to say that, in spite of this and of continuing intensive negotiations, we still have not achieved accord. This is particularly regrettable as there has been considerable progress in some aspects of the policy. It might be helpful to remind Deputies of the various sectors which form the cohesive whole of a Common Fisheries Policy, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) <i>Access</i>&mdash;This is one of the main stumbling blocks, I can assure the House that I will hold firm to my position that we must achieve a reserved coastal zone exclusive to our fishermen. The extent of such zone will depend on the outcome of negotiations. While I am not in a position, as some people seem to think, to decide on my own the terms that will apply to this country, I wish to assure the House that my untiring efforts will be directed towards securing the most advantageous terms possible.</P>
    <P>(2) <i>Total Allowable Catches (TACs)</i>&mdash;these are decided on a species and area basis and in the main are based on scientific advice on fish stocks in consultation with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the EEC's own Scientific and Technical Committee. Agreement was reached on TACs for 1980 and the 1981 proposals are now on the table.</P>
    <P>(3) <i>Quotas</i>&mdash;These are the allocations <Col N="249" /> to each member state of the TACs and understandably are the source of much discussion. We are greatly helped in this sector by the Hague Agreement in accordance with which we were entitled to double our 1975 catch by 1979. As in the case of the TACs, quota proposals for 1981 are on the table and, while agreement can be achieved only in the context of an overall package being settled, I am reasonably confident that our entitlement under the Hague Agreement will be met.</P>
    <P>(4) <i>Conservation</i>&mdash;Technical measures for conservation of fish stocks such as limitations on mesh sizes of fish have already been agreed.</P>
    <P>(5) <i>Structures</i>&mdash;This heading embraces the provision of Community aid for the restructuring of the fleet and includes such items as aid for scrapping and laying-up of vessels, purchase and modernisation of vessels, aquaculture, the encouragement of exploratory voyages for new fishing grounds and the setting up of joint fishing ventures with third countries. Our main interest in this sector is in the granting of aid for new vessels and aquaculture, where we have in the past been particularly successful, having been approved for grants amounting to 31 per cent of the total funds available in the period 1976-1979. No decision has yet been received on the current applications but I am confident that we will achieve a satisfactory share of the available funds there too. Considerable progress has been made on these proposals.</P>
    <P>(6) <i>Marketing</i>&mdash;One of the contributory factors to the present bad situation in fish marketing is that the current marketing regulations date back to 1970 and are seen to be inadequate for present-day market conditions. A new marketing proposal is under discussion but, by its very nature, it is a complicated document and will require intensive study. I have consistently emphasised the importance of this proposal and I am hopeful that we can make progress towards establishing a more <Col N="250" /> stable market in the near future. Meanwhile, I have insisted that all the existing marketing measures available to the Community be used to their fullest extent in order to alleviate some of the serious problems now facing Community fishermen.</P>
    <P>While the past year has been a difficult one in the marketing of certain species at economic prices, I do not accept that the industry is in a crisis situation as suggested in some quarters. There is already an improvement in market prices mainly as a result of measures taken at EEC level following sustained pressure from me and my Department. I refer, for instance, to abolition of duty suspensions and increased reference prices. The increased demand for mackerel at satisfactory prices and the renewed demand for Dublin Bay prawns are also worthy of mention. As I already mentioned, the value of our landings increased by 16 per cent in 1980 as compared with 1979. This is a significant increase which went a long way to offsetting the increases in costs. I will continue to press at EEC level for the early introduction of a revised marketing regulation which will provide proper protection for Community fishermen against cheap imports from third countries.</P>
    <P>We also need to improve our marketing techniques and to endeavour to find markets for the less popular species. BIM in consultation with the trade are fully committed to expanding market outlets and the opening up of a market for Irish mackerel in Nigeria last year was firm evidence of the success of the Board's efforts</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of publicity recently about possible resumption of fishing vessels by BIM.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone can whistle his own tune. I would like to assure Deputies that BIM are acting very responsibly in this matter and every effort is made to find a solution before a vessel is resumed. BIM do not want to resume vessels but on occasions they have no option but to do so. I recently set up a working group, comprised of representatives of the board, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and my Department to study the problem of arrears and make recommendations towards providing a solution wherever possible.</P>
      <P>Before passing from sea-fisheries I would like to refer to the expanded role of the National Fishery Training Centre at Greencastle at which an expanded range of courses is now available. The acquisition by BIM of a mobile training unit will take training to fishermen in their home ports. This is a very desirable development and I sincerely hope that it will receive the full support of fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to our inland fisheries. The most important event on the inland fisheries side in 1980 was the passing of the Fisheries Act, 1980 which came into operation on 18 March. The main objective of the Act is to update and widen the scope of our inland fisheries executive agencies so as to enable them to cope with the exigencies of modern times. We look to the Fisheries Act, 1980 to accomplish this objective by securing the more effective conservation, management and development of every aspect of our important natural inland fishery resources &mdash; salmon, trout, coarse fish, eels, and including sea angling resources for the benefit of our own people and as a valuable attraction for tourists from abroad. To that end in October 1980 I established, in accordance with the Act, the Central Fisheries Board and seven regional fisheries boards, with their fulltime chief officer and regional fisheries managers, to replace the former 17 boards of conservators and the Inland <Col N="252" /> Fisheries Trust which were dissolved under the Act. I am pleased to say that the whole-time staffs of the former boards of conservators and the trust, with their wide experience of fisheries conservation and protection work, continue to be employed by the new boards without any downgrading of their working conditions. Although the new boards have only been recently established they have already shown a firm commitment to carrying out the tasks assigned to them under the Act. The Fisheries Act, 1980, provides also for significant increases in the penalties for inland fishery offences which emphasises further the Government's concern for this valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>The most important part of our inland fisheries is our salmon fisheries. Provisional figures for 1980 show that the total weight of the salmon catch by all fishing methods was 895 metric tonnes valued at £3.2 million as compared with 1,073 metric tonnes in 1979 valued at £5.03 million. The overall weight of the salmon catch in 1980 showed a fall of 16 per cent on the 1979 catch which in turn was 9 per cent below the catch of 1,180 metric tonnes in 1978. This decline in our salmon catch in recent years continues to be a cause for concern. In that regard I would strongly exhort everybody engaged in the salmon industry, whether as fishermen or authorised salmon dealers, to comply with the statutory salmon conservation measures which are designed to allow a sufficient escapement of salmon to our rivers to spawn, while at the same time permitting a reasonable exploitation of the stock to the benefit of our commercial salmon fishermen, dealers, processors, exporters and our native and visiting salmon anglers.</P>
    <P>Despite the fall in the salmon catch in 1980 there were some encouraging signs for the future. For example, the run of the large spring fish was the best for many years while escapement of salmon to the spawning grounds last year was quite satisfactory. On social and economic grounds I extended last year's salmon fishing season by two weeks in the Waterford and Lismore fishery districts and by one week in areas other than the east <Col N="253" /> coast where the season ended later. I am continuing the extension this year and I have also restored the five day fishing week for commercial fishing. This is as far as I can go to meet the wishes of the fishermen until there is further evidence of an improvement in the stock situation.</P>
    <P>On 26 May 1980 I made regulations under the Fisheries Act, 1980, which introduced a levy on the first sales of salmon. The amount of levy collected to date in respect of the 1980 season is £156,161. The purpose of the levy is to provide funds towards the conservation and development of our inland fisheries additional to the money provided by the Government out of the Exchequer, which is £3.1 million in 1981. I may say that I do not consider it unreasonable to seek from persons benefiting directly from our salmon stocks such a contribution towards the heavy costs of conserving and developing our inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>In discussions with fishermen and others engaged in salmon fishing and exporting they have accepted the principle of contributing to the development of the industry and my Department are examining suggested alternatives to the levy submitted by fishery organisations. However, if the protection and development of our valuable inland fisheries is to be continued there is not alternative but to maintain the levy for this year at least. I might add that the salmon levy has been provided for in the Fisheries Act, 1980, which was passed by this House last year.</P>
    <P>As to the protection of our salmon fisheries, my Department, with the co-operation of the Minister for Defence, arranged again for vessels of the Naval Service to patrol our salmon fisheries during the 1980 season in support of the Garda and the fisheries protection staffs of the boards of conservators. This joint salmon fishery protection effort was well worthwhile and resulted in the seizure and removal from our salmon fisheries of large numbers of illegal fishing nets.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present consulting with the naval and Garda authorities with a view to arranging naval patrols of our salmon fisheries with a backup of land based Garda support where necessary during the 1981 season <Col N="254" /> in co-operation with the protection staffs of the regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>Work on the construction of the extension to Cong salmon hatchery which was started in 1978 is scheduled for completion within the next few months at a total estimated cost of £182,000. The extension will produce 100,000 salmon smolts a year when in full production and so will make a worthwhile contribution towards the rehabilitation of salmon rivers as nesessary.</P>
    <P>My Department acquired the Galway fishery in 1978 and I am pleased to say that its operation from a commercial viewpoint continues to be very successful and showed a surplus of almost £44,000 in 1980. The Department are carrying out a research programme at the fishery, designed to provide important information for its future management.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Inc. which is funded jointly by my Department and Messrs. Arthur Guinness, Son and Company Limited, continues its research into the biology of the salmon and the factors bearing on its future survival as a species. A grant-in-aid of £45,000 is allocated to the trust in 1981.</P>
    <P>An amount of £100,000 is included in the Estimates to meet our contribution towards the expenses of the Foyle Fisheries Commission. The money will be used to offset the commission's estimated financial deficit in 1981, which is continuing to rise. The rise in deficit is due largely to substantial increases in the costs for wages, salaries and to a fall in profits from the commission's commercial fishery due to the declining salmon catch. I am satisfied, however, that the commission are making every effort to reduce their annual deficit. To that end the commission increased the licence duties payable for salmon fishing licences in the Foyle area for 1980 and 1981, and will continue to seek means of reducing their overall expenditure consistent with the carrying out of the commission's obligations under the Foyle Fisheries Acts to conserve and manage the fisheries of the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>Regarding pollution control, much interest has centred around the efforts <Col N="255" /> being made to restore Lough Sheelin to its former position as one of the best natural trout fisheries in Europe.</P>
    <P>Recommendations made by an interdepartmental technical committee set up by me include the introduction of a transport subsidy scheme to remove excess slurry from the catchment. I am glad to report that the scheme is working satisfactorily and has resulted in 2.5 million gallons of slurry being transported out of the catchment to date while arrangements are under way to move a further 3.5 million gallons shortly.</P>
    <P>The scheme is administered by a management committee consisting of representatives of my Department, the local authority, the Department of Agriculture, ACOT, the Central Fisheries Board, the pig producers and the recipients.</P>
    <P>Having dealt extensively with fishery matters, I will now turn my attention to the Forestry Estimates, including the Supplementary. On the main Forestry Vote, the nett amount required this year&mdash;£32,011,000, represents an increase of £6,787,000 as compared with last year. This is due in the main to higher salaries and wages, a very substantial increase in the funds for land acquisition and additional funds for forest roads and harvesting operations, but it is partly offset by an increase of £857,000 in Appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>As some subheads of the Vote provide for about the same level of activity as last year I do not propose to analyse them at this stage. The main subheads in question are as follows:</P>
    <P>Subhead B.2&mdash;Post office Services at £236,300; Subhead C.3&mdash;Sawmilling at £290,400; Subhead E.&mdash;Forestry Education at £160,400; Subhead F.&mdash;John F. Kennedy Park at £167,000.</P>
    <P>However, when replying to the debate I will, of course, be happy to deal with these subheads in such detail as Deputies may require.</P>
    <P>I will now move on to those provisions in the main Estimate which show significant changes from last year and I will also comment, at the appropriate point, on <Col N="256" /> the provisions in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Subhead A1&mdash;£8,820,590&mdash;relates to the salaries, wages and allowances of Forest and Wildlife Service personnel. The subhead shows an increase of £496,690 as compared with last year and includes provision for a limited number of additional posts which are an inescapable feature of the expanding activities of the Forest and Wildlife Service, particularly in the light of the very important developments which have recently taken place in relation to the setting up of a medium density fibreboard plant and about which I will fully inform the House in a few moments.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.1&mdash;£1,545,000: This subhead provides for travelling and incidental expenses and shows an increase of £296,400 on the amount made available last year. Travelling is an inescapable feature of the afforestation programme and adequate funds are essential if field operations are not to grind to a halt. The great bulk of the expenditure incurred arises in the domestic context, that is, in managing the national network of State forests and supervising the substantial workforce engaged therein; only a small proportion is represented by foreign travel.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.3&mdash;£146,000: The proposed increase of £61,800 in this subhead, which relates to office machinery and other supplies, arises from the necessity to acquire some additional equipment for the Forest and Wildlife Service at its headquarters and provincial centres.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1: Grant-in-Aid for acquisition of Land&mdash;£3,300,000 as Deputies will see, there is provision for an increase of £3 million over last year in the grant-in-aid for land acquisition. I should explain that the amount originally allocated to the acquisition fund in 1980 was £900,000, but when the necessity for a Supplementary Estimate arose during the year the accumulated level of funds in the grant-in-aid was such that it was possible, having regard to anticipated commitments for the year, to utilise £600,300 towards reducing the supplementary demand. Thus, the subhead provision was cut back to £299,700, but, I hasten to add, this did not adversely <Col N="257" /> affect the land acquisition programme last year, the overall expenditure on which amounted to about £1.25 million and brought in 9,700 acres of plantable land. As a result of the substantially improved price which the FWS can now pay for land and also because of an apparent general loosening of the land market, land acquisition prospects for afforestation are looking much brighter and it is against that background that the unusually high provision is being made in the acquisition fund this year. The balance in the fund at 31 December 1980 stood at about £743,500 and this, together with the net sum of £3.2 million now being proposed, means that there will be an aggregate of about £4 million available for land acquisition in the current year &mdash; this is, in fact, the highest amount ever provided for the purpose in a single year.</P>
    <P>Closer examination of likely expenditure over the rest of the year has enabled me to reduce the original requirement in the grant-in-aid by £100,000 as a small contribution towards offsetting the cost of the Supplementary Estimate necessitated by recent developments in the wood industry field. Present indications are that land intake for forestry in 1981 will be about 16,000 acres and, although this still falls far short of the intake required to support a planting programme with 25,000 acres per annum as its objective, it will at least go some way towards improving the unsatisfactory land-reserve situation which has resulted from the decline in land acquisition in recent years.</P>
    <P>The funds in subhead C.1 also include some provision for land acquisition for wildlife conservation purposes and in this connection the purchase of the internationally important flora habitat at Pollardstown Fen is currently the primary objective.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2 &mdash; Forest Development and Management: £23,175,200: This subhead which, as usual, constitutes the main focal point of expenditure in the Forestry Vote, represents an increase of £4,041,500 over the 1980 provision. As Deputies will be aware, the subhead, in its totality, caters for the very wide variety of activities inevitably associated with <Col N="258" /> the development and management of a national forest estate which at 31 December 1980 embraced some 370,000 hectares, 900,000 acres, of land, of which 300,000 hectares, 740,000 acres, have been planted. These activities include such aspects as the production of nursery stock, the establishment, maintenance and protection of State plantations, public recreation facilities; purchase, maintenance and hire of machinery; construction of forest roads; and the cost of timber harvesting and conversion. In other words, the expenditure provided in the subhead embraces the broad spectrum of operations essential to the smooth running, consistent with economy, of the entire State afforestation programme, including the employment of a workforce of some 2,700 men.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the provision for many of these sub-elements, after allowing for the inevitable increase in wages and prices, reflects much the same level of activity as last year. I shall, therefore, concentrate on those aspects which I feel merit special comment, such as the planting programme, forest roads, mechanical equipment and amenity development. However, if there are any other aspects on which the House requires detailed information, I will supply it in the course of my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>While the planting programme continues to have an annual output of 10,000 hectares, 25,000 acres, as its objective, some difficulties have been experienced in recent years in achieving this target. This is due largely to the land acquisition problems already referred to &mdash; but now, we hope, showing signs of improving &mdash; and also to an imbalance in the distribution of the reserve of plantable land which tends to be concentrated in western counties. The total area planted in the 1980 planting season was 7,600 hectares, 19,000 acres. The current season's planting programme, which is now nearing completion, is expected to increase the area under State forestry by about 7,000 hectares, 17,500 acres.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the afforestation programme includes the planting of a small area of short rotation forestry which is being undertaken in the solar energy context <Col N="259" /> under an EEC-assisted biomass project in which my Department are co-operating with a number of other State agencies.</P>
    <P>I think it would not be understating the situation to say that, with more and more State forests coming to maturity, we have now reached an important stage in Irish forestry, one in which the massive investment in terms of capital and labour over the years &mdash; but especially in the period since the second World War &mdash; is beginning to show a worthwhile financial return. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in a situation where from now onwards timber harvesting will be a major activity, there will have to be much greater emphasis on forest roads and machinery.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling need to update and replace much of the machinery and equipment used by the Forest and Wildlife Service in connection with road-making and harvesting operations. Moreover, an adequate network of forest roads is absolutely essential to facilitate extraction of the increasing volume of timber &mdash; pulpwood and sawlog &mdash; to be harvested, and thus ensure that supply commitments to existing and new industries, especially in the light of recent developments on this front, can be fully met.</P>
    <P>The need for such expenditure is highlighted by the decision of the Medford Corporation of Oregon, USA to set up a company to undertake the manufacture of medium density fibre board in this country. The advent of this company has resulted largely from the close co-operation between the Industrial Development Authority and my Department in seeking a dependable outlet for forest thinnings.</P>
    <P>The Medford Corporation of Oregon is a major US wood-processing company engaged in the manufacture of plywood, veneer, general timber and fibreboard. In the sphere of medium density fibreboard production &mdash; a quality product used principally for furniture manufacture &mdash; it is among the world's leading producers. Ireland will be its first production facility outside the USA, with production aimed at European markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> It is expected that the Clonmel plant will be completed in 1983 and, at full production, will employ 200 workers in the factory with a further 250 engaged in timber harvesting.</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that, following on the closure of most of our mills processing small dimension wood, there have been serious difficulties in providing markets for forest thinnings. We cannot reap the benefit of producing good sawlog &mdash; from which the main income of forestry derives &mdash; unless forests can be thinned regularly. Forest thinnings are now coming increasingly on stream as the heavy plantings of earlier years reach commercial stage of development.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Government &mdash; having regard to the considerable national economic advantage involved &mdash; last year authorised the placing of contracts, for a limited period, with the remaining pulpwood-processing firms for the harvesting and removal of small material in specified State forests, utilising the services of experienced harvesting gangs for the purpose. Moreover, it became necessary to permit temporary exportation of unprocessed wood in a further effort to keep the forests thinned. The medium density fibre board plant being established by the Medford Corporation at Clonmel will reverse this position and provide a major outlet for our suplus material for some years to come, as well as generating the 450 new jobs already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The proposed increases, aggregating £3,289,500, in subheads C.2 (3), (5) and (7) this year, largely reflect the necessity for the Forest and Wildlife Service to set about gearing itself towards meeting its obligations in relation to wood supply, and to that end the funds involved will &mdash; in addition to improving the plant and machinery situation &mdash; enable a substantial expansion in the forest roads programme to be commenced. I should point out that subhead C.2 (7) also includes a sum of £450,000 to meet the cost in the current year of direct harvesting of thinnings by pulpwood processors under the contract arrangements to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2 (4) &mdash; £792,200 &mdash; provides <Col N="261" /> funds for amenity and recreational facilities in the State forests. The amount sought, which represents an increase of £86,800 on last year's provision, will be used in connection with major on-going development, to forest park standard, of existing facilities at Doneraile, County Cork and Currachase, County Limerick and also for the upkeep and maintenance, in response to popular demand, of the eight existing forest parks and the numerous other amenity areas in forest locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Some initial work is being put in hands this year at Donadea Forest, County Kildare which has been designated as the site for a new forest park, and this should mark the beginning of a significant improvement in the existing amenity there. Other areas of special interest to the Forest and Wildlife Service and at which development work is in progress are Three Rock Mountain, County Dublin, and Farran, County Cork which, being adjacent to the major population centres of Dublin and Cork, respectively, already attract large numbers of visitors steadily throughout the year, but especially at weekends. My Department is also co-operating with Shannonside Tourism Organisation in providing a site for a proposed caravan/camping park in that locality.</P>
    <P>During 1980, in co-operation with my Department, the National Sports Council, operating under the aegis of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, opened an 18 mile stretch of a long distance walk as part of the planned Wicklow Way. A further 38 miles stage, currently under preparation, is expected to be completed later this year. Much of this interesting walk &mdash; which is ultimately seen as part of an Ireland Way &mdash; traverses State plantations.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that provision for a sum of £400,000 was made last year under subhead C.4 to enable the receiver at Chipboard Limited (Scariff) to continue operations for a limited period while proposals for restructuring the company were being considered. In the event, having regard to the level of income accruing to the company under the receiver's management not all of that <Col N="262" /> allocation was required by 31 December last. Provision for assistance to a level of £100,000 is being made for 1981.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer Deputies to the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; which contains a new subhead, namely C5, which provides £1,293,000 &mdash; and put the House in the picture in relation to the proposed restructuring of Chipboard Limited, Scariff, in receivership, and the formation of a new company to carry on the business of particle production. As I have already stated, the general recession following the oil crisis of the mid-seventies had very serious repercussions for the four mills using pulpwood from the State forests. Various efforts &mdash; either by way of financial assistance or by proposals for restructuring &mdash; were made by State agencies, including my Department, to assist the mills to survive the recession but, regrettably &mdash; with one exception &mdash; these proved unsuccessful and the industries had to close.</P>
    <P>The one remaining mill, Chipboard Limited, in receivership, has continued in production with the aid of a State grant to the receiver and also a special arrangement whereby the firm is paid to harvest thinnings from certain State forests. The Government decided that every effort should be made to save this remaining mill and, it is proposed with the funds provided in the Supplementary Estimate, to enter into an agreement with a local consortium to set up a new company &mdash; to be known as Chipboard Products Limited &mdash; to purchase the assets of Chipboard Limited, in Receivership, from the receiver with a view to continuing the business of particle board manufacture at Scariff. Heads of agreement, subject to contract, have already been signed and we are working as quickly as possible towards completion of the necessary contracts.</P>
    <P>The envisaged agreement can be summarised as follows: The new company will have an ordinary share capital of £527,000. Of this, private shareholders will provide £193,000 and the State will provide £334,000. There will be provision for a share option scheme which, if taken up, will increase the private share capital to £231,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> The State will also subscribe at par for £200,000 15 per cent redeemable cumulative preference shares to be redeemed by 18 equal semi-annual instalments commencing on the first day of the fourth year. Dividends on these shares will be declared &mdash; but not paid &mdash; during the first three years, and the accumulated unpaid dividends will be paid in 18 equal semi-annual instalments commencing on the first day of the fourth year.</P>
    <P>My Department will provide a loan of £466,000 to the new company for a period of 12 years. The loan will bear interest at the Exchequer lending rate ruling at the date of draw down and will be for a period of 12 years, including a moratorium of three years on payments of interest and principal. During the moratorium period interest will be capitalised half yearly and the loan, together with the interest so capitalised, will be repaid by way of 18 equal consecutive semi-annual instalments. The agreement will provide for review of interest provisions at the request of the board of the company and for the mandatory prepayment of the loan in circumstances of excess cash flow. The loan will be a first charge on the assets of the company, subject only to the security provided to the bank for a specified loan facility.</P>
    <P>There will also be provision for the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry provided he continues to be satisfied with the company's programme and the commercial justification for it, &mdash; subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance&mdash;to provide capital grants totalling £1,012,000 over a three-year period to the company. Grant agreements will be in terms similar to IDA grant agreements. Provision for the first year's grant of £293,000 is included in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing direct financial provisions, the Goverment will guarantee £400,000 of a bank loan of £750,000 to the company.</P>
    <P>The total provision required under subhead C5 in the Supplementary Estimate is therefore, £1,293,000 made up as follows:&mdash; Share capital, £334,000; Preference <Col N="264" /> shares, £200,000; Loan to company, £466,000; Capital grant, £293,000.</P>
    <P>The agreement will also provide for loans to the company by private investors of £57,000 for a period of five years, including a moratorium of 3 years on interest and principal repayments.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the State will nominate four directors to the new company and the private shareholders three.</P>
    <P>My Department also proposes to continue for three years the arrangement whereby the existing company was paid to harvest a proportion of its wood requirements from State forests and remove the wood free of charge. For this purpose a sum of £450,000 is, as I have already indicated, provided for separately in subhead C2 (7) of the main Estimate.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be happy to give Deputies any further details which they may require in relation to the proposed new company.</P>
    <P>My Department continue their policy of encouraging private forestry through the provision of grants and free technical advice. These grants are provided for under subhead D which, with £60,000, shows an increase of £10,000 over 1980. An improved grant structure was introduced by me early last year and, while its full effects will not be evident for some time, it does at this stage necessitate a modest increase in the financial provision.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the traditional response by the private sector in regard to afforestation in this country has been poor and contrasts very markedly with the situation in other EEC member states. However, I am glad to say that there are hopeful indications that this situation is now changing. I welcome this development wholeheartedly and look with confidence to an acceleration of private planting&mdash;indeed, to the stage where it can make a much greater contribution to the overall national afforestation programme which up to now has virtually relied entirely on State forestry.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should mention that the forestry proposals in the EEC &ldquo;Western Package&rdquo;, with their emphasis on private forestry, will provide a major <Col N="265" /> boost for private planting, especially in the western region. Final details of the package as a whole are still under discussion in Brussels but I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in relation to the forestry element fairly soon. For the moment I shall confine myself to saying that the grant levels envisaged under the project will afford a most attractive inducement to landowners in western counties to devote a substantial acreage of marginal land to tree growing in the coming decade. It is my hope that, when the scheme comes into operation, it will provide a solid basis on which to start redressing the imbalance that exists between State and private forestry.</P>
    <P>In subhead G, Game Development and Management&mdash;£444,600 there is an increase of £62,300, due in the main to remuneration of the wildlife rangers. The ranger service, which at present numbers 49 officers, is concerned with the better enforcement of the Wildlife Act, 1976. While an important function of the rangers relates to the hunting scene, their sphere of responsibility extends across the whole spectrum of conversation controls envisaged under the Act and includes a variety of duties such as monitoring the commercial trade in wildlife, census of wildlife species, assisting in special ecological studies, checking game council schemes and so on. Incidentally, in addition to the 49 strong corps of rangers I should mention that some 600 forestry personnel have been authorised to enforce the provisions of the Act within their allotted forest areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Grants to regional game councils to assist their local schemes for game development are also provided for under subhead G. These schemes, which are drawn up and monitored by the Department's Wildlife Advisory Service in association with the game coucils, are geared in the main towards restocking of gun club preserves with pheasant and mallard, as well as some habitat improvement and educational projects. In addition, grants on a lesser scale are made available for the development of controlled shooting facilities for out-of-state visitors: these projects <Col N="266" /> are sponsored by a joint committee representative of the Forest and Wildlife Service and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>On subhead H&mdash;Wildlife conservation: £150,000&mdash;I should explain, for information of Deputies, that, this year, this subhead is being converted, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to an ordinary subhead from its previous format as a grant-in-aid. As a grant-in-aid, the annual provision was paid into a wildlife conservation account, the unexpected balance of which was carried forward from year to year to enable commitments arising, but not finalised, within a particular year, to be met in a subsequent year. In this context, the purchase of land for conservation purposes would be the most relevant case in point but, as the funds for this activity are borne by subhead C.I., there are no compelling reasons for retaining subhead H as a grant-in-aid&mdash;hence the change-over to a normal subhead and the closing of the conservation account. This change has no practical implications for the wildlife conservation programme and the amount being provided this year will, as heretofore, be used for a variety of conservation-oriented activities including wildlife research, management of nature reserves, publicity and education, and grants to outside bodies towards conservation projects.</P>
    <P>The protection of habitats is perhaps the most important aspect of wildlife conservation. Work is continuing on the identification of important habitats, in both State and private ownership, with a view to establishing and managing a representative national network of nature reserves. During the past year I established the first six statutory nature reserves in the State and I will be adding to that number in the current year. While difficulties can arise from divergent interests where sensitive and unique wildlife sites are concerned, I hope that these can be overcome by goodwill all round and an understanding of my Department's role in regard to this important sector of the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Much of the expenditure under subhead H in 1981 will be concerned with research, an essential element of the <Col N="267" /> wildlife conservation programme. The research work includes surveys of woodland and wetland, fauna and flora and ecological studies of a number of important species of fauna, for example the fox, peregrine falcon, Greenland white-fronted goose and woodland birds. Grants will be made available to outside bodies engaged in practical conservation projects either on their own initiative or at the behest of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Advisory Council, which was established in 1978, continued to provide a flow of constructive advice to my Department and I am happy to acknowledge the dedication shown and the valuable assistance given by the members of the council during the past year. The council's term of office recently expired but, as a mark of my appreciation of their good work over the past three years, I have invited all the existing members to serve for a second term.</P>
    <P>Public information and education is a very important aspect of wildlife conservation and my Department supplies a variety of information leaflets and booklets on wildlife subjects aimed at encouraging greater respect for wild fauna and flora and concern for their habitats. Recent additions to the range of available material include an attractive poster on the country code and a revised, indexed edition of <i>Wildlife and the Law</i> which is a practical guide to the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>My Department is also playing its part in wildlife conservation matters at international level &mdash; particularly in the context of EEC and Council of Europe activities. A wide-ranging EEC Directive on bird conservation, adopted in 1979, will come into operation shortly and I am glad to say that our existing wildlife legislation will be adequate for its implementation. The question of the ratification by Ireland of a number of international conventions &mdash; the Ramsar, Washington, Berne and Bonn Conventions &mdash; dealing with different facets of wildlife conservation, is also being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>Under subhead I &mdash; Agency Advisory and Special Services &mdash; the amount of £15,000 being provided this year is <Col N="268" /> intended mainly to meet the expenses of the Wildlife Advisory Council, to whose activities I have already paid tribute. The reduction in the overall provision under the subhead is explained by the fact that only a token amount is included for the funding of research on timber technology by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in the current year. During the past decade the aggregate funds allocated by my Department for the purpose of this exercise have amounted to almost £1 million. While there is no question of underestimating the importance of, or abandoning, the work, it was considered, having regard to the overall constraints in the allocation of available funds, that to devote further substantial funds to this particular work this year would not be justifiable. However, I can assure the House that the situation is being kept under review and, in this connection, the inclusion in the Estimate of a token provision would facilitate an adjustment should such a course be warranted later in the year. I should perhaps add that, aside from the timber technology aspect, the ongoing silvicultural research programme undertaken by the Forest and Wildlife Service is being fully maintained.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the vast bulk of subhead J &mdash; Appropriations in Aid &mdash; £6,599,600 &mdash; which relates to income accruing to the forest and wildlife service during the year &mdash; is accounted for by sales of timber. In present market circumstances, the immediate opportunities for increasing revenue from timber sales are limited and subhead J inevitably reflects this temporarily unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>In so far as pulpwood is concerned, the domestic market is still depressed and some temporary measures, including sale of raw material for export, must be tolerated in the interests of generating income, maintaining employment and ensuring continuity of trained harvesting personnel. I am, however, confident that the maintenance of the existing outlet at Scariff and the advent of the new industry at Clonmel, to which I have already referred, will provide a firm basis for the development of a steady and sound market <Col N="269" /> for smaller forest produce in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards sawlog, current prices &mdash; which are largely governed by the level of activity in the building industry &mdash; are about 25 per cent lower than in the early part of last year. However, in anticipation of a stronger market, I hope to increase substantially the volume of sawlog material available for sale this year but, in the light of very strong competition from imported timber, the anticipated increased sales of homegrown timber may not produce additional income to the extent that would normally be expected. In so far as transmission poles are concerned the level of sales remains fairly constant and I am glad to say that both the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the ESB are purchasing all the suitable homegrown material we can provide.</P>
    <P>While we are facing temporary problems in the area of wood sales, there is no doubt that this is a temporary feature. Wood continues to be a scarce resource in the European Economic Community, and indeed elsewhere in the world, and there is no doubt that, as the present worldwide recession eases, our confidence in our forest policy of continuing to produce this important and versatile renewable resource will be fully justified.</P>
    <P>I trust that this detailed up-to-date presentation of the Fisheries and Forestry Estimates, including the Supplementary Estimate for Forestry, will have given the House a good overall picture of the various activities of my Department, the two sides of which have much in common. In pure economic terms, they are jointly concerned with the development, harvesting and processing of natural resources, fish and wood respectively. Notwithstanding their biological differences, these resources represent not only a worthwhile source of employment but also considerable opportunities in the sphere of import substitution potential. From the social standpoint, the two Votes involve activities which generate wide-ranging benefits of an environmental, recreational and educational nature. My Department as a unit will spare no effort, within the resources <Col N="270" /> available to it, to ensure that these very valuable resources continue to be exploited for the national benefit.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the House and look farward to an interesting debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I must compliment the Minister on the way he has read his speech. It is one of the best read speeches I have ever heard come before this House. There is nothing new in the speech at all since last year. I would like to start with three points that the Minister mentioned. Firstly, he said that he does not accept that the fishing industry is in a crisis situation as suggested in some quarters. In a few minutes I would like to deal specifically with the state of the fishing industry in this country. Secondly, when the Minister was talking about the seizure or repossession of boats &mdash; he called it the resumption of fishing vessels &mdash; by BIM, I thought that some very smart work had been written into this speech to try to cod the people of this House about the present position as far as the fishing industry is concerned. When the Minister was dealing with the amounts of salmon he did not quote the figure caught in 1980. He did not even quote the figure caught in 1979. He quoted the figure of 1,180 tons caught in 1978 less 9 per cent for 1979 and less 16 per cent for 1980. It seems to be a most peculiar way to state the amount of salmon caught in this country in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never heard such waffle from anybody as has come out of the debate here on Fisheries and Forestry this morning. Anybody could have written that speech two years ago or last year. I am beginning to wonder if the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, whom personally I respect, is really concerned about the fishing industry at present. Does he realise that the fishing industry is on the verge of bankruptcy? For him to state here that he does not say to the fishermen that the industry is in a crisis indicates that something is completely wrong. Does he or do his Department know of the terrible state the fishing industry is in at present? Who was it who once said that Nero fiddles while Rome burns? I am not stating that <Col N="271" /> the fishing industry is burning, but I am stating that at present it is on the verge of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>This time last year I had the pleasure of speaking in this debate and I also had the pleasure of complimenting the Minister on his new position as Minister of Fisheries and Forestry. I stated then that any co-operation we on this side of the House could give him on behalf of the fishing industry we would certainly give him. Now, nearly 18 months since he has taken up this post as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, I would like him in his reply to point to one thing he has done on behalf of the fishing industry that was not planned 18 months ago, apart from taking over the forestry fair in Kildare. I would like him to point to one new directive that he has made on behalf of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>Like a lot of other people in this country, I have been most disappointed at the shilly-shallying that has gone on at home and abroad from the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry on behalf of Irish fishermen, and I do not say things like that lightly. I would not call it a pleasure, but I went to meet fishermen recently with my fellow-Deputy from my constituency. Before that I had the pleasure of meeting other fishermen around the coast. The facts and figures we heard came not just from the fishermens organisations, whom we would expect to speak out solely on behalf of the fishermen, but also from personal friends of ours in the fishing industry, who are not going to try to cod us or tell us lies. These statistics are depressing. From speaking with these people personally, I am convinced that, unless something is done quickly on behalf of the Irish fishing industry, at least one-third of our boats will be tied up by the end of this summer. I hope that when the Minister is replying he can tell this House that he is aware now of the situation, even though he was not up to this, and that he will look into the figures to find out why these fishermen are on the verge of bankruptcy at present. We have met also the different fishing organisations and, like the fishermen, they are <Col N="272" /> very concerned at the present state of the industry. Some people would go so far as to state that in the last 30 years the fishing industry has never been in such dire straits. It is unbelievable, coming into this House this morning, to hear the waffle that the Minister has gone on with regarding the fishing industry. He had not mentioned one idea concerning how he proposes to take the Irish fishermen out of the predicament they are in at present.</P>
    <P>As Opposition spokesman on Fisheries at this time, I would like to explain what I feel is wrong with the industry and how in the short term that could be dealt with. I hope the Minister will take note and that in his reply he can promise that some immediate action will be taken on behalf of the fishermen. Costs have risen so fast over the last three years, particularly that of diesel, that the fishermen find now that they are not able even to break even. On the other side of the coin, fish prices have tumbled, particularly with reference to third countries importing fish into the EEC. An interesting fact is that four years ago fishermen were receiving a bigger price for their fish than they are receiving at present. The price of diesel over the last four years has risen from about 30p a gallon to 93p a gallon, when at the same time the cost of fish in England and in the EEC countries has dropped, it is estimated that fishermen get about 18 per cent of the price of the fish eventually sold in the retail market. There seems to be a big gap between what the fishermen are getting, what the processers are making and what the retailers are marking up as profit in the shops.</P>
    <P>Leaving all that aside, there are maybe three ways in which the fishermen can be helped at present. Make no mistake about it, unless something is done for the fishing industry within the next three or four months, these men will have to tie up their boats and will not be able to go out fishing any more because of the high price of diesel. It is estimated that 50 per cent of the expenditure on fishing boats at present is in respect of diesel. Even with a 65 hp boat it is estimated that for the six people to earn even £100 a week <Col N="273" /> they would have to take in £3,300 worth of fish catches. Something has to be done. If we go back we will find probably that the fault lies with the negotiations in the EEC. There is no point in the Minister in his reply saying, as he says in his speech, that things cannot be done in this country without the OK from Brussels.</P>
    <P>I have a few little things which I would like to quote. <i>The European Parliament Working Documents 1980-81</i> on page 40 and onwards states that the German Government give subsidies to the German fishing fleet, the French Government give fuel subsidies, maintenance costs and interest rate relief to their fleet, the British Government have given massive subsidies to their fleet &mdash; and I am not talking about the EEC, I am talking about direct British aid and I will come back to it in a minute &mdash; and the Danish Government have put a moratorium on repayments for their boats. I am quoting that because the usual thing we hear from the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is that he has not the power to introduce some lifeline for the Irish fishermen. That is proof of the different subsidies that different states are giving their own fishermen, while at the same time over the last four years not one bob has been pumped in by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for the fishermen here. The <i>Fishing News</i> of 30 February 1981 states that the British fishermen are about to demand £30 million in direct financial aid from their own British Government. In 1980 the British fleet received £14.1 million in aid for the fishing industry on 29 September. That depended on the size of boats. Each boat was given a cash payment to tide it over the recession which is affecting the fishing fleets in all the nations of the EEC at present. For example, a 75-80 ft. boat last September got a grant of £9,450. A boat of 45-56 ft. received £1,350, and so on. The point is that the English fishermen have been looked after by the British Government. The Danish fishermen have been looked after by the Danish Government, German fishermen are looked after by the Germans, and the French fishermen by the French, but the Irish fishermen are let go to the wall.</P>
    <P>Fishing is one of the industries we <Col N="274" /> should be developing in this country, instead of having me standing up here today stating that, sadly, this industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is on its knees, and something must be done about it by the present administration. I suppose the Minister is going to ask me what can be done. I suppose he is going to ask me where the two pennies, the two widow's mites that were given to the fishermen in the last budget, have gone. As I understood it, the Taoiseach and the Minister last November agreed that the entire excise duty would be deducted in the budget of 1981. Yet the Minister for Finance, when he was telling us about the tremendous support he was giving to Irish fishermen, in fact was giving them a 2p rebate on their excise duty to alleviate the cost of diesel, which he knew was crippling the industry. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry did not tell us that the following week we would have another increase of 9p a gallon on diesel. That was in the beginning of February. The Minister for Finance did not tell us that before the end of March the fishermen would receive another shock, another 9p a gallon, bringing the cost of diesel now up to 93p a gallon, the highest price of diesel anywhere in Europe at present as far as the fishermen are concerned.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Forestry and Fisheries realise that the French fishermen are paying only 50p a gallon for diesel? The Germans are paying something similar and even our neighbours in England have to pay only 60p a gallon for their diesel? Yet, our Irish fishermen are being crippled by being asked to pay 93p a gallon. I am not saying that this is the way out of the present industrial crisis, but I suggest that the entire extra 5p which the Revenue Commissioners get from excise on diesel oil should now be removed, as a first step towards alleviating the financial position of the fishermen. I have said many times to our fishermen around the coast that, if we do not expand our fishing industry now and cannot come up with our quota catches, we will never get increased quotas in future years from the EEC. Our fishing industry <Col N="275" /> must be kept afloat by immediate assistance from the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder if the Minister is the &ldquo;hind tit man&rdquo; for the Minister for Agriculture. Agriculture seems to be getting all the subsidies &mdash; the cattle headage grants and an extra £20 a week subsidy for extra workers taken on. The fishermen, on the other hand, do not even get State insurance at present. I have been talking about diesel oil, but I could also talk about &mdash; not the word the Minister used, not a moratorium, but delayed repayments on some boats, particularly in regard to the fishermen who have found themselves behind in their repayments through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I will be dealing later on with the position regarding the Celtic Sea. But I say now that fishermen, on the south-east coast particularly, who find themselves behind in their repayments are in that position because the Celtic Sea was completely closed to them. A very lenient view should be taken regarding their repayments and some extra incentive should be devised, such as a delayed repayment scheme to the BIM. Special consideration &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;special&rdquo;&mdash; must be given to any fisherman who has fallen by the wayside, not through any fault of his but through the fault of the EEC, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and Fianna Fáil because of their negligence in handling this industry in the last four years. In the short-term and the long-term, a price support scheme is needed now for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of weeks my fellow countyman, who will be talking in a similar vein, and I have met the different fishing interests in Donegal, particularly the Killybegs Fishermen's Association. we have sat down and worked out, the Minister and his officials will be glad to hear, some solution which would be acceptable to the Irish fishermen at no great cost. This solution is called a price support scheme for fish. I do not want the Minister, when replying, to say that this cannot be done without getting sanction from the EEC. It has been done in Britain in the last number of years and <Col N="276" /> there has not been a murmur about it from the EEC. The reason for this is that the British Minister for Fisheries is concerned about their fishing industry. He is concerned about the situation of the boats and about the price of fish. He has introduced a price support scheme away and above the compensatory price being paid at present by the EEC.</P>
    <P>How many people realise that, if a fishermen brings a box of mackerel into a port but cannot sell his mackerel, he is given 2½p a lb. of a compensatory EEC allowance? I wonder how many people realise that in 1980 there were 10,200 tons of fish withdrawn from the Irish market because there was no price for it and fishermen had to take up the pittance of 2½ pence by the EEC. That was for mackerel. One does not have to be an economist &mdash; I think the Minister is a scholar &mdash; to work out for oneself the fact that that kind of money will not pay anybody for fishing. I do not have to tell you that we meet constituents working on fishing boats who have not received a brass farthing since the beginning of the year because the price of fish has been so bad.</P>
    <P>I asked you a question last week which was answered for you by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The question related to the price of fish in the EEC and the compensatory price for whiting. The answer I got from Deputy Hussey &mdash; I am sure you saw the script &mdash; was that you were quite satisfied and the Irish fishermen were quite satisfied with the new arrangements made in Brussels and you were congratulated on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but he must address the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. The Minister seems to be satisfied with the increase we are getting from the EEC. He seems to be satisfied with whiting falling from £8 to £6 a box. He seems to be satisfied that whiting at six pence a lb. was a fair price to offer Irish fishermen in 1981 to enable those fishermen to make a livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to price support which will cost no more than about £5 million, and <Col N="277" /> the possibility is it will not cost that at all like the intervention beef, there is a floor economic price which leads fishermen to believe that they will at least break even over the 12 months. If we got the same allowance for diesel that the French are getting that would be fine but we must be realistic. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that the fishing industry will get a shot in the arm to prevent it going to the wall. Surely it can be treated in the same way in the EEC as the English and the other countries are. The kind of support scheme I am talking about need not be that great at all. For mackerel there should be an increase of £1.69 a box to give the fishermen a minimum price of £5 a box or five pence a 1b. That is not too much to expect. That would be better than having the Minister for Social Welfare paying these fishermen the dole. Is it too much to expect whiting fishermen to be given a guaranteed price of £10 a box or 10 pence a 1b. If you do not do something like this we will be back here week after week on the Adjournment, on Supplementary Estimates and at Question Time telling you that in the month of March 1981 you were warned that the fishing industry was on the verge of bankruptcy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I have made my <Col N="278" /> point loud and clear. Would the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry consider the state the industry is in? The Minister said we were aware of the lack of markets here and the lack of proper marketing. I quite agree. I have been giving the short-term view. A sum of £3 million to £5 million is required to rescue the industry.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has sanctioned a number of new processing firms. The processing industry will have to be developed. I gave a figure of 18 per cent as the amount estimated that the fishermen actually catch of the entire fish sold. Our fishermen are getting about £17 a box for cod and that is transshipped to England where the middle man gets £37 a box. He makes £20 profit. We will have to process as much fish as possible. The Minister said that there are 1,600 people employed in the processing industry. In Bremerhaven there are 11,000 employed. In Killybegs, with an annual turnover of £5 million, only 500 people are employed. This is a part of the industry that could and should be developed. It has a tremendous employment potential. After that comes the important question of marketing. We have only one marketing man abroad. I asked a question about this and I was told the number of marketing people BIM had abroad. In actual fact we have one man in Paris on behalf of BIM, the Irish fishermen and the Department. It is high time we treated the industry as a business and a profitable business at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Dr. Meaney on his appointment as CEO of BIM. The industry has lost a friend in Mr. Brendan O'Kelly but I hope Dr. Meaney will be a new broom that will sweep clean. I hope we shall see many new ideas from the new man. He has the right qualifications for developing the fishing industry. Something radical must be done quickly about fish marketing. We should set up a system like Bord Bainne or Córas Tráchtála. Córas Tráchtála offices could take a fishing representative in the countries where they operate to promote Irish processed fish. It could be pre-packed in Ireland and sold abroad. When the Minister spoke of <Col N="279" /> the increased fishing industry it reminded me of a firm increasing its turnover so quickly that in the following couple of months the firm is in bankruptcy because they created too much too soon. It is nice to see the total fish catch increasing but unless we can process it, market it and get the maximum price for it a great deal of money will be lost to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister is off to Brussels tomorrow to meet his European counterparts. I understand there has been a row between Britain and Germany in the EEC discussions that have taken place and will be continuing tomorrow. We know that the reasons for the row is that Germany wants to be allowed to fish for 6,000 tonnes of cod in Canadian waters. Perhaps the figure is not exact but it is near enough. In return, the Canadians would be allowed to export into the EEC 30 tonnes. The cost of diesel in this country is 93p per gallon while the cost in Canada is 25p per gallon but because of the different size of the gallon in Canada which is only five-eights of our gallon the price works out at 40p per gallon.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that the reference price for fish coming into third countries has to be increased substantially because most other countries, particularly the Canadians, the Norwegians and the Icelanders are fishing much more cheaply than Irish fishermen. With lower basic costs the end product cannot be produced at the same price. I hope when the Minister is in Brussels tomorrow he will see that whatever tonnage of fish &mdash; I would hope none but being a realist I know he will probably have to agree on some figure &mdash; that is permitted to be imported is kept as low as possible. The secret is to get the reference price up above the support price that I mentioned earlier. It comes back to simple arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been remarkably quiet. He is not always so quiet here. Perhaps he has not the right PRO working for him. He has been very quiet when he has gone to Brussels to talk for Irish fishermen. All I heard him say was that he thinks that a satisfactory solution will <Col N="280" /> be worked out and that we shall be seeking exclusive zones for Irish fishermen. To me that means exclusive zones and I think we &mdash; and I mean all of us &mdash; cannot accept anything less than a complete ban on foreign vessels inside a 12 mile zone. The Minister will have the backing of this side of the House if he seeks that. Under Article 2 of our Constitution the Irish people have the right to the territorial seas off our coast. You are a great man at quoting constitutions at times. You should be able to get advice. You cannot accept anything less than a 12 mile zone. You, as the Irish Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to the chat across the floor of the House. That will not do. The Deputy must address the Chair and must speak in the third person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair also represents a fishing constituency and will agree that just as important as our 12 mile exclusive zone is that the Minister for Fisheries should have the sole right to allow Irish fishermen to fish in that 12 mile zone and specify the amount of fish they may catch and see that no other boat, no matter from where it comes, will be allowed inside that zone unless they come in to unload their cargoes at the processing factories we propose to set up. One of those things is as important as the other. In no way can we accept anything less.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Minister will be allowed to open the Celtic Sea and we shall be allowed to fish 100 tonnes of herring&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Multiply it by 10 &mdash; 1,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I meant to say 1,000. That herring may only be fished by boats of 50 feet length. Does this mean that no outside boat, no boat from the west coast of England or the Isle of Man will be allowed to fish herring in the Celtic Sea? Secondly, is the Minister satisfied &mdash; I am not &mdash; that the 50 feet should not be increased to 85 feet for these boats.? When talking about the Celtic Sea I hope we are also talking about a famous zone <Col N="281" /> known as 7A off Donegal; I hope that will be open for the Donegal Fishermen. I always speak for the two zones together. If we opened these areas to all the fishing boats in the Community it would only be a matter of a very short time before the herring grounds would be shut again due to over-fishing. Quotas were introduced for EEC member states but none of them has worked. We must insist again that our 12 mile zone will be operative and that the Celtic Sea will be fished by Irishmen and by no one else.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look into the situation in regard to flags of convenience. Some Dutch fishermen are now registering in Belgium so that they can take up the Belgain quota because the Belgians are not fishing. Guernsey boats are being registered in England and they can go back to Guernsey where they do not have to pay tax on their fishing operations. It gives them an unfair advantage. This will have to be tightened up. The Spanish could register in England if they were allowed. They can certainly register in Belgium, and probably in Ireland under the Irish flag. Then they would be given part of the Irish quota.</P>
      <P>For instance, one of the finest fish processing factories in these islands has been established in Castletownbere and is being supplied by three Spanish boats. Simply because they have a factory in County Cork they are allowed to fish within our 12-mile zone. The Minister must get a guarantee that more Spanish boats will not be allowed to fish in Irish waters, because if the owners of this factory put in a new application we could have a further 20 Spanish boats fishing in our waters.</P>
      <P>Last week, I addressed a question to the Minister, who was not here, about a rumour that interest rates on fishermen's loans for new boats are to be increased from 8 per cent to 14 per cent. I hope the Minister, when he is replying to the debate, will deny this rumour. The answer I got from the poor Minister of State amounted to nil. He did not know, and I could not expect him to know. The Minister knows and I hope he will scotch that rumour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our deep sea fishing industry is on the <Col N="282" /> verge of bankruptcy and it will go to the wall unless something is done immediately. The Minister can expect all the ammunition we have in the Opposition to be used to make him look after our fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to frighten anybody. Besides, the Minister has enough big guns in Kildare. He is the representative of Irish fishermen and he does not seem to give a damn about how much take home pay our fishermen have. The Minister can interrupt all he likes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot because it is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about inland fisheries and referred to the Bill on this subject which was debated in 1979 and passed last April. The Minister spoke about the new Central Fisheries Board and the district boards. This is not anything new &mdash; it is all in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that Act there is provision for a 10 per cent salmon levy. When we were on the Committee Stage of that Bill I asked the Minister how much he expected the levy to yield, and his answer was £450,000 annually. At Question Time last week I found that the actual yield has been only £153,000, only a third of the yield estimated. Something has gone terribly wrong. It has also transpired that the people on the Innishowen side and on the other side of the Foyle do not pay the levy because they say it is unconstitutional. We all know that salmon is being imported, and I understand that the levy is not imposed on that. Therefore, the only people who are paying this salmon levy are the poor devils fishing in the west and the north-west. The final nail in the fishermen's coffin is that this levy was supposed to finance the restocking of our rivers. Can the Minister tell us what new restocking has taken place in the year since the Bill was passed, how many smolts have been put into the rivers in that time? I do not think the revenue from the levy has been spent in that way. <Col N="283" /> I suggest that, if the levy is not collected and administered in an equitable way, it should be abolished forthwith.</P>
    <P>I understand that intensively reared salmon are being sold on the London market in greater numbers and at cheaper prices than the royal salmon caught around our coasts. The Norwegians catch seven times more intensively reared salmon than we do of royal salmon. There does not seem to have been any directive from the Minister in regard to the potential for mariculture or aquaculture or intensive salmon rearing. A multinational undertaking are to set up a big operation in Castletownbere. Apparently people must begin to do things themselves, because BIM, whose job it is, do not seem to be educating the public in this regard. We are told that one of the BIM's functions is developing and marketing. They should be explaining to the people the potential of aquaculture and mariculture. I understand that their restocking job has come to an end and I hope that Dr. Meaney will see the importance of these developments.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be glad to hear that I visited Wexford recently. There is a mussel farm down there and their main worry &mdash; and again the Minister will have to take this up in Brussels &mdash; is that there seems to be no reference price for mussels coming in to the EEC from the Third countries. There must be some kind of safety valve for an enterprise like this that is developing so well but is being undercut by Korean mussels coming all the way from Korea to the EEC because their basic costs are cheaper. A reference price must be introduced not just for mussels but for every type of fish here.</P>
    <P>In Mulroy Bay there are very encouraging signs of tremendous potential for scallops. I would like to congratulate the Department on organising a seminar which was held to explain to the local people and also to the press and the entire people of Donegal so that they realise that in Mulroy Bay there is a type of development that can and should be expanded. If this is done properly there is a lot of revenue to be gained therefrom. <Col N="284" /> Mulroy Bay is unique here because the water does not go in and out as fast as it does in most other bays.</P>
    <P>The one cause of concern that everybody at that seminar had was that the Department have issued a licence to the ESB to allow them to have 20 cages for intensive salmon farming in Mulroy Bay. The people who know most, the people in the research laboratories have a twofold fear. The first is that it is not proven that the droppings from the salmon are not injurious to shellfish and they think the opposite could be the case. In the reports it is shown that within a 35 foot radius of these cages no shell fish will live because of the effluent. The second fear is that this effluent, in time, is part of the cause of this terrible disease known as Red Tide and that the more intensive the salmon farming the greater the chance of Red Tide. We do not mind the 20 cages that have already been erected. But we would certainly not like to see any more licences given for fish farming in Mulroy Bay, because it is a unique bay and it should be developed as a shellfish bay. There are plenty of other bays suitable for trout and salmon rearing, but Mulroy Bay is the only one suitable for scallop farming. I hope that the Department and the Minister will take this into consideration because, in the long term, we could be killing the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention the position regarding the St. George's Bay oyster beds in Clarinbridge. Again, I hope that when he is replying he will state his position regarding St. George's Bay. The Minister knows that, under the Bill he put through the House last year with our approval, one of the sections provided that the central board had the right to acquire fishery rights here when they came up for sale. I hope that the Minister will clarify the position with regard to St. George's Bay in his reply.</P>
    <P>I could deal with fisheries for another two hours because I have so much to say about it, but in the time that is left to me I have to deal with forestry. Again I would like to emphasise that whoever the Minister is getting his information from in regard to fisheries does not seem to <Col N="285" /> know anything about it. The Minister states that he does not accept that the industry is in a crisis situation as suggested in some quarters. In all quarters, certainly in the Minister's Department, certainly in BIM, it was admitted months ago that the fishing industry is in dire straits; it is on the verge of bankruptcy. I hope that, when the Minister is replying he will give the fishermen some indication that he is concerned about the fishing industry. He is the Minister for Fisheries and, as such, he should be concerned about the industry, about the livelihoods of the fishermen. I hope that he can give the House a guarantee that something will be done immediately to safeguard livelihoods, to safeguard the industry and to ensure that in this crisis time the Government will inject money into the fishing industry as other countries have done off their own bat without the EEC.</P>
    <P>I now turn to forestry. As far as forestry is concerned, I would like to deal with it in two parts. It is worth noting that in regard to the fishing industry we are talking about an Estimate of just £20 million, whereas the Estimate for Forestry is £30 million. Very few people realise that the forestry side of the Minister's Department is half as big again, as far as the Estimates are concerned, as the fishery side. Before the Minister started to speak certain Deputies on this side of the House had some reservations about this new company that is being set up in Scariff. The position is that we have all been very concerned over the last couple of years about our forestry factories, if I may call them such. For example, we have seen Munster Chipboard going into receivership; then we saw Scariff Chipboard going into receivership. I understand the Department then got a firm of consultants, Arthur Little and Company, to look into the industry to see what best should be done in the long term.</P>
    <P>I agree 100 per cent with this. I realise that there is tremendous potential in the forestry industry here. It will probably increase our work force in the next seven or eight years by about 4,000 if it is handled properly and I will deal with that in a few minutes. But I cannot understand why we have got into such a complicated <Col N="286" /> set-up here of share capital, preference shares, loans to capital and capital grants. It would take a qualified accountant an hour to study the two pages which I have been endeavouring to study in the last few minutes to try to sort out this jigsaw puzzle. In the last 50 years we have invested in the forestry industry. We have seen the trees growing and we have seen them now, over the last couple of years, coming to maturity. I hope that the State will take a major interest in the large processing firms that are to come here. Otherwise it will be like having an oilwell off the Porcupine Bank and the State just handing it over to multinational companies and giving them grants for exploring it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the State taking a major stake in forestry enterprises as far as processing and marketing are concerned. In the Department we have probably the best experts available in relation to forestry. I am convinced of this. The problem starts at the forest gate. We have a policy regarding the forest gate which none of us can criticise except for the fact that we are only planting about 16,000 acres at present. We should be planting about 25,000 acres. What happens when these trees leave the forest gate? Private individuals buy and collect them and sometimes they ship them abroad. I would like to see this type of development taking place, whereby the Department of Fisheries and Forestry would set up a semi-State body to deal with the processing and marketing of timber or to set aside a specialised section in the Department, completely separate from the growing end.</P>
    <P>I would like to see proper processing plants erected and developed on a profitable basis here. I am afraid the State seems to be giving away everything. For example, the State has given a grant of £293,000, it has given a loan of £466,000. It has taken out ordinary share capital of £334,000 and preference share capital of £200,000. It is allowing this company to take timber from the forest free of charge. I realise, as the Minister realises, the problem that we have with thinnings, which have to be taken out, otherwise the other trees will not grow to maturity. <Col N="287" /> I do not think that anybody can seriously suggest that a factory, unless it is a State factory, run by private individuals, should be given free timber. When the Minister is replying, I should like him to state the exact share that the State is going to take in this new industry. I would also like to know exactly the amount of money that the private individuals are contributing in hard cash. There is a difference between putting up money and putting in hard cash. I want to see exactly the share that the State is going to hold and the share which private individuals are going to hold.</P>
    <P>Trees have been grown here for the past 50 years. It does not matter which Government were in power, they all invested in trees. Therefore, it is fundamentally, psychologically wrong to start thinking now of handing over the profitable end of the business to private enterprise. I hope, as far as policy is concerned, that there is not going to be a major difference between the Minister and this side of the House. I think it should be a State enterprise advised by the experts from the private side. They are paying their fair share and are not being given buckshee money as has been done so often in the past. We are not talking about a microchip industry. We are talking about native timber. I want questions answered and even though we passed the Supplementary Estimate for Forestry without a vote, we might have to have a vote in the long run unless we get a definate commitment from the Minister that the State is going to take a major share in the forest enterprise and in any other forest processing firm which is set up.</P>
    <P>I heard, on very good authority, that the IDA had secured a very big European processing timber firm to take over Scariff. The IDA put it to the Minister. I understand that the Minister put it to the Government for sanction that this European firm would reopen Scariff. The Government decided that the firm of Mclnerney would be given the option rather than the European firm. I honestly feel that when a processing timber industry is set up here, the State should have <Col N="288" /> a major share in it. Scariff in Minister did make a profit and in a few year's time this is going to be a most profitable enterprise. I am totally convinced that the forestry industry is one of the most under-developed at present. We can thank our ancestors for having the foresight to develop this industry.</P>
    <P>People talk about oil imports. How many people realise that timber is our second biggest import. Over 80 per cent of the timber we use is being imported. It is being imported from Finland, Russia and Canada, countries which are outside the EEC. A definite policy is needed now for the forestry industry. It is estimated that in 1990, it will be our most important industry if it is properly developed. If that is done we will be an exporting country in the EEC within nine years. There is tremendous potential in the forestry industry if it is developed properly; and, unless we get a definite commitment from the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry on this now we will have no hesitation in putting the Estimate to a vote. I come from private enterprise myself but from this angle I see no reason why, as in the case of Bord na Móna, some section could not set up in the Department of Forestry.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the position regarding the surveying of biomass. Much as he admires research, it is hard to understand how the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have axed the IIRS £.5 million commitment and that research is not taking place in that body at present. Now is the time when, instead of axing that £.5 million, it should be increased. I understand that the Department are working on a project whereby willow trees can be planted in soft, rushy fields and every five years or so a crop cut down to about a foot above the ground. It will not even have to be re-planted. It will be chopped down and can be made into some form of energy. This type of research should be developed more and more and these people should be given the money for this purpose. In the long term the bogs and rushy fields, particularly in Leitrim and the north-west, which are not being utilised could be used for this. The small farmers could make far <Col N="289" /> more money if the State, even at this time, thought of taking some kind of share in their land and planting this type of tree crop over a period. Firstly, the farmers would be better off; secondly, the State would be better off; and, thirdly, we would be saving so much money when it comes to the import of energy. That is something very small but I am really disappointed that the Department have cut this £5 million from forestry.</P>
    <P>There is much potential in the timber industry at present. Bord na Móna manufacture briquettes. There is nothing to prevent a similar type of briquette being made from wood chip. This would be another saving in energy and research should be developing on this all the time. Also there should be some formula whereby processors would be able to dry their timber a lot faster than at present in their drying sheds. We have been importing 84 per cent of our timber and this has included dried timber. Now is the time to do the research so that in four or five years we may hope to talk to each other across this floor and say that these things are coming on stream. With the right directive any Minister for Fisheries and Forestry can make a name for himself over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>I question the amount of money we are spending on private planting at present. I believe that the State has done a marvellous job in forestry. I doubt whether the private planting project, even though at present one can get £105 an acre grant in respect of it, is so successful. The Minister should give thought to changing that scheme and encouraging his Department to take a share basis in lands and develop them. Over a five-or ten-year period, the farmers would be better off. Even though there may be one, two or ten good private estates, most of the private forest schemes have not really worked. Some of the banks and multinationals are now starting to look at the possibility of tree-rearing. It is interesting to know that it costs about £200 an acre to plant trees in this country and at today's value on £200 in 14 years' time the profit would be £4,355 for the same acreage, and we have to allow for the time involved. We should <Col N="290" /> be encouraging more and more people to plant forests.</P>
    <P>The sawmill industry is in a depressed state at present and the IDA have given substantial grants over the last 12 months to that industry. Here is an industry where the sky is the limit as far as potential is concerned. We are not bugged by fire being a hazard in the forests as it is in other countries. We have a damp climate here which is very suitable for growing trees, and fire is a minimal risk in Ireland compared with some other countries. I am concerned that we have bought only 16,000 acres of land last year to develop forestry. Any Minister must aim for 25,000 acres a year, because this is an on-going thing. So many acres of land are going to waste in this country that the Minister should be taking over and developing. He did say in his speech that more money is available in 1981 for the purchase of this type of land, but he did not say that the money was not taken up in 1980 and that this land was not bought in 1980 and should have been bought then. I would like to see this target increased, and I am not being unrealistic when its potential is considered. In the long term the only way that it can be increased is for us to buy as much land suitable for forestry as is available to be bought and utilised. Any Minister who stands up in this House to state that we have bought only 16,000 acres of forestry land in 1980 is not doing the State justice.</P>
    <P>In regard to the banks and multinationals, I understand that four of them have bought land in the last month. Could some scheme be worked out whereby their investment would be tax free? It is accepted generally that if you are planting for a long period you do not get profit until the trees are cut. We should give them a tax incentive, over a ten-year period perhaps, that would be a guarantee that if the timber is growing for longer than a ten-year period they would not have to pay any tax on their eventual profit. The State should increase its acreage and private individuals should increase their acreage also.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to speak this morning. Although the fishing <Col N="291" /> industry is in a state of bankruptcy, the forestry industry offers tremendous potential. I am disappointed that we have had no new ideas on the forestry industry from the Minister. I would have expected him to be briefed on the potential of this industry, this little gold mine we could have if it were developed properly. I hope he will be able to guarantee to the House that the line the Government are taking on processing and marketing is a State line, and that the State will take a high interest in the industry. I hope he can guarantee that we are not throwing money into another Scariff and that in another three or four years' time we will not be faced with another factory on the verge of bankruptcy. Management, knowledge and expertise are needed in the forestry industry today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the appalling conditions in the fishing industry today we were entitled to expect some positive indication of help from the Minister. We looked forward to this Estimate for that specific purpose. Having listened to the Minister very carefully, one must conclude that the introduction of this Estimate is not merely a non-event, but essentially a sad event. It gives no gleam of hope to the many thousands of people engaged in the fishing industry that the past number of years of great privation and acute hardship are nearly ended.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed signally to grapple effectively with the issues involved. In his statement he merely skimmed over the issues, and he patently ignored the basic problems which are there for all to see. Having regard to the plight of the industry as we know it, I assert that the Minister has treated this House and the industry with contempt. His contribution in respect of fisheries in particular was very brief on this occasion. It was a weak and puerile effort, similar to the lamentable role he has played in the defence of this industry in Brussels over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were entitled to look to this Estimate for some indication from the Minister that at last he would take steps to <Col N="292" /> stem the drift towards penury and bankruptcy in this industry. His approach has been a shameful evasion of responsibility in this area. Realising the serious situation which has beset the industry for so long, certainly since Fianna Fáil came back into power, it is extremely difficult to understand why we have had this puerile approach in this House today.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not accept that the industry is in a crisis situation. That statement will cause widespread indignation and anger amongst all the people directly involved. Is there anyone who is even remotely associated with the fishing industry who would agree with that statement? Is there any boat owner or fisherman who would agree with that statement? Surely the evidence is there for all to see. The Minister's statement that there is no crisis flies in the face of the truth and the facts. The protestations in recent years, and in more immediate times, by the various fishermen's organisations are proof of that.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it that the Minister is deaf and blind and has not heard or seen these people clamouring for admission to his office or besieging the gates of Leinster House? It is a starting statement which will be repudiated by all the leaders of the fishery organisations. I derive no personal satisfaction from saying this, and I do not wish to secure any political kudos for being frank and blunt about the situation. There are no votes for me in respect of fisheries in the constituency I represent. I have an obligation to my party and to the people involved in the industry which we in the Labour Party have always treasured as one of our most wonderful assets.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that, over the past four years, the Fianna Fáil Administration have brought nothing but despondency and economic ruin to this industry. The people who reposed their confidence in Fianna Fáil in the last general election, and accepted their glowing promises of a 50-mile exclusive fishing limit and a new era of prosperity, have been sadly disillusioned. I contend that, in the recession we have experienced, all industries have been affected, agriculture, tourism and so on. I do not exaggerate when I say <Col N="293" /> that the fishing industry has suffered most in recent years.</P>
    <P>The situation in agriculture is bad, but it is worse so far as fisheries are concerned. No industry has suffered more and none has received so little recognition as has been the case in respect of fisheries. There has been no positive help of any kind to alleviate the situation. Regretfully, this has been confirmed once again by the Minister in glossing over the situation in his statement today. Being the sensible and intelligent man he is, the Minister must know the damage that has been done to the fishing industry in recent years. He must know that the situation is grave, that the plight of our fishermen is lamentable as a result of escalating costs, especially the increases in oil prices, and also because of the drastic fall in the price of fish. Added to these difficulties is the problem of large imports of fish into EEC countries from third countries, a situation that neither the Minister nor the Community have been able to stem. Further, there is the problem created by the restrictions governing fishing, especially herring fishing. All of these factors have brought about a great lowering of the standard of living of our fishermen. If the Minister needs evidence of this situation, he need only advert to the records of BIM which show that increasing numbers of fishermen are finding it impossible to meet their commitments in respect of repayments for boats. Indeed, there is an admission in the Minister's speech that seizures of boats are taking place and will continue to take place as a result of the inability of our fishermen to meet their repayments.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat angry that in the light of these facts the Minister has not so much as raised a finger to assist this precious industry and the people involved in it. It is no longer a case of pleading in this House for the advancement of the fishing industry. We are fighting today for the survival of that industry. The 50-mile limit proposal, which many of us regarded as an essential safeguard for the development of the industry, was shamefully abandoned by Fianna Fáil and in particular by the Minister's predecessor. From that moment on the industry <Col N="294" /> drifted downwards, lacking both in confidence and in security. I make no apology for adverting again to the question of the 50-mile limit. That was a fundamental principle of the policy in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and we believed at the time that they were sincere. Many of their members who are now in important positions in Government &mdash; and I include in this the Taoiseach &mdash; are on record as having said that nothing less than a 50-mile exclusive limit would suffice. They promised to fight determinedly to secure such a limit, but their backsides were hardly warm in their seats in Government when they abandoned that fundamental principle and from then on we made no progress in Europe in regard to fisheries. Despite all the toing and froing in this regard, there has not been any semblance of a worth-while breakthrough of any kind. The Minister has retreated from the principle of a 50-mile exclusive limit to a limit of 12 miles, but he is no nearer a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy White has pointed out the assistance that has been provided by other countries for their fishing industries in these times of difficulty. Where the Community have proved unable or unwilling to provide positive aid, national governments have gone to the rescue of their fishing industries and have taken positive steps to help those concerned. They have provided worth-while subsidies in respect of fuel oil. The French fishermen have been subsidised for some time to the extent of about ten times what is being offered to our fishermen. They have been made the mean offer of 2p. This represents a calculated insult to our fishermen, who are beset by serious economic problems. In any event, this subsidy will be offset quickly by the substantial increases in the duty on oil products imposed in the budget and by the increases in oil prices that were announced shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>The British Government have no hesitation in assisting their industry and defending their position in Brussels with determination. It is evident to those who watch the scene there that Mrs. Margaret Thatcher has not won for herself the name of the Iron Lady without good reason. <Col N="295" /> We must admire her for the stand she takes in defence of vital national interests such as fisheries. I wish that our Minister showed the same determination. Does the Republic of Ireland, in the context of EEC affairs, count for very little? Are the major decisions, particularly in respect of fishing policy, made by the giants of Europe &mdash; Britain, France, Germany &mdash; and do we not count for anything in that assembly?</P>
    <P>More and more restrictions are being put on the Irish fishing industry by Brussels. There are impositions in respect of tariffs and quotas. Will the Minister tell us of any worth-while concession the fishing industry has obtained since we joined the EEC? I believe this stems from the attitude of Fianna Fáil in negotiating the Treaty of Rome. It is evident to us, as we look back over the records, that the then Fianna Fáil Government placed no importance whatsoever on our fishing industry. The disregard we have to contend with from the bureaucrats in Brussels stems from that. No safeguards were asked for in the negotiations and no assurances were demanded in respect of territorial rights and exclusive limits. Fianna Fáil treated this important industry, as they have always done, as a kind of Cinderella. They invited its exploitation by the major groupings in Europe by ignoring the industry at that time.</P>
    <P>The rich asset around our coasts are for exploitation by the British, the Germans, the Spaniards, when they come in, and the rest. We have received no compensatory provisions up to now. That is why I assert that our membership of the EEC, so far as our fishing industry is concerned, has been a hindrance rather than an asset. All the toing and froing of the Minister and his galaxy of civil servants from Dublin to Brussels has not achieved anything. Is there the semblance of a fishing policy? Is there a sign of agreement? There is certainly no sign of a united fishing policy despite years of negotiations. The major powers of Britain. Germany and France dominate the scene and our effective power in this area, as far as the Minister for Fisheries is concerned, is only baby power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's participation in Brussels seems to be defensive and negative. I hope the Minister can prove, when he is replying, that what I am saying is not true. Our waters seem to be there for the exploitation and use of our so-called partners in Europe. We have lost control over one of our most cherished assets. The fishing industry is in a deplorable state and the EEC are doing nothing to help the situation. In the circumstances, where the EEC has failed to come to agreement and where it is clear it has lost its effectiveness, the Minister and the Government have an obligation to intervene directly and do what is necessary to protect the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot take on the role of Pontius Pilate and say &ldquo;Sorry, there is nothing I can do, it is all the fault of Brussels&rdquo;. The Irish Government, despite what is agreed in Rome, have the right and the duty to maintain sovereign control over Irish territorial waters and a solemn obligation is imposed on them to safeguard, maintain and preserve our rich heritage. It is not good enough to say that they will not agree in Brussels. They are our waters, it is our industry and it is our duty to protect it. In this context the preservation of our fish stocks is of paramount importance. We have a duty to prevent the rape and the plunder of our fishing areas. The Minister will have to elaborate more fully on what he will do in this situation. If Brussels do not agree to act, the Minister must act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the agricultural industry, the farmers presume that the Irish Government are prepared to make up the difference if there is a short-fall in price increases emanating from Brussels. The Minister should think along those lines in <Col N="297" /> this instance. The Minister will have to buttress this industry before irreparable harm is done.</P>
    <P>I have referred to a situation where our fishermen are unable to meet their commitments in respect of hire purchase repayments on boats acquired through the aegis of BIM. Is it not a fact that a sizeable number of our fishing fleet are facing bankruptcy, that at least 35 skippers face legal action for repossession of boats acquired through BIM, that some 140 skippers are heavily in arrears amounting to over £1 million and that 76 per cent of all accounts are in arrears averaging about six months?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to BIM for their humane approach to this situation, for their understanding of the problem and their reluctance to harrass, sue or seize boats; but it is clear from the Minister's statement that seizures are taking place, that court proceedings are in train in many cases and that the pressure is on. These fishermen would not be in this sad predicament if they could pay their debts but they are simply not making enough money. They are being paid the prices they were paid in 1976 for their fish. Prices are falling, but inflation is soaring. This is their dilemma and the Minister must bridge the gap. I am pleading for leniency for these men, I am pleading for a moratorium on repayments for boats acquired through BIM until the situation improves.</P>
    <P>I would not thank the Minister for such a concession because he knows that these men would pay if it were humanly possible for them to do so. Far from recognising their plight and introducing some relief, it has been suggested that the subsidy on loans for the acquisition of boats through BIM of some 5½ to 6 per cent is about to be abolished and repayments for boats will rise to a frightening extent to perhaps 14 or 15 per cent. If that happens what is left of our fishing fleet will have to be sold. It will be the death blow, a crippling blow that will push average repayments up by as much as £20,000 a year. That is money that is not being earned. Many of these boats and their crews will go out of business, into extinction from which they can never hope to <Col N="298" /> return. Will the Minister make clear his intention of providing positive assistance to our skippers and crews in these circumstances?</P>
    <P>The 2 per cent tax relief from customs duty in respect of fuel oil was a calculated insult in these circumstances and it should be increased to a realistic figure. The suggestion of withdrawing the subsidy on fishing boats is mind boggling and I hope it is not true. If it is, it is the end of the Irish fishing fleet. When the Minister ignores the situation to the extent that he says there is no crisis. I trust he will accept from this side of the House that we differ on what the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; means. I think he will agree we have on our hands a most serious situation. Let us use any word we like, it would be remiss of all of us to close our eyes to a most grave situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt mainly with forestry and, while I am not complaining about that, it must be agreed that the question of fisheries is the more important. However, we are grateful for the information he has given us. On this side of the House we have always said there was tremendous scope for additional employment in forestry. It is a matter of shame in respect of successive Governments that the great potential in this area was not exploited to the full extent and that more jobs were not provided in this sector.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that such a vast amount of Irish timber has been exported in recent times at ridiculously low prices. It might have been more socially beneficial to use that timber to heat the homes of our aged and poor people rather than selling it abroad at these absurdly low prices. I contend that the timber should have been put to better use. How beneficial it would have been if it had been used as an adjunct to the free fuel scheme, thus providing heating for needy people. There is evidence of large imports of timber of doubtful quality. This is disconcerting at a time when Irish mills are closing and when hundreds if not thousands of Irishmen and women are thrown out of employment because of the shortage of timber.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister is coming <Col N="299" /> to the rescue of some industries, especially the industry at Scariff. My wish is that help would be given to more industries that are in trouble. I agree with Deputy White that it is a good thing to see a Minister in charge of forestry who is prepared to come to the rescue of these industries and give them assistance to survive. This is a welcome trend and I congratulate the Minister on this matter. It is admirable that he is prepared to provide public money to maintain jobs in this sector.</P>
    <P>We had been worried about a different trend in the Department in recent years, starting with the sale of the boatyards attached to BIM. This was a dangerous trend which we deplored at the time. I am glad to see that to some extent the attack on semi-State industries has been set aside and I welcome the positive involvement by the State in the maintenance of industries attached to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have always called for decent conditions and wages and for proper safeguards for forestry workers not merely in respect of everyday employment but with regard to sickness and retirement pensions. We are pleased that such great progress has been made in recent years in improving the lot of forestry workers. There was a time not so long ago when conditions in the industry were intolerable &mdash; the wages were poor and the suffering and privation of the workers was acute.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary for public representatives or the unions representing the men to have to appeal to the Minister or the Department for items that should be supplied without intervention being necessary. I have in mind the provision of shelters and protective clothing. This should automatically be provided by the forester in charge and the unions or public representatives should not have to intervene in such matters.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the intervention of the Minister with regard to the sawmills at Scariff I am concerned that he did not refer to the two State sawmills under his jurisdiction. One of these sawmills is in my constituency in Dundrum. County <Col N="300" /> Tipperary. This mill gives very valuable employment. It is the mainstay of this area which is bereft of any worthwhile industry. Naturally I want to see that industry not merely safeguarded but expanded and developed along modern lines. I do not want to see any strictures being placed on that expansion and I would be fearful and concerned lest anything might happen to it in the future. I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that he will personally nurture and develop these sawmills under his care and afford them every opportunity of expansion.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to show that the Government are not in love with State enterprises as such. The sale of the boatyards of BIM is proof of that, as is the proposed break-up of CIE and of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. We are concerned to ensure that there should not be any interference with matters which are the responsibility of the State, and that is why I am seeking a positive assurance with regard to the future of the State timber mills, especially the factory at Dundrum in my constituency. I raised this matter recently by way of Dáil Question and was given the impression in respect of the Dundrum factory that some kind of investigation or inquiry was afoot concerning its future. I should be grateful to be informed as to what precisely is happening there. What is the nature of the inquiry and by whom is it being conducted? What are their terms of reference? When will the outcome be known and will the findings be made public? I am concerned about the stability of these State sawmills, small as they are. The workers of Tipperary whom I have the honour to represent in this House wish to know where they stand in this important matter.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3 refers to sawmills. However, the Minister did not refer in his speech to that subhead and I should be greateful for elaboration.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to avail of this opportunity of joining with the Minister in extending most sincere congratulations to Dr. Tony Meaney on his appointment as chief executive officer. Dr. Meaney has had a brilliant career in <Col N="301" /> the Department and he brings to his new post much experience and widespread knowledge of all matters appertaining to fisheries. The board are most fortunate in securing the services of this dedicated and brilliant young man and I wish him much personal happiness in his exalted position. I express the hope that he will derive great satisfaction from his work and that great achievements will accrue from all his future undertakings in this important office. My extension of congratulations to Dr. Meaney is all the more sincere because I know him personally and because he happens to be a native of my own town of Clonmel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the establishment of a very important industrial enterprise at Clonmel. The Medford Corporation of Oregon, USA, are setting up a company there to undertake the manufacture of medium density fibreboard. This is very welcome news to my constituents <Col N="302" /> and my own people of Clonmel. It was a matter of much regret to me, that, due to illness, I was unable to be present at the recent official launching of this enterprise, I should like to avail of this opportunity to express my personal delight at their coming, to wish them boundless success and assure them of the utmost assistance we can render them in South Tipperary in order to make the enterprise successful in every way. The Medford Corporation will prove to be a very important adjunct of the Forestries Section of the Minister's Department. It is a major wood processing company engaged in the manufacture of plywood veneer, general timber and fibreboard and, in the sphere of medium-density fibreboard production, theirs is a quality product used principally in furniture manufacture. They are amongst the world's leading producers. It is a very large, much valued enterprise. It is expected to provide employment for some 200 workers in the factory with a further 250 engaged in timber harvesting, that is, a complement of 450 workers. In an area of high unemployment, redundancies and short-time workings, from which my town and constituency are not excluded, this is welcome news indeed. I extend to all concerned my heartfelt good wishes for the success of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay this debate unduly. I feel I have made the salient points I wanted to make on this occasion. If I have seemed to be ever-critical of the lack of worthwhile news in the Minister's brief it is only because I am really concerned about some of Ireland's most cherished assets, our fishing and forestry industries. I would ask the Minister to dwell on the views expressed by Members of this House very carefully and, whenever the time comes for replying, to come back to us with much better news, with more hope for the fishing industry, more positive information concerning the kind of redress required to undo the wrongs imposed on all concerned in the industry today, from outside influences, such as lack of activity on the part of the EEC in respect of such matters as imports of fish <Col N="303" /> or whatever from Third countries. As I have said, where the EEC failed to act, our Minister and Government must act. I urge them to do so now before it is too late and irreparable damage has been done to our fishing industry.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that my time will be fairly limited. The House will be glad to know that I do not intend to refer to the Forestry Section.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome this opportunity of referring specifically to the fishing industry since this question is of prime and immediate concern to my constituency. I listened with keen interest to the Minister's deliberations and indeed those of Deputy White and his colleague. Where as it is their duty to be critical it is their duty also to be constructive in such criticism. Deputy White commenced by complimenting the Minister on his eloquence but then proceeded to adopt a negative attitude towards the remainder of his speech. There were statements such as &ldquo;not a bob&rdquo;, &ldquo;did not care a damn&rdquo;, &ldquo;nothing new&rdquo; and &ldquo;no directive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While I do not completely dissociate myself from the fact that the fishing industry is in difficulty, I should like to highlight some benefits in this respect that have accrued to County Donegal in the past year. Here I should refer in particular to expenditure such as Bord Iascaigh Mhara grants for fishing boats which amounted to £4,684 million, Bord Iascaigh Mhara loans for fishing boats which amounted to £8.420 million, EEC grants for fishing boats which amounted to £923,000, and Killybegs Harbour syncro lift £369,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The syncro lift material has been ordered. I can give the Deputy all the relevant information. The design work for the civil engineering structure is being completed and contract documents <Col N="304" /> should be available in the near future. It is anticipated that the public works should be in operation by 1982 &mdash; that is the most up-to-date information. That is not to say that we are without difficulty and, with this in mind, I wish to make the best use of the time available to me. We have the construction of the auction hall in Killybegs, the syncro lift to which I have referred, the general dredging of the harbour, which allocation is being increased since it has been found necessary to cater for larger-sized vessels. Indeed I am disappointed that the Department of Fisheries have dissociated themselves from making an allocation towards the shore road, which is now the responsibility of Donegal County Council, and of prime concern to the development of Killybegs. There is a commitment from the Government towards the reclamation of the seaward side of the shore road and reclamation of the area between the new roadway and the present shoreline. During the course of the past few months the Government also gave a commitment of expenditure in excess of £1.3 million for the development, dredging and extension of the Burtonport facilities. As Deputy White so ably said, there is a commitment also to the development of Mulroy Bay, a very worth-while and significant project.</P>
      <P>While I feel we should accept criticism I feel it is our duty here also to be as constructive as possible. Indeed there were a number of items in respect of which I found myself in total agreement with my two colleagues on the far side of the House in relation to the fishing industry. It is on this aspect I wish to speak and I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible. There was a time when words of learned length and thundering sound amazed the gazing rustics but that applies no longer. That will not put money into the pockets of the fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Deputy White's remarks about a meeting which we attended in Killybegs. It was a very informative meeting, the end product of which was the presentation <Col N="305" /> of a document to us by the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation. These people have put a large amount of effort and energy into the preparation of this document. It is the only possible constructive, real, method of assisting fishermen in their hour of need. We could underline the question of need because, at the moment, the plight of fishermen, particularly those in Killybegs, is very serious.</P>
      <P>There are two obvious danger factors in the situation &mdash; the present price of diesel and the present low price of fish at auction level. Many people know exactly the price they pay in shops for fish fingers, fillets and so on and are of the opinion that those prices filter through in a reasonable manner and reward the man going fishing in the bay, to whom I am directing my attention today. In actual fact, there is no correlation whatsoever between the prices asked in shops and those received by fishermen. In our discussion with the fishermen, it was very difficult to arrive at an acceptable solution in relation to the price of diesel. An obvious suggestion would be a subsidy, but this line of thought would be dangerous. Every other industry which uses diesel would then have an equal right to direct aid from the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government must act upon the prices received by fishermen at the moment. People may not be aware that for a skipper to take out his boat for a night's fishing &mdash; and this is the average boat &mdash; would cost about £200 before he catches a fish at all. On the bigger vessels now operating out of Killybegs &mdash; and I have family connections fishing on some of these &mdash; one of the crew recently told me that when in full operation they spend in the region of £50 worth of diesel per hour. This is a colossal commitment and is the main reason why the Killybegs fishermen now find themselves in difficulties. I make reference, not to the larger vessels in this instance, but to the smaller boats. They have two choices &mdash; they can spend their nights fishing and, it is hoped, catch something, or they can tie up at the pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, they are encountering a difficulty which they have never encountered to the same degree in 30 years, and some have been fishing for that length of <Col N="306" /> time. They are in an industry which cannot be compared with any other sector of our workforce. They are totally committed, totally dedicated to their work and are working in excess of 100 hours per week. This factor has never been highlighted. We talk of 40 and 44-hour weeks, but these men fish in excess of 100 hours. Most have long experience and their association with the same type of employment for such a long period would render it difficult to deploy them in other industries if our fishing industries collapse. I genuinely feel that disaster for many of our fishing fleets is just around the corner. I may be parochial in referring to Killybegs alone, but my remarks apply equally to fishermen around our coasts. For that reason. I beg forgiveness for labouring the point on Killybegs.</P>
    <P>When I spoke last in this House, I said that the development of the fishing industry is very important for County Donegal. The Government must, indeed, be complimented on their efforts in this direction. I have not come here today to defend the Minister &mdash; he is big enough, strong enough and capable enough of defending himself. From where I sit, he could certainly not be described as &ldquo;Baby Power&rdquo;, but I will leave the Minister to deal with that criticism.</P>
    <P>I compliment him on his commitment to the job. In his term of office, he has dedicated himself fully and wholly to the welfare of a very small section of the voting population. Let us be clear on one thing, the entire fishing industry embraces about 6,000 people and could not be regarded as a great vote-catching sector. That has never been the consideration of the Minister. The development of the fishing industry at Killybegs is directly attributable to him.</P>
    <P>Skippers are encountering extraordinary difficulties in maintaining crews. It is a known fact in Killybegs that many of these fishermen have not made one penny. I agree with Deputy White that some boats have been tied up since November. If this situation is allowed to continue, the fleet will certainly collapse and the livelihood of the entire population of Killybegs will be in danger. The hub of the fishing industry is the man who <Col N="307" /> goes out fishing in the bay. I am being objective when I say that development has not been oriented around this important hub, but around ancillary industries. It is time to change.</P>
    <P>Someone complimented a certain gentleman on his appointment. I wish to be associated with those remarks and hope that he can bring a change into the thinking within BIM. BIM have quantified and qualified the needs of the fishermen in the smaller fleets by assessing the larger fleets. Those larger boats are doing fairly well, but that is not the case with the smaller boats. This new appointee will, it is hoped, apply his dedication and determination to assisting those in need.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable that the fishermen will watch, with keen interest, the lavish subsidies paid to farmers &mdash; sheep and cattle subsidies &mdash; when it has been established that there has been a downward trend in the price of fish. Our present diesel rate is around £1.02 per gallon but some of our EEC colleagues pay from 50p to 63p. There are anomalies there. Let there be no misunderstanding in relation to the difficulties arising out of subsidising diesel. It would be unwise to ask for a direct subsidy on diesel. If the Department can see any way of increasing the 2p already granted, this would be welcome news. It is absolutely important that immediate action be taken.</P>
    <P>From our discussions with the fishermen it is not a question of things getting better next year. They are in difficulty at the moment. Many are in very serious straits financially and their recovery will be long-term. I should like to try to bring into perspective the downward trend that has taken place. I want to highlight the situation. I have been given by the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation a rough estimate comparing prices in 1977 with those obtaining today. In 1977 whiting commanded £11.50 approximately per box. The average price today is £8.40. In 1977 haddock commanded £15 per box. Today it is £15. In 1977 mackerel commanded £3.50 per box. Today it is £3.31. Herring in 1977 averaged £14 a box. Today it average £12.20. In 1977 <Col N="308" /> cod was approximately £20 per box. Today it is £17.69. Round haddock in 1977 was £15 a box. Today it averages £8.40. One does not have to be very intelligent to appreciate these drops in prices.</P>
    <P>The prices for fish are in no way compatible with the price increases that have taken place in other foodstuffs. Fish prices have not kept in line with the prices of other foodstuffs. In the agriculture sector subsidies were actually introduced to help the farmers in difficult periods. It is now time some form of subsidy was introduced to assist the fishermen. We have reached the stage where a subsidy must be introduced. It is unbelievable that in this day and age a box of whiting can be bought in Killybegs for £5.70 and subsequently appear in the shops at 80 pence upwards per 1b. I made out a rough table to illustrate the position. A box of whiting at £5.70 will produce approximately 42 1bs. filleted. The current price in the shops is 80 pence per 1b. The fishermen received £5.70 and the same fish is sold in the shops for £33.60. A box of cod bought in Killybegs at £17 is sold filleted in the shops at £1.30 which gives a figure of £54.60 as against £17. Surely where the exercise has to take place is in the field of prices. I do not envisage the Minister subsidising the cost of diesel but I see room for improvement in both the marketing and the price of fish, particularly from the point of view of the man going out into the bay to catch the fish.</P>
    <P>The real disgrace is surely the amount of fish going for withdrawal. I can quote approximate figures in Killybegs last year; 953 tons of whiting, 2,039 tons of mackerel, 118 tons of round haddock, 3 tons of plaice, 3 tons of cod, six tons of silf plus six tons of hake, making a total of approximately 3,130 tons of fish converted into fishmeal. There was a total withdrawal of 10,200 tons. Surely we have reached the stage where we must seriously consider the conservation of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>This brings me once more to the question of a support price for fish. I have here a table complied by experts, men associated with the industry for quite a number of years, men representing the <Col N="309" /> fishermen and their needs. I intend to discuss the matter with the Minister at the first opportunity. The structure is there whereby this particular system could be operated. All that is needed is goodwill and I know we have that from the other side of the House. We may have differences of opinion in relation to other aspects but we are all agreed that the fishermen must be catered for. It is a question of immediate action. If the Department in conjunction with the fishermen's organisation could have a worthwhile discussion I can see that the people who would not benefit so much would be the people engaged in processing. Deputy White mentioned that an increase, or a levy, or a subsidy in respect of fish would cost around £5 million. It does not necessarily follow that that would bring about an increase in price to the consumer because there is a big enough gap there already, three to four per cent, and there is room for everybody in the industry if the right attitude is adopted and if people are not selfish. I would urge the Minister to take immediate action to ensure success for the fishermen and to help them out in this very difficult period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Coughlan that the prices paid to the fishermen compared with the price paid by the consumers is something calling for immediate remedy. I wonder who is responsible for the situation? I would remind the House there was a different Government in office in 1977 and surely that Government is entitled to some credit for keeping costs as low as they were and keeping prices as satisfactory as they were compared to the hideously dilapidated state of the industry today. I heard Deputy Treacy talk about fishermen going out of business. I am interested in one particular fishery where I would hope for the goodwill of the Ministers &mdash; indeed, not just his goodwill but, as one of his own councillors said in Galway recently, if the Minister cannot do it we will get the Taoiseach to do it.</P>

However, that application was recorded in the County Leitrim index because the applicant had given an address in County Leitrim, the other application having been recorded in the County Cavan index, because the applicant had given an address in County Cavan and the two files were not associated. The applicant probably became confused between the two applications and may have assumed that the application of last August related to the January 1980 application. Apart from the standard letter of acknowledgment, action has not been taken on the current application because payment of the grant had not been claimed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is already aware, approval in principle has been <Col N="319" /> given to proposals submitted by Dublin County Council for the construction of that part of the Western Parkway/Southern Cross route between Red Cow on the Naas Road and Harold's Grange, and to the council proceeding with detailed planning for the route. Road grants totalling £2.445 millions, have been allocated to the council to date for the sections of the route between Naas Road and Firhouse Road.</P>
      <P>The allocation of further grants to the council for the remainder of the route, from Firhouse Road to Harold's Grange, will be considered on receipt of an acceptable detailed design for the road, including plans, longitudinal and cross sections, bill of quantities and an estimate of cost together with details of land requirements and an indication that the council are in a position to proceed with the purchase of the necessary lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the main commitments given by Senator Eoin Ryan on behalf of Fianna Fáil prior to the 1977 election and since was to activate the Southern Cross route in a way that would avoid routing heavy traffic into residential areas? Is he aware that the phasing of the road that he has now described will have precisely the opposite effect, because it will deliver a huge volume of traffic via the square from Newlands Cross down to Firhouse without any provision for accommodating that traffic eastwards from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the development of further sections of route, including the timing and the execution of the work, is primarily a matter for Dublin County Council. It is understood from the county council that, by order dated 18 October 1979, the City and County Manager appointed a consultant for the drawing up of the CPO for land acquisition, the preparation of a detailed map and the signing of contract documents in respect of the by-pass. The question of allocating grants for other sections of the route from Firhouse Road to Aherne's Cross will be considered in the light of the progress made by the council. It is a <Col N="320" /> matter for the county council and the consultants should be allowed to get on with the job. If Deputy Horgan can use his influence there it would be very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if the fundamental aspect of his Government's commitment is to be observed and maintained, that priority should have been given to the section of the road from Tallaght to Harold's Grange which links on with Sandyford? Would the Minister not agree that if that section of the road is not built first, all the traffic which is arriving off the Naas Road and coming down from Newlands Cross to Firhouse will end up clogging the residential roads around Ballyroan, Butterfield, Holylands, Nutgrove, Taylor's Lane and Kilmacud and that there will be a dangerous backlog of traffic from there on in until the final section of the road is built? Finally is the Minister not aware that there is considerable apprehension that the sections of the Southern Cross route from Harold's Grange will never be built because pressure will be put on to join up existing sections of residential roads to take that traffic when it arrives at this spot?</P>

      <P>The Employment Maintenance Scheme, to which the Deputy refers, was terminated with effect from 31 March 1980 at the insistence of the European Commission on the ground that it contravened Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome. The scheme provided for payments of £5 per week per head of the work force of participating firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the termination of the Employment Maintenance Scheme employer and industry organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions agreed under the provisions of the first national understanding to provide a new <Col N="334" /> temporary scheme in its place. That scheme &mdash; the Employers Temporary Subvention &mdash; operated from April to the end of December 1980. Under the terms of the scheme, a payment of £5 per head per week was made for 26 weeks and a payment of £4 per head per week for the final 13 weeks. It also was terminated on the insistence of the European Commission, again on the ground that it contravened Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>In view of these EEC objections it must be recognised that the difficulties involved are very great. The Government are, however, continuing to examine the problem to see if firms with a prospect of long-term viability can be helped through temporary difficulties, and in this connection informal discussions have taken place recently between officials of the main economic Departments and representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Federated Union of Employers. This examination has not yet been concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is prepared to subsidise the cost of the installation of electricity for private householders in view of the great financial burden being imposed on people <Col N="337" /> building new houses, particularly in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) (for the Minister for Energy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government consider that they have gone as far as can reasonably be expected at the present time in subsidising provision of electricity supply.</P>
      <P>In regard to rural electrification, the ESB have informed me that about 99 per cent of all rural householders are now connected to electricity supply. Since 1946 almost £100 million has been spent on rural electrification schemes. Moreover, quotations by the ESB for connection to electricity supply in rural areas, including supply to newly-constructed dwellings, provide for payment by the ESB of the first £160 of the connection cost together with half of the amount by which that cost exceeds £850. A scheme of deferred payments also operates whereby connection costs may be spread over a five-year period. The amounts quoted for connection of homes to the electricity supply are directly related to the costs involved in making supply available. The costs can vary greatly from location to location and depend to a great extent on the distance of the house from the nearest supply point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the electrification scheme, which is part of a package of measures being considered in the EEC context which is designed to stimulate agriculture in the less-favoured areas of the west of Ireland. This scheme will be implemented over a ten year period. Beneficiaries will be required to contribute 20 per cent of the cost. The EEC Commission is currently considering an outline programme for the various measures in the package. This programme must be approved before detailed measures, including those for electrification, can be considered and implemented. The priorities criteria and selection procedures relating to the electrification scheme have not yet been decided. Therefore, it is not yet possible to say who will ultimately benefit under the electrification scheme. The scheme will be widely advertised in due course and it <Col N="338" /> will then be a matter for those interested to make application for assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the earliest date by which, on the basis of the information currently available to him, it would be possible to have oil off our shores available for commercial purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The date by which oil off our shores will become available for commercial purposes will depend, in the first instance, on how soon an accumulation of oil large enough to support commercial production is identified.</P>
      <P>At present the best prospect of a commercial discovery would appear to be in the Porcupine Basin off our west coast where significant flows of oil have been tested over the past three drilling seasons. However, further drilling will be necessary to determine whether an accumulation large enough to support commercial production is present in the basin. There is no way in which one can predict exactly how much further drilling will be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a commercial discovery is verified or located, the date by which oil will actually be brought ashore will depend upon the location of the discovery and other factors, including the water depth in which it lies. In the Porcupine, for instance, the great depth of water and the harsh environmental conditions would almost certainly require special production techniques designed and tested to withstand such conditions. In this situation it would be prudent to allow, say, four years for the field to come on-stream. In complex <Col N="340" /> circumstances the period could be longer. A discovery in less hostile conditions &mdash; the Celtic Sea or Fastnet Basin, for example &mdash; could possibly be brought onstream in a shorter period. Allowing for the necessary appraisal drilling, however, it is unlikely that, even on the most optimistic assumptions, a discovery in these areas in 1981 could be declared commercial before 1983.</P>
    <P>Thus, while one can never be absolutely certain in these matters, I think it is reasonable to say that, even given favourable circumstances, it is unlikely that any oil could be brought ashore before the mid-eighties at the earliest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his reply was on the pessimistic side and that one of the major factors influencing the pay back time of offshore development is the price of oil, and that if the price of oil continues to rise at its present rate, developments which were not commercial will become commercial and ones which were marginally commercial will become very much more so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the plans he has for the development of the necessary infrastructural facilities in western Ireland in the event of a viable oil source coming into operation off the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional infrastructuaral facilities that would be necessary in the event of a commercial discovery of oil off the west coast would be determined by a number of factors, notably the size of the discovery and the method by which it is developed. For example, the infrastructural requirements in the case of a very small find would be very different from what would be necessary to accommodate a large find with major associated downstream developments. The location where additional infrastructural facilities would be required would depend on where the oil <Col N="341" /> is landed which, in turn, could be largely determined by the precise location of the discovery.</P>
      <P>As we do not at the moment have answers to any of these questions concerning the location, size, method of development of a discovery or downstream possibilities, it is impossible to make specific provision for the installation of the appropriate facilities. Indeed, as the installation of infrastructure is very costly, it would be imprudent to provide for such facilities until we are certain that a commercial discovery will, in fact, be made.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that an oil discovery off the west coast is likely to be in very deep water and quite severe environmental conditions, a significant period of time will elapse between the announcement of a commercial discovery and the commencement of production of oil. This will give us reasonable time to develop the necessary additional infrastructural facilities at the optimum locations.</P>
      <P>However, in order to be in a position to respond quickly if a commercial discovery is announced in any of our offshore areas, my Department, in conjunction with the other relevant Departments, commenced some time ago a preliminary examination of the infrastructuaral facilities that are likely to be required in the event of such a discovery and how each Department can best contribute to the provision of these facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on the European Council which I attended, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Maastricht on 23 and 24 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> The Council agreed to take for its agenda&mdash;(1) The economic and social situation and medium-term perspectives; (2) Relations with industrialised countries; (3) The North-South dialogue; (4) The seat of the institutions; and (5) Political co-operation items including, in particular, Afghanistan, Middle East, the Lebanon and Poland.</P>
    <P>At the end of the meeting the Dutch Presidency issued a summary of the conclusions, in accordance with the normal practice. I have arranged to have copies of this summary placed in the Library, for the information of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Council convened in the face of a sombre outlook for the Community economy. The paper submitted by the Commission brought out that the current recession is much deeper, wider and more persistent than had been anticipated. For the Community as a whole the most recent Commission forecasts suggest that the upturn in activity may be delayed until the third quarter of this year, much later than previously expected. The year-on-year change in GDP for the Community for 1981 has been revised down from an increase of 0.6 per cent to a decline of the same dimension. While some slowdown in consumer prices is foreseen, the current balance of payments outturn could be slightly worse than the high deficit recorded in 1980. One feature that was highlighted in the Commission document was the need for a concerted reaction to the very high and volatile interest rates prevailing in the United States and to the appreciation of the exchange rates of the dollar and yen.</P>
    <P>The major Irish concerns at the Council related to employment and agriculture.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the number of unemployed in the Community now exceeds 8,500,000 and is still rising. This is not a phenomenon confined to any one country or even to the Community. The current recession affects every country in the industrialised world.</P>
    <P>My approach to the Council was that, with unemployment at its current level and with the further deterioration projected for the Community as a whole, it <Col N="382" /> was inconceivable that Europe's leaders should adopt a passive and even fatalistic attitude. It was unacceptable that an Economic Community should make no attempt to conduct a policy of economic management. I stressed that, if constant references to Community solidarity had any real meaning, it should manifest itself in relation to current economic difficulties. Recessionary tendencies in one country spill over into the others with a cumulative effect and only a combination of effort can counteract this process.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that national governments have by treaty conferred on the Community institutions certain powers which, in consequence, they themselves cannot exercise.</P>
    <P>This division could have the effect, unless action is taken, of restricting the power of governments and the Community to react to economic circumstances. It is imperative to ensure that this does not happen and that measures taken at national level to counteract unemployment or other economic evils are matched by compatible and parallel action at Community level. Just as recession in one country affects others, so the consequences of recovery and growth in one economy help others. The essential aim of economic policy now is to get back on to the path of real growth and to increase employment.</P>
    <P>I wish to direct the attention of the House to the important declaration in the Presidency conclusions that the Council in Maastricht was agreed that the fight against the evil of unemployment should be conducted not only by the member states but also at Community level and that the Community must be involved in limiting the effects of recession and bringing about the return of sustained economic growth and satisfactory levels of employment. There is also the important decision to the effect that a contribution to recovery can be made by ensuring that the existing funds and financial mechanisms contribute as much as possible to the reduction of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The problems facing the European economies in achieving growth are clearly identifiable.</P>
    <P>The first is the high and fluctuating <Col N="383" /> level of interest rates, which makes decisions on productive investment difficult. This is not a problem for any one country but requires international attention at the highest level.</P>
    <P>The second obstacle is the level of energy prices. The cost of imported fuel is now a major factor in the western recession. For us the cost of oil has risen from just over £70 million in the early seventies to a figure estimated this year to be of the order of £1 billion. This represents a real and irrecoverable transfer of resources. There is no way we can escape its consequences at present, but we can mollify them through vigorous and concerted policies for energy conservation and substitution. The Council in Maastricht recorded their view that a reduction in dependence on imported oil and the use of alternative fuels are vital to employment and the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The third structural obstacle to the improvement of employment lies in the area of incomes. We had before us advice from the Commission that the expected reduction of employment in 1981 could be corrected progressively with the recovery in the second half of the year. They say that the speed of this recovery will depend on the response of the social partners to the need for higher investment and structural change, and that defensive measures and subsidies would impede the progress of re-allocation as much as aggressive wage policies. With little productivity growth and further losses in 1981 on the terms of trade, they see almost no scope for significant real income gains in the Community.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussions with other Heads of Government I have urged that, apart from the general need to concert Community policies and instruments, there are a number of specific proposals which would need to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>The first is to encourage increased investment to improve the structural capacity of our economies, both to give direct employment and to create the capacity for future growth. In our conditions, with 50 per cent of the Community average GDP <i>per capita,</i> the need <Col N="384" /> for this strategy is particularly pressing. Our economy needs large investment, new productive capacity and essential infrastructure if it is to improve in the medium and long term its relative efficiency and the standard of living of our people within the Community. Deputies will note that the Presidency conclusions accept the need for structural reinforcement of the European economy through cost restraint and a rise in productive investment and productivity. This is an endorsement of the Government's policy, reflected in the Investment Plan for 1981, of improving our productive capacity and economic infrastructure so as to avail more fully of growth possibilities as international economic activity increases.</P>
    <P>We have been making the case that there is a need to expand the activity of the Social Fund to meet the special needs of young people in the present restricted labour market. Increased education and training, particularly in technological skills, will reduce pressure on the labour market and provide young people with greater employment opportunities as economic activity expands. Deputies will note that the conclusions indicate that, in ensuring that the existing funds and financial mechanisms contribute to the reduction of unemployment, particular attention should be given to the possibilities of providing advanced technological training and education for youth.</P>
    <P>We have also stressed the need to protect and preserve, in the present abnormal but temporary recession, jobs in industries whose viability in more normal market conditions is proven. The industrial and competition policies of the Community have an obvious and powerful role to play here.</P>
    <P>I suggested also that it was for the Community to promote, in consultation with the social partners, the technological and innovative development of industry. The conclusions of the Council endorsed this approach and called for co-ordinated efforts to foster the development of high technology and innovative enterprises.</P>
    <P>The conclusions refer to the proposed joint Council of Ministers of Economic Affairs, Finance and Social Affairs to <Col N="385" /> consider general economic and social problems and, in particular, unemployment. The Council stressed its conviction that a thorough preparation of such a Council is of the highest importance.</P>
    <P>An important overall conclusion was that in the present economic situation intensive consultation with the social partners is of vital importance. As I have stated here many times, continuing and intensive consultation with the social partners in dealing with the economic situation is a fundamental policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>The discussion on a Common Fisheries Policy was disappointing in that no conclusions were reached. The outstanding problems seem to be disproportionate to the need to develop this policy, in the interests of fishermen generally and the cohesion of the Community. It was agreed in the end that there should be a further attempt to settle the outstanding matters and that a meeting of Fishery Ministers should be held tomorrow, Friday.</P>
    <P>Our concern with agriculture and the effect of recession on farm incomes throughout the Community, and, in particular, in our own country, are well known. What is happening in agriculture is aggravating the Community's greatest failure to date &mdash; its continuing inability to reduce the serious regional imbalances within its borders. This failure has created doubt in some minds as to the political will of Europe to progress towards its fundamental aim of closer union.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the serious fall in farm incomes in many of the member states the Council, in an important and positive conclusion, requested Ministers of Agriculture to continue and intensify their discussions on the proposals on agricultural prices and economies for 1981-82 with the will to reach agreement by 1 April. It is urgently necessary that they should comply with this directive.</P>
    <P>Now that the Customs Union is complete and with good progress on the common commercial policy the basic defect manifesting itself is the limited resources of the budget. It is surely unrealistic to expect the budget, amounting as it does to less than 1 per cent of the GNP of the <Col N="386" /> member states, to make any significant impression on our problems. Even less can it be expected that the budget, within its present limits, can meet the inevitable further demands on its resources which will follow enlargement.</P>
    <P>We would view with the utmost concern any attempt to dismantle the achievements of the Community by undermining the Common Agricultural Policy. The CAP is enshrined in the Treaty itself, and currently protects the livelihood of eight million farmers and farm workers who are an important force for social, economic and, hence, political stability throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we accept that there are certain products under the CAP which have run into a situation involving both cost and market difficulties. Solutions to these difficulties must be sought product by product and not by way of attempting to impose a single rigid formula which will inevitably not be appropriate for the very different problems that present themselves. In principle, we believe that a solution to the present problems of the CAP must meet a number of conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) it must be in conformity with Article 39 of the Treaty and with the established principles of market unity, financial solidarity and community preference;</P>
    <P>(2) it must not be disproportionate, in scope or in duration, to the real problems of the individual product sectors; there should be no permanent, institutionalised co-responsibility system;</P>
    <P>(3) it must not add to the problems of farmers who are already in difficulties; in operating the policy the Community must have due regard to the need to protect farm incomes and in particular to take account of the effect of rising costs of production on farmers;</P>
    <P>(4) it must not carry risks of deterioration in the general economic situation of member states particularly as regards employment;</P>
    <P>(5) it must not act against the overall objective of regional convergence in <Col N="387" /> the Community, and in particular it must not prevent member states whose productivity in particular sectors is substantially below Community level from reaching that level; and</P>
    <P>(6) it must, as regards exports, respect the Community's role as a major agricultural exporter, and, as regards imports, ensure that a fair share of the necessary burden is borne by third countries whose supplies to the Community also contribute to the difficulties.</P>
    <P>We also support the reduction and ultimate elimination of MCAs which act against a fundamental principle of the Community in the distortions they cause in the system of free trade within its borders.</P>
    <P>I mention these principles now because they are relevant to the examination being conducted by the Commission under the mandate of 30 May last of the problems arising from the settlement of the British budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Council also decided that the location of the Community institutions should remain as they are.</P>
    <P>Discussions in the political co-operation framework focussed mainly on East-West relations, in particular, the situation in Poland. We talked about Middle East questions, including difficulties facing UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon. In addition, the European Council provided a useful opportunity to review relations between the Community and the new US administration.</P>
    <P>On Poland, we reaffirmed the position stated at the last meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg on 2 December 1980. We stressed that the Polish people should be free to face their internal problems in a peaceful manner and without outside interference. Any other attitude would have very serious consequences not only for Poland but for the world. We also indicated our readiness to continue to give economic support to Poland.</P>
    <P>The Council underlined that the problem of Afghanistan remains a threat to the stability of relations in the region and worldwide. We once again stated the <Col N="388" /> requirements for a political solution and welcomed the UN Resolution of 20 November 1980 and the proposal put forward by France as initiatives worthy of support.</P>
    <P>The Council heard an interim report by the Netherlands Foreign Minister on the satisfactory results of his Middle East mission which is aimed at a comprehensive, just and durable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He will continue his contacts with the various parties concerned and we will consider the matter again at the next meeting of the Council at the end of June.</P>
    <P>As regards the Lebanon, the Council gave strong support to the efforts of the UN Security Council to ensure that obstacles will not be placed in the way of UNIFIL in the full discharge of its mandate in Southern Lebanon. As Deputies will be aware, three soldiers of the Nigerian UNIFIL contingent were killed in a recent incident and it is important that effective action be taken to avoid a repetition of such attacks.</P>
    <P>As regards the North/South dialogue, the European Council stressed and reconfirmed the advantage of opening concrete negotiations between the industrialised and the developing countries with regard to serious international economic problems. With an eye to the international conferences foreseen, we instructed the General Affairs Council to examine the Commission proposals and to report to us at our next meeting in June. That meeting will, of course, precede the meeting of the World or Western Economies Summit in Ottawa and accordingly will provide a timely opportunity for finalising the guidelines for the Community's participation in the Summit meeting.</P>
    <P>The Ottawa gathering will in turn facilitate an exchange of views with the United States, Japan and Canada. As regards the reference in the Maastricht conclusions to forthcoming international conferences, there are a number of these but attention is principally focussed on the Summit Conference on the North/South dialogue which is to be held in Mexico next October. This will be an event of the highest importance in the <Col N="389" /> context of this dialogue which the Government believe must be pursued on a consistent and equitable basis.</P>
    <P>On political relations between the Community and the United States, there is satisfaction with the expressed intention of the new US administration to pursue a consistent policy and to consult closely with its friends in Europe.</P>
    <P>In essence, I believe that in spite of all the difficulties and in particular the disappointment over fish, the Maastricht Council was a useful meeting. There were a number of important conclusions. The meeting was well ordered and, apart from the discussion on fish, dealt in a businesslike and positive way with all items before it. Our thanks are due to the Presidency for this. The decisions on the economic and social situation, particularly in the recognition of unemployment as a Community problem, are valuable in the specific nature of the recommendations they make for dealing with the fundamental economic issues and the recession facing the industrialised world today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell on the sense of humiliation felt by evey Irish man and woman at the spectacle of our Taoiseach allowing himself, through his own and his Minister for Foreign Affairs' deliberate ambivalance and double talk, designed to fool people for electoral purposes, to be placed in the position of being publicly ticked off by the British Prime Minister at an international gathering and emerging with his tail between his legs. Not only would that not happen when we were in Government, it could not be conceived that it would have happened; because our diplomacy was concentrated on securing results and not on public relations and also because, whatever battles we had to fight with the British Government &mdash; and there were many on a multitude of issues &mdash; we were particularly careful not to allow ourselves to be wrong-footed by them. Having said that, I pass to the substantive economic issues of this European Council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as our interests in the Community are concerned they must be preserved by us playing a constructive role <Col N="390" /> in the resolution of problems, even problems that do not directly concern our vital interests, for example the Lomé Convention on the democratisation of Portugal and the Euro-Arab dialogue and by espousing the cause of European integration. We gave these policies high priority during our period in office and this brought us the goodwill of other member countries who contrasted our constructive approach with that of the UK. We should also use the goodwill thus secured to ensure that our problems will be treated sympathetically. It was thus that Deputy Mark Clinton secured for Irish farmers many benefits that we would otherwise not have obtained. It was thus also that we secured from our partners recognition of the special position of Ireland in relation to the fishery problem and the need for the enormous expansion of the Irish catch at a time when the fish catches of all other countries were to be cut. It was thus also that we secured a two-thirds increase in our share of the regional fund by comparsion with what was originally proposed.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came to power, I have seen little evidence of any similar strategic approach to the question of our relations with the other member states. Our attitude seems to be a mixture of the passive and the poor mouth, precisely the combination which intelligent diplomacy should lead us to avoid. Looking back over recent years I have found it hard to detect from the accounts, given in the press or by the Taoiseach to the House of these meetings, any serious effort to advance our vital interests by securing the support of other countries with similar interests or by playing a positive and constructive role of a kind that won for us the goodwill of other member states.</P>
    <P>As far as this European Council is concerned it is clear that there were several objectives which we should have been aiming to secure. One relates to the highly controversial fishery issue, where the possibility still remains despite the action of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Minister for Fisheries, in throwing away, within a fortnight of coming to office so much that we had gained in October 1976, of securing at least a 12 <Col N="391" /> mile band around our coasts together with a privileged position in areas beyond that, especially off the west coast. I am not clear as to what steps, if any, the Taoiseach took at Maastricht to advance our case in this respect. No press report I have read in any Irish or English paper has anything to say about Ireland and fisheries&mdash;all the talk now is about the British position, and all the concessions seem to be sought by Britain rather than by this country. There may be more to this than meets the eye but to the interested observer it is not evident that any serious attempt is being made to retrieve even part of the damage done by the disastrous blunders of the present Minister for Foreign Affairs in the early weeks of the present Government's period in office. Indeed the Taoiseach's silence on this issue in his speech comfirms my suspicions that no action was taken in regard to our fisheries position at this Council.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural front we have both short-term and long-term interests to pursue and to protect. In the short term we must be concerned to ensure both that the price increase emerging from the forthcoming Agricultural Council meeting or meetings will be on the scale commensurate with the level of inflation that this Government have imposed upon this country by their disastrous economic policies. I concede that this may be difficult to obtain. The Government's actions in allowing inflation here to rise to and remain at a level around 20 per cent, now 21 per cent, greatly weakens their capacity to argue the case for farm price increases of the scale needed to protect our farmers' incomes. This is because the Government's failures have left us open to the argument that we ought to clear up our own mess ourselves rather than expect Europe to bail us out. Nonetheless, even allowing for self-imposed difficulty, one would have hoped that the Taoiseach would have used the opportunity at the Maastricht Summit to press our case strongly in relation to farm price levels, and in particular to secure the support of his fellow heads of Government for a serious special package for <Col N="392" /> Ireland to replace the derisory proposal for £16 million a year over two years which is all that his Minister for Agriculture has so far been able to extract from the European Commission. If the Taoiseach did raise and press these matters I would have thought that he would have told us something about his efforts and achievements since then, but there has been silence in respect of this whole area.</P>
    <P>Neither, in the press nor in his speech &mdash; four pages of which are devoted to the discussion on agriculture &mdash; is there a reference to the Taoiseach's actively doing something about it at the summit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is telling us here what needs to be done and what the other countries should do but there is no evidence that he told them our needs or put our case to them. There is no point in preaching to us because we are converted. It was in Maastricht that the preaching should have been done and there is not the slightest evidence that the matter was even raised by the Taoiseach. Indeed it is difficult to trace any indication of any serious contribution made by the Taoiseach to the discussions at Maastricht. The impression that the average newspaper reader has, apart from what he has heard from the Taoiseach's brief discussion with the British Prime Minister, is one of an Irish Leader sitting silently and missing his opportunity to press for serious consideration of the critical economic situation in our country.</P>
    <P>One of the problems here may be an inhibition on the part of the Government in explaining to our partners &mdash; just as they have been inhibited in explaining to the Irish public &mdash; how serious a crisis has been created in this State. The extent to which our present economic difficulties are due to the domestic policies of our Government rather than to factors outside our control is something that other member Governments may well be aware of so that any attempt to seek their support for our economy generally, quite apart from support for the specific difficulties of the agricultural sector, could meet with a rather cold reception. It may have been the fear of this that prevented the Taoiseach from pressing strongly, as one would have hoped he might have <Col N="393" /> done, for a reflation of other European economies which are not as financially constrained as ours and where the pursuit of saner economic policies has left room for reflationary action which, if taken, could after six months or so begin to benefit this country.</P>
    <P>The communique certainly suggests very little is going to be done by the other member countries to revitalise the economy of the Community as a whole. The references in it to the economic situation are, to say the least, discouraging; when one reads such language as &ldquo;continuation of prudent monetary policies&rdquo; one cannot draw much hope for action that would expand economic growth &mdash; which now appears to have disappeared within the Community as a whole, being replaced by a forecasted marginal decline in output during the current year. When one reads that &ldquo;short-term demand stimuli will turn out to be ineffective&rdquo; one can hear the death knell being sounded for many industries here which depend for their survival on a prosperous and expanding European economy. One wonders why the Taoiseach agreed to this proposition and why he did not press the argument that precisely what is needed at present, in countries that are not constrained by financial disarray and excessive borrowing as we are, is the application of short-term demand stimuli, instead of which he agreed with them that there should not be such action taken as a result of which the economies of these countries will remain depressed and we will have corresponding difficulties in pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph of the communique, one can read an implied criticism of this country &mdash; I refer to the statement that &ldquo;high and divergent inflation rates will outstrip both the prospects of growth and of the economic cohesion of the Community&rdquo;. It is difficult to see this as other than a warning that the continuation of inflation at the rate that this Government's policies have produced will make it difficult for the IR£ to hold its value in the EMS. One would like to have heard from the Taoiseach in this debate, and we shall certainly seek from him in the now widened debate on the <Col N="394" /> Finance Bill, some indication of what measures he proposes to take to reduce our high inflation rate now 3½ times what it was in 1978, and to reduce the threat both to the prospect of growth in this country and to the maintenance of the value of our currency within the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>The references to unemployment in the communique are equally discouraging and do no more than repeat what has been said at so many other previous European Councils. I took the opportunity to glance back through the record of the European Councils over the years 1979 and 1980 to see what they said about unemployment. They acknowledged in March 1979 that priority should be given to improving the employment situation which continues to give rise to concern and they went on to invite both sides of industry to take the appropriate measures to develop their dialogue at Community level. In November 1979 they recalled that they discussed the serious unemployment situation in the Community and stated that a more co-ordinated approach to employment problems should be defined, requesting the Commission to submit proposals and measures which could be framed to promote more incisive Community action to do with the unemployment problem. At the following European Council it was agreed that the reduction of inflation was an important means of combating unemployment but that efforts within the Community to reduce structural unemployment should be stepped up and better co-ordinated. Three months later at Venice they affirmed &ldquo;in the face of the increasing disturbing employment situation...particularly as regards young people...the priority and need, in some of the member states, for short-term structural measures in the context of an active employment policy&rdquo;, and went on to talk once again about the need to &ldquo;ensure a better coordination of employment policies at Community level.&rdquo; At the December 1980 meeting, the European Council said that &ldquo;it was particularly concerned at the rapid increase in unemployment in the member states of the Community&rdquo;. It went on, after reference <Col N="395" /> to the need to reduce inflation, to say that &ldquo;the various Community instruments must continue to serve first and foremost policies aimed at reducing structural unemployment and at improving infrastructure and the economic situation in the less favoured rural regions&rdquo;, adding, that &ldquo;a special effort should be made in the Community and in all member states to assist young people to find employment, and to ensure that training is geared to requirements&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, at the latest European Council Meeting the heads of government tell us again that &ldquo;the high and rising rates of unemployment, especially among youth, are a cause of deep concern.&rdquo; I do not know whom they are impressing but I do know whom they are depressing, the peoples of their countries. The constant reiteration of clichés followed up in no case over a period of two-and-a-half years by any action of significance is undermining confidence generally throughout the Community in the effectiveness of the Community as an instrument of common economic policy, and I think it is time that someone said this plainly at a European Council Meeting. I regret that the Taoiseach did not appear to have had the courage to do so.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that this European Council Meeting has yielded nothing of value from the point of view of this country, or indeed of the Community as a whole. Nothing was settled or decided in the sphere of fishery policy, agricultural policy or employment policy, all of which are vital to us. As I have had occasion to say in the past, one is forced to question the utility of regular meetings of this kind which, occurring whether or not there is something ready for decision, something that would produce practical results, only have the effect of depressing the peoples of Europe and undermining their faith in the Community. That was the view I held when the proposal was first put forward in October 1974 for these regular meetings. I pressed that view but was overborne by the larger countries which thought these meetings would provide them with an opportunity to boss the <Col N="396" /> smaller countries &mdash; as has tended to be the case.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that the Community does not have at its disposal the resources to take any action that would be likely to have perceptible effects on the economies of members states. The present budgetary limitation, of 1 per cent of member states' VAT, leaves the Community so under-financed that it is simply a joke to pretend that it could take effective action in the economic sphere, and its attempts to co-ordinate the economic policy of members states which even without those resources it could, in theory, do, have notably failed because of the unwillingness of individual countries, including Ireland, to accept the need for co-ordinated economic policies. The scale of resources that would be required by the Community in order to intervene effectively in the economic situation is many times greater than the resources now available to it, which are so exiguous that the relatively small sums devoted to agriculture, themselves no more than, and in many cases probably less than, member states would be providing to assist this sector by means of national policies were there not a common agricultural policy, loom so large in this tiny budget as to have become the focal point of attack by those vested interests which are hostile to, or uncaring for, the need for a prosperous agricultural sector within the member countries.</P>
    <P>What action did the Taoiseach take at this European Council Meeting to raise the crucial question of lifting the 1 per cent VAT limit, which at present hamstrings the Community in its efforts to act effectively in the economic sphere? Whatever short-term alleviation there may be of the effect of this limit by virtue of an improvement in agricultural prices reducing the cost to the Community of disposing of surpluses, the fact is that we are within a year or at most two years to the point where this limit will be a serious constraint on the further development of the Community. What support has the Taoiseach sought or secured from other member countries who may share this view &mdash; and some of them do &mdash; to get this limit removed, as it must be if the <Col N="397" /> Community is not simply to fade away in the years ahead as it becomes increasingly ineffective through the inadequacies of the resources available to it? What diplomatic campaign has this country mounted on this issue and what success has it had? These are the kind of questions to which the House is entitled to answers and on which it has not been given any information whatsoever by the Taoiseach or by his Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that under the present Government the Irish contribution to the Community has become negligible and negative. Any reports, reaction or feedback I have had from other countries in Europe, from people involved in the political process or in the European Commission have tended to confirm that. The contrast between the active policy pursued by Ireland during the period of office of the National Coalition and the passive policy. Only a return to the positive and active diplomacy of the period meet when I go to Brussels as well as to other European capitals. The prospects of our securing from this source the kind of assistance needed by a peripheral economy such as our own are fairly limited for the time being in view of this passive policy. Only a return to the positive and active diplomacy of the period of the National Coalition Government can give us any hope of securing from the Community the kind of assistance which this country needs and to which it can rightly lay claim if it makes its own positive input to the working of the Community, as was done during the early years of Irish membership in accordance with a carefully thought-out and concerted strategy which produced concrete results that have been singularly lacking during the past four years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred in his speech to several other matters. He listed on one line the failure to take any decision about the location of the political institutions of the Community, a failure that is impeding the work of the Community and leading increasingly to unrest among the staff who find it impossible to work in three locations at once. It is about time this matter was tackled. Obviously vested <Col N="398" /> interests are concerned in several of the member states. It is up to countries like Ireland who do not have a vested interest in where the capital of the Community is to be to help find a solution in this regard rather than stand back and let the quarrel continue, leaving the Community increasingly ineffective as its staff trundles backwards and forwards between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, becoming increasingly frustrated as a result of this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference in the communiqué and in the Taoiseach's speech to the situation in Poland but I am concerned about reports that have come in since then of a hard line German attitude to the terms of financial aid to Poland. I hope the Taoiseach and other heads of government will ensure that aid is given to that country on a basis that will really meet Polish needs and that it will not be given on the basis of a primary concern with narrow banking criteria.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach referred to the North-South dialogue and the differnt fora in which the discussions will proceed. I hope we can make a positive input to this dialogue, as was done when we were in government, and that in co-operation with countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, who share our concern, we can ensure through these fora that the Community's input to the Summit in Mexico, where we shall be represented as part of the Community, will be a positive one. We should ensure that situation will not arise as happened in 1976 when, after several years when the Community had given a lead in the matter, it slipped backwards under pressure fom the United States to a negative attitude at Nairobi which has done it no good since then with the Third World, and which has done a disservice to our relationship with these countries and to the cause of the more equal distribution of resources worldwide.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reference in the communiqué or in the Taoiseach's speech to El Salvador. If this matter was not discussed I regret that fact. I would have hoped there would have been a discussion on it and that a joint approach to the United States would have been agreed. <Col N="399" /> On this matter I have had occasion more than once to congratulate our Minister on the efforts he has made in this area. I do not fault the Government here at all. It may be, although we cannot know it at this point, that there was a discussion on this subject at Maastricht but that it was decided not to make public reference to it because a private diplomatic approach to the United States might be more effective than public statements. I have no reason to believe that is the case; I am merely speculating that it could be the case. If so I would be happy with the approach adopted.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any information on the subject I can only express concern as to whether this meeting did consider the situation in El Salvador and the danger to European-American relations which it constitutes and considered approaching the United States with a view to helping the situation in El Salvador, helping the human rights situation, helping to achieve a solution to the internal problems of that country through mediation and helping to ensure that equipment and arms are not furnished to the military government of that country by the United States. If that was done, I am glad; if it was not, I regret it. I can understand that even if it were done the Taoiseach might not be able to refer to it here and it will have to be left to historians to discover whether the Summit dealt with that important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his report. He has done his best to attribute some importance to an occasion which was in every respect a waste of time and money. I have very little to say about this latest example of EEC summitry because there is little or nothing to say about it.</P>
      <P>As to the substance of the meeting, neither the fisheries policy nor the agricultural price package was advanced in any way and once again the Heads of Government have ended up by sending these matters back to the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of worthy but quite practical statements were made on world <Col N="400" /> political issues. We must welcome the statement on the situation in the Lebanon, but can anyone say that all the public relations and all the expense were justified? The Summit decided to press ahead with the Spanish and Portuguese applications for membership and that must be supported fully in political terms, but can we honestly say that this first Summit, after the welcome entry of Greece to the Community, did anything to suggest that there is either the political will or the economic or social policy to make enlargement work?</P>
    <P>The Summit decided not to do anything about the absurd situation regarding the seat of the European Parliament. The costly Parliament circus is to continue back and forth between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg and this is the kind of thing which gives the Community a very well deserved bad name.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, there was a major issue facing the top people at the meeting and they did nothing about it. The Community's economic crisis is deep and its effects on ordinary men and women and their families are severe and getting worse. More than eight million people are out of work and almost half of them are young people. What had the Summit to say to them? We have heard the ten political leaders mouthing the usual platitudes about concern and high wage demands. We have heard nothing at all about a genuine Community response to the crisis, nor about any form of analysis of the basic causes of the crisis.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the European Community today is the victim of its own philosophy. It was believed that free trade would produce growth, full employment and prosperity. In the world of the eighties that is a foolish and quite baseless belief. The European Community today is experiencing the results of the failure of the present economic and social system. Widespread unemployment, lack of any real hope of improvement, growing regional imbalance in coming years and dangerous social pressures all add up to an unacceptable situation. A Community with vast resources is seen to be unable to fulfil adequately <Col N="401" /> its responsibilities to its own people, never mind to the world at large.</P>
    <P>What is needed now is a concerted Commuity programme for economic recovery. Nothing like that emerged from the Summit. The Community must advance towards a new phase of development based not on simplistic faith in the private sector but on the pursuit of communal goals. It is now surely obvious that solutions do not lie in the traditional area of fiscal and monetary policies and that they demand management. There must be a change in direction and emphasis. Policies must relate directly to the eradication of the fundamental causes of the crisis, which include maldistribution of resources and undemocratic control of the key centres of the economic system. Amongst the elements of policy which must be stressed are strong planning procedures with democratic involvement of the interested parties, selected sectoral growth policies, long-term investment policies with central control, especially in relation to multinational companies, long-term employment plans for key economic sectors, a coherent programme for energy conservation and development and proper balance between economic, social and environmental goals.</P>
    <P>The crisis is so great that there must be a total commitment of political will to the planned pursuit of full employment and that commitment is at present totally lacking. While it remains a missing element there must be a serious question mark over the future of the Community. Unless the Community is seen to be relevant to the real needs of its people &mdash; and what need is more urgent than the needs of over eight million people for jobs? &mdash; it will lose more and more of its little remaining attraction for the men and women of the ten countries. Unless the Community makes itself relevant to these needs it does not merit the support of anyone within it.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to look at the domestic background against which the Taoiseach attended the Summit meeting. In his speech the Taoiseach said that the major Irish concerns at the Council related to employment and agriculture. This Summit was to concern itself mainly <Col N="402" /> with unemployment and other economic difficulties within the member states. This country has probably the worst record in all sections of our national economic life. Today an inflation rate of 21 per cent has been revealed and that probably puts us at the top of the chart of member states. The number of unemployed on the live register stands at 126,000 and they will be joined by approximately 50,000 school leavers this year. Agriculture, our main industry, is experiencing an unprecedented crisis. People who are trying to make a livelihood from fishing are today picketing this Parliament as we discuss the Summit. Our national finances are in a state of total chaos. State Departments, local authorities and health boards have had to cut back on essential services because of the economic policies pursued by this Government. Every Member of this House who has any contact whatsoever with his constituents knows precisely what that means. For instance &mdash; and this seems to be a relatively small thing but it is an indication of the economic state of this country after three and a half years of Fianna Fáil &mdash; an old person who needs the care of a chiropodist cannot get it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fair enough. I will finish on this point. Inflation, unemployment, the plight of our agricultural sector, fisheries, our national financial position, balance of payments, the plight of the 50,000 school-leavers who will be looking for jobs in June next, none of these matters &mdash; and this was the only thing that emerged from four consecutive news bulletins &mdash; none of these matters, either individually or collectively, according to a statement by the Taoiseach, was this Government's first priority. According to the Taoiseach, their first priority at the Summit lay somewhere else.</P>
      <P>How seriously could one be taken by one's fellow Heads of State if one states, at the Summit itself, that none of those matters &mdash; unemployment, balance of payments, inflation &mdash; was one's first political consideration.

      <P>Before Question Time I was about to deal with the one issue on which I intended to speak on this Estimate, which is, the St. George Fishery at Clarinbridge. There was a Supplementary Estimate for Fisheries debated in this House on 3 December last. On the previous day I had a reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question I had posed regarding the acquisition of the St. George Fishery. It is a fishery that runs along the coast for approximately a mile in the Kinvara-Ballinderry marine area, a total of 810 acres. At that time I asked the Minister for Fisheries if he was aware that it was reported in a local western paper that the fishery had been bought by a group of French people, deemed to be a French consortium &mdash; a group of four people is how they were described. I had a reply from the Minister that the sale of the fishery had gone through and seemingly had been sanctioned by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Fisheries was debated in this House on 3 December. I availed of that opportunity in the House to ask the Minister for Fisheries if he would acquire this fishery. I presented the case in the best way possible on behalf of the 300 fishermen who might hope to make a livelihood from this fishery. The Minister stated, in reply that part of the reason he could not acquire that fishery was that the powers of the Central Fisheries Board extended only to the acquisition of fisheries for the implementation of a development programme. It was stated that the St. George Fishery was not the subject of such a development programme and that therefore the Central Fisheries Board had no authority to acquire it. That was the bones of the reply the Minister <Col N="405" /> gave on that occasion. From the little I know about the Central Fisheries Board they do have power to acquire this fishery. On that occasion I indicated my disappointment at the decision of the Minister and the Central Fisheries Board not to acquire that fishery.</P>
    <P>Since that date in December last many meetings have taken place between local politicians and the fishermen who want the Minister to acquire that fishery. One of those meetings was attended by the Minister. The sale took place some time before 3 December last; I cannot recall the exact date but it does not really matter. We are now at 26 March and I am expressing an opinion on behalf of the 300 fishermen. I am the only person to do so, however well or badly I may do it. The other people representing the area &mdash; the Minister for the Gaeltacht, the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and Deputy Molloy &mdash; seem reluctant to express an opinion in the House on this issue. There are a couple of other people down there who would like to get in on the act. Of course, if they were part of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party in the House they might not have the will or be given the opportunity to express their opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say this, that if we do not see some action on the part of the Minister in relation to this fishery it will be easy to count the numerical support for his Party on the ground in that area at the next election. Local people are inclined to express the opinion that the Minister for Fisheries seems more <Col N="406" /> inclined to take action on behalf of those French people, taking their side, rather than that of the 300 local fishermen.</P>
      <P>Since that date in December last there have been many meetings held, to none of which could we entice the powers that be. However, on 17 January last, at 9.15 a.m., the Minister for Fisheries &mdash; I think he had attended a Fianna Fáil social in Galway the evening before and it would be on his way home to Kildare &mdash; arrived in Kilcolgan to meet all the interested parties, including all the politicians and aspiring politicians. On that occasion we had a great chat with him, when there was represented to him in the best possible way the reason we thought that fishery should be acquired. In fact, he expressed such a keen interest in it that he even went to inspect the fishery. I left the meeting at that stage because I had to attend &ldquo;clinics&rdquo; and, as a result, was not in the Minister's presence when he inspected the fisheries.</P>
      <P>The Minister inspected that fishery and, as a result, all who took part in the meeting on 17 January were of the impression that they were going to get some action. The Minister on that occasion was backed up by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister of State. When seeing all this power coming down to a place called Moran's in Kilcolgan, I was sure we would get some action. The people of the area were disappointed when they did not even get a reply from the Minister for quite some time &mdash; about five or six weeks &mdash; even though the Minister promised to have the matter investigated. It was hoped that he would revoke the licence granted for the St. George fishery. To make a long story short, nothing has happened since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday, 23 March, the Minister met a deputation of the local community representing all the political interests, among others. I was not able to attend the meeting as I was otherwise engaged politically in Galway. These people expressed their points of view to him and he said he would make a decision on the future of this fishery within a week or ten days. I tried to raise the question on the adjournment twice already, but when the Fisheries Estimate was coming up today, <Col N="407" /> I decided to wait until now. I am here today to put the case to the Minister that this fishery be acquired for the benefit of the Irish people living in that area. A group of French people have acquired &mdash; or have been allowed to acquire &mdash; this fishery.</P>
    <P>I presume that the purchase of a fishery is somewhat similar to the purchase of land. In most cases as far as land is concerned &mdash; particularly a large tract of land, more so if it is being acquired by a non-national &mdash; the sanction of the Land Commission would be necessary. In the purchase of this fishery by a group of fellow Europeans, but foreigners, it was presumably necessary to get the sanction of the Minister. Having got his sanction, there is a further stipulation that one must apply for a fishing licence &mdash; the case is different for a farmer buying land, because he can start farming right away. The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry granted the licence, which was all right at the time. I do not know if there is a tieup between the Minister or his party and this group of French people. It smells rotten in Galway that we have a native Minister who will not act on behalf of Irish fishermen &mdash; part-time farmers, none of whom is wealthy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister does act on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want him to do, but he has not been doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During these meetings it was stated that there may not be adequate legislation on the Statute Book to allow the Minister to acquire this fishery. If that is so, let us introduce the legislation immediately, even if for the sole purpose of acquiring this fishery. It is the stated policy of the Fine Gael Party that any fisheries which come on the market should be acquired by the State for the benefit of the local community. Everyone, regardless of his or her political affiliation, must agree with that. How did the St. George fishery ever get into foreign hands? I will tell you how all these fisheries got into foreign hands. They were all granted by royal charter, which is, in <Col N="408" /> actual fact, the crown. This happened years and years ago and these fisheries have been passed down from one generation to the next.</P>
    <P>Until quite recently I represented a totally inland area, but I was aware that there were a lot of privately owned fisheries around the coast, most of these being in the hands of non-nationals. In this day and age there is much expression of opinion in Parliament about affairs in the North of Ireland and that we should be one entity, which is only natural and which nobody in this House would disagree with, although some may claim that they are more part of it than others. Take the southern part of Ireland and here we are speaking about 810 acres of coastline around Galway and the Government are signing this area over to Frenchmen. The very nationalistic party in power at the moment express so many diverse opinions about the part of the country which is in the hands of a foreign power and are giving away another little bit, 810 acres off the coast of Galway. That is wrong. They should not be expressing so much of an interest in what they have not got and at the same time handing away what they have. There is a slight parallel between the two.</P>
    <P>The salmon weir in Galway, which was in the hands of a non-national, was the subject of discussions and fish-ins over the years. It was recently acquired at an approximate cost of £250,000. In one year that cost has been recouped by catches of eels alone &mdash; about 17 tonnes in the one year. It would be no great financial burden on the State to acquire these fisheries by a gradual process, starting with the one I have been speaking about, the St. George fishery. Due to the inaction of the Minister and the Department, one local Fianna Fáil councillor said &ldquo;Let us get the Taoiseach to do it&rdquo;. All right, we call on the Taoiseach, the big daddy, to come down and crack the whip, withdraw the licence and take over the fishery.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for one moment, a similar sized fishery was for sale on the coast of Brittany. Do you think that Irish people, even if they had the finance, would be allowed to buy it and be granted a licence <Col N="409" /> to farm that fishery? Not on your life. Typical of us Irish, that is the way we are behaving. As regards this fishery and all other shell fisheries around our coast, regardless of what hands they are in, I hope the day is coming fast when we will see them all in the hands of our own people. We should train people in mariculture in the same way as we train experts in agriculture with a view to ensuring that we farm our fisheries for the benefit of the Irish fishermen and the Irish people generally. In the St. George fishery most of the 300 people involved are part-time fishermen. They deserve special consideration.</P>
    <P>I remember very clearly in 1977 prior to the change of Government a great deal of hassle as to who was doing what for our fishermen. There was talk of a fishing limit around the coast and I remember Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs now &mdash; he puts his foot in it often enough and, if I put my foot in it by not addressing him properly, I apologise &mdash; and the man who picked up the crumbs from the rich man's table, Minister of State, Gallagher, once deposed, I remember them, when the Government of the day were trying to negotiate a proper fishery limit, stating that a 50 mile limit was the right of the Irish fishermen. They said it was their natural right to have that. Of course, once June 1977 passed and the big majority came in after convincing the poor fishermen they would do the devil and all for them, that 50 mile limit was conveniently forgotten about. I listened to Deputy Coughlan today, the victor in Donegal, stating that the price of fish at the moment to the fishermen is less than it was in 1977 and costs are doubled. One wonders where priorities lie or what is the Government's policy in regard to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>In order to assess the value of a fishery it is generally estimated that one acre of seabed properly farmed is equal to ten acres of agricultural land. For the education of those who would not have any idea of the size of 810 acres of seabed I am talking now about 8,100 acres of fairly good agricultural land. That is what I am talking about when I talk about the St. George fishery. The Minister must be <Col N="410" /> aware of the militant action being taken by the fishermen in that area. He must be aware that the quay there is being picketed by the local fishermen. He must be aware that they are dissatisfied with the lack of action. He certainly has been aware of the situation since 3 December last when I spoke here on the matter. He has had ample time to make up his mind. I do not know who he is protecting. Does he or the Government have some link with the people there? More militant action will be taken in the future unless this fishery is acquired and I now call on the Government to acquire it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred this morning to Rossaveal and said he intended in the very near future to declare it a major fishery harbour centre. I am disappointed to find no money has been allocated for the development of Rossaveal as a major fishery centre. We seem to have got no further than talking. No money has been allocated for Rossaveal just as no money has been allocated for the purchase of the St. George fishery. There has been talk about reports. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I intend in the very near future to declare Rossaveal a major fishery centre. With this in mind I set up, in June 1980, the Rossaveal Harbour Development Advisory Committee, on which all interested parties were represented, to recommend for my consideration appropriate works in order of priority for the development of the infrastructure of Rossaveal harbour. I expect that the Committee's report with recommendations will be available in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>Let us hope they will be available in the next few months. The Minister has been very slow getting things off the ground. Have any plans been made for the development of the infrastructure, such as roads and so on? The roads in the area are indescribable and a large input of money is essential if Rossaveal is to be developed as a major fishery centre. The Minister has responsibility, though not total responsibility, for the infrastructure. I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="411" /> would like to interrupt me and say the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have nothing to do with roads.</P>

      <P>On the Office of Public Works last week I spoke about the condition of Clifden Harbour. The Department of Fisheries should co-operate with the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works in improving facilities at Clifden and Cleggan and in that area. Not only will this benefit fishermen but it will also facilitate tourism, because naturally where there are fish there will be fishermen and when it is also <Col N="412" /> a scenic area you will have tourists, and the condition of these piers is tied in with other industries. I am thinking of piers from Leenane, Rossroe, Renvyle, Ballinakill, Cleggan, Clifden, Ballyconneely, Roundstone, Letterard, Carna, Kilkerrin, Lettermullen, right around to Rossaveal where I began, where very little money has been spent. It is necessary that something should be done to improve these piers by the Department of Fisheries in conjunction with the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Gaeltacht. I do not seek a very large allocation of money.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested to find the Department getting in touch with the Department of the Gaeltacht because I think they are supposed to come up with the money for most of these piers because they are in the Gaeltacht areas. But the Minister has a role to play also. He should work hand in hand with the Department of the Gaeltacht to improve facilities for fishermen and tourists in that area.</P>

      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Forestry gives us an opportunity to express our views about many areas where expenditure is incurred. I intend to deal specifically with the State support provided in this Estimate for a new company to be known as Chipboard Products Limited in Scarriff, County Clare, where the State has decided for the first time in the case of the timber industry, to have a strong share capital and to appoint four State directors. I want to make it quite clear that I give my unqualified and total support to the provision of State investment to make this industry viable. The former industry, Chipboard Limited, had many ups and downs over a period of years, but now the local investors who previously invested in Chipboard Limited have shown extraordinary faith and confidence in the new industry and in the directors and managing director who will be running the new business. The new company will give employment to approximately 222 people and 95 per cent of it will be male. They will also have three shifts for five days and two crews on the weekend. This means that local small farmers will have an opportunity to <Col N="413" /> supplement the income from their farms. In this area that is vital because there are no other industries. The taxpayers have had the doubtful advantage of contributing to State investment without enjoying much there themselves up to now.</P>
      <P>The intention of management there is to co-operate with AnCO, which will improve productivity within the firm. The State grant will help with re-equipment. The State is not helping a lame duck but helping people who have contributed in an exceptional way in establishing Chipboard Products. Local shareholders have invested and paid £193,000 in this case. They have also made provision for £57.000 in loans for this company. That shows the faith local investors have in the industry. Total private shareholding has amounted to £250,000. This is a rare example of co-operation in rural areas. We must appreciate local effort as the State has done in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were several difficulties regarding expenditure and costs in the former firm. These will now be eliminated. Wages and salaries cost £1.25 million last year. Fuel and energy costs were exceptionally high for kiln drying timber, amounting to £700,000 last year. This was a big drain on the company's finances. With innovations and the use of the sawdust from the processing in the mill, there will now be a reduction in fuel costs to less than £500,000, giving an initial saving straight away. Previously, there was a heavy drain on finances of about £400,000 annually for interest charges. In no way could the company survive where those charges had to be met. In every respect the new company is worthy of State confidence and the investors are most optimistic. This is the type of industry which has future potential. Last year sales amounted to £7 million. There is no other such company in this country, apart from one in the North of Ireland in Coleraine. We have done a good job in that we are supporting the remaining chipboard industry in the State. If we had not provided this investment we would be importing these products. There is definitely a net gain to the country in the <Col N="414" /> balance of payments of approximately £4 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for having given me permission to raise this matter. In the question on the Order Paper today I asked for details of the implementation of the Government's commitment to road proposals in relation to the Southern Cross route. Perhaps it was too broad a question to be dealt with in the confines of Question Time, and I am therefore glad to have this opportunity to expand on the problem and on the moves that are being or are to be made by the Government to deal with it.</P>
      <P>It goes back to 1977 when on 8 June the Southern Cross route study group, an umbrella organisation made up of representatives of residents' associations throughout the southern part of County Dublin, received from Fianna Fáil in response to an official request, an undertaking signed on behalf of the party by Senator Eoin Ryan. The undertaking was very simple and it was given in response to the following question: &ldquo;Does your party support in principle the position of Dublin County Council to reject plans to channel heavy traffic through residential south Dublin and to immediately construct a road on the agreed line of the Southern Cross route motorway to take this traffic&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil responded, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, there was not a commitment from Fine Gael and the Labour Party responded &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Anybody who examines the commitment will see clearly that it is in two parts. The first involved the rejection of the plans to channel heavy traffic through residential south Dublin and the second was the construction of the agreed line of the Southern Cross route motorway. I wish I had a blackboard or a map to explain precisely what is involved. I will do my best without visual aids to explain this complex matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, what is generally agreed to be the Southern Cross route motorway <Col N="415" /> begins at a point slightly south of Firhouse Road and travels in a wide arc from there towards the sea. The sad fact is that since 1977 when the commitment was given, not a bulldozer has been moved into that part of the road alignment. A comparatively large amount of money has been spent by the Government on something called the Western Parkway. It was always envisaged that the Southern Cross route would link up with what is called the Western Parkway, finally avoiding the need for heavy traffic, particularly industrial vehicles, to travel through any residential areas in the south and west of the city, but since 1977, the Government have been doing their level best to suggest to people and to concerned public representatives from the county council and the Dáil that work sanctioned by the county council in relation to the Western Parkway is in some sense the implementation of the commitment in relation to the Southern Cross motorway.</P>
    <P>I must point out that the Southern Cross and the Western Parkway, even though they will be joined up eventually, in political, geographic and engineering terms are two different things and that the implementation of one cannot be construed as implementation of a commitment given to the other. The present situation is that the amount of work done on the Western Parkway has tended to create a situation which makes the implementation of the Southern Cross route all the more urgent, and it is therefore all the more disturbing to the residents' associations that what appears to be happening is the reverse of what was promised.</P>
    <P>Approximately £7 million has been spent or authorised since the general election in improving traffic flows in west County Dublin. The alarming thing is that there has not been corresponding expenditure worth speaking of in the south County Dublin area. What is happening in effect is that the traffic flow through west County Dublin is being improved, increased and diverted away from residential areas in that part of the county &mdash; a very good thing it is, too &mdash;<Col N="416" /> but that traffic flow has reached a point when it will increasingly arrive at the Dodder at Firhouse with nowhere to go except through residential areas. That is because the Southern Cross route will not have been constructed to meet it.</P>
    <P>In the west of the county, two parts of road systems, the Western Parkway on the one hand and the Belgard&mdash;Tallaght by-pass on the other, have been constructed virtually in parallel and are being constructed in such a way that will increase the pressure of the volume of traffic coming in the direction of Dublin south. If you go back to the original 1977 proposal you will see that it was decided to provide a link between the Belgard-Tallaght by-pass and a further section of the Southern Cross route which would carry traffic away from the residential areas of south Dublin towards Sandyford, with perhaps a spur to the Sandyford industrial estate.</P>
    <P>A bad situation has been made even more critical because money has been given to construct a new bridge across the Dodder. Of course a new bridge across the Dodder is necessary, but the phasing of this development gives many residents of south Dublin areas considerable cause for concern because it indicates that even before the Southern Cross route has been built or any substantial steps have been taken to acquire the land, do the planning and build the road, access into south County Dublin by traffic coming from the Naas Road will be increased dramatically. Already it is a serious problem, first of all because of the growing industrial development in the west of the county and because of the growing and welcome industrial development in the Sandyford industrial estate. But to have all this industrial development without the provision of an adequate road network will create very serious problems. It has been exacerbated, if anything, by the fact that many of the juggernaut drivers &mdash; and who can blame them &mdash; now use CB radios so that whenever there is a hold-up on any of the larger residential roads which they are now forced to use because of the absence of the Southern Cross, they take off into smaller residential roads, terrifying residents and their <Col N="417" /> children and turning into what I gather are known in the trade as &ldquo;rat runs&rdquo;&mdash; roads totally unsuitable for heavy traffic, much less heavy industrial traffic, using them to circumvent traffic hazards.</P>
    <P>There is a point that can be made and was made by the Minister of State to me at Question Time today when he tried to pass the buck completely to the Dublin County Council. He said it was totally in the hands of Dublin County Council. It is of course true that Dublin County Council have an important function in this matter. It is also true that the elected members of the Dublin County Council have virtually unanimously supported the proposals made by Southern Cross route study group. The last time I am aware of that they took a substantive vote on those proposals they passed them by a majority of something like 18 to 1.</P>
    <P>There are administrative problems in the design and execution of any project of this size. The elected representatives are putting the maximum pressure they can put on to ensure that any administrative, legal and other logjams are cleared out of the way as quickly as possible. They do not have any evidence that the same degree of urgency applies in the Department of the Environment and that the Department of the Environment are putting any pressure on the county council to ensure not just that the Southern Cross route is built but that the phasing and development of the Southern Cross route is carried out in such a way as to maximise the safety of the inhabitants of the area and not the danger to the inhabitants of the area.</P>
    <P>Unless this is done what is going to happen is that all this traffic is going to arrive, coming off the Naas road at Newland's Cross, in the general direction of south Dublin and the bottleneck, in so far as there is a bottleneck, that exists at the moment at Newland's Cross will not exist any longer because it will have been transferred to the Firhouse Road. I do not know if the Minister has been along the Firhouse Road recently but the Firhouse Road in its present shape and state is so narrow that two cars and a bicycle cannot safely cross abreast on it. All this traffic is going to arrive on the Firhouse <Col N="418" /> Road with no further motorway, dual carriageway or anything else to take it.</P>
    <P>I think I can see what is going to happen. The pressure will build up for an immediate release of this logjam of traffic, and engineers and other people who like to have quick solutions to problems &mdash; and especially ones which do not necessarily cost as much as a motorway &mdash; may be tempted to take the soft option. The soft option in this situation would involve joining up existing residential roads like Ballyroan Road, Glendoher Road, Barton Road East and Whitechurch Road, on the one hand, and Ballinteer Avenue and Sandycove Road, on the other hand. All the traffic that the Southern Cross route study group confidently expected would be travelling on the Southern Cross route will now be travelling instead along these presumably slightly upgraded residential roads. There have already been protests on these roads at the volume of traffic they are having to carry at present. I shudder to think what the reaction of local residents would be &mdash; and I have never encouraged any group to break the law &mdash; if the kind of traffic volume that we see at Newlands Cross at present were to be diverted along the kind of residential roads I have described.</P>
    <P>The final word in many of these cases of road development and construction lies with the Minister and the Department, because the Minister and the Department, in the final analysis, control the allocation of funds by turning financial taps on and off. By indicating to local authorities what the ministerial and governmental priorities are they can have a substantial input into the construction of a road network that will meet not just the needs and demands of local residents but indeed their own earlier commitments. The 1977 commitment, I have no doubt, was made by Senator Eoin Ryan in good faith. He took pains not just to sign it on his own behalf but to associate Deputy Jack Lynch, the then leader of Fianna Fáil, with his agreement in principle with the aims and objections of the study group. Deputy Lynch is no longer Taoiseach but that does not essentially alter the political mathematics of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="419" /> As somebody representing an area which would be most gravely affected, from Firhouse all the way to Mount Merrion, if the Southern Cross route is not completed or is not substantially built in advance of the diversion of this traffic from the Naas Road, I have to ask the Minister what the 1977 commitment means now in 1981. Will he ensure that the work on this scheme is carried out in such a way as to ensure the implementation of the first part of the commitment given on behalf of this party to take traffic away from residential areas? There is a strong suspicion that at the moment what is happening is the reverse. If this is so the volume of traffic which will be going into the residential areas of south Dublin will, if anything, be increased. While I would not shed many tears over the fate of the Minister's party if they are perceived by the electorate to have failed to keep this commitment, in the longer term I would prefer to see the Minister's party keep the commitment and get the credit for keeping it than receive whatever electoral blows they might receive for failing to keep it, because in the long term the interests of the many and varied communities in that area are vital. If those communities are broken and fractured by heavy traffic, the danger is not just that they will turn around and wreak their vengeance on Fianna Fáil but that they will in some fundamental way be alienated from the process of political decision-making that we have at the moment. I urge the Minister to reiterate the 1977 commitment made by his party and to indicate how he proposes to ensure that heavy traffic will be routed away and not into the residential areas I have talked about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity this evening to report to the House the satisfactory progress that is being made in the construction of this new ring road known as the Southern Cross, and to take the opportunity to put on the record of the House the progress that is being made in regard to the commitment that has been referred to by the Deputy. <Col N="420" /> The House is already aware that approval in principle has been given to proposals submitted by Dublin County Council for construction of a new route between the Red Cow on the Naas Road and Harold's Grange and to the council proceeding with detailed planning for this route. Dublin County Council, in accordance with normal practice, are preparing plans for sections of the new road which will provide links with existing roads. For the section of the road linking the Naas Road with Greenhills Road, the council are preparing a compulsory purchase order for submission to me. Grants totalling £335,000 have been allocated for this section, mainly to meet the cost of such land as can be acquired, by agreement, by the council. I am pleased to report that construction work on the next section, Greenhills Road to Tallaght Road, has been completed with the aid of grants totalling £1,223,000.</P>
      <P>For the next section, Tallaght Road to Firhouse Road, grants totalling £877,000 have been allocated to meet the cost of land acquisition and construction work. There are many sections to this road. The completion of these three sections will provide a new road linking the Naas dual carriageway with Firhouse Road and will represent about half of the total length of the new route from Naas Road to Harold's Grange. Half of the project is already under way, which can be seen as confirmation of keeping a promise that was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the remainder of the route, from the Tallaght by-pass to Harold's Grange, I understand that the county council, in October 1979, appointed consultants to draw up the compulsory purchase order documents necessary for land acquisition and to prepare detailed design and contract documents. I am also advised that the council's engineers are in consultation with the consultants on the preparation of these documents. The question of allocating grants for this part of the route will be considered by me in the light of progress made by the council with detailed planning and land acquisitions. I must point out, however, that the timing and execution of work on further sections of the route is primarily a matter <Col N="421" /> for Dublin County Council. I want to take the opportunity to assure the House that there will be no delays in the Department of the Environment. I intend, through necessary grant allocations and prompt examination of the plans, to fully support the county council in its efforts to implement the programme for this new road. I consider that a stage has been reached where the county council can plan for extending the new road to link the Naas Road with the Lucan Road and for extending from Harold's Grange to Leopardstown Road.</P>
    <P>This ring road is one of the major improvement works for the Dublin region included in the road development plan for the 1980s. This plan, which is the first of its type since the foundation of the State, provides that priority in investment will be given to the principal urban and inter-urban roads, access routes to the principal seaports, airports, bypasses, relief roads and internal circulation roads in the cities and other important commercial centres. It provides for the systematic improvement of the principal routes, while at the same time providing for ongoing programmes of strengthening and maintenance. The investment plan for 1981 provides for a considerably increased level of finance for the road network. On foot of the provision of £80 million, I have been <Col N="422" /> enabled to allocate grants to road authorities, totalling over £87 million, for road improvement and maintenance work this year. This level of investment will enable road authorities to make substantial progress with the programme of works outlined in the road development plan.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to place on record the progress which has been made to date and the commitment to the future by the Government. I am aware of the concern of parents in the area with regard to certain sections of the road. I know there is heavy traffic in their area. As the father of two young children, I appreciate the worry of parents in the area and the anxieties of parents in all urban areas. Because of my concern in this case, and the representations which I received from Deputy Niall Andrews, I have agreed to meet a deputation from the study group next Tuesday. It will give me the opportunity to go into greater detail with the deputation on the plans and programmes of the Government to fully honour its commitment to the people of this district. Progress has already been made on about half the road and there will be no delay in the construction of the remaining sections.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 31 March 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 1973 to 7 March 1981. He had earlier been referred for examination by a medical referee but in the event this examination did not take place. Due to an administrative <Col N="357" /> error following this referral, payment was inadvertently stopped. The matter has since been rectified and all payment due to 11 April 1981 has been made.</P>

In view of the fact that only one medical certificate has been received from him there was no undue delay in the payment of benefit. He has no entitlement to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>There are 16 disabled people employed in the Department at present, that is 1.3 per cent of the workforce of 1,250. My Department will also be accepting a number of the disabled people who are being recruited by the Civil Service Commission. I have also decided that preference will be given to employing disabled people where practicable in subordinate employment.</P>
      <P>I should mention that approximately 75 per cent of all posts in my Department are in operational areas with a liability for full-shift working. Many people with a wide range of various disabilities are precluded from employment in such areas for practical reasons. However, my Department are engaged in a programme of ensuring that the greatest possible number of disabled people will be employed.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 10 March to Deputies Bruton and Fitzpatrick, I have encouraged the State bodies under the aegis of my Department to make every effort to increase the employment of handicapped persons and I have been assured of their full co-operation. The matter of employment generally is, however, one of day-to-day administration for the State bodies in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The entitlement to health services of children in second level schools generally depends, if they are under 16 years of age, on their parents' eligibility for services. If the parents are holders of a medical card, their children are entitled to free general medical practitioner services, including necessary drugs, mediices and appliances and to free dental, ophthalmic and aural services.</P>
      <P>All children suffering from certain specified conditions are entitled to free drugs and medicines prescribed for that condition. Other children, irrespective of parents' income, qualify for the drug refund scheme where expenditure on prescribed medicines incurred in respect of any calendar month exceeds £8.</P>
      <P>Children under 16 years are generally entitled to hospital services on the same basis as their parents. If the parents are in categories I and II of the population, i.e., with full or limited eligibility for health services the full range of hospital services will be provided free in a public ward. If either parent is in category III of the population, the children will normally be regarded as being in that category also. Hospital services are, however, provided free for all children suffering from prescribed long-term illnesses, irrespective of their parents' income.</P>
      <P>Persons over the age of 16 years are regarded as adults for the purposes of health services and entitlement of second level pupils over 16 years of age to services therefore depends on their own eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of all services to second level school children under 16 years without reference to their parents' means is a matter which will be considered in the <Col N="373" /> light of future developments and the resources available. However, I have already indicated in the House &mdash; Dáil Debates Vol. 325 Col. 1561 &mdash; on 17 December 1980, my policy in regard to future extension of dental services to second level pupils.</P>

The priority accorded to the project by the NorthEastern Health Board was such that it was not possible for me last year or in the current year to provide funds to permit the project to proceed having regard to the overall demands on scarce capital resource.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The daily rates of children's allowance at present in payment, rounded to the nearest penny, are 15p for the first qualified child of a family and 23p for each additional qualified child. Under the provisions of the 1981 budget these rates will increase by 33½ per cent to 20p and by 30 per cent to 30p respectively, with effect from July 1981.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland a standard rate of allowance is payable in respect of all qualified children. The daily sterling rate at present in payment is 68p per child.</P>
      <P>However, I should mention that in Northern Ireland the child tax allowance has been subsumed in the child benefit payment whereas a child tax allowance of £195 per child per annum is granted under our legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 20 November 1980 but was not qualified for payment at the time as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the necessary required minimum of 26 contributions paid since his entry into insurance. Following inquiries locally and in Northern Ireland it has been established that he has sufficient weeks of insurable employment to qualify him for benefit. Payment of all disability benefit and pay-related benefit due, less refund of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the health board, has been made to 21 March 1981. If he has remained incapable of work after that date payment will be made if he submits covering medical evidence.</P>

      <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners submitted for my approval in February 1978 draft by-laws relative to the discharging, loading, handling, storage and distribution of petroleum within the limits of their harbour.</P>
      <P>Examination of the by-laws entailed consultation with various Government Departments, as a result of which substantial amendments of the proposed by-laws were necessary. Earlier this month the harbour commissioners were asked by my Department to publish statutory notice of submission of the proposed by-laws for my approval. A period of 60 days after publication must be allowed for the submission of objections. On the expiration of this period and, subject to the consideration of any objections that may be received, I would hope to approve the by-laws without delay.</P>

    <P>With regard to the question of the prevention <Col N="377" /> of accidents, I should point out that regulations made by the Minister for Labour under the Dangerous Substances Act, in September 1979 which impose stringent requirements in regard to the loading, unloading and storage of petroleum, apply and are being enforced at Drogheda Harbour.</P>

      <P>Work never commenced on the scheme, however, and the group informed the Department recently that the scheme is being re-organised to cater for three members only.

      <P>While a provisional selection of roads which will become regional roads has been made in consultation with the local authorities, no formal designation of regional roads has yet been made. It is envisaged that the national and regional roads will broadly replace and correspond with the existing main road system, including trunk and link roads. About 500 miles of existing main roads would not be regional roads, while over 700 miles of non-main roads would become regional roads. The two categories of roads would represent about 18 per cent of the total road network. Any legislation necessary to give statutory effect to the new classification proposed will be introduced in due course.</P>
