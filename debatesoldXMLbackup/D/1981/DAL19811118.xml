      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a double week's payment in December 1981 to recipients of long-term social welfare payments.  The measure is a further earnest of the Government's commitment to those dependent on these payments. In the short time since the Government assumed office, provision has already been made for increases in all weekly social welfare payments as well as the value of the vouchers under the national and urban fuel schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for a double week's payment over and above the increase in payments in October is without precedent. Last year when a double payment was provided in December there was no provision for an October increase.  Moreover, these double payments do not arise from any obligation such as that in the second national understanding which provided for the double payment last year.  The Christmas bonus this year reflects the Government's appreciation that recipients of long-term benefits such as the elderly, chronic invalids and widows are in need of special consideration. For my own part I am well aware of the difficulties facing such persons and I hope <Col N="2263" /> that this double payment will help to make the Christmas period more comfortable for them.</P>
    <P>The categories who are being given the extra week's payment under this Bill are persons receiving old age pension, contributory and non-contributory, blind pension, widows' and orphans' pensions, contributory and non-contributory, survivor's benefit, retirement pension, invalidity pension, deserted wife's benefit and allowance, social assistance allowances for unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives and single women, and occupational injuries disablement pension and death benefit by way of pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to mention, although it is not strictly relevant to this Bill, that a double week's payment is also being provided in the case of persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, infectious disease maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children, all of which are administered by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Apart from occupational injuries benefit payments, the double payment will be made at post offices on the appropriate day of payment of pensions and allowances in the second week of December 1981.  Old age, blind, widows' and orphans' pensioners will be due payment on Friday, December 11, the other categories on Thursday, December 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sums to be paid will be equal to the face value of the weekly pension or allowance order and will include all increases in respect of adult and child dependants and any supplements which form part of the regular weekly payment.  Certain long-term recipients of occupational injuries benefit <Col N="2264" /> by way of pension are paid by cheque monthly in advance.  These will be issued with cheques for December at the equivalent of five weeks' payment instead of four.</P>
    <P>The number of payees who will benefit as a result of this Bill totals 348,000. These are made up of 195,000 old age and blind pensioners, 83,000 widows, 1,000 orphans, 33,000 retirement pensioners, 16,000 invalidity pensioners, 6,000 deserted wives, 9,000 social assistance recipients and 5,000 occupational injuries pensioners.</P>
    <P>In addition, the increase payable in respect of a further 121,000 persons will also be doubled for that week.  These are 50,000 adult dependants, 3,000 prescribed relatives and 68,000 child dependants. The overall total of persons covered by the extra payment provided for in this Bill will therefore be 469,000. When account is taken of the double payment in health allowances to which I have already referred, the total number who will benefit from the double payment will be 496,000.</P>
    <P>The cost of the additional payment is estimated at £12.5 million, comprising £7.38 million for contributory and £5.12 million for non-contributory payments. A figure of £.75 million is included in respect of the double payment in health allowances which I will be providing for by regulations.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that this Bill will commend itself to all Deputies, and I ask for its early passage so as to ensure that the additional sums will be paid in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting this Bill and I can assure the Minister that its passage through the House will not be delayed by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my privilege to set the precedent last year of providing a double week at Christmas for all these worthy beneficiaries, old age pensioners, widows and indeed various other categories on long-term benefit.  In her speech earlier and indeed also in other discussions in the House the Minister has expressed doubts about whether Fianna Fáil would have repeated that precedent set last year.  I should like to set her mind at ease.  I <Col N="2265" /> should like to place on record the fact that our pre-election programme very clearly stated our commitment to providing the double week, or bonus as it is known, for Christmas 1981.  I was very glad that the previous Government were prepared to make that commitment before the last election, something which was not done by the present Coalition. Indeed it is the Coalition's commitment which must be in doubt in relation to the present double week for Christmas.  They did not state in their programme that they would give it.  Neither was it stated in either the Fine Gael or Labour programmes.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter in the House on 5 November.  Being concerned at that stage that the time was running out and was insufficient for all the necessary administrative arrangements &mdash; I raised the matter on the Order of Business on 5 November.  It happened on that day that the Tánaiste was handling the Order of Business.  I questioned him about the intention of this Government to introduce a Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Bill for 1981.  Apart from the fact that he did not know what a Temporary Provisions Bill was &mdash; he turned to his Whip to ascertain if he happened to know what it might be and, mind you, we are talking about a time when the passage of such a Bill was very urgent &mdash; clearly he had no intention of introducing the double week nor had any preparations been made for it at Christmas.  He said that the increases had been given from 1 October last, more or less contending that that was sufficient.  Were not the Coalition giving the 1 October increases?  Indeed that sentiment is repeated in the Minister's introductory remarks this morning when she said that the October increases were being given in addition to the double week at Christmas as if this were something very special, very unusual and totally unprecedented.  Of course what she does not say is what the Minister for Finance tells us here in the House, that is that the October increases were intended only to offset the effects of the mid-summer budget.  It is an insult to the House and to the intelligence of Members on the Opposition side to suggest <Col N="2266" /> now that the 5¾ per cent introduced here &mdash; clearly stated by the Minister for Finance as constituting a partial offset, because it did no more than that &mdash; would do any more than offset the direct effects of the July budget.  That is all the October increase achieved.  It did not advance the position of the old age pensioner, widow or any other beneficiary.  As I have already pointed out the October increase led to a reduction in the real incomes of those beneficiaries.  It is very easy to see why that is so because the 85 pence per week increase to widows in October was a derisory one.  It was advanced as an increase to meet the additional costs arising from the 50 per cent increase in value-added tax, the absolutely ridiculous increase granted in ESB costs and indeed over the whole range of other costs introduced by this Government at that time as part of their package and for reasons very clearly stated.  Whether or not we agree with these reasons the fact is that the 1 October increase was introduced only as a partial offset of the costs incurred by the elderly and other social welfare, long-term beneficiaries.  It had no bearing on the double week at Christmas; its sole purpose was to offset inflationary effects.  It is now being used as a sort of public relations attempt to divert attention from the real position of people on social welfare, people whose incomes are being systematically reduced.  I shall be very interested to see whether or not that continues to be the case.  Of course the massive shift towards indirect taxation is particularly discriminatory against those people on long-term social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>To return to the Tánaiste, not alone did he refer to the increases given on 1 October but he said also that no promise had been given.  Indeed he was supported by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in making it clear that the Coalition had not promised and therefore did not have to live up to any promise.  Certainly we did promise and would have lived up to that promise to repeat this double week at Christmas.  I would refer Deputies to the Official Report of Thursday 5 November 1981 in which that little scenario can be clearly seen.  I think it has <Col N="2267" /> been recorded clearly outside the House also.  Indeed I should like to offer my congratulations to the press reporter who, following the discussions in the House that morning, went of his or her own volition, contacted the Department of Social Welfare and reported that evening that the Department had confirmed that no arrangements had been made to date, that in effect clearly there was no intention on the part of the Government to proceed with the provision of a double week at Christmas.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves: Why did the Coalition not want to give a double week at Christmas?  In all the circumstances we must recognise that rarely has there been a more difficult period for the elderly and those on long-term benefits than the present one, especially bearing in mind this massive shift to indirect taxation.  Now that all the public relations are over, now that the package has been sold &mdash; and I congratulate the Minister on so doing &mdash; the record of the House will show and that will be the record which will stand. When that has blown over we shall revert to the essence, the real integrity of this Government.  Certainly I would question it in relation to their position on this double week at Christmas.  Why did they not want to give this double week at Christmas?  There is a very simple answer.  I know the Minister to be a very sympathetic and understanding person. I know her to be concerned and I would have not doubt about her approach in this respect.  The reason the Coalition did not want to pay the double week at Christmas was purely a matter of cost.</P>
    <P>We are being lectured repeatedly in this House by the Minister for Finance about the cost of anything and everything. He does so daily, continuing the process started by this Government the moment they assumed office, when they began these lectures claiming then to have had great knowledge of the country's finances.  Indeed the Minister for Finance in the House yesterday, when taunted by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party about his approach in this respect, became particularly upset and obviously concerned about the cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> I have here the social welfare figures because we have had the Estimate but I do not have those for health.  Last year the double week cost approximately £.5 million.  I presume here it is about £.8 million or thereabouts on the Health side.  It does not show but it is given in the £12.5 million the Minister mentioned this morning.  If we deduct from the figures given we find the double Christmas week on the social welfare side will cost £11.678 million.  The first October increase cost £9.6 million.  Straight away we see that the October increase of £9.6 million was £2 million lower than the double week at Christmas.  That is simple mathematics.  Now I sat on that side of the House and I know the arguments put by those who want to save pennies at the expense of the elderly, the infirm and widows.  That is the reality but that will not appear in the PR because this is something that goes on behind closed doors between the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare.  Not only will there be a saving of £2 million but it is a very clever approach in the sense that this £9.6 million thrown to the Labour Party as part of the Gaiety Theatre document represents yet another sprat thrown to catch a salmon and accepted at the time because no one had done his figures.  A widow would get 85p a week on the first of October increase and a child 25p per week.</P>
    <P>Had the Labour Party considered the implications I am sure they would not have accepted that kind of sop but, relative to the deal made in the shift to indirect taxation, that is the reality of the situation.  I was surprised at the Minister for Finance being so indignant and annoyed yesterday because he got good value from the 1 October increase.  It was just a plank in the agreement and nothing more.  It was designed to sell the package to the Labour Party and subsequently to some of the Independent Deputies.  That was its purpose.  It was designed partly to offset the increased costs.  It had nothing to do with the budget and to use it as something supplementary to the double week at Christmas is quite wrong.  It simply is not true.  I want to make that quite clear.  I do not accept it and I am sure the <Col N="2269" /> beneficiaries will not accept it.  It was a confidence trick and it did not work.  The Coalition were caught on the hop and now they have to pay the double amount. The total is £12.5 million.</P>
    <P>We will have the 1 October increase when the Estimate comes in later this week but we can take it it is £9.6 million, about another £10 million to £10.5 million so the difference is £2 million in both cases.  The saving to the Government would have been £2 million.  Now they have to pay both.  They tried to use the lower 1 October increase, which was a partial offset only for the Minister for Finance's budget, a savage budget affecting those on long-term benefits.  I mentioned the £12.5 million because I saw in some paper a reference to £25 million, part of the PR again relative to the extra week.  I warn people to watch what is being done.  This increase is being used to suggest they are getting a double week. The double week is £12.5 million.  That is the real figure.  The beneficiaries will get the normal week as well and that constitutes another £12.5 million.</P>
    <P>I come back to two proposals in particular in this Bill.  Last year when I introduced this we discussed certain categories it was thought should be included.  I am very pleased to see the domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children has been included in this measure.  It was included last year also though it was not regarded technically as being strictly within the definitions.  Had the present Government been looking at this in the proper way instead of rushing something through at the end of the day they would have put forward suggestions for further improvements in order to cover categories other than those covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate I raised the question of including those on unemployment assistance where these unfortunate people have been on this assistance for over a year.  The Minister would have the figures available.  The total unemployment assistance at the moment is £2.2 million per week and if you take that over a year you obviously reduce the figure considerably.  Concern was voiced last year by those on the Government side of <Col N="2270" /> the House now about the non-inclusion of those on unemployment assistance. These were people who had gone through unemployment benefit and been out of work therefore for some considerable time.  I accepted then there was some validity in the argument and I would have hoped that that aspect would have been pursued and examined in considerable detail this year to the extent of making some improvement in the worst cases. There are cases of real poverty among those on unemployment assistance and this is due mostly to the situation throughout the world in relation to unemployment. I do not throw this out to embarrass the Minister.  It is something which should have been examined carefully to see at least what element of that list could have been included.  It would at least suggest at first sight that those who are over a year on unemployment assistance should have been considered.</P>
    <P>Since the whole Bill was agreed to at fairly short notice, I would like to suggest that the Minister should double the weekly pocket money allowance this Christmas for the physicially and mentally handicapped in residential care.  We increased that at the beginning of the year from between £1.50 and £2 to £4 per week overall as a contribution towards the Year of the Disabled.  It should have been included last year but it was not, perhaps because it was not a very rational thing at that time.  In many cases people did not get it at all.  We looked into it and at the beginning of this year we got it under way in a rational way.  Now I hear Members on the other side of the House saying that this is a very mean amount. Yet I had to get this money from the Minister for Finance of the day who had his problems just as the present Minister for Finance has.  Under the circumstances we achieved a considerable advance.  It would not cost very much to double that for Christmas.  As I said, we managed to get in the domiciliary care allowance the last time.  That is the other side of the domiciliary allowance, the small allowance that goes to people who are in full-time residential care.  These are normally the most severely physically and mentally <Col N="2271" /> handicapped.  The Taoiseach has expressed enormous concern in public and in this House for the disabled.  Therefore, I am convinced that, if the Minister sent a message to the Taoiseach, the small amount of money involved would be forthcoming without question.  It will come up under the health side and there will be an opportunity to ensure that it could be done.  I estimate that it would probably cost about £50,000, which is relatively small.  For a very small cost a fine piece of additional kindness could be shown these people this Christmas.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal during the Estimates debate and in Private Member's Time about the general commitment of the Government to action in the area of social welfare.  The Government say they are committed to combating poverty and so on.  It is easy to have the best intentions and goodwill towards people.  But goodwill is not enough.  It is not just a question of goodwill.  Of course, with goodwill we can all live more happily together.  But it is also a question of hard cash.  That is the criterion on which we will judge this Government and not the oft-repeated statements about their commitment to the poor and the lower income groups.  They will be judged on the rates of benefit which are given.  These are relevant questions.  It is very easy to say one supports the elderly and the various other people on these benefits, but it is another thing to put on the table the hard cash that is required. As the Minister stated the other day, the cost of social welfare benefits for a full year at present rates would be about £1,320 million.  On can see straight away that this is a very substantial figure.  Any real increase in that will certainly have to be hard fought for because it has to be paid for by direct or indirect taxation or by an increase in the pay-related social insurance and these are not very happy options for the Minister.  They are options which will be opposed.  That is why I say that the real test of this Government in relation to their work on poverty in particular will be in relation to the amounts of money which they transfer in <Col N="2272" /> real terms to the beneficiaries within the whole social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a very limited view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is a very important view.  The old age pensioner will tell the Deputy to give him the money in his pocket and then he will be able to have views of all sorts.  If he does not have the money in his pocket he has very little real purchasing power.  Over the last two years the position of the old age pensioner was significantly improved in real terms.  I am sure they would confirm that for the Deputy.  In parallel with that there is the whole task of improving the community structure and the delivery of services to people.  I do not deny that for a moment.  I revamped the National Social Services Council, set up a board and gave it a new director status and raised it to the level of a stronger semi-State body. I also did this with the National Rehabilitation Board.  That took negotiation and I had to break through and create new posts in these areas.  These are the organisations which can really effect change within society of the kind which I suspect the Deputy is referring to.  For that same purpose I also set up the National Council for the Aged, headed by one of the most capable men in this country who will put tremendous management ability into the development of those services and the direction of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have the opportunity here to discuss all those elements.  We would be here for quite some time if we did.  I would accept the view that community development in particular is vital to the long-term interests of these groups within the community.  But in the short term the levels of payment here are so low and have been so low that only real increases can bring them to the position where they can benefit in any realistic way from the society which is around them.  In that sense I would agree with the parallel developments which I presume the Deputy is referring to.  But these improvements will only come from real shifts in money.  I know that is a real headache for the Minister and the Government <Col N="2273" /> at this time because of the costs involved.  That is the realism of today. We had to face it last year when we knew we were in a depression and were faced with an economic downturn and people were standing back from these services and saying that one had to bear in mind what resources would be available and what was possible in the present circumstances. Notwithstanding that, we showed a real commitment and I am proud that the previous Government made that commitment in hard cash terms.  That has yet to be shown by the present Government.</P>
    <P>This will be a very difficult Christmas for a variety of reasons.  Unemployment is running at a record level, the shift to indirect taxation is making costs considerably higher and we are only now beginning to see the real impact of increased ESB charges.  A record number of people will be turning to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for help to meet their bills.  I warned about this in July when the Minister for Finance made a rash and unconsidered judgment by allowing an 80 per cent increase in the fuel variation surcharge.  How could any Minister or Deputy on the other side of the House justify an 80 per cent increase when the input costs of oil have stabilised on the international market?  It cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I note that the categories in the Bill are the same as last year.  It has a simpler layout and this arises from the fact that at the beginning of the year we had the passage through this House of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981. There is only one Act referred to, and I would like to thank the Members on both sides of the House who contributed to the debate on the Consolidation Bill and to the officials, for whom it meant a tremendous volume of work.  The next task is to update some of the provisions within the legislation.  This is a process which should be continued.  The Consolidation Bill was a massive leap forward because of the time and work it took on the part of officials.  The way is clear now for a continuation of the process of modernising legislation on social welfare.  I hope the Minister will consider building in permanently <Col N="2274" /> this double week at Christmas. It is a precedent which was introduced and is now there for the second time.  I am sure we would all like to see it continued in future years.</P>
    <P>Although not strictly relevant to the Bill, the Minister said the double week is also being paid in respect of disabled persons' maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and the domiciliary care allowance.  These are administered by the Department of Health and I thank the Minister for confirming they will also be paid.  Would the Minister also consider, as a matter of considerable urgency, giving a double week's pocket money, the special £4 per week allowance, to those who are physically and mentally handicapped?  It would not be an expensive measure and is well within the capacity of the Government's current finances.  Would the Minister also consider &mdash; I appreciate this is a much bigger question &mdash; the question of those on unemployment assistance and whether any of those categories could be included?</P>
    <P>I am very glad to have the Bill before the House.  I know the Minister also welcomes it.  It is very necessary at Christmas because of the high costs that are incurred.  It spread real joy last Christmas and Members on both sides of the House were happy to see a double week being paid.  Those now in Government welcomed the introduction of that measure last year.  The money was badly needed by the people who received it.  Some of us have an opportunity of earning a bonus at Christmas and it is nice to think that the elderly got that little extra last year. It made things a little bit easier for them at that time.  I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill and I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which provides a double week's payment for long term social welfare recipients at Christmas.  Listening to Deputy Woods, I came to the conclusion that what he said is an indictment of the policies of his own Government over recent years, which have put us in such a dire financial <Col N="2275" /> position that we have difficulty in even meeting these very basic social welfare payments at times like this.  If the country had been run in a proper, businesslike manner we could afford to give the poor and the underprivileged far more than they are getting at present.  Even the very basic increases are difficult to grant nowadays because of the dreadful shortfall in the Estimates which were presented to this House earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>Those Estimates included social welfare and health.  As a result, every health board are financially embarrassed, unable to provide staff, equipment or heating for people in very poor circumstances and invariably in poor health. The present unhappy position can easily be traced back to the financial mismanagement which the country has endured for four years.  This was highlighted two weeks ago by Sister Stanislaus at a seminar in Kilkenny.  She told the audience quite clearly that there are now one million people in this country who are underprivileged and suffering from varying degrees of poverty.  Sister Stanislaus and her associates are to be complimented for pin-pointing that sad situation which has been allowed to develop over a number of years and which is a reflection on us all.</P>
      <P>We are becoming a nation of two societies &mdash; the rich and the very poor.  The gap between the two sectors continues to grow.  We must be very careful because that situation could undermine the very basis of our society.  We are a country with a population of slightly over three million and if one million of these are seriously underprivileged, there is cause for considerable concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are told that the beneficiaries in various categories will total 348,000.  I do not know if that number includes dependants, but I presume it does not.  The total number of underprivileged is obviously far in excess of 348,000.  Some people are not included under the terms of this Bill who, if included, would greatly swell that number. For instance, Deputy Woods has mentioned people on long-term unemployment assistance, many of whom are <Col N="2276" /> on the breadline, living in poverty.  There is a case for including these people.</P>
    <P>Last week at Question Time I brought to the notice of the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare another class of social welfare recipient who is not covered by this Bill who might be borne in mind for inclusion.  I am speaking about the long-term disability benefit recipients.  There is a very fine line between a person who qualifies for an invalidity pension and one who qualifies for long-term disability benefit. Almost invariably, when I bring to the notice of the south-eastern region health authorities the problems of a long-term disability benefit recipient, they convert that benefit to an invalidity pension. There is, of course, allowance made in this Bill for invalidity pensioners.  There is no provision for long-term disability benefit recipients who usually are men or women in the late fifties or sixties, who have worked hard for 30 or 40 years and fallen into bad health.  This type of recipient gets a monthly rather than a weekly certificate because his or her doctor knows that there is only the very slightest likelihood that this person will ever work again.  Probably the more correct thing would be to place this patient on an invalidity pension.  Would the Minister consider including those long-term disability benefit recipients of a year or more in this scheme this Christmas?  I have written to her Department regarding a few individual cases and had a few cases last year along the same lines.  Thousands of people in this position around the country are just as necessitous as any of the categories included in the Bill.  To long-term unemployment benefit cases, also, as well as unemployment assistance cases, this scheme would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>We must remember, first and foremost, that we are giving with one hand but nowadays are taking away with the other, where many of these people are concerned.  It has been stated that many of these 348,000 are being asked to pay very heavy financial items which did not arise previously, and for which in many cases, no allowance is being given.  I refer to water rate charges.  Five or ten years ago, in rural areas, the pensioner might <Col N="2277" /> have had to pay 50p a year water rate charge.  Today he must pay £24 in my county and £30 in others.  That is a very large amount for an old age pensioner, contributory or non-contributory, to pay at one go.  The saving under this Bill for an individual pensioner ranges from about £25 to £35 per head, in my estimation, because of this new water rate charge.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are supposed to alleviate cases of hardship and in some cases they do.  However, the local authorities are virtually screwed into the ground financially to such an extent that they must narrow the basis of that relief scheme and many thousands who previously qualified for relief no longer do so.</P>
    <P>The health boards mentioned in this Bill are likewise in extreme financial difficulty. Those of us who are members of a health board know that there has been a shortfall of millions of pounds in each health board area for 1981.  Nobody should known that better than Deputy Woods, because it was his Government who are responsible for that.  The result of this disgraceful shortfall is that health boards have had to make economies in every area, in some of which the money is most badly needed to alleviate the hardships of the very poor.  I specifically refer to the free fuel scheme, the concept of which was excellent and which worked quite well last year.  What do we find this year?  The health boards have not the money and many people who received the benefit of this scheme last year have been told this year that they cannot get it.  The sum last year was £60.  That is more than double the relief provided under this Bill.  If I made a survey I would find that hundreds of my constituents have been cut off from this scheme in 1981 who were in it in 1980.  That is a double hardship because the present relief does not even half offset their loss. Again, the base of that scheme is becoming more and more narrow.</P>
    <P>These people are the very ones who need free fuel.  There is no turf bog in my constituency.  As I have said here before, many schoolchildren there would not know what a sod of turf looked like. Occasionally we got some turf from Littleton <Col N="2278" /> in Tipperary.  Since timber is only of use to those who are able-bodied and have the means of preparing it, the only logical alternative is coal but that is costing more than £100 per ton.  The people I am talking about cannot afford that sort of money.  Many of them are suffering from severe arthritis.  They are old and should have constant heat.  Instead of helping them in this regard the position this year is that they are not being allowed something for which they were eligible previously.  I urge the Minister to take an overall view of the situation and to consider the situation in terms of what we might call the satellites who are supposed to serve the needs of so many of our population.  I refer to the local authorities in terms of the water rates and to the health boards in terms of free fuel and in this instance in terms of the double week's payment to social welfare recipients. This provision does not cover those cases in which benefit has been withdrawn and that is why the payment should be made to long-term social welfare recipients, to the long-term disability benefit recipients who should really be in receipt of invalidity pensions.  Consideration should be given also to the case of long-term unemployment assistance recipients in areas where employment is not available.</P>
    <P>This week I have furnished the Minister's office with details of two cases of long-term disability recipients.  In each case a husband, wife and two children are living on £55.10 per week.  Recently Sister Stanislaus said that she throws her arms up in dismay when she reads about someone in the social circle complaining that he cannot get a decent dinner for two for £40.  We are talking about a family of four living on £55.10 per week but not entitled to free fuel.  In each of the cases to which I refer the South-Eastern Health Board have refused to grant the free fuel allowance.  This is a disgrace.  Both families are living in the urban area of Dungarvan but if they were living in a rural area they would not be entitled even to relief from water rates demands.  They are not entitled to the double payment at Christmas.  I hope that at a further Stage of this Bill the Minister will give some <Col N="2279" /> hope to those people who are in dire need by providing that they will not be disqualified from the extra payment as a result of red tape or of severe cutbacks in finances to the local authorities and to the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Deputy Deasy has said concerning the double week's payment for long-term disabled benefit recipients.  Many of those people would be entitled to invalidity pensions but qualification is not automatic.  They must go through the normal process of application.  Many of them are not aware of this and, consequently, are being deprived of this extra benefit at Christmas. I agree with Deputy Deasy that at a further Stage of this Bill, the Minister should consider introducing an amendment to alleviate this situation.</P>
      <P>So far as the allowances generally are concerned, I compliment our spokesman, Deputy Woods, for highlighting the situation in the past fortnight.  Old age pensioners and the various other social welfare recipients can be thankful to an active Opposition who have been responsible for ensuring that this double payment will be made at Christmas.  This is something that the Department are not likely to inform those concerned of but the public, thanks to the media's attention in this area, are aware that if it had not been for the Fianna Fáil spokesman raising the matter, the double week's payment would not be made.  The Government had not made any arrangements to grant the extra money but when the question was raised here they agreed to consider it.</P>
      <P>However, I would go further and suggest that the double payment be retained throughout the year because social welfare payments are not at all adequate in the context of the cost of living.  The people concerned, especially those on long-term social welfare, are on the bread line.  They cannot cope with the massive increases in the prices of the various commodities and services such as ESB and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to long-term patients in welfare homes and psychiatric <Col N="2280" /> hospitals.  There is no reason for those people not to be paid the extra money direct at Christmas.  I would go even further than Deputy Woods's proposal and suggest that the full double week's payment go directly to those patients.  I say this because what happens in this regard is that the double week goes directly into the coffers of the health boards.  That is not right.  There is no reference in the Bill to the question of repayment directly to the Department of Health.  How much money will be paid back directly to the health boards and to the Department as a result of this double week's payment? As a working constituency Deputy the Minister will be aware that in these cases the books are held by the matron, that the payments are put into the accounts of the welfare homes or psychiatric hospitals concerned.  An allowance of £1.50 used to be made to the individual but that paltry sum was a sheer injustice.  We increased the amount and recently I asked the Minister to consider bringing it up to £10.  The Minister said she would consider the matter.  However, in the case we are talking of, the institutions concerned will benefit from the Minister's provision though I am sure that is not the intention of the Minister.  Therefore, this Christmas long-term patients in these institutions will receive the normal payment of £4.  What could one buy with such a small amount?  Would it buy even a gift for a grandchild or an extra drink at Christmas?  It would hardly cover the cost of two brandies.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for the Minister to give a clear directive to the health boards to double the allowance, at a minimum, and possibly go beyond that by giving the double week's payment directly to long-term patients in welfare homes and psychiatric hospitals.  I appeal to relatives and neighbours of long-term patients in these institutions to visit them at Christmas and I would ask the Minister to direct all health boards to allow the public to visit patients in psychiatric hospitals. I tried on many occasions to visit St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe and St. Patrick's Hospital in Castlerea but I was refused the privilege of seeing my constituents.  Many of them do not vote <Col N="2281" /> but that does not mean that I do not represent them in this House.  I was categorically refused this permission by the CEO of the Western Health Board. Deputy Woods was well aware of this matter but the Department were not in a position to direct the CEO to allow me to visit these psychiatric hospitals.  I have always been welcome to visit the welfare homes and I appeal to the Minister to allow an open day in the psychiatric hospitals during the Christmas period.  Many of the patients have not received a visit or a letter for 40 years, although perhaps they would not want to see their TD.  My purpose was not to expose the deprivation of the patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases are very welcome but I am concerned about those who have been omitted from the scope of this Bill, namely, those on unemployment benefit and assistance.  Surely these people should be given a double allowance at Christmas.  As a parent, the Minister is well aware of the many costs incurred at this time of year and how parents feel pressurised by television advertisements and displays of toys in supermarkets.  How can the unemployed make Christmas happier for their children? How can they tell them that they cannot have gifts?  In the debate on the 1980 Bill many Deputies now on the Government side made this point but they have somehow ceased to fight for the people they represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Labour benches are so empty today.  One of their best socialists now occupies the Chair and he had to leave them.  Can they claim that they <Col N="2282" /> are happy with these increases, knowing that they have been forced on the Government by the Opposition?  Where was the call from the Labour Party for these increases?  They were silenced on this issue, as on many others.  I hope some of their socialist Deputies will speak on the Bill and say whether they are satisfied with it.  Where are Deputies Browne, Kemmy, Sherlock and Loftus?  Deputy Kemmy, as joint Taoiseach, could direct the Minister to give the double payment to those on unemployment benefit and assistance, particularly in his constituency of Limerick where there are quite a number of unemployed.  Surely he should fight for the many deprived people who elected him to this House, although they may not return him next time.</P>
    <P>Many deserving people are not in receipt of the free electricity allowance. This scheme was introduced by Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Finance and the late Deputy Joe Brennan, then Minister for Social Welfare.  It has been most beneficial and very few other countries have such a scheme.  I would ask the Minister to increase the number of units allowed, especially during the winter months, and to extend the scheme to widows.  They should have a tremendous champion in the Minister who is herself a widow and I hope she will ensure the extension of this scheme in the next Budget.  A married couple in receipt of the old age pension will benefit twice from this double payment but this will not apply to the household of a widow who may have young children.  She should be given as much assistance as possible.</P>
    <P>We have had savage increases since last July.  One of the worst is the increase in postal charges.  The elderly love to send Christmas cards to their families in different parts of Ireland and throughout the world.  A case could be made for giving a postal allowance to the elderly at Christmas.  The cost of stamps should be reduced for them.  I know this would be difficult to operate, but something should be done about it.  When one thinks of a stamp costing 22p one realises it is very difficult for the elderly to send letters and postcards to their friends and relations <Col N="2283" /> throughout the country at Christmas-time, not to talk about the cost of sending them to their relations throughout the world.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government the allowances to social welfare recipients were increased by 25 per cent.  This was a tremendous increase and was badly needed.  We only have to compare that with the 3 per cent increase given in October.  We have been told that this extra money given to those people at Christmas will compensate them for the increased price of goods.  Deputy Woods has explained the position in this regard.</P>
    <P>The elderly are allowed a free television licence for black and white sets.  I have been advocating for some time that that allowance should be given for coloured sets as well as for black and white sets.  Those people have to pay the difference between the cost of a black and white licence and that of a colour television licence.  Black and white television sets are almost obsolete and this allowance should be extended to colour television sets.  This would save a lot of red tape in relation to the administration of the scheme.  The elderly feel they have a free television licence and are not aware that they have to pay the difference between the cost of a licence for a black and white set and that for a colour set. Something should be done about extending that in next year's budget.  The cost would not be very great.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for bringing forward this provision.  I know she has probably fought very hard in this particular Scrooge Cabinet we have at the moment.  The Minister for Finance will probably be regarded as the modern day Scrooge.  It must have been very hard for the Minister to get something out of Scrooge this Christmas.  I know the Minister has a very hard fight on her hands when one considers the right wing policies of the present administration.  I am sure she got some support from her socialist colleagues in the Cabinet. Fianna Fáil must also be complimented for putting the pressure on the Minister. I am sure she welcomed the pressure which Deputy Woods put on her some <Col N="2284" /> weeks ago so that she could go to the Cabinet and make the case for the double payment this year.  I hope she will do everything in her power to ensure that the increases are extended to people receiving disability allowances and those receiving unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very amusing to hear some of the remarks from the other side of the House this morning.  Deputy Leyden is long enough in the House to know that when a back bench Government Deputy wants to get across a point to the Minister he does not have to expose it in the House.  I do not remember Deputy Leyden contributing to the debate last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  That is the first inaccuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  I am glad the Deputy contributed to the debate.  It might be interesting to read his contribution. It is grossly unfair of the Deputy to be so critical of Government backbenchers for not showing their concern in the House for this payment.  I am sure that if any backbencher on the Government side did that in the House Deputy Leyden and his colleagues would be very quick to say: &ldquo;Are you not friendly with your Minister?  Do you have to bring it into the House?&rdquo; I am quite sure when he was concerned about something when his party were in power he did not show the concern in the House.  There are other means of doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer my heartiest congratulations to the Minister for Social Welfare for ensuring that this payment is made.  I regret that the Minister cannot extend this payment to others this year.  I look forward to future years when this can be done. There was no real obligation on the Government to introduce this Bill for a double payment such as there was on the previous Minister for Social Welfare, despite all the claims that have been made this morning.  I do not believe the previous Minister for Social Welfare would have had to resign if the Bill granting the double payment was not introduced <Col N="2285" /> last year because it had already been provided for in the National Understanding. The Government were already committed to it, so no thanks are due to the previous Government for introducing it last year.  This was introduced last year for the first time and it is being introduced this year without any such commitment. This really shows the social concern of the Government.</P>
    <P>I could go back over a lot of things which the previous Minister for Social Welfare said and turn it right back on him.  The difficulties the Government find themselves in now are because we had a Fianna Fáil Government for the previous four years and because the present Fianna Fáil spokesman on social welfare was the previous Minister for Social Welfare for some time before the change of Government.  The man who was the former Taoiseach was Minister for Social Welfare before that.  Deputy Woods and Deputy Haughey cannot afford to be critical of the present Minister for Social Welfare.  The Government are paying the social welfare cheques in the week in which they are due.  That is a great step forward compared to the last two years when Deputy Woods was the Minister responsible for that Department.  However, I cannot put all the blame on the former Minister because his predecessor, for whatever reason, neglected the Department of Social Welfare and gave much more attention to the Department of Health.  Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods were dab hands at public relations.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Woods this morning telling us why there was an increase in social welfare payments in October. According to him, it was done to sell something to the Labour Party and because of that increase a public relations package was presented in the past two or three weeks.  I did not understand what Deputy Woods was getting at, but in my time in the House I have not known any Minister who was better at public relations than Deputy Woods. I am not blaming him.  He had a job to do and he had difficulty in doing it, but <Col N="2286" /> he was able to hide much of that difficulty through his public relations exercise.</P>
    <P>I give my heartiest congratulations to the Minister, Deputy E. Desmond.  It gives me great happiness to think that some 83,000 widows will have a happier Christmas principally because Deputy Desmond is Minister and also because we have a social, caring Government.  There are 1,000 orphans, there are 33,000 retired pensioners as well as others on whom this Government are prepared to expend money.  This Christmas the Government will spend £12,500,000 to ensure that the less well off will have a happier Christmas.  These people have to watch the pounds and pennies but the Government have gone a long way this year to ensure that they will have a happier time. I hope in future years the Minister will be able to extend this payment to other categories to whom it is not possible to extend it on this occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle came into the House I referred to Deputy Leyden's contribution and I queried if he had spoken last year.  When he said he did, I accepted that and I am sure it is on the record.  I do not see his intervention now as a point <Col N="2287" /> of order.  I hope he is not setting a precedent whereby I can seek a right to speak a second time in this debate.</P>
      <P>I remember many references of the former Minister and his predecessor to the social, caring Government we had when Fianna Fáil were in office.  That same caring Government found it extremely difficult in the past three years to pay social welfare recipients.  They saved many thousands of pounds in that many of the cheques arrived six or eight weeks later than the due date.  Despite the public relations efforts of Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare, Fianna Fáil should be ashamed of their efforts in this area.  They left this Government with the enormous task of providing £12,500,000 to help needy people.  Our Government were not obliged to expend this money but because they are a social, caring Government they decided to provide it for the less well off in our society.</P>
      <P>There was more widespread and greater poverty in this country when Deputy Woods left office than there was when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1977.  The task of providing a double weeks' allowance for those in need is greater this year than it was last year when Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare.  I do not put all the blame on him but his party must accept the responsibility.  He just happens to be the person who took over a neglected Department.</P>
      <P>I hope when the Minister leaves office in a few years' time that same statement will not be made about her.  I know of her concern and that of the Government to combat poverty.  Must I remind Deputies on the opposite side of the House of Fianna Fáil's efforts to combat poverty? They abolished the committee concerned when it got to the stage that it would cost them money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Woods has any doubt about the matter, I ask him to compare Fianna Fáil's record on social welfare with that of the National Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977.  The present Government have not yet got into full stride mainly because they found an empty <Col N="2288" /> purse when they took office.  Let him compare the record of social welfare increases from 1973 to 1977 when for the first time those who most needed it were given a respectable allowance in the budgets of 1974 and 1975.  I share Deputy Wood's concern for those on unemployment assistance.  I ask the Minister to consider this category when this comes before the House next year.  I have the greatest sympathy for families where the main bread winner is unemployed for over 12 months.  I spoke to one person yesterday who is keen to get work but unfortunately over the last 14 months has only got 14 weeks' work.  I regret that it is not possible to give this double payment to such people this year but hopefully they will be included next year and perhaps we may be able to extend it to other categories.</P>
    <P>I spoke last week on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs about a reduction in the cost of postage for Christmas cards. Deputy Leyden mentioned this but saw some difficulty in it.  I ask the Minister to consider the case of people who are in homes or living alone and are recipients of social welfare payments.  I am sure she could devise a system where they could be issued with franked envelopes.  Many of these people only communicate once a year with friends of their own age.  Their friends may be in different homes from the ones they are in.  Even if they are in the same home there is something about receiving good wishes by post rather than by hand as many people are doing.  I support Deputy Leyden in what he said in this regard and ask the Minister to consider issuing franked envelopes.  It will not involve extra work for postmen because every house and home is visited over Christmas time.  It would be a nice gesture.  It may be too late to organise it for this year but it should be possible to issue half a dozen or a dozen franked envelopes to some of the categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have a Government who were prepared to introduce this without being forced to do so by people inside or outside the House.  It probably gives Deputy Woods pleasure to try and claim <Col N="2289" /> responsibility for the introduction of this measure.  If that is what he wants let him have it.  There was no obligation on the Government to do it.  I am glad they did, as it is an indication that we have a caring Government prepared to assist the less well off without any great arm twisting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers I welcome this Bill irrespective of how inadequate it may be.  I share Deputy McMahon's view that it leaves out a lot of categories in spite of what he may feel.  This measure has come as a complete turnabout by the Government who only a few weeks ago indicated through an official statement that there were no plans in the pipeline to introduce any measure to make a double weeks payment to social welfare recipients. Therefore it can be seen that the turnabout, welcome as it is, was due to pressure exerted by Fianna Fáil both inside and outside the House.  Nobody wishes to be smallminded about a measure such as this in claiming credit but the record should be put straight and I am certain if Deputy McMahon reflects back he will agree with what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Taoiseach indicated that we would all have to face a 10 per cent drop in our standard of living.  Events unfortunately not only underline that but would indicate that we are facing a greater percentage drop in living standards. While such a reduction affects us all, it hits the less well-off more so.  We are all aware of the difficulties of old age pensioners, widows, the unemployed and so on in meeting the present cost of living and making ends meet from one week to the next.  They are faced, as we all are, with daily increases in prices whether for foodstuffs or clothing &mdash; the main essentials of everyday life.  They are faced with the same difficulties as anybody else but they are less well able to cope with the problems of over-coming these difficulties. Inflation at present officially is running at 22 per cent, therefore how can one relate the present rate of inflation to the recent miserable increase extended to social welfare recipients?  The 3 per cent increase, even 5p a week in many cases, was a mere pittance which, rather <Col N="2290" /> than helping those people, I suggest damaged their morale very considerably.  It was an open insult to old people and those on welfare benefits, people whom we should all be striving to help as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The recent budget proposals are not part and parcel of this Bill, therefore, it is not my intention to delve into them. Nevertheless, the proposals have affected prices and, as a result, the people concerned and involved under this Bill. For example, VAT was doubled and this is affecting the ordinary, everyday essential services which old and needy people have to purchase as do any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>The recent policies of the Government and their price increases, VAT increases and so on have caused serious disturbance to those less well off and also to the unemployed.  We hear quite a lot nowadays about so many thousands being on the poverty line in the last few months. Many more thousands have been brought not merely closer to the poverty line but right on to it since the Government introduced their measures last July.  The previous speaker spoke of social commitment and the special social concern of the Government in looking after the less well off section.  It is all very well to talk about what one would like to do, but action is what counts.  We all know that actions speak louder than words.  There is no doubt whatever that the Fianna Fáil Government did more in the last few years for social welfare recipients than did any other Government in the history of this State.  In successive years we have had increases of 25 per cent and again one must compare this with the paltry increases extended in recent times by the Coalition Government.  Very little more need be said if one wishes to compare the social conscience of the present Government with that of the former Government.</P>
    <P>As I have said, action counts.  We know what actions were taken by the previous Government and we know also the miserable action that has been taken so far by the present Government.  I am not being personally critical of the present Minister, whom, incidentally, I would like to <Col N="2291" /> congratulate on her appointment.  We all realise that the Minister also has her difficulties in dealing with the Minister for Finance who was hell bent on pursuing a policy that must and undoubtedly will bring the living standards of every section of this community crashing to the ground, none more so than that of the social welfare recipients, the less well off and those not able to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the present Bill does not extend to the long-term unemployed people.  The number of people unemployed at present is a record in the history of this State and, unfortunately, that number is growing daily.  Too many people have been unemployed here for a long time.  Many among those numbers would give anything to have a job.  They are genuinely anxious to work and are sincerely seeking employment.  Many of them are men who have wives and children and homes to keep and they have to educate, clothe and feed their children. Consider a person who has been unemployed for a year-and-a-half and who has a wife, three children and a home, as I have mentioned, to keep on £50 per week when all the fringe benefits have run out. That person undoubtedly is in the poverty category and no-one will disagree with that statement.  Therefore, it is sad that this Bill does not provide for that category.  I am quite certain that nobody, least of all the taxpayer, would have objected to an additional amount of money being included in this measure to cover what would be accepted readily as a much-needed gesture on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Christmas is the season of goodwill and cheer.  Everybody tries to make the very best possible feast of Christmas irrespective of means.  We will, of course, witness many expensive parties at Christmas-time, cocktail parties and so on.  We will witness increased expenditure on alcohol during Christmas.  At present £1.5 million is spent daily on alcohol in this small country.  I am not by any means an anti-drinker, far from it.  Nevertheless I feel that in this area there is a tremendous amount of irresponsibility on the part of many of our people, particularly our <Col N="2292" /> young people, when it comes to spending money on alcohol.  Unfortunately, Christmas will bring a number of tragedies such as road accidents, etc.  On the other hand those poverty-stricken families whom I have described, those poor people, the unemployed, will be trying to make the best possible of Christmas for their families on a miserable £50 per week.  If those people who are lavishily spending so much on alcohol and everything else were to think for one moment of the circumstances of such families I am quite sure that they would have no objection to any Government raising finance to cater for those families, particularly at Christmas.  That lead must come from the Government.  That lead must be given by the Minister responsible for social welfare. Whilst perhaps it is a bit late in the day to extend the Bill to cover such families I would like to think that the Minister will give some commitment that a much more widely based Bill will be considered and introduced in future years.  It is not good enough that because it is Christmas, the time of goodwill, the time of good cheer, we should perhaps satisfy a personal charitable ego by throwing a crust to the less well-off.  A defined programme which will improve the living standards of those who are not very fortunate is called for and we must try to ensure a more realistic and stable future for them.</P>
    <P>We all hope the need for social welfare benefit will decrease because of economic development, more jobs, and so on, but we must face the stark and harsh reality that there will always be a percentage of the population who are unable to look after themselves or take up work, even if it were available.  We will always have the disabled, the sick and people who are physically incapable of working and we must provide a better future for them.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is well meaning and dedicated to the position she occupies and I am realistic enough to accept that she will do everything in her power to help these people, but at the Cabinet table she might find herself in the minority and find it very difficult to deal with a Taoiseach and a Minister for Finance who are pursuing monetarist policies <Col N="2293" /> which have failed miserably in other countries.</P>
    <P>In the past the Labour Party claimed to be the champions of the poor and the less well off.  The Minister is a member of that party and she must find it disappointing that there have not been any Labour contributions to this debate.  The absence of Labour Party Members since this Dáil commenced has been very obvious.  Maybe there is not a specific reason for this, but it has been commented on by the media.  One could be forgiven for thinking it could be due to difficulties within the Government and within the Labour Party itself.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to free Christmas postage for old age pensioners and social welfare receipients.  Some measure should be introduced in this Bill to help these people.  It should not be too difficult to administer.  The previous speaker mentioned six franked envelopes being provided with each pension book. This figure could be extended.  Some facilities should be extended to old age pensioners, perhaps they could send telegrams on presentation of their books at the local post office.  This might be considered if it is too late to extend free postage to them.</P>
    <P>Old people love to receive and send greetings to relatives and friends but because of the high cost of postage it is impossible for older people living on limited means to send Christmas greetings. This point has already been made by previous speakers and I will not labour it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods covered all the details in this Bill very adequately and I will not delay the House by repeating what he said.  I am very pleased this Bill was introduced today, although in my view it is inadequate.  Perhaps the Minister in her reply will tell us if it is possible, even at this late stage, to bring in measures to help the people who have been left out, particularly the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I do not intend delaying the House very long but because I represent a constituency which has a large number of social welfare recipients &mdash; the city of Limerick &mdash; I feel I should not let this occasion pass without saying a few words on this very significant and very welcome Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on her generosity and initiative in making it possible for almost 500,000 underprivileged people to enjoy Christmas.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced at a time of very severe economic stringency, at a time when every western European country is concerned about national finances and major economic problems.  This Government have found a significantly large sum of money to meet a very worthy need.  This measure is a clear indication of the social concern of this Government and reflects the personal commitment of the Minister.  Down the years she has been an advocate for the poor and underprivileged sections of our community. She is to be commended that so early in her term of office, and despite financial stringency and constraints, she has introduced this Bill which will help almost 500,000 people.  This is very praiseworthy and I commend the Government and the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has shown recognition of the fact that in this country we have an inordinately large proportion of people in the social welfare category.  As well, the serious problem of poverty has been <Col N="2295" /> referred to today.  Various surveys have been carried out and we know that an appalling proportion of our people are on what might be called the poverty line. This Bill will make their lives at Christmas a little less miserable.  The unfortunate thing is that these underprivileged people are the least organised, the least able to exercise muscle or to engage in agitation to demand increased benefits.</P>
    <P>The effects of this Bill will be welcomed by everybody and by all parties, no matter which side of the House they occupy.  One aspect worries me, and it is the main reason why I stood up, and that is whether the Minister can ensure that these payments will be available quickly.  In her opening speech the Minister said that one category, old age pensioners would get their payments on Friday, 11 December and that the others would receive them on Thursday, 10 December.  I hope it will be possible to ensure that all the beneficiaries will receive their payments in time for Christmas. We all know the appalling delays in the past two years in the matter of these payments and I hope the Minister is getting abreast of the job of easing these delays.  The effect of this Bill will be nullified if the people entitled to these payments do not get them in time &mdash; the payments will be useless if they are kept waiting for weeks and months.</P>
    <P>I am not talking politics when I comment on the appalling delays in social welfare payments in the past two years, delays which caused the enormous hardship and cruelty.  I am sure most Deputies who live in large urban areas have had experience of constituency offices becoming virtual bureaux for social welfare. We have had strings of people looking for their rightful entitlements being subjected to enormous cruelty.  I hope that because of the Minister's deep personal commitment to the poor and the underprivileged and her demonstrated sincerity she will tackle this problem as quickly as possible, that she will revamp and streamline the whole area of social welfare.  This is a time of major high technology and computerisation, when office administration is becoming highly <Col N="2296" /> sophisticated, and I hope the Minister will find it possible to do such a major revamp that these delays will not recur, that people will be paid promptly what they are entitled to by right.  Particularly I hope that people concerned will get their payments in time for Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed and to express my gratification because all contributors welcomed the measure.  That is what I had expected.  The debate has been on two main issues.  The first is who should get the kudos for the introduction of this measure and two, whether this scheme should be extended to other categories. Almost all Deputies who spoke broadened the debate to include comments on the enormity of the poverty in this country and of the gap between the rich and the poor.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell on who should get the kudos for the introduction of these double payments.  I do not think it is a matter on which the time of the House should be expended.  Some of the matters raised by Deputy Woods did not have anything to do with this double payment. I can tell him that there was pressure from backbenchers, from social welfare recipients and from the unions to have this double payment made this Christmas. I should emphasise, however, that at no time was a decision taken by the Government or any question of the Government considering not to make this double payment.  Deputy Woods has experience of how Government work in these matters.  The main thing is that we have the Bill before us, and it is on the same day as the Bill came before the House last year, 18 November.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the officers in the Department that these payments will be made in time.  A once-off payment like this inevitably involves extra work for staff, but I have been given that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about the possibility of extending these payments to other categories. I hasten to assure Deputies that I am aware there are other categories who will be in need this Christmas.  There <Col N="2297" /> are people even outside the social welfare categories who will be in need.  The Government gave this some consideration, as I have no doubt the Government did last year.  We know that there are many people who have been in receipt of pay-related benefits for 15 months and go back to a flat rate.  They can have many problems.  If it is extended to them it must also be extended to those in receipt of disability and supplementary welfare benefits.  The problem here is that one creates a new grey area.  It is given for 12 months but there are also those on 11 months short-term benefit who are equally necessitous, maybe more so. Wherever the cut-off point is there will be a problem.  Understandably, Deputies and others will point to those who are equally necessitous and are left outside the measure and in respect of whom a new anomaly is created.  In the main it was agreed last year, and again this year, to confine this as far as possible to those categories who do not have the prospect of ending their dependence on social welfare. They are the categories that are included in the measure but this is not the last word on this and we can look at it again.</P>
    <P>Problems will arise also with regard to those who have breaks in their claims. They may have a genuine grievance if they were not covered.  However, whereever we draw the line we will have problems because people will be left outside the scheme.  There are people who are completely outside the system and, in many instances, are equally necessitous. We do not put forward the claim that this will eliminate poverty for Christmas but we hope it will bring some comfort to the categories we are catering for.  It is in line with our general concern for the standard of living of so many people in this unequal society and for that reason I am glad to be associated in some way with a measure that will bring comfort to a number of them.  The total number of people involved is 496,000 which includes 121,000 additional dependants.  I am grateful for the welcome extended to the Bill and I am mindful of the points raised by Deputies.  A Deputy made the point that cost was not an issue but it is this <Col N="2298" /> year.  The economy was never in a worse condition.  When we took over, the state of the economy created an enormous problem for us.  We deserve recognition of the fact that in spite of that we agreed to pay this double allowance although there was no obligation on us under the national understanding.  The Government made a commitment to give a 5 per cent increase to old age pensioners and that was transferred into an increase plus 3 per cent which, I am aware, only compensated for budgetary increases.  Listening to some Deputies one would have thought that cost of living increases were always granted up to now.  For several years there were enormous increases in the cost of living but social welfare recipients were not compensated.</P>
    <P>I do not contend that this is enough. We have a long way to go before we will have done enough in relation to social welfare payments.  Such payments, however, are not the answer.  Really, it is a fire brigade service, a mopping up of the effects of many other policies implemented by Governments down the years in relation to housing, education and so on.  Many of the people we are dealing with did not have an opportunity in life and were condemned to a certain lifestyle and incapacity of one type or another which meant that they had to depend on social welfare benefits.  Others are unfortunate in that they are sick or disabled. It is my intention to cater for that section of the community and I will never be satisfied I have done enough for them.  I am grateful for the contributions and it is important that the legislation is passed quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told the House that she does not have the cost of including the mentally and physically handicapped in this scheme but I should like to make a special plea that the Minister give consideration to including them when drawing up the regulation on the health side.  I do not wish to make a political point on this but I believe the cost involved is minimal.  An examination of the list, and the various elements <Col N="2300" /> within it, will show that one area that was overlooked last year, and this year, is the handicapped.  We have catered for the domiciliary care at home by doubling that allowance.  It would cost only a few thousand pounds to cover the mentally and physically handicapped in the scheme.  I do not believe the Minister would have any difficulty in this respect with the Minister for Finance and I hope she will give an undertaking to look seriously at that request.  It is feasible to include them in the list.  I appreciate that there are greater difficulties about including people on long-term unemployment assistance but it is worth looking closely at the list because, as Deputies have stated, those on long-term unemployment allowance are deeply into poverty.  The Minister should look at that section.  It may not be possible to do anything about those people for Christmas but they should be included in future schemes.  In this the Year of the Disabled the Minister should double the allowance for physically and mentally handicapped this Christmas. Such a move would have our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I elaborate on that point in relation to long-term patients in welfare homes and psychiatric hospitals? Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me but I cannot see how such patients would benefit under these provisions.  The total number of beneficiaries under this Bill has been given as 348,000.  I presume that the 140,000 old age pensioners include old age pensioners at present in welfare homes or psychiatric hospitals.  Therefore I cannot see where there is provision to direct the health boards to give these patients the double week.  Some health boards may, with humanity, decide to grant this increase.  I believe the Minister should direct the health boards to give a double week allowance &mdash; or their pocket money as it is called &mdash; to patients in welfare homes and psychiatric hospitals. This would not constitute an increase in the Minister's budget.  If the Minister does not issue a directive to the health boards what will happen is that the matron of a particular hospital or welfare home will put the money directly into her accounts.  As a result the health boards <Col N="2301" /> will be receiving a £4 or £5 increase that week which will benefit them.  I do not deny that they need money also.  But the Minister should now direct that each health board CEO &mdash; in some health board areas I understand that the allowance is £5 in some welfare homes, but I am subject to correction on that &mdash; would direct that each patient in a welfare home or psychiatric hospital receive a £10 allowance for one week during Christmas to compensate them for increased costs. This would be a very humane gesture and easy to implement.</P>
      <P>Of the many people involved who will receive the double payments on Friday, 11 December and the other categories on Thursday, 10 December it is quite possible that somebody on sickness benefit would qualify for invalidity pension on 12 or 13 December.  As a result they would not benefit from this increase.  The same would apply to an old age pensioner who would qualify for an old age pension on the day after the allowance.  There may be very few involved but they would be deprived of this double payment.  Perhaps the Minister could see her way when preparing the regulations to allow up to 25 December &mdash; in other words, that all people who qualify up to that date would benefit from the double payment.  This would cover the people about whom I am speaking.  Possibly it would cost a couple of thousand pounds more, but in justice this should be considered.  Perhaps an amendment could be included to allow for that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E Desmond Mrs. E Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point raised by both Deputy Woods and Deputy Leyden in relation to patients in homes.  It is not a matter that arises on this Bill, but I will certainly look into it.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to make life more comfortable for people on very low incomes in respect of the Christmas period.  I am interested personally in the category mentioned, people in psychiatric and long-stay homes generally.  If there is something we can do to ensure that they will derive full benefit from the provisions we are implementing here, I <Col N="2302" /> shall certainly undertake to do so.  I will examine the matter when I go back to my Department and see what I can do about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leyden also raised the question of people who might qualify the day after the implementation of these provisions. I do not know how we could implement that provision.  I take the spirit in which it was advanced &mdash; that what we are trying to do is to give relief for Christmas &mdash; but I should imagine there would be a great deal of administrative difficulty endeavouring to have such benefits paid in time if we were to take into account everybody who might qualify the day after or two or three days after up to 25 December.  If a decision on qualification were taken on, say, 14 or 15 December there is no way payment could be issued with the other payment on the 11th or 12th of the month.  I am sympathetic to the whole idea but I do not think it is administratively possible to meet the Deputy's request in that respect.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when replying to Second Stage, said that the former Government were committed under the national understanding.  As I said earlier in the Estimates debate, it was a proposal of the then Minister for Social Welfare, with the full support of the Government. This proposal was then put to the social partners as something we wanted to do last year.  It is regrettable that this year there is not an opportunity for the Minister to put forward such proposal.  There has not been an opportunity because so far a national understanding has not been <Col N="2303" /> negotiated.  If there were such a partnership then the Minister for Social Welfare would find the partners helpful and supportive of her in some of her objectives, which of course would occasion some increased costs.  I wanted to make that point clear in relation to the question of the national understanding.</P>
      <P>The second point I wanted to make refers to the fact that the Bill is called the Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1981.  We had a similar Bill last year when we had experience of its operation. We have now a second temporary Bill. Perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of having a permanent Bill in this area in the future.  Now that the precedent has been established it would be unlikely that any Government in the future would not grant this double week at Christmas.  It has become a feature of our whole social welfare system and, as such, merits recognition as a permanent one.  Old age pensioners, widows and others should now be able to look forward to Christmas with that advantage before them, knowing with certainty. Leaving aside altogether who forced the matter or whether it was forced on the Government this year, the fact is that recipients are hearing about this double payment very late this year.  They know that and have made that point themselves. Indeed they were worried that they would not receive it this year.  I do not believe these people should be placed in that position next year.  There may or may not be a national understanding.  For instance, these matters might be sorted out in the August/September period. But, with the lack of a national understanding this year, with all sorts of possibilities for next year we cannot anticipate, it would be only reasonable to remove the temporary nature of these provisions and allow beneficiaries to look forward with certainty to that kind of advantage each Christmas.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell made the point that there is very little time remaining in which to implement the provisions of this Bill.  I appreciate that since the system was tried out last year it will not be as difficult this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2304" /> I believe it can be implemented in the time.  One thing tried last year which resulted in considerable savings was the fact that this increase would be paid at double the face value of the benefit.  This led to some difficulty with post offices because they had to identify the value but the staff were most co-operative and helpful and the whole operation was done at quite a low cost from the point of view of the administrative implementation of the scheme.  That was naturally very beneficial. I should like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the post offices for their co-operation and I am sure the same co-operation will be there this year to ensure speedy payment.  It would be wrong to take the co-operation given for granted and that is why I mention the matter.  Last year there were administrative kinks to be ironed out.  In the light of the experience gained I trust there will be no kinks this year.  I presume I am right that it will again be double the face value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that those who receive disablement benefit and other such allowances will get the double payment.  Would the Minister like to comment in regard to those in receipt of home assistance?  When does she propose to introduce a supplementary estimate to permit these increases by the health boards?</P>
      <P>With regard to children's allowances I do not think it would be fair that all should receive double the allowance. There are, however, those who should be considered in this regard.  There might be difficulty from the point of view of administration but the Minister could start with those who are already in receipt of social welfare benefit.</P>

    <P>I join with Deputy Woods in complimenting post office staffs on the excellent work they did last year.  Things went very smoothly indeed.  I am sure things will go equally smoothly this year.  The staffs went to a great deal of trouble to help the Department and ensure that all those entitled received their allowances in time.  I have been asked to table questions to the Minister in regard to social welfare recipients who are not receiving their allowances.  I am not criticising the Minister <Col N="2305" /> but I am tabling questions for written answer to ensure that payments are made quickly.  The Minister should take steps to ensure no problem arises.  I am sure the Minister will give special consideration to this aspect.</P>

      <P>I join with those who have expressed appreciation of the post office staffs and I thank them for their co-operation and willingness to extend the same co-operation this year as they did last year.  I am quite certain it will be forthcoming.  Deputy Dr. Woods made the point that there was a misunderstanding. Quite apart from that what really matters to the people concerned is getting their benefit.  They are well aware that they will get their benefit in time and they can budget for it.  There will be an Estimate next week in regard to Health.  Children's allowances are not of course included.  Deputy Leyden made the point that the suggestion should apply only to those in need.  The payments in respect of child dependants are being doubled but I doubt if doubling children's allowances could be regarded as a progressive step.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before discussing the various sections I want to say that it is my intention and the intention of those on this side of the House to co-operate fully in the passage of this measure as quickly as possible.  The House will recall that this legislation was introduced by the previous Government and that the Second Stage of the debate on the Bill was held last May prior to the general election. The amendments we have before us from the Government are mainly drafting <Col N="2306" /> amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 12, which deals with section 16, and we will discuss that at greater length when we get to it.  I assure the Minister of the co-operation of Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>This legislation arose from the report of the Fire Services Committee, 1975, which was considered and various action was taken by the previous Coalition Government in 1977 and by the Fianna Fáil Government from 1977 to 1981.  Various work was carried out as a result of this report.  In the introduction to the terms of reference for the tribunal which was set up last February, arising from the tragedy at the Stardust nightclub, I, as Minister for the Environment, made a series of commitments with regard to measures to be taken to improve fire services generally.  These commitments were: the introduction of the Fire Services Bill, which we have before us; the setting up of a fire task force in co-operation with the Fire Prevention Council and making available to that task force adequate and substantial funds to carry out their work.  The Fire Services Bill was introduced in April and had its Second Stage debate in May.  The publication of the building regulations, with the amendments, was carried out within six weeks of the setting up of the Stardust Tribunal and then, in fully amended form, were published in April.  The fire task force has been operating very effectively and I would like to take this opportunity of praising them and putting on record my appreciation for the work put in by the chairman, Mr. Geoffrey Cronin, the members of the task force and the co-operation they have received from all sections of the community.  I know the work they were undertaking when I was Minister and, from reading media reports since, they have been carrying on that work in an excellent manner.  That is something for which we should be very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other measure that was introduced by the previous administration for the improvement of the fire service generally was the interest subsidy paid to local authorities to encourage them to purchase fire tenders and equipment generally. <Col N="2307" /> That was a major boost to the efforts of local authorities to improve their fire fighting and fire prevention capacity.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister his intentions with regard to bringing the Bill into operation.  The Minister for Finance spoke yesterday about revisions and reviews for decentralisation and other issues.  There is a cutback in funds and it would be wrong for this House to pass legislation such as the Fire Services Bill, have it passed by the Seanad, signed into law by the President, and raise expectations within the community generally about action to improve fire fighting services if we have no money to implement these measures.  What is the situation with regard to the availability of the necessary funds?  Will the Bill be brought into operation immediately it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President?</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of the commitments with regard to expenditure on the fire service by various administrations. The previous Coalition Government in their last year in office had £694,000 in their budget for fire services. This was immediately increased in the first Fianna Fáil budget and in the 1981 Fianna Fáil budget it increased to £2.5 million.  During that period we were involved in the construction of 14 new fire stations and there were plans for 11 more.  Forty-four new appliances were purchased for the fire service.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements of this legislation is the whole area of fire prevention, the carrying out of investigations of buildings and the investigations of such things as have been included here by the Minister with amendment No. 1, the examination and positioning of hydrants.  This all involves staffing.  Fire training involves staffing.  We are talking of considerable expenditure.  It will be necessary for the Minister for the Environment to have the assurance of the Minister for Finance that funds will be available to put this Bill into operation because people expect that this legislation will remove the present inadequacies in the operation and organisation of our fire services.  The financial implications of the Bill are considerable. <Col N="2308" /> It will need tremendous effort on behalf of the Minister for the Environment to get the necessary funding from the Minister for Finance.  I assure the Minister for the Environment, that we will be following the publication of the Book of Estimates very carefully in regard to the funds being made available for the fire services.</P>

I understand the procedure is that questions tabled the previous day take precedence and I am wondering if the Chair would consider having that procedure examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with a view to ascertaining if it is still the most appropriate way of operating.  I say this because it seems unfair that a question which appears on the Order Paper for one day but which is not reached can appear further down the list for the following day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the phenomenal growth in tax avoidance lending schemes?  Would he give the estimated loss in revenue to the State in each of the last five years arising out of relief for industry, agriculture and shipbuilding which have accrued to banks and enterprises in the sections designated as entitled to tax relief under lending schemes, sometimes called tax-based lending?  Will he take steps to ensure that tax reliefs intended for particular economic activities, such as job creation, will be used for that purpose and not shared with financial institutions for non-productive purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for the figure for the amount of revenue actually foregone by those schemes.  In the event of the tax benefits arising from leasing, section 84 loans and preference share financing schemes &mdash; the three categories involved &mdash; being abolished it is tentatively estimated that the banks liability to <Col N="2315" /> taxation would increase by approximately £40 million in a full year.  However, it is contended by the banks that most of the relief concerned is in most cases passed on to manufacturing industry and no real advantage is given to the banks or their shareholders as a result of the schemes in question.  This matter has been the subject of a submission by the Central Bank to the Commission on Taxation, to which the general subject was referred earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that any change of this nature would be a budgetary matter and it would not be appropriate for me to indicate the Government's intention at this stage. This matter is receiving close attention from the Government at the present time.  In the course of this examination the Government have to take into account not only the nominal tax paid by banks but also the effect any such change might have on the level of industrial incentives.  As the Deputy will appreciate, we are competing to attract a relatively small pool of highly mobile industrial investment and any diminution in schemes which are beneficial to such mobile investment could discourage it from coming here.  The Government must weigh this consideration in the balance against other considerations which have also to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind when looking at this subject the fact that the relief given in this case may well be passed on to industry and agriculture but this is done at the discretion of the lending institutions, which I believe should only be in the hands of the State?  Does the Minister intend to bear this in mind when finally making a decision on whether he thinks it is appropriate to leave this facility available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made <Col N="2316" /> what I regard as a very valid point.  This point was made in another form by the Central Bank in their submission to the Commission on Taxation.  They argued that any such subsidy to industry should be explicit and given by the State rather than given indirectly through any other institution in a manner over which the State does not have complete control.  In assessing this matter we have got to look at all the considerations involved.  I assure the Deputy and the House that we will take our responsibilities in this matter very seriously.</P>

      <P>I am aware that negotiations are being conducted by the Minister for Agriculture with the banks in regard to methods which might be used to assist the farming community in what the Government recognise are very acute financial difficulties which many of them face. The Government in this context in their negotiations with the banks are prepared to examine every possible avenue whereby assistance could be given by the financial institutions and the Government to farmers who, as a result of the impact of inflationary policies over the last number of years, are in serious difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the supplementary question asked by Deputy McCartin the implication was that the ACC might be meant.  When the Minister was replying he mentioned agricultural institutions and I thought perhaps he might have been referring to the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to agriculture in reply to a question from Deputy MacSharry. Deputy McCartin did not mention the ACC in his question, which relates to the operation of section 84 by the licensed banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister replied to Question No. 5, I did not hear what he said.  The question asked whether the proportion of corporation tax paid by all banks in Ireland is declining having regard to the profits in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can work that out for himself from the figures I have given him which are drawn, as I have indicated, from the published accounts of the two major licensed banking groups in so far as those figures reflect the true situation.  It has not been the practice in the past for the Revenue Commissioners to give information about the tax payments of individual taxpayers or groups of taxpayers which might be so small as to render the individuals within that group identifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any bank received more in grants from all sources in 1977 and <Col N="2318" /> 1981 than they paid in Irish corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in reply to the Deputy's three preceding questions regarding corporation tax paid by banks, the principle of confidentiality regarding taxpayers' affairs means that figures for the amount of corporation tax paid by each bank cannot be disclosed.  I am also advised that information on the amount of grants paid to each bank is not readily available on the basis of statistics as at present compiled.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to carry out the bank-by-bank comparison of grants received and tax paid which would be necessary in order to answer his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if he supports paying to the banks taxpayers' money which was originally intended as an incentive for productive industry?  He has stated he is not prepared to tell the House the amount paid since 1977.  If the Minister has not that information now I am prepared to wait for it until a later time.  Further, will the Minister state why the IDA did not list the amount of such grants paid by them to the banks in line with their policy of openness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the questions in reverse order.  The policy of the IDA in this matter so far as the House is concerned is a matter to be dealt with by the responsible Minister who is not the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Which Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some argument about that for quite a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision was quite clear.  The Minister for Industry and Energy is responsible for the IDA.  A question was also asked about payment of grants and if I supported payment of <Col N="2319" /> grants in these circumstances.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this payment arises from the fact that State grants are payable to banks as they purchase plant and machinery under the present tax arrangements for on-leasing to their customers. As they are the technical owners of the machinery in question, it is appropriate that the grants should be paid to them.  Obviously this practice would be changed if the leasing arrangements in the tax code were changed.  The relevant question to ask is about the arrangements in the tax code rather than about payment of grants which is purely incidental to the arrangements that exist in the tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say the reason he did not answer the question regarding grants paid by the IDA to the banks is because of a statutory regulation, or does he consider that it would not be in the best interest of the public to know the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make a distinction here.  In regard to the tax payments, the practice of not disclosing information arises not from a statutory provision but from a well-established practice of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; not the Minister for Finance &mdash; not to disclose tax payments by individual taxpayers or groups of taxpayers that are so small as to render the individual members liable to identification.  That is a practice I have inherited and I am following it.  So far as the payment of grants is concerned, that is a matter for the IDA.  If they choose to disclose information, that is their choice and, in the final analysis, it is the choice of their Minister.  It is not mine.</P>

      <P>The amount of assessed tax in arrears on 31 October 1981 is estimated at £600,000.  As regards cases where assessments have not been made, these consist chiefly of cases where returns have not yet been delivered.  In most cases payments on account have been made.  It is not possible at this stage to state what additional amount is likely to be collected when these cases are finalised.  If further cases come to light where wealth tax is payable, all such cases will be followed up and revenue requirements insisted on in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since wealth tax returns were made by the individuals concerned they were self-assessments, unlike income tax which is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Individuals who thought themselves liable to wealth tax were required by law at the time to make assessments themselves.  How can the Minister give us his estimate of the amount of wealth tax uncollected at this stage?  If it was left to individuals to make returns, and many of them did not do so, how are the Revenue Commissioners in a position to estimate the amount of uncollected wealth tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate I gave was of the amount of assessed tax in arrears. That relates to identified taxpayers who have not yet paid wealth tax.  I did not give any estimate of the amount of tax <Col N="2321" /> that might be owed by people not yet identified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is self-evident.  It would be quite unfair to the people who paid wealth tax when that tax was in operation if others who, in defiance of the law in many cases failed to make returns, should by virtue of the passage of time be allowed to escape their liability. That is perfectly fair and I do not think the Deputy was suggesting anything to the contrary.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that estate, legacy and succession duties would have yielded the following amounts in the years from 1976 to 1981, inclusive, if they had not been abolished in 1975 and had continued unchanged since then: 1976, £21 million; 1977, £26 million; 1978, £34 million; 1979, £44 million; 1980, £50 million; 1981, £55 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if with a view to increasing public awareness of the dangerous and insupportable drift in public expenditure and related taxation he will publish the draft annual estimates for Government Departments as presented by them to him together with an illustration of the increase in taxation required to finance such expenditure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the Deputy's proposal.  While publication of the draft estimates demands and the related taxation implications could have the favourable effect suggested by the Deputy, it could also give rise to certain practical problems.  However, as I have recently informed the House, the Government will shortly be publishing, for discussion purposes, their proposals for reforms extending across the whole range of financial procedures, and the Deputy's suggestion, as well as any others that may be made, will be borne in mind in relation to those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly encouraged by the Minister's approach.  Will he agree with me that the present system helps to keep alive the lie that there is any such thing as a free service from the Government? Will he not agree that the only way to curb demands for greater expenditure is directly and publicly to embarrass the big spenders with the tax consequences of their own extravagance?  This <Col N="2323" /> can only be done by publication of the draft Estimates from spending Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another way of achieving the same result and that is by publishing the Estimates as agreed by the Government well in advance of the budget when the tax measures to pay for them are introduced.  This would allow for timely debate of the Government's proposals and for any modification of them in the light of that debate.  If the consensus in the House was that the provisions were inadequate then additional taxation would have to be levied.  Likewise if the House were of opinion that the tax burden likely to arise was too great the Government would be in a position to reduce expenditure.  That is the basic underlying proposal in the document which I will be publishing very shortly.  As to the specific suggestion made by Deputy Ryan there is one problem which I am sure he and former Ministers for Finance will appreciate and that is that this proposal, by encouraging spending Departments to publish their demands, would encourage them to put in the maximum demand because if they put in anything less in respect of any item they would bring down on their heads the condemnation of anyone benefitting from that item.  The present position, which does not allow publication until the Government as a whole have considered the matter, puts the spending Ministers as well as the Minister for Finance in a position of collective responsibility where they must take some responsibility for pruning the demands in their Departments.</P>

However, I have indicated here in the House in response to the Deputy's question that it is my earnest hope that it will be possible to introduce this measure in the 1982 budget.  It was not introduced in the July 1981 budget because it is a relatively complex measure involving changes in capital taxation.  It was felt that (1) it would be difficult to make the relevant provision in the short time available between the change of Government and the introduction of the budget; and (2) it would be wrong to deal with one item of capital taxation in that budget while not dealing with other items which might fall to be considered in regard to capital taxation.</P>

It would be quite wrong to settle a particular measure of taxation until it is possible to say with certainty that we can afford that in the light of the level of expenditure being decided upon.</P>

      <P>Stocks of folders and filing or index cards are now available to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. There was a temporary delay in the supply of folders of a particular colour and filing cards of a particular size due to a heavy demand recently which depleted stocks of the items in question.  As regards sellotape, stocks of certain roll-sizes are available, and stocks of other roll-sizes are on order and will be available very shortly.  I am not aware of problems regarding the supply of any other items of stationery to Members of either House.</P>

I appreciate the levity in the House when you talk about folders, pencils and cards, but it has been a very serious problem.  They have been rationed over a number of weeks lately.  I would like the Minister to say quite clearly that any Deputy who goes to look for materials for the normal work which he is undertaking will not be rationed currently.  Even as recently as yesterday, irrespective of colours or kinds of folders, these were still rationed to this House.

    <P>Information regarding the persons who <Col N="2337" /> qualify for the weekly payment of £9.60 is set out in the press advertisements now appearing.  The payment applies only in the case of married couples living together.  The wife working full-time in the family home whose income is not in excess of £1,040 and whose husband is liable for tax will qualify for the weekly payment.  Where the total family taxable income is between £2,000 and £4,000 the weekly payment will also be paid to the stay-at-home wife.  The treatment of social welfare payments in relation to eligibility for the £9.60 payment is still under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The widow will not qualify for the £9.60 allowance, but in accordance with the Government's programme she will qualify for a double tax credit.  In other words, a widow will receive a tax credit equivalent to that which she and her husband, if he were alive, would receive.  This is a major advance on the <Col N="2338" /> previous treatment of widows in our tax and welfare system.</P>

Will the Minister be frank and tell the House that the vast majority of women cannot benefit in any way under the scheme?  In addition to the straight transfer, the Minister is giving a direct benefit of £25 million but he is not giving any of that benefit to widows in that position.</P>

    <Title>Fire Services Bill, 1981: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: "That section 1 stand part of the Bill."</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I was discussing the timing of the Bill and when its provisions will be brought into force. I dealt with the history of this legislation which arose from the report of a review of the fire services published in 1975. That report was acted upon by the administration at that time and later by Fianna Fáil between 1977 and 1981.  It was a part of a commitment by Fianna Fáil on the introduction of the terms of reference of the Stardust Tribunal in February.  There was a commitment then to introduce this legislation in April and that was carried out.  There was a commitment with regard to the publication of the amended draft building regulations within six weeks of the setting up of the Stardust Tribunal and that was carried out.  There was also a commitment with regard to the setting up of a task force to examine and improve fire prevention activities and assist owners of property in regard to fire <Col N="2376" /> prevention, particularly owners of buildings catering for the general public in large numbers.  That was also carried out.  The Bill was part of the commitment by the Government at the time of the setting up of the Stardust Tribunal.  The Second Stage of it was discussed in May and I welcome this opportunity to debate the amendments put down today by the Minister for the Environment.  Most of those amendments are of a technical nature but I will be discussing at greater length amendment No. 12 to section 16 which deals with the fire services council, the inquires that are suggested and the operation of the investigations of fires.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for a commitment that when the Bill passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas and is signed by the President it will be brought into operation.  It must be remembered that to bring the various provisions of the Bill into operation will cost a considerable amount of money.  In 1977 when the National Coalition introduced their last budget the allocation for the fire services was £694,000 and in this year's Estimate Fianna Fáil provided £2.5 million for those services.  That represents a considerable increase.  In the period between the general election of 1977 and the change of Government earlier this year 14 new fire stations were constructed and 11 further projects are under construction.  A total of 44 new fire appliances were also provided throughout the country.  It was a question of continuous progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for the Environment to give the House a guarantee that the work undertaken, work envisaged and the expansion of the fire services envisaged within the terms of this Bill &mdash; which involves training, fire prevention and all other aspects &mdash; will place him in a position to secure from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and his other colleagues in the Cabinet the necessary finance with which to implement the provisions of the Bill.  There is a level of expectation amongst the general public that the fire services generally are to be improved, through reorganisation, as envisaged under the provisions of this Bill.  There is expectation of a <Col N="2377" /> dramatic improvement.  For the sake of the House and the country perhaps the Minister would see his way to giving this guarantee.  I can assure him that on this side of the House we will be keeping a very close eye on progress and will be ensuring by means of all the facilities at our disposal, that the provisions of this Bill are implemented once passed.  It would be a tragedy were this Bill merely passed and left on the statute book, if the necessary finance were not made available.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that in April last we introduced a system of subsidisation of local authorities to assist them in the purchase of extra equipment, a 50 per cent subsidisation of the interest rates involved in repayments on equipment, which was of enormous assistance to them.  The financial commitments involved in that decision were considerable.</P>
    <P>Great work has been done by the fire services throughout the country.  This Bill, together with the other measures about which I have spoken, provides an opportunity for what might be described as a great leap forward in the development of our fire services and, in particular, in the development of their fire prevention element.  We have all become aware of the absolute necessity for an improvement in the fire prevention element of the fire-fighting tasks.  Fire prevention constitutes a key element of this Bill.  In the next section there is an amendment in the name of the Minister which talks about "fire hydrant".  All of these things are to do with fire prevention. This will necessitate considerable resources both of manpower and finance at Government level.</P>
    <P>It will require considerable commitment to financing on the part of the Government with which to implement the fire training facilities of this Bill.  It is essential that we get this commitment today during the discussion on Committee Stage, or at least some inkling as to the level of financial commitment of this Government in 1982 when this Bill has been passed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his assurance <Col N="2378" /> that he will co-operate in getting this Bill through the House as quickly as possible. As he says, this is a Bill introduced when he was Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here largely with what might be described as technical amendments. However, there is one amendment of substance, No. 12.  I can give the Deputy the guarantee he seeks that this Bill will be made effective immediately it is passed into law and the finance will be there to back it up.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 27 and 28, to insert fire hydrant' includes any hydrant marker-plate, cover or box;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the definition of a fire hydrant to include its marker-plate, its cover and the box enclosing it.  This means that, for example, under section 31 it will be an offence not only to damage or obstruct a hydrant itself but also the other components, including the marker, which helps firemen to speedily find the hydrant. Other references to hydrants arise in amendments Nos. 9 and 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment.  It improves the wording of the Bill and takes me back to the question of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section dealing with interpretation goes into considerable detail in regard to interpretations of "building", &ldquo;fire authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire bridge&rdquo;, that included in the present amendment on &ldquo;fire hydrant&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire safety&rdquo;, &ldquo;functional area", "planning authority" and so on. Many of these involve finance.  For example, there is considerable pressure within the fire services in the Dublin area &mdash; perhaps the Minister would comment on the progress of negotiations with Dublin Fire Brigade on this question &mdash; with regard to the fire hydrant.  To improve <Col N="2379" /> the fire prevention work the staff of the fire services in Dublin Corporation have been pressing for greater freedom, at a time when they are not involved in actual fire fighting, to engage in mapping and acquisition of greater knowledge and awareness of the placings of fire hydrants outside hotels and other public buildings. I heard quoted the case of a recent fire in a hotel on the quays.  When the fire brigade arrived it was discovered that some of the hydrants were damaged or at least were not in working order.  The danger inherent in a situation like that is self-evident, particularly in a public building such as a hotel.  In fact this Bill specifically refers to hotels and places with bedroom accommodation.  The provision of finance for this investigatory work and the fire prevention work in which Dublin Corporation want to involve themselves is a key element of this Bill.  I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the progress he has made in the negotiations with the fire authorities in Dublin and the staff involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the Deputy an assurance which I shall repeat now but I do not think it would be helpful to the progress of this Bill if on every section and amendment I have to stand up and give the same assurance.  When this Bill goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas and has been signed by the President its provisions will be brought into force immediately and finance provided for them.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment with which we are dealing is to ensure that fire hydrant marker-plates are clearly discernible and it will be an offence to obstruct them in any way.  But the actual placing of these and the technical aspects of their placement is really a matter for people more competent than Deputy Burke or I to deal with, the actual fire people themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in putting down an amendment giving an interpretation of a "fire hydrant", there is not much point in putting a sign on a road or on a corner of a wall showing <Col N="2380" /> where the fire hydrant is if, in the event of a fire, a fire brigade arrived only to discover that the fire hydrant indicated was not in working order.  The members of Dublin Fire Brigade show a commendable level of concern and commitment to their job when they want to involve themselves in moving out from their stations, involving themselves in the investigation of the operation of these fire hydrants. Further on there is reference to the role of the sanitary authority.  Surely it is fundamental that the equipment provided, including hydrants and so on, should be in working order.  The Minister has given a commitment as to finance.  I am asking him now about the negotiations and where he envisages development taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The sanitary authorities are the people responsible for the provision and maintenance of hydrants and so forth.  While we will be laying down the standards the actual locations and whether these hydrants are in working order will be a matter for the sanitary authorities in the areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is basic to the fighting of a fire that the brigade should know exactly the position of the hydrants in the area in which they are operating and whether these are in working order.  What I am asking the Minister is that the fire brigades should be allowed to go out and discover for themselves these basic things.  Fire brigades should know exactly where the hydrants are rather than have to search around looking for them.  At what stage are the negotiations with the fire authorities on the level of fire prevention rather than fire protection?  Surely it is basic that firemen should know where the hydrants are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in dispute. Of course it is essential that the personnel should know where hydrants are located but these are matters to be discussed between my Department and the local authorities together with the fire fighting services and these matters are on-going. There is continuing dialogue.  There is <Col N="2381" /> dialogue now and discussions will continue after this Bill is passed.  There will be no finality to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate it is an on-going situation.  Surely the Minister has somewhere in his brief or can get from his advisers information on the progress of the present negotiations.  I do not have to remind the Minister of the concern about the effectiveness of the fire services.  There is a very costly inquiry into the matter at the moment and I would like to hear some comment from the Minister on it.  I know it is an on-going situation.  I realise the positioning of the hydrants is a matter for the sanitary authority, but would the Minister let us know the state of negotiations with regard to extending the operations of the Dublin Fire Authority and the fire authorities in the rest of the country from the point of view of the request from the firemen that they should be allowed to visit and research the positioning of hydrants, examine buildings, houses and office blocks so that, in the event of a fire, they will be familiar with the building, its equipment and furnishing, the escape routes and the positioning of the hydrants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would really be a matter more appropriate to Question Time.  It is a matter for discussion between the management of the fire services and the authorities concerned.  Negotiations are proceeding.  They are not finalised. If the Deputy would raise the matter later on, I may be able to get the information for him on the appropriate section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to markers, many of these are vandalised and have not been replaced and fire brigades have <Col N="2382" /> to go round searching for hydrants.  Will there be some system of inspection to ensure that these hydrants are kept in proper working order and are clearly marked?  For some time now this matter has been a bone of contention between the fire authorities and the local authorities. It may be rather complex but it is something that should be cleared up. Somebody, the fire authority or the local authority, should have the responsibility to see that these hydrants, marker plates and other identifications are looked at, kept in good order and properly marked. I understand that damage can take place but, in lots of cases, they are broken for months and nothing is done.  I am not happy with that aspect of it and I think the sole responsibility should lie either with the local authority or the fire authority. I would be glad to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the fire authority to see that these markers and hydrants are in place and are operating properly.  Any deficiency in that regard should be brought to the attention of the county manager who will make it good.  I want to thank Deputy Burke and Deputy Connolly for their assurance that they are going to give every co-operation in passing this Bill. When it is passed it will be clearer as to whose responsibility it is and some of the confusing undergrowth which is there at present will be cut away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply I am not too happy with the passing of the buck from the fire authority to the local authority.  The fire authority should be responsible for maintaining markers and hydrants and to see they are in order.  If they are out of order they should have the power to have them repaired.  I regret to say it has not been a satisfactory situation in the past.  I do not wish to be awkward but there should be overall responsibility in any organisation. I hope arrangements can be made that when defects are noticed the fire authority should have the necessary funds to look after them.</P>

      <P>The Bill envisages placing considerable responsibility on the owners of property to make it fireproof. We will be discussing that at greater length when we get to that section. Does the Minister envisage placing legal responsibility on the authorities to make sure that the indication of hydrants is marked in a proper way and that maintenance would not be in a haphazard manner?  The Minister has amendments down about the maintenance of fire signs. Is there a responsibility on the local authority or the fire authority to keep the signs and the indication of the position of fire hydrants in a similar manner?</P>

      <P>Flammability of furniture, furnishings or equipment on premises is an area of great concern.  In the publicised recent tragedies which we have had, without in any way prejudging the reports of tribunals, etc. evidence has been given of furniture in public areas being of a highly flammable nature.  Evidence has also been given and accusations made about the type of wall coverings in premises being of a dangerous <Col N="2384" /> nature.  Section 37 of the Bill proposes to give power to the Minister to make regulations for precautions to be taken in public premises for the protection of persons and property against fire.  Has the Minister made progress with regard to deciding upon the specifications and regulations he is going to set down with regard to prohibiting the presence or use in premises of these furnishings or other materials or equipment which could create a fire hazard which, unfortunately, has been the cause of so many tragedies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <P>Where new buildings are erected would the planning authority have the right to specify what type of materials should be used there?  They generally refer the application to the chief fire officer of the area.  At present the danger lies in buildings which are built for many years.  These buildings should be looked at and, before we left office, the then Minister for the Environment asked local authorities to have checks and inspections carried out on all buildings where people congregate for social gatherings.  Exits should be properly located and emergency lighting should be in order.  I am not happy that in all cases emergency lighting is functioning properly.  Where a new building is being erected I am led to believe &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; that where planning applications have to be applied for under the law, in a general way the planning authority refer that to the chief fire officer of the area and he then gives his views.  In addition, he can examine a building in the course of construction in order to find out whether the regulations are being complied with.  In the final analysis the insurance company concerned before issuing a certificate satisfy themselves that the fire officer requirements are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable concern about the continuing use of polyurethane foam seating in so many lounges and hotels.  In 1980 a standard was set for the manufacture and sale of furniture in the context of the use of this material but that related only to domestic use.  The provision has not been extended so far to the commercial side. The longer the delay in extending the regulations to the commercial side the greater is the danger of further tragedy in places of public resort.  The Minister has told us that he is waiting on advice from the IIRS.  That is all very well, but surely there are standards available from other sources either within the UK or within other member states of the EEC. I appeal to the Minister to take advantage of whatever existing standards are available in respect of the use of these materials and then, if the IIRS produce higher standards, the regulations can be tightened further.  In the meantime some improvement is needed.  These foams are used to a large extent in such places as hotels, lounge bars and restaurants as are various types of plastic coverings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much sense in what the Deputy says but I can assure him that to my personal knowledge fire officers in Cork are visiting all places of entertainment and laying down standards on the spot in respect of materials already in use.  In the event of non-compliance with their directions, premises are closed down.  That is the sensible approach to adopt until such time as the IIRS produce set standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that, but I would remind the Minister that not so very many months ago when his party were in Opposition I was criticised by them, and by others outside also, for directing the fire authorities to visit hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and <Col N="2386" /> so on for the purpose of investigating the situation in regard to fire regulations and with having premises closed when standards were not complied with.  I was told that there was no power on the Statute Book to take that action.  Therefore, I am glad that the Minister has set the record straight this evening.  I compliment him on continuing the work I started but which met with a barrage of criticism from the then Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We were accused of bringing in measures that would result in premises being closed.  However, it is time we had proper standards in regard to the materials used in seating in public places.  Some of the foam being used is dangerous.  Instead of going on fire it smoulders and emits fumes that can be lethal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of the House share the concern in this area.  Regarding what Deputy Burke has said about being criticised on the basis that what he was doing would result in premises being closed, I did not mean a fire officer turning a key in a door in any premises.  I was referring to the use of the ordinary power of the law in this situation.</P>

      <P>With regard to the regulations under the Bill and the implementation of this section with regard to sets of standards, improvement in the quality of building materials and the implementation of the draft building regulations, when does the Minister intend to bring in the legislation to give statutory effect to the draft building regulations which at this stage are operated on a voluntary basis but as if they had statutory backing to them?  Will the legislation be of a self-regulatory type?  It is basic to the Bill that the building regulations, the <Col N="2388" /> Bill and the standards under the Bill go hand in hand.</P>

The type of materials to be used in buildings is involved in fire prevention.  I do not expect the Minister to go into a full debate with me in relation to what is included in his proposed legislation, but I ask him to bring forward this Bill before Christmas and let us see it.  When his party were in Opposition they were very vocal on this.  I would like to see the Bill because it goes hand in glove with the Fire Services Bill we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with a drafting point and simply makes it clear that all the requirements, the contravention of which constitutes an offence, are contained in Part III, sections 18 to 31.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of penalties I know there is considerable reluctance to talk of penalties which can be imposed retrospectively. The Minister's former Minister of State indicated that the Minister's amendment to section 16 was to be used retrospectively to deal with investigation into incidents that had taken place in the past. What is the situation with regard to the imposition of penalties in relation to owners of property where fires have taken place?  I understand those types of incidents will be looked into under the investigation aspect of section 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section and I am glad the Minister has left it as I originally had it drafted.  This is a key element of the Bill for those who do not take into account the danger they can create for others in regard to the proper maintenance of their buildings.  It sets out the types of penalties involved. I am glad the Minister has left it as I introduced it.  The penalties are stiff, as they should be for anyone who is so uncaring and irresponsible as to set the lives of others at risk.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 6 to 8, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: "That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We come to the nub of the Bill, namely, the whole question of fire authorities and the reorganisation of the fire services throughout the country.  The Bill revolves around this section.  It gives belated legislative force <Col N="2392" /> to the recommendations of the review of the fire services in 1975.</P>
      <P>It is important that the commitment made by the Minister in response to questions I asked him on section I regarding the availability of funds be honoured. The need for the reorganisation of the fire services is self-evident in a country that has seen such industrial development taking place in the last number of years. Some idea of the scale of that industrial development can be got from the recently published report of CTT, which showed that in 1971 exports were valued at approximately £400 million whereas in 1981 the figure was nearly £4,800 million. Hand-in-hand with that industrial development there has been progress with regard to hospitals, schools and national development generally.  The fire services have not kept pace with this level of development.  Unfortunately it has taken some major tragedies to concentrate the minds of all political parties &mdash; I do not wish to cast stones at anyone on this point &mdash; on the need for rapid development of the fire services.  Section 9 sets out the structure for improvement of the fire services and I am glad the Minister has not made any alterations in this regard. For the record I should like him to clarify that in the setting up of fire authorities and in the development of the fire services finance will not be a stumbling block.</P>
      <P>Pending the passing of the legislation, I should like to know if any discussions have taken place with the various local authorities involved with a view to speedy implementation of the major reorganisation referred to in section 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be above party politics.  I agree with Deputy Burke that this section is the kernel of the Bill. I am not here to stop the Bill going through the House.  In my view it is an enlightened Bill and I will give the Minister whatever support I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should like to point out to the Minister that there is a lack of co-ordination in the various Departments concerned with building standards and designs.  I have said elsewhere that there should be greater co-ordination between the IDA, the IIRS, the local authorities <Col N="2393" /> and the Minister's Department to ensure that the right materials are used in the building of houses and public buildings in particular.  I should like the Minister to use his offices to ensure that there is such co-ordination in future.</P>
    <P>Better standards of design and building materials are necessary.  Deputy Burke spoke of shoddy and cheap materials being used, and I agree with him.  People who are out to get rich quickly often cut corners.  Some of the planning boards and departments at local government level have been lacking in their duty to inspect premises; in many cases they have turned a blind eye to what has been happening.</P>
    <P>There is also need for greater co-ordination between the planning department of local authorities, the section dealing with fire services and the section dealing with water supply.  Sometimes there is not even a joint committee of local authority sections dealing with water supply and the fire service.  They are two separate branches but there should be a joint committee of the two branches. That would ensure that fire hydrants are not vandalised and are kept in good order.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the role of chief fire officers.  Sometimes these officers are curtailed and hamstrung by petty restrictions.  Their advice and recommendations are not passed on to public representatives in this House or at local level.  Sometimes they are filtered through city engineers and do not reach public representatives and sometimes they are censored.  I should like to see the role of the chief fire officer upgraded and given more status in society.  In the aftermath of the Stardust tragedy fire officers must be allowed to do their duty unhampered by petty restrictions.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for better training facilities for firemen and officers. There should be a central school for such training.  That matter has not received attention in the past.  We thought firemen could be trained by exposing them to fires and that they would learn more or less by trial and error.  That day is long gone.  We can learn much from the experience in other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt the Deputy but on Committee Stage he must relate his comments to what is in the section.  Section 9 refers to the appointment of certain authorities.  Training and other matters are dealt with in other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was relating this to what Deputy Burke said about building materials coming on the market and the fire officers not knowing how volatile they were when exposed to fire.  Last Sunday statements were made in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> regarding the fire services and some disquieting allegations were made. I hope the Minister will deal with that in his reply.  This is the central part of the Bill and I have put forward these points now as I may not get an opportunity of dealing with them later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be better co-operation between the fire officers and county councils.  In some counties relations have not been the best.  This goes back over many years.  I hope whatever little differences there are will be resolved.  When the Bill passes I hope there will not be any arguments among fire officers, managers and county engineers but that they will get down and do the job and do it well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sensitive subject and, as Deputy Connolly said, the differences go back over many years.  Deputy O'Brien as Minister of State made a deep study of the problem and interviewed everyone involved in it.  He set that out with recommendations in a memorandum <Col N="2395" /> which he sent out to all concerned and asked for observations.  We have not received all the observations yet.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows the problem and how difficult it is to solve.  Deputy O'Brien made a big effort at trying to solve the problem and I hope that the talks he had with the various bodies will lead to a solution.  As Deputy Burke said this is the central section of the Bill.  It gives statutory foundation to what was the position as regards fire authorities up to now.  In that sense it is not as Deputy Kemmy seemed to infer a reorganisation of the fire services.  It recognises in law what was happening anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of reporting relationships between fire officers and chief fire officers has been discussed and the Minister said that discussions had taken place with interested parties and certain recommendations had been made.  In the recommendations I hope that the very important role of the second officer is recognised.  This is the non-degree man who has come up through the ranks and is the backbone of the fire fighting service.  I hope the promotion opportunities which are so rightly his will be made available.</P>
      <P>Much has been written and spoken about this matter.  There have been many television and radio discussions and statements from interested parties.  Were the proposals that have been made for the solution to this problem discussed with the Minister's chief fire adviser?  Is the chief fire adviser in agreement with the line being taken and with the recommendations that have been made?  Has the Minister the support of his chief fire adviser on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be helpful to say any more on this matter. As the Deputy and every Minister for the Environment over the last five years knows, this situation is sensitive and delicate and should not be probed too deeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not probe it too deeply but it is central to the Bill. There is no point in passing legislation if <Col N="2396" /> having done so we find ourselves stuck in the industrial relations quagmire that has for so long bedevilled the operations of the fire service.  At the time of the discussion of the terms of reference of the Stardust Tribunal and the questions that were asked at Question Time dealing with the fire service, it was the view then, and I assume still is, of the Minister's party that the situation with regard to reporting relationships and the position of chief fire officers in relation to engineers and second officers would be resolved.  I appreciate the Minister's concern for the sensitivity of this matter. However I cannot but say that the sensitivity was not exactly recognised by his colleagues when sitting on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>When discussing the organisation of the fire authority it is impossible not to mention staffing.  What is the Minister's view with regard to the future staffing of these authorities?  Is it to be done by chief fire officers?  What is the role of the fire officer or second officer?  What is the role of the fire prevention element of the fire authority?  Who is to handle that situation? What is the position with regard to the Minister's own chief fire officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall last February great political play being made by the then spokesman on the Environment on behalf of the Minister's own party, the spokesman on behalf of the Labour Party and others who, when fire matters were being discussed at the time of the setting up of the tribunal, questioned my sincerity in the matter on the basis that the chief fire officer was not sitting at my right hand to give me the full benefit of his knowledge. I notice today that the Minister has quite an excellent staff of advisers with him and I do not comment in any derogatory manner on their competence.  I know them to be excellent men.  I know them to be the architects of this legislation, but I notice also the absence from the Minister's right hand of his chief fire officer, a matter which was of such deep concern to the spokesman for his party on the Environment at the time of the setting up of the Stardust Tribunal.  I can understand if the man is ill or tied up in some discussions with chief fire officers around the country <Col N="2397" /> or something like that, but I wonder at the absence of this chief fire adviser.</P>

Are additional opportunities and on-the-job training opportunities being provided for this excellent body of men in the proposals that the Minister has made?</P>

We can be told that staffing is a matter for the fire authority when they are set up and that it is an internal matter.  Will the Minister inform the House as to his proposals with regard to staffing, line of command, overall command and promotional opportunities to be offered to existing fire staff, and the position with regard to the existing proposals that have been laid out and sent to the representative bodies, the unions and the professional bodies concerned and if they have the full unequivocal support of his chief fire adviser?</P>

      <P>It is not a question of my refusing to answer, as I have explained a number of times.  This is a very sensitive area which has eluded solution by various Ministers in charge of this Department for a great number of years.  A very comprehensive <Col N="2399" /> document has gone to everybody involved in this.  It would be unhelpful and may be damaging to the chance of success in this area if we were to start debating the various proposals here.</P>

      <P>This sense of responsibility that we are now hearing from the Minister prompts me to refer him to the Official Report of Tuesday, 24 March 1981, column 2023, volume 327, when this very question with regard to chief fire officer posts was the subject of a question by the present Minister for Education, then spokesman for the Environment.  The question asked the Minister for the Environment:</P>
      <P>if he will state in respect of each of the six vacant posts of chief fire officer as per his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 440 of 10 March 1981 the date on which each post became vacant.</P>
      <P>We proceeded then into quite a lengthy number of supplementaries and contributions about the vacancies from the present Minister for Defence who came in on it.  As a matter of fact, the present Taoiseach came in, as I see his name here also.  The level of sensitivity that I am now being asked to show on this matter was sadly lacking at the time of that and other Question Times to which I could refer and in debates on the setting up of the tribunal after that terrible tragedy at the Stardust which we all regret so deeply.  I appreciate that negotiations have taken place and that proposals have gone forward.  I am asking the Minister if his fire adviser, a man who was talked about at length by the Minister's party when in opposition, is in full agreement with the proposals that have been set out in the recommendations made, and where is he today that he is not doing his chief fire advising to the Minister in the debate taking place here on Committee Stage of the Bill, a matter which seemed to bother the Opposition at that time. The absence of the chief fire adviser was a subject of considerable agitation to the present Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>This is the main section of the Bill and deals with authority.  Personnel also comes under this section. There has been a bone of contention between county managers, county engineers and chief fire officers.  What will be their promotional prospects.  What will be the position when vacancies, by way of retirements, occur?  Will they be affected by the embargo on recruitment?  This is a very relevant question which many people are asked, and which is causing some chief officers a great deal of difficulty.  Will the embargo affect promotions? I do not wish to discuss the differences between managers, the county engineers and the fire officers but I am interested in the personnel aspects. Will vacancies be filled?  Everybody will admit that additional personnel will have to be recruited if we are to carry out these regulations.</P>

      <P>A few weeks ago I asked questions about the Tallaght fire station.  Tallaght is a new town with a large population and a fire station has <Col N="2401" /> been badly needed for many years.  The Minister said staff would be available but it would not mean an increase in staff numbers of Dublin Corporation but that vacancies would be filled from within their existing staff numbers.  That indicates staff in other areas would have to be let go to man the fire station.  Is that different from what the Minister has just said?  What is the position about extra staff?  Can extra staff be employed by the corporation, in addition to existing staff numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tallaght personnel are at present being recruited.  I do not have all the necessary information at hand, but if the Deputy wishes to put down a question I will give him the information.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes, I will tell him what I can recall, I said the posts could be filled within the total corporation structure.  That does not mean letting people go because Dublin Corporation employ about 9,000 people. There is a certain amount of natural wastage there and if the corporation wish to fill the Tallaght posts from existing staff they are entitled to do so.  They are filling the Tallaght post at the moment and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that no additional staff will be recruited to man additional fire stations but that they will be manned by existing manpower, in other words, no additional appointments will be approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Staff are being recruited for the Tallaght fire station.  I want to make it clear what is involved here.  On 21 July the Minister for Finance made a statement in the House about recruitment to the public service.  He said that barring unforseen circumstances, no extra staff would be recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If extra people are to be recruited to the public service they must be paid. They can be paid from only one of two <Col N="2402" /> sources &mdash; increased taxation or increased borrowing.  Fianna Fáil spent the last two days voting against increased taxation in the Finance Bill, and I presume that, after four years, the message has got through about borrowing for current expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with matters relating to the Finance Bill and they are not relevant to this discussion. I do not wish to get involved in that but I should like to remind the Minister that at the end of the year the figures will show that there was no need for the July budget.  The population in many towns in my constituency, centres such as Portlaoise, Edenderry, Birr and Tullamore &mdash; a town that is recognised as the most rapidly expanding centre in the midlands &mdash; is expanding and there is no doubt that additional fire-fighting personnel will be required.  There is no doubt that to implement properly the provisions of the Bill, inspect premises and see that fire regulations are complied with in places where the public gather, additional personnel will have to be employed.  Is the Minister saying that as a result of the embargo imposed by the Minister for Finance extra personnel will not be brought in except for existing replacements?  In other words, if a chief fire officer retires he will be replaced but if additional firemen or other personnel are required they will not be taken on.  That is my interpretation of the Minister's reply and I should like to know if that is correct.</P>

      <P>Is it true that approval will not be given to the Department to take on additional staff to implement the provisions of the Bill?  We are all anxious to implement the terms of the Bill, because there is little point in expressing words of regret after a tragedy.  After such occurrences many people come forward and lay the blame at certain doors but that is not what should happen.  I am anxious to know if bodies such as Laois County Council or Offaly Council will have adequate personnel to implement the terms of the Bill.  I have grave doubts about that.  Senior personnel I have spoken to realise that extra personnel will have to be recruited to deal with these important matters and I am worried about that aspect.  The embargo should be lifted as far as the fire services throughout the country are concerned.  If extra personnel are required to carry out this responsible work, they should be recruited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connolly, and the Fianna Fáil Party, are giving voice to a fallacy that to get more work done one needs more people to do it.  The truth is often the reverse.  It is no slight on public authorities, any more than it is a slight on private enterprises, to say that there is often room for improvement in working methods and systems, that it is often possible by motivating people properly, by reorganising work, to get more work done.  If the consequence of the Government decision, or an embargo, is that efficiency in the public service can be increased, we could well end up with a situation which we were moving towards between 1974 and 1977, where a happier public service was doing more work.  For the ten years prior to 1974 the average increase in the numbers in the public service was 6 per cent but between 1973 and 1977 that average increase was reduced to 1 per cent, although that 1 per cent catered for a very substantial increase in the number of teachers to cater for the increased child population and a very substantial number of soldiers and gardaí.  A much greater volume of work was done by a comparatively smaller number of public servants, who <Col N="2404" /> in the process achieved much greater job satisfaction less boredom, and, in many cases, greater pay.  If it is considered prudent by all wise businessmen, and it is considered prudent by them, that to achieve greater productivity one should reorganise the work force, cut out unnecessary practices and paper work, it is not wrong that that should also be done in the public service.  It is good that it should be done.  It is a real tragedy &mdash; I am not talking party politics at the moment although it may seem that I am&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am with the Chair.  I am here to quell the fires of enthusiasm which Deputy Connolly has displayed for the gross expansion in the numbers of the public service for the purpose of working the provisions of this Bill.  The Bill is capable of being worked by the authorities which already exist with the additional powers being given to them under the Bill.  The way to ensure a growth in bureaucracy without the additional protection that the Bill seems to give the community is to expand the numbers, but of much more importance is to give job satisfaction and worthwhile powers to the existing authorities, That is what the Bill is doing and that is what it will achieve <Col N="2405" /> without the flabby expansion in numbers which Deputy Connolly is advocating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been enlightening to listen to that contribution from the other side of the House, a Fine Gael contribution, leaving aside the Minister. As the Deputy spoke the picture was going through my mind of the happier public servants doing more work on their 1 per cent increase in four years. "Richie's little robots," is the phrase that crossed my mind at the time.  The reality of the situation is that the former Minister left a public service with a backlog of wage and salary demands that had to be met by the incoming Fianna Fáil administration. To talk about motivation and fallacy about numbers, to talk about reorganisation of work practices, to talk about extra paperwork and setting up little bureauracies and cushy jobs for firemen is not what the Bill is about.</P>
      <P>I might remind the Deputy and the House of one amendment put down by the Minister, which reads:</P>
      <P>.... &ldquo;(10) A fire authority shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this section and as occasion requires, make a survey to examine the location and adequacy of water supplies for fire-fighting purposes, fire-fighting equipment and fire hydrants.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, of its very nature, envisages an improvement in the fire services &mdash; otherwise there would be no necessity for the Bill &mdash; an improvement taking into account industrial expansion, and the general improvement of standards throughout the country envisages also the construction of new fire stations.  It envisages development of the fire services in the new expanding towns and suburbs around the country.  This will necessitate extra manpower, and is not relevant to the trite comments made concerning no extra manpower because of public borrowing and the national debt situation we have just heard from a former Minister for Finance.  We are talking about extra manpower necessary to implement fully the provisions of the Bill, in particular as they relate to fire prevention.  This will involve and necessitate the employment <Col N="2406" /> of extra firemen and extra staff within the fire services.  We envisage the construction of extra fire stations.  They will not be manned by the existing force already stretched to their limit.  I would assure the Deputy and the House that that is not what is included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>According to the Deputy Richie Ryan's little right-wing philosophy we have just heard, there is no room for the expansion of our fire services.  That was not the cry we heard from him and his party when they were sitting on this side of the House a short few months ago. The electorate would have been very interested to have heard those comments prior to the general election.  It is only now we hear the full monetarist philosophy &mdash; the worker is all wrong and blame the public service.  The public service have a productive role to play, not the type of role which seems to be envisaged and which surprises me coming from a former Minister for Finance and, I think, also Minister for the Public Service at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The Deputy is well informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This catchcry that the public service is comprised of people sitting in offices drinking cups of tea all day is altogether wrong.  They have a productive role to play and the fire services are a classic example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill there is envisaged greater involvement of the fire services particularly in the fire prevention area.  It is indeed disappointing to hear the Minister say in response to the discussion we have had on this section that the fire services be expanded only with existing staff except in special cases. Everything is a special case when it comes to the fire services.  The whole of the fire services should be excluded from the operation of the regulation laid down by the Minister for Finance in July.  It is a source of considerable disappointment and worry to hear the Minister talk about the expansion of the fire services in this cheese-paring way.  On the first section, when I questioned him about the operation of the Bill and asked for a guarantee that there would be no hold-up in funds, <Col N="2407" /> he gave the House that guarantee.  Now we hear from the Minister that that wholehearted guarantee is less than wholehearted and can be considered as such only when we consider the manning situation and the manner in which he talks about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can take it by the Deputy's unwillingness to define the word that, like Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Haughey, he does not understand what it means.  Certainly he used it in the wrong context there, given its accepted meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must repeat how grateful I am to Deputy Burke and Deputy Connolly for their assurance that they would facilitate the speedy passage of this Bill through the House because they realised how necessary it was to have it passed as quickly as possible.  Deputy Burke asked me to give an assurance that when the Bill <Col N="2408" /> became law the necessary money would be available.  I gave him that assurance, that immediately the Bill was passed its provisions would be put into operation and that the money would be made available for staffing and buildings to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Richie Ryan was of the impression that I was talking about hundreds of employees.  I did not mean anything like that at all.  I was talking about additional staff, because many chief fire officers throughout the country have told me that they would not be in a position to carry out the job as laid down under the provisions of this Bill without additional personnel. I can only go on their word.  As I know them, they strike me as highly respectable and intelligent men who know their job. That is my interpretation of the situation. I understand now that there will be no extra recruitment.  They and the local authorities must now realise that they will not be allowed to recruit any additional personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the Deputies' interpretation of what I said, I am afraid there is nothing more I can add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister, because it is fundamental to this section dealing with the functions of fire authorities, where are we wrong? Can the Minister now give this House a guarantee that where extra personnel are required for a new fire station or to implement the provisions of this Bill &mdash; for example, in respect of all of the fire prevention roles envisaged, the extension of the fire services to outlying areas, the improvement of the fire services, the extra training and staffing that will be required &mdash; they will be employed without affecting existing staff allocations in the local authorities involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear on this.  I have given the undertaking that the money necessary to implement the <Col N="2409" /> provisions of this Bill will be provided. As I said earlier, we cannot have the position repeated in the next four years that obtained in the last four.  As I pointed out, Deputies opposite spent all day yesterday voting against increases in taxation.  The cost of the public sector bill at present is over 50 per cent of the total budget.  I presume Deputies opposite want more public sector expansion without being willing to vote for the taxation to pay for it.  They must make up their minds; they cannot have it both ways.  If they want extra staff employed in the public sector they must come in here and vote for the taxation necessary.  They did not do that yesterday.  Therefore any plea by them to employ extra staff, having refused to vote the necessary taxation, is hypocritical.  They do not mean what they say.  They are trying to create the impression that they want expansion and the creation of jobs but they will not provide the money.  I have already assured the House that the money, the facilities and the staff will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refuses to answer a simple question.  The Bill envisages the expansion of the fire services to cater for increased industrialisation and other developments such as hospitals, schools and so forth.  The Bill envisages the construction of more fire stations.  Under the Minister's amendment:</P>
      <P>A fire authority shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this section and as occasion requires, make a survey to examine the location and adequacy of water supplies for fire-fighting purposes, fire-fighting equipment and fire hydrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this will involve extra staff.  We have the examples of the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council in regard to the Tallaght fire station.  Will the Minister give an assurance that the necessary moneys will be available?  Will he assure the House that the staff required will be additional to the existing allocations or will this mean a diversion of staff from road maintenance, road construction, lighting maintenance, cleaning and so <Col N="2410" /> on?  All I ask for is a simple answer.  Will the staff be additional to existing staff or will there be allocations out of existing staffs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will be precisely as I said in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Larry MacMahon. Where a local authority can find the extra staff within their own personnel they will have to do so because Deputies' opposite are not willing to vote for taxation to pay extra staff and we do not want the same kind of borrowing that went on for the last four years.</P>

      <P>This matter was raised in a Labour Party amendment put down prior to the dissolution of the Dáil and is already covered by the general provisions of section 10 (2) (b) of the Bill which requires a fire authority to establish and maintain a fire brigade, provide premises and make such other provision as it considers necessary or desirable for such purpose.  This duty on fire authorities is expressed widely enough to cover the making of provision for the reception of requests for the service and also the response to such a request.  Also section 10 (2) (a) requires fire authorities to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires.  This implies an obligation to make arrangements for expenditious response to requests for the assistance of the service. While the amendment is not, therefore, strictly necessary, the provision of adequate facilities for the receipt of calls and call-out of brigades is of utmost importance. The amendment will help put this duty beyond any doubt and will make the statement of fire fighting responsibilities more comprehensive.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (3) (a), line 34, after "facilities" to insert "(including a national training centre)".</P>
      <P>I have received representations from a number of interests suggesting that the Minister should be empowered to establish a national training centre, and a Labour Party Member also made reference to a national centre.  While it was originally intended that the words "provision of facilities" in subsection (3) (a), would adequately cover the provision of such a centre, I have decided to put the matter beyond doubt by moving an amendment suggesting the addition of the words &ldquo;including a national training centre&rdquo; after &ldquo;facilities&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the amendment but the whole question of an adequately trained fire-fighting and prevention staff on a national basis is necessary because of the tragedies which have taken place and which have concentrated our minds on the need for an adequate fire-fighting service.  One area that has been under constant complaint, both from those inside the service and those looking at it, is the inadequacy of training.  I know great strides were made <Col N="2415" /> with regard to the training centre in Wexford and that training was provided for personnel in centres in the UK but this was only scratching the surface.  When does the Minister envisage the national training centre being established?  Pending the establishment of this centre, what action is he taking in the meantime for full training to be provided, not just in Dublin, Cork and Galway where they have a full-time fire service, but also in rural areas?  There should be training in the use of breathing apparatus.  This has been the cause of considerable controversy. Training in types of material should be given for those involved in fire protection work and special attention should be given to buildings in the course of fire protection examinations and reports.  Training should be given in the most modern equipment for communications. I understand that at present in the Dublin Corporation area the system of communications on a fire site between the men is literally hailing one another or asking a colleague to carry a message to the fire cheif.  There are no walkie-talkie facilities available to firemen working on sites in the Dublin Corporation area.  If it is as bad as that in Dublin, how much worse is it in rural areas?</P>
      <P>What steps are being taken, as a matter of urgency, to extend training on breathing apparatus equipment to all firemen? In the past there have been industrial disputes with regard to breathing apparatus and I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Burke that the constant retraining of the staffs of fire services is essential but the primary responsibility in this matter lies with the fire authorities.  If the Dáil accepts my proposal in this regard and if it becomes law, I will ask the fire council to look at the adequacy of training facilities in individual authorities and nationally. We should also set up courses for part-time firemen who are a very important arm of the fire-fighting service.  This section enables the fire training centre to be set up.  I expect the council to advise me on this because their views would be <Col N="2416" /> very valuable in this regard and a very effective short-cut to getting information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, a number of local authorities have no arrangements for adequate training. I presume a training school would be in a central location where the local authority could send their personnel for courses. If this is so, it would be very welcome. Part-time personnel are doing an excellent job but lack the finesse of special training and if this could be brought about it would be very helpful.  How long will it take to put this into operation?  The Minister said it is a matter for each local authority or corporation, but I think it would be advisable in regard to training personnel to bring them on courses which cover new techniques in fire-fighting. Could we have, perhaps, three or four locations throughout the country at which these courses would be provided? The Minister mentioned earlier that the matter is one for each local authority but perhaps there could be a central location in Leinster and another, say, in Munster. In any case, adequate training should be provided as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned that both the part-time and full-time staffs of the fire service receive the highest standard of training.  The basic training has always been undertaken by the local authorities in their own areas but more sophisticated and advanced training is needed and this, as the Deputy suggests, could be done either regionally or at a national centre.  However, that is the kind of advice I will be seeking from the fire council.  They will be advising us as to the best procedure to adopt in the interest of getting the best possible results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 16 to insert a new section as follows&mdash;</P>
      <P>"16.&mdash;(1) The Minister may by order establish a body which shall be known as the Fire Services Council (in this section referred to as the Council) to perform such services for or on behalf of the Minister or fire authorities as he may specify from time to time.</P>
      <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the Council shall at the request of the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) perform such functions under section 15 (3) as the Minister may assign to the Council,</P>
      <P>(b) assist in the preparation of guidelines, codes of practice, standards or regulations relating to fire safety,</P>
      <P>(c) undertake or arrange for research in relation to fire or fire safety matters,</P>
      <P>(d) carry out an investigation into any fire or any operation of an emergency nature to which section 25 relates and make a report thereon to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2418" /> (3) The Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, shall apply for the purposes of this section to a fire authority, to an order under this section as if it were an establishment order and to the Council as if it were established under such an order.</P>
    <P>(4) The Council shall make an annual report of its activities to the Minister who shall cause it to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from fire service staff interests which suggested that the Fire Service Training Council to be established under section 16 as originally drafted should be given a mandate to deal with a wider range of fire service matters.  I have given this question careful consideration and I agree that the council should be given a wider mandate.  I also consider it important that the council should have more than just an advisory role and should be given suitable functions to enable it to make a useful, constructive and practical contribution to the improvement of the fire service.  There is, for example, a pressing need to develop arrangements for fire service training.  The preparation of guidelines and standards for the fire service is also an urgent priority.  I expect that a council on the lines envisaged in the amendment could make a significant and worthwhile contribution in such areas.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for the establishment by order of a fire services council empowered to provide specified services for and on behalf of the Minister and fire authorities.  These services can include advice as well as practical assignments. Subsection (2) of the amendment spells out a number of specific services which the council shall provide at the request of the Minister.  The first of these relates to training.  The basic responsibility for training will remain with fire authorities but section 15 (3) empowers the Minister to assist fire authorities by arranging or providing instruction, providing training facilities, including a national training centre, conducting examinations and granting certificates. The council could assist in relation to these training functions immediately by <Col N="2419" /> taking over responsibility for devising, organising and directing central courses. My Department have done a substantial amount of this kind of work already but the programme needs to be expanded and developed to give the maximum assistance to local fire authorities in improving the efficiency of the fire service.</P>
    <P>The production of guidelines and standards in respect of many aspects of the fire service is also necessary in order to promote efficiency and standardisation. The Department already use <i>ad hoc</i> groups, representative of fire service and other interests, in preparing guidelines for the fire service.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done in this area and I consider that existing arrangements need to be developed on a more formal basis.  Subsection (2) therefore enables the council to assist with the preparation of guidelines, codes of practice and draft fire safety regulations.  These documents would still require my consideration and approval but their production could be much more expeditious if the research, drafting and consultation were entrusted to the council.</P>
    <P>The council would be empowered to organise research and also to carry out investigations into fires or into operations of an emergency nature under section 25. This latter provision is similar to an arrangement in Britain whereby the Fire Brigades Advisory Councils, at the request of the Home Secretary, carry out investigations and prepare reports into major fires.  In addition to the existing powers for establishment in appropriate cases of a tribunal of inquiry, I consider that there should also be a less formal procedure available for use in appropriate circumstances which could quickly produce an account of a particular incident and the lessons to be learned.  Under subsection (2) the Minister could request the council to carry out such an investigation.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the council would be a broadly representative body, whose members would also possess a fair measure of expertise in fire and related matters. The details of membership would be <Col N="2420" /> left to the establishment order.  I believe that the council, in co-operation with my Department and fire authorities, can make an invaluable contribution to the advancement of the fire service.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not itself establish the council but gives the Minister power to do so.  Any establishment order would, of course, have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment.  While I welcome the extension of what was to be a fire services training council into a fire services council and while I welcome also the terms of reference of the council, since the advice regarding codes of practice and standards of regulations in the area of training are very important, I wish however to question the Minister on paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>In his explanation of his reason for tabling the amendment the Minister said he intends that this type of inquiry will be related to matters of what we might call normal house fires but that it would be in addition to the type of tribunal used in the Stardust and Whiddy Inquiries. This paragraph of the amendment concerns a matter which the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment referred to consistently in relation to the Bundoran fire disaster.  Is it the Minister's intention to have a public inquiry into the tragedy at the Central Hotel in Bundoran in August 1979?  Is it the intention to have a public inquiry into the incident or is it the intention to use the type of power envisaged in paragraph (d) of this amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister of State said was that this was the normal way of ensuring that an inquiry could be held into the Bundoran fire.  The Government have said that there will be an inquiry into the fire but they have not said whether that inquiry will be public. The Act under which the Stardust Inquiry is being held and under which, I think, the Whiddy Inquiry was held also, specifies that the business must be urgent and important.  That speaks for itself.  While the importance of the Bundoran tragedy <Col N="2421" /> remains, it is less urgent now than when the motion was tabled originally in April or May of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's comment with regard to the urgency for this inquiry. In recent weeks we have seen the publication of the Garda report on this tragedy.  The recent television programme on it and the interviews which took place on that programme highlight the need for a public inquiry into the incident which took place in Bundoran.  I would like for the record and for the benefit of the House in discussing this matter, to remind the House of the timetable of events since August 1980.  The fire, with tragic loss of life, took place on the night of 8 August 1980. Reports were made by Donegal County Council, the Garda Síochána and by the chief fire adviser to the Department. Papers were referred by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who on a couple of occasions requested additional information.  At the end of March the Director of Public Prosecutions indicated it was not his intention to proceed with a criminal prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10 April 1981 I announced the Government's intention to hold a public inquiry into this incident.  At that stage we were in a position to do so because the Director of Public Prosecutions only days before that had indicated his intention not to proceed with any criminal prosecution.  During the debate on the setting up of the Stardust Tribunal and in the two months following that incident the Minister's party continued to call for a public sworn inquiry into the Bundoran fire.  The present Taoiseach was involved in the Question on Tuesday, 24 March 1981 as reported in volume 327, No. 12 of the Official Report.  Deputy White and the present Minister for Education were involved in this also.  Deputy Browne, who was very vocal on this matter at that stage, was also involved in this question. The accusation of cover-up was being thrown about.  I refused to accept any accusation whatsoever at that time.  After announcing the intention to set up the tribunal the previous Government laid <Col N="2422" /> before the House on 7 May 1981 the following motion:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>(1) the immediate and other causes of, and the circumstances leading to the fire at the Central Hotel, Bundoran, on the 8 August, 1980,</P>
    <P>(2) the circumstances of and leading to the loss of life and personal injury at the Central Hotal on the 8 August, 1980,</P>
    <P>(3) the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before 8 August, 1980, to prevent and detect and to minimise and otherwise to deal with fire at the Central Hotel,</P>
    <P>(4) the means and systems of emergency escape from the Central Hotel, and their adequacy, on 8 August, 1980,</P>
    <P>(5) the measures, and their adequacy taken on and before 8 August, 1980, at the Central Hotel to prevent and to minimise and otherwise to deal with any other circumstances that led or contributed to the loss of life and personal injury aforesaid or might have led or contributed to loss of life or personal injury,</P>
    <P>(6) the adequacy in relation to the Central Hotel of the legislation, statutory regulations and byelaws relevant to fire prevention and safety, and of the application, observance and enforcement of such legislation, statutory regulations and byelaws.</P>
    <P>2. Making such recommendations as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper in respect of the statutory and other provisions in relation to fire, fire prevention and means and systems of emergency escape from fire in hotels, their adequacy and enforcement and any other matters that the Tribunal considers relevent.</P>
    <P>We had a general election and that <Col N="2423" /> motion was not debated.  We had a Second Stage debate on the Fire Bill, but the motion was not debated.</P>
    <P>When in opposition earlier this year the present Government parties and one of the Deputies who keep them in power. were very loud in their calls for a public inquiry into this matter.  On 21 July last I asked the Minister for the Environment the following question:</P>
    <P>Mr. Raphael Burke asked the Minister for the Environment if he intends to proceed with the holding of the public inquiry into the fire at the Central Hotel, Bundoran, County Donegal, on 8 August 1980; if so, its terms of reference; and when he expects the first sitting to take place.</P>
    <P>The reply given was:</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien): I have this matter presently under consideration and a decision will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>A further discussion took place as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Raphael Burke: It is unfortunate that the Minister himself did not answer this question.  The Bundoran fire inquiry was a matter of considerable concern to the Minister's party when on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. E. Collins: Not to the Deputy's party.</P>
    <P>Mr. Raphael Burke: The previous Government laid down the terms of reference of this inquiry and the matter was on the Order Paper.  Is the Minister prepared to honour the Commitment to hold this inquiry?</P>
    <P>Mr. F. O'Brien: As I indicated, I am considering this matter and will make known my decision in due course.</P>
    <P>On 22 October last I asked the Minister for the Environment if and when he intends to publish the report of the internal investigation into the Bundoran Hotel fire tragedy.  At that stage it looked as if we would never get to the public inquiry.  The reply given by the Minister of State referred to the reports which had been prepared earlier.  I then said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2424" /> The Minister will recall that when the Coalition were in opposition there were numerous calls for the holding of a public inquiry into the tragedy at Bundoran.  Is the Minister now prepared to publish the reports available to him, one from his own fire services adviser, and will he hold a public inquiry?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State then said:</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply, the report referred to is for departmental use only and in the normal way such reports are not published.  With regard to the Deputy's request for a tribunal, that is under active consideration.  As the Deputy is aware, it is hoped that the Committee Stage of the Fire Bill will be taken next week and section 16 will set up a Fire Service Council.  I hope they will examine that tragedy rather than setting up a wide-scale tribunal which would be very costly.</P>
    <P>That is on the record of the House by the former Minister of State in the Department of the Environment.  He stated:</P>
    <P>I believe a Fire Service Council would do the job adequately.  I am pursuing another area because we do not want to set up costly tribunals every time a tragedy occurs.</P>
    <P>In my view it is becoming something of an "in" thing to criticise the cost of the Stardust Tribunal.  It is indeed a very costly operation and I regret that.  However, the necessity for the tribunal far outweighs the cost factor.  If it was true in respect of the Stardust incident, equally it is true of the Bundoran fire incident.</P>
    <P>A few minutes ago the Minister spoke of the urgency of the matter and he said this was a factor that had to be considered in deciding whether to set up a tribunal. The Government have been in power since the beginning of July.  On two occasions the matter was considered in this House.  Today we are asked to accept an amendment to the Bill before the House but the Minister will not say if it is his intention under paragraph (2) (d) of amendment No. 12 to investigate the <Col N="2425" /> Bundoran incident.  The former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, now Government Whip, said on 22 October it was his intention to use that type of investigation.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil I am calling on the Government to proceed with the public inquiry and the terms of the tribunal as set out in the Dáil Order Paper of 7 May 1981.</P>
    <P>There is considerable public disquiet regarding this matter.  It is in the public interest and the interest of the people concerned in Bundoran that this be done. The terms of reference of the tribunal relate not only to the incident in Bundoran. Paragraph 2 of the terms of reference refer to: &ldquo;Making such recommendations as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper in respect of the statutory and other provisions in relation to fire, fire prevention and means and systems of emergency escape from fire in hotels, their adequacy and enforcement and any other matters the Tribunal considers relevant.  &ldquo;The hotel and tourist industry is of vital importance to the economy.  The second item to be considered by the tribunal which I have quoted is very important to the operation of the tourist industry.  In encouraging tourists to come here, in the grading system used by Bord Fáilte, in the incentives given and in advertising for tourists, the most basic thing is to assure people that they will be safe in our hotels.</P>
    <P>When the Government were in opposition many of the Minister's colleagues, including the Taoiseach, spoke about this matter and the Deputy who is keeping the Government in power, Deputy Browne, was vocal on this point.  We showed our good faith by putting the terms of reference on the Order Paper of 7 May.  On two occasions the Minister of State told us that it was being considered and we heard it today again.  The good faith of the Government must be questioned when we see that they are changing their attitude on a basic matter such as this.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I call on the Minister to announce the decision of the Government to go ahead with the holding of this public inquiry.  He should state clearly if it is a question of the cost of the <Col N="2426" /> tribunal.  Is he trying to include it under paragraph (d) of amendment No. 12, as was the stated intention of Deputy F. O'Brien, Minister of State?  Why is the Minister so reluctant to carry out what his party spoke about so much when they were in opposition, namely, the holding of a tribunal?  I am calling on him now to announce his intention to proceed with the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from the constituency concerned, I should like to endorse what Deputy Burke has said. The terms of reference should be similar to those set out by Fianna Fáil in April prior to the general election.  If it were not for the general election a public sworn inquiry would have been held and we might have had recommendations from it.  We are not particularly interested in having a public inquiry merely for the sake of having such an inquiry.  It is our view that the findings would help to prevent further fires in hotels throughout the country.  The recommendations of the tribunal should be implemented immediately.  This would allay any fears of people who stay in hotels.  Unfortunately visitors in our hotels will think of the dreadful disaster that occurred in the Central Hotel, Bundoran in 1980.  I know that the local public representatives of the area are most anxious that a public sworn inquiry be held.  As a Deputy from the area I endorse what Deputy Burke has said and I ask the Minister to arrange to have a full public inquiry carried out immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last Deputy's contribution I have spoken to public representatives from that area.  I was in Bundoran five or six weeks ago and met the chairman and members of the Bundoran Uraban District Council and also the chairman and members of the Fine Gael Party in that area.  At no stage were representations made to me by any group of people or any individual I met in an effort to influence me to ask the Government to take a decision one way or the other in the matter.  The only thing that was said to me by I think, the chairman of the Urban District Council <Col N="2427" />&mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; was that he would like the Government to announce a decision as soon as possible. That was the only reference made to it during the hours I spent in Bundoran.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke said that the last Government decided to hold a public inquiry into the Bundoran fire some time in April on the basis of an order placed in this House in May this year.  The reason for the delay in placing the order before the House was that they were waiting for a Garda report on the fire that took place in August 1980.  Subsequent to that the Stardust fire took place and within a relatively short space of time an inquiry was set up without the findings of the Garda inquiry.  Any neutral observer would be entitled to conclude two facts from this: the last Government did not decide to have a public inquiry until they felt that because, due to the weight of public opinion, they were obliged to hold an inquiry into the Stardust fire, it would look, to put it no stronger, odd if they did not have an inquiry into the Bundoran fire. They set up the inquiry into the Stardust fire under the 1921 Act which states that an inquiry shall be held in urgent and important matters.  That certainly applied in the case of the Stardust fire.  It would be reasonable to say that it did not apply at that stage in the case of the Bundoran fire.  The matter was important.  The Garda report was available at the time and on the basis of that the Director of Public Prosecutions said he would not be issuing summonses.  What was to be established was, as Deputy P. Gallagher said, how such a fire could be avoided in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came to office we looked at this matter and at the decision of the DPP and the amount of money spent on the Stardust inquiry which is just over £1 million.  We are not sure if the object was to ensure that a similar occurrence did not happen again and we were not sure if that objective would be achieved by having an inquiry similar to that in the case of the Stardust fire.  I say we were not sure.  We do not rule it out.  At that stage we decided that we should leave a further option open which is the amendment <Col N="2428" /> to the Bill we are now discussing and that is the setting up of a fire council. I understand a similar council set up an inquiry into the Woolworths fire some years ago in Manchester.  Its findings were accepted by all concerned as being fair and helpful.  The Government have not yet decided, because they cannot until the council is established, whether they will have a public inquiry under the 1921 Act, given the fact that the urgency appears to have gone from it, or whether they will use the council.  The function of the council is to do what Deputy P. Gallagher wants, set up inquiries and establish a set of guidelines and, by investigating the fire that took place in Bundoran, ensure that such a fire does not occur again.  This is one of the reasons the amendment is before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct a statement made by the Minister.  He referred to the fact that the previous Government did not declare their intention to hold an inquiry until April because they were waiting on a Garda report. That was not the situation.  The initial Garda report became available much earlier and had been referred to the DPP. He requested considerable additional information on a number of occasions. When he made his statement that he did not intend to proceed with prosecutions, within days the Government announced their intention to hold a public inquiry into the Bundoran tragedy.  They were not waiting for the Garda report.  In a press conference on the Fire Bill on 10 April I announced the setting up of the inquiry.  The Minister referred to the weight of public opinion which was on the shoulders of the Government pressing for a public inquiry into the Bundoran incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If when in opposition the Minister's party saw need for a public inquiry at that time is it now only on money grounds that there is not to be one?  It is becoming obvious that if the Government intended to hold a public <Col N="2429" /> inquiry into the Bundoran tragedy they would have announced it in July when questioned by me in the House or again in October or they would have announced it today when we are discussing this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the further options opened by this amendment which he has here before us today.  That envisages carrying out investigations into any fire or any operation of an emergency nature to which section 25 relates and making a report thereon to the Minister. If we were to use that procedure what is the position with regard to the calling of witnesses and the evidence to be given at such an inquiry?  Is it to be sworn evidence? What is the legal position with regard to privilege?  Is it to be public or private?  I find it disturbing that the Government are so reluctant to follow on a basic commitment such as the holding of this inquiry.  If the Minister recognises the validity of the case that Deputy Gallagher and I have made with regard to such a tribunal and the recommendations that it might make in respect of fire, fire prevention and means of emergency escape from fire in hotels, why is he so reluctant, in view of the leaks that have taken place and of the general public disquiet about this incident, to announce an inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was in Bundoran six or eight weeks ago talking to people in the area.  Circumstances have altered considerably since then.  They altered with the unfortunate delay by the Government that resulted in part of a Garda report being leaked.  The portion of that report which was leaked and published related to the fire doors, fire hoses and materials used within the hotel and general questions about the incident and the tragedy involved.  Because of the delay by the Government and their reluctance to call an inquiry, somewhere somebody released part of that Garda report.  Following on that report and the investigation carried out by the "Today Tonight" team with all the interviews in that programme there is considerable disquiet about this whole tragedy at the Central Hotel on 8 August 1980.  I suggest to the Minister that the matter is still very <Col N="2430" /> urgent and important.  It can and should be dealt with under the 1921 Act.  I appeal to the Minister to ease the public disquiet about this occurrence and proceed with the public inquiry which the previous Government placed before this House on 7 May last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over this ground again.  It is too tragic for many of the people involved.  As I said, the Government are having an inquiry into this.  We are opening up a further option, for instance, as to what kind of inquiry to have at this stage.  Even though we tried to establish what happened in Bundoran &mdash; that would be the purpose of the inquiry &mdash; we should be concerned also about the point raised by Deputy Gallagher to ensure that we can learn from that tragedy sufficient to impose standards and laws that will prevent it happening in other hotels.  I accept Deputy Burke's point about the Director of Public Prosecutions reporting only in April and for that reason we are waiting for the report, but he said that the Garda report had been available something like two months before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite a considerable time before the report was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the same Garda report of which a leak was referred to on television last week.  If he had considered that report so serious and of public concern at the time he should have brought an order into this House in February referring to the Bundoran fire, but he did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government at that time decided to await the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That was announced by me in this House on a number of occasions. I do not want to get into controversy on this because it is a tragedy and so many families are involved.  However, the Minister says on the one hand that the Government intend to hold an inquiry.  He will not tell us at this stage whether the inquiry is to be a public sworn inquiry or <Col N="2431" /> an inquiry under this amendment he is bringing for paragraph (d) under the Fire Services Council.  Section 12 which he is amending sets out that the Minister may by order establish a body which will be known as the Fire Services Council.  It does not set up this body.  It says that it may do so by order.  In his reply in the debate part of his contribution was "if the council is established".  I presume that the council will be established.  I am looking at the timing of it.  We are on Committee Stage of this Bill here today. Assuming we finish that Stage the next day, because it does not seem that it will finish this evening by 7 p.m. &mdash; then on another occasion we will have Report Stage.  Then it has to go to the Seanad for discussion there right through Second Stage, because we are in the enviable position of starting our discussion on it on Committee Stage in this House.  It will be at least the Christmas break &mdash; or close to it because we are not many parliamentary weeks away from Christmas &mdash; before it is completed.  Assuming that the Minister sets up this council some time in January or maybe later, because I doubt if it can be set up before Christmas, then one of the first tasks of a brand new body will or ought to be to investigate what happened in Bundoran, and we are heading into the second year after the tragedy at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not only in the Government's own political interests, not only in the interests of keeping commitments made prior to elections by the Government parties, it is not only for the sake of getting to the root of the incident involved, it is in the public and national interest that this inquiry should be held now.  Too many questions are left unanswered which should be cleared from all points of view, from the point of view of every party and from the national point of view.  It is necessary to have this public sworn inquiry.  I suggest to the Minister that he reconsider his stance on it.  He should appeal to his Minister for Finance.  It may be an expensive operation.  However, in the circumstances where we have not had this Fire Services Council in operation, the Bundoran incident should be the subject <Col N="2432" /> of a public sworn inquiry.  If in the future tragedies happen&mdash;and they will &mdash;and the Fire Services Council are operating and the machinery is there and can be put into operation immediately, so be it.  Immediately you can set up an inquiry using the Fire Services Council. The circumstances of this tragedy are such that it is in the national interest in the broadest sense that this tribunal should proceed under the terms of reference laid down by the previous administration. I think they cover particularly the points to be inquired into.  The Minister could broaden them if he wanted to. I appeal to him to change his course on this.  Quite sincerely I say to him, Sir &ldquo;You and your Government are wrong in your attitude to it".</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had followed the advice he is giving me, this inquiry would be over and the results would have been published before he left office, because the fire took place in August 1980 and Fianna Fáil left office in June 1981.  The Deputy says I should reverse my decision and not have a closed mind.  I do not have a closed mind.  The only decision the Government have come to is that they will hold an inquiry.  When this Bill is through they will make up their minds what form the inquiry will take. We can make a very quick decision once the Bill becomes law.  We may have a public inquiry or we may opt for the council, but if there is a public inquiry we can go ahead with it immediately.</P>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has decided there is no prosecution he can make on the basis of the Garda report.  We are trying to learn from this tragedy whether there are rules, regulations or directions we can give to hotel owners that will prevent a similar occurrence.</P>
      <P>We have not made as much progress today as Deputy Burke or I would like and I accept his assurance that we are going to get this Bill quickly.  When the Bill is law we can decide which course to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (d) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" /> carry out an investigation into any fire or any operation of an emergency nature to which section 25 relates and make a report thereon to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the fire council are carrying out an inquiry can they arrange, in law, to subpoena witnesses to attend the tribunal? If they do not have that right this Bill is useless.  The Bundoran inquiry should be held under the 1921 Act, which sets out the necessary guidelines.  It will be presided over by a judge of the High Court. He has the right to call witnesses and, if they do not attend, the law is brought into operation.  It does not state in the Bill that if the Minister of the day sets up an inquiry the council can subpoena witnesses. Will witnesses give evidence under oath at such an inquiry or will it be an ordinary hearing, like a planning appeal where a person may turn up if he wishes?  I would not be happy if the inquiry into the Bundoran disaster was handed over to the fire council because their terms of reference are not wide enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connolly has a very valid point which perhaps needs to be amplified.  An inquiry would have little power unless there was power of subpoena.  I presume such an inquiry would have made available to it statements giving the results of the findings of technical officers.  I would regard it as important that those statements and reports should be readily available to members of the public and in particular to people who might have been injured in the fire or to the relatives of people who might have tragically lost their lives in that fire.  When a road accident occurs a members of the public can write to the investigating Garda superintendent, obtain a report on the occurrence and a copy of the statement made by all the witnesses.  It is not just the question on the criminal side that is being dealt with in this Bill &mdash; making any guilty parties amenable &mdash; but there is the civil law side, where the relatives of a person who lost his life, or a person injured in a fire, wish to set about claiming damages against a party who was in breach of his <Col N="2434" /> responsibilities under the Bill.  What frequently happens in this kind of situation is that the technical reports of the investigators are denied to members of the public and they find themselves at a serious disadvantage when trying to make a claim for damages against a potentially guilty party.  They would need access to those technical reports to enable them to put their case together.</P>
      <P>All too often in the past when members of the public looked to Government Departments for technical reports of the investigators they were not made available. They were given the reply that this was a private matter in the Department and the reports were not available to the public.  That is a wrong principle.  I would like to see it written into the Bill that all this technical information should be readily available to any member of the public on payment of a nominal fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say one or two things about the council and the relationship it might have with a public sworn inquiry.  Immediately a tragedy occurs there is nothing to prevent the Minister of the day asking the council to investigate the matter.  He would appoint somebody technically competent to hold an inquiry into the causes of the fire and see what should be done to prevent such an occurrence in the future.  That inquiry would submit a report to the Minister who may decide to make it public.  The reason why it is not written into the Bill that it should be made public in all cases is because that would be the first investigation to be carried out.  It would be faster than a Garda inquiry and, certainly, would be a lot quicker than a public sworn inquiry.  If the Minister published the report it could have a bearing on court cases that might follow afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not so much a report I was talking about as the statements of the witnesses, the technical officers who examined the situation.  That is what I am concerned about more than the actual findings of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would envisage that in <Col N="2435" /> submitting their findings to the Minister the council would also submit the documents and the evidence on which those findings were based.  They would be embodied into a full report at that stage which the Minister would in most cases publish.  Obviously, the Garda in most cases will be investigating a tragedy and that investigation will be operating concurrently with the investigation of the council.  If it was decided that this was not sufficient, a public sworn inquiry could run concurrently.  The purpose of an investigation by the council is to give the Minister quickly a factual assessment of what happened in a tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>To give a factual report of what happened is only one part of the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into the Bundoran tragedy, as laid before the House by the previous administration.  The second part was to make recommendations, not just a speedy report to the effect that something happened or that a hose did not work. The second part was to make such recommendations as the tribunal, having regard to its findings, thought proper in respect of statutory and other provisions in relation to fire, fire prevention and means and systems of emergency escape from fires in hotels, their adequacy and enforcement and any other matters that the tribunal considered relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is possible but it is unlikely to happen.  It would take some time to set up the tribunal because the order would have to be passed by the House.  A month may elapse before the public inquiry would start but an inquiry by the council could be put into motion quickly, possibly on the same day as the occurrence.  Memories would be better <Col N="2436" /> then.  The Garda investigation would also commence very quickly after the occurrence but, because of the machinery involved in establishing a public inquiry, that would take more time.  However, there could be an overlap.</P>

There is no need for delay if the Government act with due care and attention in the public interest, as was the position in relation to the Stardust tragedy.  It appears that we are not going to get any further information from the Minister on the Bundoran situation.  The debate on the Bill will not conclude tonight and I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision and be in a position to tell us when we consider this matter again that he has decided to hold a public inquiry.</P>

It appears that it will depend on the Minister's interpretation of what is a major item.  The Minister, and the Government, feel that the Bundoran disaster was not serious enough to warrant a public inquiry, but there is no doubt that the main obstacle to holding such an inquiry is the lack of finance.  The Minister for Finance has his hands tightly on the public purse.  That is the kernal of the problem.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2438" /> That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the extent and level of crime, violence and lawlessness in this country at present amounts to a serious emergency and calls on the Government to undertake immediately, a comprehensive national campaign to deal with the situation as a matter of extreme urgency and for the purpose of this campaign to:</P>
    <P>(1) involve local authorities, voluntary organisations and education authorities,</P>
    <P>(2) provide all the equipment and resources necessary, and</P>
    <P>(3) recruit adequate numbers of Gardaí and other personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I referred to the possibility of community councils, residents associations and so on liaising with the Garda Síochána as custodians of their local communities.  I referred also to the question of a police authority and other related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening I should like to discuss the question of bail and its general effect on the minds and morale of the Garda Síochána and of the general public.  In any democratic society there must be a balance between what is good for the community as a whole and the liberty of the individual.  There are a number of areas of the legal system in which the Garda authorities and the general public must feel a great degree of concern. Surely one of the most vital of these is that of the granting of bail.  How many times have proven and hardened criminals been granted bail only to commit further and probably more heinous crimes?  My views are not a criticism of the courts but rather an observation of a <Col N="2439" /> curable problem for which we in this House must have the answer.</P>
    <P>There are two criteria for the granting of bail arising out of the Supreme Court decision in the O'Callaghan case: (1) will the individual during his bail interfere with witnesses, and (2) will he abscond the jurisdiction or not answer to his bail?</P>
    <P>If a person charged with murder is released on bail and commits a second murder totally unrelated to the first charge, then he may well be entitled to bail a second time.  Having raised the problem on this and a number of other occasions and having heard the present Minister for Justice being loud in his concern for the whole area of bail, this is an opportune time to raise the subject again.</P>
    <P>I now propose a solution which may not find acceptance within the hierarchy of the Minister's Department or on the part of the Minister himself.  There is an answer to this gap in the legal system.  It is possible for the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation in this House to solve this very serious problem.  Unfortunately, that legislation might well fail the test of its constitutionality.  On the other hand, crimes committed on bail are usually taken into account when sentencing for the original offence or offences. The sentences usually run concurrently. However there is a view that these sentences, in the circumstances I have just outlined, should run consecutively.  I will leave the subject of bail because it is one worthy of a debate in its own right.  May I take this opportunity of wishing the Minister of State well in his Department; he is a worthy incumbent and I wish him every success.  But I would urge on the Minister to include in the Government's Dáil programme a discussion on this whole area of bail.</P>
    <P>Another matter I raised last evening was the position of young people and the drugs menace.  We all know, and it is has been stated, that the Garda Drug Squad are doing an exceptional job in attempting to curb this dreadful social disease which may well have reached or will reach epidemic proportions among our young people.  My information is that the drugs graph has gone through the roof. <Col N="2440" /> that the prevalence of pushers and traffickers has become a very serious problem. Of course the school authorities have a primary role to play in this area and must maintain constant vigilance. They must also maintain the momentum of the courses they conduct on the evils of drugs.  Generally the pusher will not be found in the classroom.  Rather will he be found plying his deadly trade outside the school grounds and places frequented by school children.</P>
    <P>The drugs scene has become such a problem the Minister might consider, in aid of the Garda Drug Squad and in consultation with them and with the Minister for Education and the schools authorities, full-time school inspectors to help stamp out the threat to our adult young from the menace of drugs and the drugs trafficker or pusher.  Society is coming round to the idea that drug addicts should be rehabilitated.  That is as it should be.  However, it is very difficult to apprehend the really evil people in this whole sordid matter &mdash; the drug pushers. No sentence could be long enough or hard enough for these people in our society.  We can only wish the Garda Drug Squad well in their continued efforts in their war against the drug pusher.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me I should like to bring the attention of the House again to a paper laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 1981 entitled Community Service Orders, a very interesting and worthy paper.  I mentioned in the course of my contribution last evening that in the event of a crime being committed in the community &mdash; in which young or not so young people are involved &mdash; the possibility of forcing these people into purging their transgression against the community should be considered, that they should be asked to recompense the community either in money's worth or in work value.  This booklet goes a long way in posing the type of solution to the problem I would envisage.  For some time efforts have been made to develop that aspect of dealing with offenders which involves their performing work for the benefit of the community.  Over the past few years <Col N="2441" />&ldquo;suitable prisoners&rdquo;&mdash; the expression used in this booklet &mdash; have been released on a daily basis from prisons and places of detention to work on projects within the community.  The prisoners are released to do work under the general guidance and control of prison officers. The work they perform is of a kind which is of benefit to the community and which would not be done otherwise.  Recently, for example, prisoners were released in the custody of prison officers, through a community project in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire, where they did an exceptional job on an alcoholic or rehabilitation centre, the Hanley Centre, in the heart of Dún Laoghaire.  Tribute was paid to the work done by these prisoners.  I should like to add my vote of thanks for the opportunity they were afforded to rehabilitate themselves in some small way in recompense for the damage they had done to the community.  They completed projects which entailed the construction of a school hall in the Dublin area and the refurbishing of a centre in Dún Laoghaire for the treatment of alcohol-related problems.  While the number of prisoners employed under the scheme is relatively small in the context of the total prison population, nonetheless the scheme has proved successful, when measured by the extent of involvement and the effect it has had on the prisoners engaged in it, by the standard of the work being done and the reaction of the various local communities for whom projects have been completed.  I believe these people will be accepted by the communities so damaged and I strongly recommend the proposal to the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice.  I would ask, in conclusion, that an opportunity be given to discuss this excellent booklet on community services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and I am confident that the former Minister, Deputy Collins, has a profound understanding of the subject matter of the motion and I commend his concern in introducing the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not alone in experiencing an increase in crime.  It is a worldwide phenomenon. <Col N="2442" /> In order fully to understand the situation we must look at the changing factors in our society.  In particular we must look at the changes occurring in the social and moral fabric of our society. What we are experiencing is not a reflection on the Garda Síochána or on the manner in which they carry out their duties.  We must look further to seek out the root cause of the problem.  Society itself and each constituent member of society has a part to play if we are to get to grips with the problem of crime.  Now I am not convinced that a continuing increase in the number of garda personnel will, of itself, solve the dilemma with which we are faced.  For too long the public have turned a blind eye to the commission of crime when a small inconspicious gesture would have been of immense assistance to the Garda in rendering the force far more successful and effective in its attempts to prevent the commission of crime.</P>
    <P>The important part that can be played by citizens in the protection of their own property cannot be over-emphasised. This is an area in which we need to raise the level of consciousness.  The very least people can do is take the minimum steps necessary when, for example, they are away from home on vacation or otherwise. If they take such steps and engage at the same time the assistance of other members of their community they will carry their share of responsibility and that will be of enormous benefit to the Garda.</P>
    <P>It could perhaps be said that the Garda are operating at or perhaps below capacity at the moment and it is therefore all the more important that every member of our society should render every possible assistance to them.  This assistance should be given without question.  In our private capacity as citizens we have a responsibility and a moral duty to assist the Garda.  In the absence of an acceptance of that responsibility and duty we are not playing our part and we cannot expect the Garda Síochána, a body of men which commands the admiration of all, to operate to the utmost of their ability if we on our part are not prepared to undertake our responsibility.</P>
    <P>The crux of the matter is that we have <Col N="2443" /> set standards of behaviour.  These standards are the product of a very democratic system.  At times we unfortunately do not seem to have the will to implement these standards and, in the absence of that will, we cannot be successful in combating crime.  There is urgent need for all public representatives to give a lead in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to certain aspects and types of crime.  First there is crime classified as armed robbery.  This is a type of crime' towards which I have a personal revulsion.  All members of our society must share the same revulsion. Over the last few years the use of firearms has been increasing.  The use of firearms at any level in the pursuit of crime is totally unacceptable.  We should learn the lessons experienced by other highly organised societies where, over a period of years armed crime has become the rule rather than the exception.  Any man or woman who sets out to commit a crime with a firearm in his or her possession is to be condemned.  Where he or she claims justification under the pretext of some quasi-political pretext he or she should be subject to the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>In this area of prevention the community should give its full co-operation and assistance to the Garda.  Now is the time to call a halt to the increasing crime.  I am optimistic that the prevention strategy recently adopted by the Garda will be successful.  Good results are already being shown and hopefully in time society will be rid of this scourge of criminal violence.</P>
    <P>Another area of crime is the area of crime committed by juveniles and young persons.  There is a kind of acceptance that no matter how well social and other services are developed this phenomenon will always be with us.  While that somewhat widely held conviction has a certain amount of credibility, I am sufficiently young in years, possibly over-optimistic, to believe that a great improvement can be achieved in this area.  This is an area we must treat with great concern.  The figure for crimes committed by young people in the Dublin Metropolitan area is quite alarming.  The 1979 survey in the <Col N="2444" /> Dublin Metropolitan area in respect of nine different categories of offences, showed that almost 70 per cent of those charged were under 21 years of age.  This is a truly alarming statistic and one which must give rise to great concern.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Collins pointed out, the fact that the commission of crime can frequently be associated with certain areas in which there is a lack of standards and good living conditions is well established. This is a sad reflection on the effectiveness of successive Governments since the foundation of the State.  We have failed to create a more equitable distribution of wealth.  We have failed to provide adequate housing.  The result of this is the rise in our crime rate, particularly among young people.  The fact remains that those areas exist and it will require the combined efforts of all branches of Government, not merely the Department of Justice but also the Departments of Education, Health, Social Welfare and Labour, to create the opportunities and the necessary service for these young people so that they will not resort to crime as a first option.  We must give them some hope that they will be able to enter the mainstream of society and carve out a career for themselves rather than resorting to what seems to be their only option at present&mdash;a life of crime.  It is a sad situation and requires the efforts of every Member of this House to remedy it.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with juvenile crime and the unfortunate situation in relation to juvenile offenders, it would be remiss of me if I did not mention the success being achieved by the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  While this scheme was initiated to assist and supervise juveniles who were cautioned as an alternative to being prosecuted and to assist those regarded as potential delinquents, the scope of the service has now been broadened considerably.  I welcome the broadening of the service.  Through continual contact with parents, teachers, clubs and youth leaders, the juvenile liaison officers have become involved in all types of youth work and youth activity.  They are of enormous benefit in our efforts to combat and prevent the commission of crime <Col N="2445" /> among young people.  Consequently, their work has taken on a significantly community relations dimension.  They are now working in close contact with many statutory and voluntary bodies, which would seem to be the practical implementation of the terms of the motion.  Their work has broadened far beyond what it was originally set out to do and this is to be commended and encouraged.  I look forward to the expansion of this service, because we cannot estimate the good which can result from the increase in the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  The day to day work of the scheme has helped the Garda immensely. It has also helped their role in the community by removing many misconceptions and misunderstandings and I believe it will play a major role in the Garda response to juvenile crime.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prevention of juvenile crime there is a serious responsibility on parents.  They must be prepared to make the effort to provide a stable home life and guidance for their offspring.  This is their responsibility and it is only fair to say that this responsibility may have been neglected in modern society.  Possibly parents should reflect on these duties and re-assess their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the children in the household and, if necessary, their lifestyle should be changed to give the proper guidance to young members of the family.  Without guidance in the home where can children get good example? It is not sufficient that it is provided in schools and in forums for education if it is not given the necessary backup and encouragement in the family.  The present implementation of juvenile justice needs an urgent expansion of the expertise available in the educational and health sectors.  We could thwart many young people who might have an inclination to pursue the road of crime and follow in the path of many criminals if we provided the necessary backup at a vital and vulnerable stage in their early careers.  It is during the formative years that example must be shown and we as legislators have a responsibility to provide the necessary backup, social services and educational facilities which these young people need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2446" /> If these services are provided before young people have committed their first act of crime or perpetrated their first involvement in crime, there is some hope that we may be able to turn them from this path before they are classified as criminals.  If we fail to prevent them from entering the mainstream of criminal activity, the damage will have been done and the best efforts of society and the Garda will be in vain.  We have an ideal opportunity to make an impression on these young people in their earlier years when they are most vulnerable.  There is a serious duty on us as legislators not to let that opportunity go by and not to neglect our young people when it may be very attractive for them to get caught up with their companions on the streets and to engage in criminal activity.  They do not realise the alternative and the rewards to be gained from entering into the mainstream of a stable society.  That should be their aim and it should be the Government's commitment to provide the facilities for them to enter into this mainstream.</P>
    <P>With regard to the juvenile liaison officer scheme, I look forward to an expansion of the services already provided and which are doing excellent work.  I am hopeful that by expansion of the services the necessary results will be achieved.  The problem of juvenile justice was under examination for many years until very recently by the task force on child care services.  The enormity of the task with which this forum was faced cannot be underestimated.  I am glad to see their conclusions have been presented to the House.  The only regret is that, due to various unfortunate circumstances involved in the presentation of the report, possibly there was the tendency in the intervening period to allow necessary reform and legislation to be held over until the task force had presented its report.  The report of the task force and the supplementary report have to be commended, but it is regrettable that we had a tendency in the intervening period to wait for the results.  Certain steps could have been taken in the interim.  However, now that the task force have presented their report we must <Col N="2447" /> proceed to implement their recommendations as a matter of urgency.  I am aware that the Minister for Health is preparing recommendations based on the task force report and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the words of welcome expressed by Deputy Andrews.  He referred to the community service orders and to the paper which was presented to the House some time ago.  The implementation of the community service orders will add a new dimension to the prevention of crime and to the price paid by the criminal to society.  In the instances outlined by the Deputy of where crimes are committed which are very recognisable as being against specific members of society compared with crimes committed against the community at large and where damage is done to housing estates and other private property, I recommend the work done in bringing in the community services orders.  It is a very acceptable form of punishment for this type of crime. Legislation in that respect is being prepared and we hope to be able to introduce it at an early date.  It is a move that must be welcomed by all responsible Members of the House and I look forward to its implementation.</P>
    <P>The question of drugs has been mentioned frequently in the house recently. The problem in this area is one which cannot be overstated.  While it is receiving serious consideration from the Garda it remains a very serious problem.  We cannot underestimate the dangers attaching to crime in the drugs area.  Permanent drug units operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and members in each Garda division have undergone advanced courses in drug investigation.  The Government view with concern the growth in drug abuse that has been developed in the past number of years.  I regret to say that this growth has not been confined to soft drugs.  Hard drugs also, such as heroin, began to be sold on the streets on a regular basis during the last half of 1980. Pharmacists are being faced increasingly with demands from youths for drugs.  The commissioner is taking special measures aimed at counteracting the break-ins in <Col N="2448" /> pharmacies, an area of crime which has been on the increase in recent times.</P>
    <P>The abuse of drugs is not confined to any particular area of crime but it leads to involvement in other areas of crime. Inevitably and regrettably the user of hard drugs will become a pusher in order to support the habit.  This, in turn, accounts for the rapid spread of the abuse.  To support this evil and sad habit the drug abuser requires vast sums of money which on average he has no way of coming by in the normal course of events.  Once hooked he will not stop at anything to ensure that he can continue to support his regular supply.  This leads to an increase in the general crime rate. The good liaison between the Garda and the customs service will continue to make matters difficult for importers of illegal drugs.  The Garda have built up excellent relations with the community from whom information is regularly forthcoming. This is a very important part of crime detection.  In this area which can have devastating effects on our community, both young and old, such co-operation is of added importance.</P>
    <P>Parents call constantly on Dublin Castle for help and I must make it known that help and advice are willingly given and will be given at all times in this problem. It is the intention of the Garda that pushers and traffickers will be brought to task for their vile crime.  These people are making profits out of the unfortunate drug problem and in the process are wrecking the lives of many young people who are unfortunate enough not to be able to resist the temptation to try drugs initially, and will be brought to justice.  I expect that many young people take drugs for kicks in the first instance but find themselves inevitably going down the slippery slope until they find themselves with serious medical and other problems.</P>
    <P>If these pushers and traffickers can be brought to justice for their vile crimes and put out of commission so that the supply of drugs can dry up, we can expect a consequent reduction in the problem. Mainly the problem is a social one and other agencies and parents in particular <Col N="2449" /> can make an even greater impact on it than can the Garda.</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify certain points raised yesterday in the debate in relation to the accommodation at the Garda Training Centre at Templemore and in particular to the proposed take-over of the Army block there.  I tread warily in this matter having regard to Deputy Collins's expertise in this field.  The Deputy referred to plans which he had in mind to increase the intake of recruits to Templemore.  He will be aware that the maximum number of recruits that can be accommodated there is 300.  When the Deputy was Minister for Justice he was in the position of trying to arrange for extra recruitment accommodation by way of having a large building within the training centre made available for Garda use.  This building is used by the Army and they have indicated that they are prepared in principle to hand over this block for Garda use subject to certain conditions.  I must emphasise that it has been only since the previous Minister left office that a formal undertaking has been given to hand over this building and that the conditions have been spelled out. Among other conditions, the Army authorities require that extensive alternative Army accommodation be provided before the building in question is handed over.  Therefore, agreement must be reached in relation to these conditions and it is possible that the alternative Army accommodation will have to be built before the Garda take possession of the Army block.  However, the accommodation position of the Garda will not be improved on the taking over of this building because it is in a very bad state of repair.  This includes rising damp and a roof that is suspect to the extent that we do not know how much attention it may need.  The building is very old and needs to be completely gutted and refitted. It needs new floors and new stairs as well as plumbing, heating and rewiring in addition to all the other ancilliary facilities. That would be a major job but the question is yet to be decided as to whether the better solution might be to knock it completely and to build a new specifically designed block on the site.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2450" /> It would be unrealistic to pretend that all the necessary planning, tendering and building work could be completed in less than approximately two years.  The accommodation available in Templemore for the time being will impose certain constraints on the level of recruitment. I commend this motion because it will help to raise the level of consciousness inside and outside the House to the need to tackle the problems facing our society, serious crime problems and rising criminal activity.  I can say that the Government will tackle this problem with every power available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this motion by Deputy Gerry Collins is timely.  It is a very important motion and I hope the contributions made in the debate will alert us to the necessity for immediate and positive action to rid our cities and towns of outrageous acts of violence and lawlessness.  Deputy Gerry Collins has given tremendous service to the Department of Justice, and the motion in his name must be viewed in that light.  I hope whatever Deputy Collins as Minister for Justice embarked on will be brought to fruition by his successor.</P>
      <P>We must not be under any illusion that Garda stations and extra gardaí on foot and in motor patrols will solve the problem of crime.  It is essential that maximum security will be available to protect our people and our property.  But this will be of no avail if people do not co-operate to the fullest extent with our security forces. I believe there is a danger that people are prepared to accept all this violence as part of presentday living.  People are searching for a reason for all the turmoil in our community.  Is it a lack of education, is it our social living or the frustration of living?  It is terrorising the people, whatever the reason for it is, and action must be taken immediately to minimise this upsurge in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young and old people are no longer safe from the vandals who roam the streets in search of innocent victims or the satisfaction gained from destroying public or private property.  Old people who were once respected are now the <Col N="2451" /> targets of vandals.  People are crying out for action and this must be taken by the Government with the co-operation of all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>Nobody is seeking political advantage in this debate.  We are seeking a concerted plan where everybody has a part to play in ensuring we have the security everybody desires.  Cork city, which I represent, is no different from any other place where lawlessness is concerned. There is an urgent need to strengthen the Garda force, backed up by additional patrol cars.  There is an urgent need to expedite the erection of Garda stations which have already been approved in the Blackrock, Gurranebraher and Mayfield areas of Cork city.  I would also like the Minister to ensure that the telecommunications system in the Garda headquarters at Union Quay is urgently completed. Those things are essential in every part of the country as well as in Cork city and would be a major step in the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Garda force in Cork city especially for their dedication to duty and their alertness recently in preventing major robberies and apprehending the people involved.  I cannot lay sufficient emphasis on the importance of the co-operation of the public with the security forces.  This is very necessary for speedy detection and the prevention of further acts of violence.  Unsolved crime encourages further crime.</P>
    <P>Drugs and over-indulgence in alcohol, especially among young people, is now a major problem in our society.  The experts in crime tell us that 80 per cent of violence and vandalism is attributable to drugs and alcohol abuse.  We can read every day of court proceedings where the common plea very often is &ldquo;committed under the influence of alcohol&rdquo;.  Unfortunately this excuse is too often accepted by some of our learned judges and District Court justices.  The Minister should examine the possibility of introducing identity cards at 13 years of age.  It is sad to pass a licensed premises and see young people aged 10, 12 and 13 years leaving it.  One must ask who is serving drink to those people and who are the people <Col N="2452" /> witnessing this taking place?  We must give very serious consideration to under-age drinking.  I have no doubt the Minister has endless representations from the people involved in the development of young people regarding this very important matter of alcohol drinking at an early age.</P>
    <P>Drug peddling and drug abuse is at a stage where people are alarmed especially the parents of young children going to school.  I suggest that we ask the Minister for Health to consider reviewing the Drug Abuse Act.  I have no doubt it needs updating.  I was a member of the all-party committee who formulated that measure under the chairmanship of the then Minister for Health, Deputy Corish.  Last week on my way to the station, I was saddened to see from my taxi young boys and girls of about 12 years in a circle sniffing glue from a plastic bag.  I do not think the Act I referred to has any provision to deal with such matters and that is why I ask the Minister present to mention this matter to the Minister for Health with the objective of reviewing the Act.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that the majority of young people are responsible citizens. They must be protected from the irresponsible people crawling around our cities and towns, in dancehalls and discos, in public houses, schools, colleges and universities, in search of innocent young people who are unaware of the consequences of drug indulgence.  This is the concern of all.  Every effort must be made to stamp out this soul-destroying practice. No effort or money should be spared to bring to justice the people involved in drug peddling.  They are everywhere.</P>
    <P>I have devoted much of my life to young people and I am very interested in their development.  I know the part they can play in this matter.  In their own interest and in the interest of all other people, if they have information of people involved in drug peddling I ask them to bring it to the notice of the Garda authorities where they will be assured the matter will be treated in the strictest confidence. The young people know the people who are involved in drug peddling.  I appeal to all young people, to youth clubs and organisations, to give any information <Col N="2453" /> they have to the Garda authorities.  This is in their own interests and in the interest of the country generally.  I know that young people have this information but they may be reluctant or afraid to come forward.  They may be frightened of being brought to court and they may fear serious consequences for themselves.  I have no doubt the Minister will assure them that any information given about this matter will be treated in the strictest confidence by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to increase the numbers in the Garda Drug Squad in order to ensure effective policing in this area.  I have had dealings with the Garda Drug Squad in Cork and I know they are few in number, but their task is great.  If we are serious about eliminating drug peddling and drug abuse we will have to spend more money and train more gardaí to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many people involved in crime are the victims of violence and broken homes.  Present-day society is paying for its neglect.  We have failed to provide an adequate service to help these people.  Money does not solve all problems. The involvement of voluntary groups is most important but there is a lack of professional involvement in this area.  A well-organised community association can be very effective.  When we talk of vandals and criminals we are talking of people who live in our community. I am very disappointed at the lack of professional involvement in the work of community associations.  There is a crying need for professional people to help.  A Government cannot afford to pour millions of pounds into every undertaking. In my view the voluntary effort is always the most effective.  I hope as a result of this debate that doctors, social workers, nurses and such people who have a wealth of experience will become involved in the work of community associations. As I said, as a society we failed to provide an adequate service and we have to suffer for that neglect.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that work on the juvenile detention centre at Cork has been postponed.  I hope that is not true. I should like an assurance from the Minister that this worthwhile undertaking, <Col N="2454" /> which was approved by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, has not been shelved.  I know of the tremendous work carried out in Cork jail.  The young people were brought from the jail environment into the community and they performed very useful community work. I hope this worthwhile project will not be postponed because of lack of money. That would be disastrous for all those involved in helping young people.  Many a boy or girl who never had the security of a home found some comfort, understanding and dedication to their welfare in the detention centre in Cork.  I congratulate Cork prison wardens for their dedication.  Their success has surpassed all our expectations.</P>
    <P>Further examination must be given by the Minister to a proper back-up service for those released from prison.  One can imagine young persons after serving a sentence of two or three years suddenly finding the prison gates open to them.  At least they had some security in the prison. There should be greater liaison between the prison authorities and AnCO so that when young people are released they may be admitted to one of the AnCO training centres.  We should show interest in young people who have served their sentences. It is important to them to know that on release there is a caring community outside the walls of a prison.  We have failed here.  We all know of young boys and girls who, within a month of being released, are involved in crime again for the simple reason they had no-one to take an interest in their welfare when they left prison.  Some people might say we are talking about money but there are many who would pay substantial sums of money today if they were assured of peace and security.</P>
    <P>We failed in the past to use the existing readymade structures such as youth clubs, youth organisations and sports organisations.  I pay tribute to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the work he did while in office.  I assure him that it does not go without recognition.  What better place than a club or organisation such as scouting and so on for young people to know what is happening in their community? <Col N="2455" /> Here they would be face to face with the realities of living.</P>
    <P>There is no point in anybody saying after this debate that they will examine this and see what can be done.  It is too important for that.  I strongly recommend, and I am sure Deputy Collins had the same thing in mind, the setting up of an all-party committee of the House so that once and for all we could bring about an awareness of what should be done, what could be done and the kind of co-operation we will be looking for from people.  We would fail now in everything done so far if we were not fully assured that some machinery would be set up to bring together responsible people and those with experience, Members of the House, members of the Garda, health boards and local authorities, to formulate definite plans.  Will we wait until it is too late and there is more turmoil on the streets?</P>
    <P>The first indication of a young person going on a wayward track is non-attendance at school.  More school attendance officers are needed who are specially trained to cope with a situation of advising a young person and his family.  This is something we should give careful consideration to because in my work I have found that where a boy or girl does not attend school there is a tendency for them to go in the wrong direction.  This is more properly for the Department of Education. Security, which comes under the Department of Justice, is very broad and involves practically every Department.  I wish to emphasise the importance of something concrete coming from this discussion. I was most interested in much of what we said and everyone gave their fullest co-operation during the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is all-embracing, to echo the sentiments of the Minister last night.  It deals with the level of crime and violence we have at present. Effectively, and this is a very valid distinction, we have two types of crime. There is subversive crime and crime committed by individuals or gangs with no alleged political motive which is not a threat to the well-being of the State but <Col N="2456" /> poses one to the well-being of the people living in it.  On a motion such as this, and in the circumstances in which we find ourselves with the tragic events that have occurred on this island in the last ten days, it behoves all Members to speak on the motion and condemn the acts that have occurred, and, without hesitation, to call on those whose violent deeds are causing so much sorrow to people living in both communities in the North of Ireland and in the South to put down the gun and try to allow politicians on this island to deal with these political problems. It behoves us in this House to state that the actions that have occurred on this island in the past ten days are merely prolonging the agony and suffering of both sections of the community in the North and adding to the feeling of instability and causing great concern to all of us living in the South.  We must come to grips with the problem facing us.  It is not easy but I hope all of us in this House can tackle it in a constructive way without trying to score party political points or engaging in politicking with some electoral gain in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard for a number of years that it is a matter of concern to the majority community in the North of this island that there are difficulties about extradition. The law does not permit us in this country to extradite persons whom the courts find charged with political crimes. This holds in most European countries. There is nothing different in the approach of this country from that of other members of the EEC and of other democratic countries around the world.  It behoves us to find a solution to ensure that the men of violence, no matter in which part of this island they are living, are brought to heel and to justice for the acts they commit.  In this regard I hope I have the support of Members opposite.  I welcome the fact that the Attorneys General of the UK and this country are investigating the possibility of establishing an all-Ireland court.  I see much merit in it, in that it can get round some of the legal difficulties we have in both parts of this island at the moment.  It may help not merely in bringing to justice some of these responsible for the acts of murder that have occurred <Col N="2457" /> but may, if and when the possibility arises of establishing such a court, contribute to a greater degree of understanding among all of us living on this island.</P>
    <P>In the little time I have I would like briefly to make one or two remarks in relation to what I call the non-subversive areas of crime.  I do not wish to score party political points, but I view with a certain degree of cynicism some of the comments made by Members opposite. They had four years in Government in which to introduce reforms at administrative and procedural levels to combat crime.  Generally speaking there was little change.  Some of the legislation was postponed while committees looked into matters. As we all know, on occasion committees are formed simply to postpone decision-making.  In this context I refer to two reports in particular which were published and whose recommendations I hope to see implemented in the future. One is the task force report on child care services which deals not only with the problem of children who need to be taken into care but also with children and criminal matters.  In that report recommendations were made with regard to changes in the courts as they deal with children, and a variety of other recommendations deal with what the courts suggest should be a special juvenile force within the Garda Síochána.  The Minister, the Minister of State and Members opposite have also referred to the juvenile liaison system whose work has made a real contribution to the community not merely in dealing with crime but also after the event.  I hope that we can develop a juvenile liaison force in the Garda Síochána on the lines laid down in the task force report.  It is difficult to understand why that type of comprehensive approach was not implemented by the previous Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased indeed with the contributions made to this debate by all who participated in it. Deputy Shatter as a new Deputy will forgive me for not taking up one or two points he raised.  He will appreciate that there is a time restriction on me.  If he wants to find out why more Garda members <Col N="2458" /> are not involved in the juvenile liaison force that can be explained very simply by his own Minister.  If men are to go into the juvenile liaison force those men must be taken out of uniform and as it is we have not enough men in uniform.</P>
      <P>A number of facts emerged from this debate which is the first debate I have heard in this House which could be described as non-political.  Nobody from this side or from the Government side was interested in scoring political points. That is as it should be because the problem is extremely serious.  There is a soaring crime rate and the best efforts of our Gardaí &mdash; and they are excellent &mdash; are not good enough to protect society and the people.  That is why I came to this House with the motion in my name and that of the Chief Whip of my party, to have a fair, proper, straightforward discussion of the extent of the problem so that we might come up with something worthwhile and constructive that would assist those who need protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was sad to hear during the course of the debate that despite the soaring crime rate which we all agree is there, the last report of the Garda Commissioner on crime has shown an even higher increase. Despite that it has been revealed to the House that the Garda Commissioner can expect only an extra 300 gardaí by the end of 1982.  If the situation is as serious as we all say it is, surely the Government will take upon themselves to look at this in a new light, to find a new approach, a new way to give the Garda Commissioner the additional manpower he requires immediately, and which he has said he does not want piecemeal.  He was given a commitment by the last Government that he would be given the 2,000 additional members of the force that he wants.  He was given that commitment because in his report to me in August 1980 he set out a blueprint to deal with subversive and ordinary crime.  He spelled out the requirements and needs for September and October 1980.  That commitment was given by me on behalf of the Government.  His complete recommendation and his full report were acceptable to us in Government at the time and would have been implemented <Col N="2459" /> by me or by my successor if we were still in Government.  I am satisfied that if we are going to give only 300 additional men by the end of 1982 we are not being as determined as we should be to stamp out crime.  That is why I said during the course of my earlier contribution to this debate that I had hoped we would have only 300 new gardaí trained by the end of 1982.</P>
    <P>Last April when I was discussing with the Garda Commissioner how best we could proceed as rapidly as possible to get more people into the force, he told me &mdash; and it should be on the files in the Department &mdash; that the Army Chief of Staff, who has since retired, told him there were no difficulties in giving him the Army barracks in Templemore which could be used for training Garda recruits. I accept what the Minister of State said that formal approval of this request has come through only now.  If it has taken seven months to get formal approval for something I was told could be done there and then, there is something wrong somewhere. I am not blaming anybody, but somebody needs to be shaken up a little so that progress can be made more quickly and the urgency of the situation can be attended to.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may not have been briefed on this point because it is not an area in which he normally works, but as long ago as 18 months or two years, I was told by the Garda Commissioner that the block in Templemore was a likely site, if we wanted it, for a Garda officer college.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Chair is alive to his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Tonight the Minister of State and last night the Minister for Justice said they were not convinced that the continuous increase in Garda members would help defeat crime.  If they believe that they are living in a fool's paradise.  Even with the additional 2,000 members who were recruited in my time there are still not enough members of the Garda.  Every Member of this House should know there are Garda divisions in this and other cities where there are not enough men to put even one, two or three men on street patrol.  One should look at the places like Ballyfermot, Ballymun and Tallaght and one will see the position.  There is not sufficient manpower in these areas because of men on the shift rotation system, men in court and men doing other duties which people like Deputy Shatter believe can be done by waving a stick and transferring men from one section to another.  It does not work like that.</P>
      <P>There is a need for more men on the force and it does not do justice to anybody in the House, particularly the Minister, to say he is not convinced more garda are needed.  If this is the advice he is getting he should look elsewhere, and he cannot look to a better person than the Garda Commissioner because he is the only professional man who can give him the benefit of his professional advice, and he says he wants an additional 2,000 members on the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I said I will be the Minister's best friend when he comes to this House looking for extra money to provide extra men, even 5,000, if the Garda Commissioner needs them.  I have heard it said that the Drug Squad are doing tremendous work.  They are.  Everybody knows <Col N="2461" /> that if people need money for drugs they will steal, rob, mug and do every criminal act to get that money.  The drug problem &mdash; and these are the words used by the Minister for Justice in an interview with a journalist of an evening paper about two months ago &mdash; is of crisis proportions. Even with the recent increase of an additional six members to the Drug Squad, the entire squad of 26 people is not big enough to deal with the problem. That is why I asked the Minister for Justice two weeks ago to set up a body, perhaps under the chairmanship of a member of the Judiciary, to inquire into the extent of the drug problem.  During my term in office, I am on the record as saying that nobody in the Department of Justice could tell me the extent of the drug problem in Ireland today.  If there is somebody now in the Department who could give me that information I would be glad to have his advice.  I would like the Government to set up a body to inquire into that area and see what could be done in this area.</P>
    <P>In our courts today people were charged with the manufacture and having in their possession drugs to the value of £2.5 million.  Imagine the havoc this would wreak on our young people if these drugs had not been found.  Of course, we only hear about the drugs that are found.</P>
    <P>It is common talk amongst the teaching profession and others involved in voluntary organisations that the drugs problem is far greater than we know.  We cannot tackle the problem as it should be tackled until we know the extent of the problem. I have suggested that a national campaign should be mounted by the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Government so that we can, as a matter of extreme urgency, deal with rising crime trends. We must involve in this campaign not just the Garda Síochána who are doing their best &mdash; and would do better if there were more men &mdash; but we must involve local authorities because they have an important role to play particularly in the ghetto areas in our cities and towns.  They have an important role to play in the areas of planning, development and the provision of recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>There are parts of this city &mdash; and it is a <Col N="2462" /> shame on everybody in this House and in society &mdash; where families of eight or ten are living in one or two rooms without the basic facilities of bathrooms or toilets. I have great sympathy with the Minister of State when he says children must be given guidance from the home.  That is a cry in the dark.  How can they get guidance from a home where the father has been unemployed for many years, and there is little likelihood he will ever get a job, where the mother too is unemployed, or she might be lucky enough to have an office cleaning job.  It is very difficult to get guidance there because these people have no hope for the future and they probably despair for their children's future.  Children of 12 and 14 years of age in these ghetto-like areas which we tolerate, steal cars the same as other children play football, and believe there is nothing wrong with that.  They steal handbags and snatch purses from old ladies causing terrible distress because they believe there is a need for them to steal and therefore they are entitled to steal.  This is their way of life.  They feel entitled to steal, especially if they believe they will not be caught.</P>
    <P>We must involve the Department of the Environment and the industrial training agencies in these areas because employment is an important factor in keeping people away from crime.  Our health and welfare agencies must also be involved because they have an important role to play.  Our educational agencies should teach these people to read and write because there is evidence that many of these children when leaving national schools cannot read or write.  We must pay attention to this.  We have to involve the voluntary organisations.  Those who have contributed to the debate have paid credit to those organisations for the tremendous work they are doing.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that in our cities and throughout the country we have voluntary organisations doing very important work and if they were not involved in it many more people would be suffering because of lack of attention of State Departments and State agencies.  A lot of work can be done.  If we do something now, something that perhaps we should <Col N="2463" /> have done ten years ago, we will probably have fewer people involved in crime.  If we had the courage, the wisdom and the determination to do something some years ago the situation would be different. Let me truthfully say, and I condemn myself before I will condemn any other man, if we had the interest in doing something things would be different.  If we did not have the interest ten years ago, maybe in this day and age we might have the interest to do something now.  I will give every help possible on behalf of my party to any worthwhile proposal that comes from the Government in relation to this area because I believe we owe it to the children in those ghetto areas who seemingly are nobody's children and who, as sure as day follows night, will be criminals unless we do something for them.</P>

      <P>It is sad that I have to drag the Minister back to discuss the subject matter of question No. 15 on today's Order Paper.  I raise this matter because I feel as a taxpayer, and in the interests of other taxpayers, I am entitled to query the Minister in relation to a promise he made here last week.  Last Thursday the Minister said he would have in the House before the Christmas Recess the necessary legislation to deal with the £9.60 per week scheme.  However, yesterday the Taoiseach informed the Leader of our party that the Government were not in a position to have the legislation debated before Christmas.  Like many others I believe that the wives of Ireland are not married to husbands who are so mean that they do not give them sufficient money to run the home.  The decision of the Government to leave wives with the option of claiming £9.60 per week from their husband's tax allowance and paying it to them in the form of a weekly or monthly allowance is an invasion of the privacy of Irish homes.  Earlier today I asked the Minister to tell the House the <Col N="2464" /> cost of implementing this scheme and I suggested a figure of £160 per person per year but the Minister denied that.  However, in recent weeks the Minister admitted in the course of interviews that it will cost the State approximately £24 million to administer it.  He also informed me that it would not be necessary to employ any extra people to implement the scheme.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that this scheme is totally discriminatory against those who do not wish to take part in it.  If a wife decides not to take up the option her husband will have to contribute towards the implementation of the scheme.  The Minister should tell the House if he proposes to grant an additional allowance to those couples who do not wish to partake in the scheme.  When I asked that question earlier I did not get any answer but it is possible that the Minister has his own reason for not doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister, and the Department, for outlining the position in this evening's newspapers.  It is possible that the decision to do so arose out of my supplementary questions today.  Tonight's <i>Evening Press</i> carries a headline, &ldquo;Husbands Not Hit In Wives' Tax Deal&rdquo;, and if that is <Col N="2465" /> the case I do not know where the Minister will get the money from.  The Sunday newspapers carry advertisements outlining those who qualify for the £9.60 per week.  I should like to know if the Minister is of the opinion that the wives of small farmers are entitled to receive that money.  Does the Minister feel that the wives of unemployed men are entitled to receive the £9.60?  Has the Minister considered unmarried mothers, deserted wives or disabled people?  Many others should have been included by the Minister if he was to fulfil the election promises.</P>
      <P>When will the Minister be in a position to bring the necessary legislation before the House?  It is an insult to the integrity of husbands and wives that the Minister has decided to distribute a portion of the income of the wage earner.  I wonder why the Minister did not make an allowance for the husband who stays at home while the wife goes out to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple reason is that when we first heard about the scheme we were told it would be paid only to people who were paying tax.  Then the next week we had another version.  We have had other versions weekly since the Dáil resumed.  I suppose there will be another version before it comes to the House.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to study the position now to ascertain whether he will make available to the husbands of wives who do not participate in the scheme an amount of money &mdash; I suggested a figure today of £160 per year as being the cost of administering the scheme; the Minister denied that but was not in a position to say how much it would cost to administer the scheme per applicant &mdash; and I ask him this evening to tell the House, if he has the figures, how much the cost will be per person to administer the scheme. I honestly believe that the figure I suggested of £160 per applicant as representing the cost of administering the scheme was very conservative.  I wonder what it cost to advertise the scheme in all the national newspapers on Sunday last. No doubt that will have to be included in the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies raised today the position of people who might be late in applying, who might wish to participate in the scheme after April next or enter on the day and make an application on the day. Will they be paid retrospectively or what will be their position?  I honestly believe, as do a lot of other people in this country, that the Minister and his Government are not in a position to say how they will operate the scheme because they do not know; they do not honestly know where they can get the necessary finance with which to operate it.  The Minister should let the people know that they have been conned.  I honestly believe and have found &mdash; as did other candidates during the last general election &mdash; that the promises, as made by the Deputy's party regarding the £9.60 were made to all and sundry.  Every woman who stayed at home was practically guaranteed that she would receive £9.60, and it was not that <Col N="2467" /> she would receive it from 6 April 1982 but that she would receive it within a month.  It is no wonder the Minister throws back his head and sighs because it is he who must now carry the can for the non-implementation of the £9.60 weekly.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to answer my question.

      <P>This infamous advertisement that appeared in some of the newspapers of late is unprecedented in State advertising, in so far as it pre-empts budgetary change in taxation structures.  The truth is that, under the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the Revenue Commissioners, or their mentors, the Department, could be charged with misleading advertising.  That is covered specifically in both those Acts.  The truth of the matter is that the very heading of this advertisement states that there will be a payment of £9.60 to certain people.  That is misleading and not true. This is a credit transfer and that in itself has been stated by the Minister for Finance.  I have no doubt but that the Government could end up in court before the week is out.  This advertisement is couched in the type of terminology not familiar to the ordinary citizen of this State, and for good a reason &mdash; to confuse them utterly.  It is also confusing to established accountants and people involved <Col N="2469" /> in monetary business in this country because it refers them to no Act of Parliament of this country at this time and consequently is misleading on that front also.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, when it is all boiled down, there will be no net increase of family incomes because of the provisions of this so-called legislation to come forward.  Therefore whether one has £10,000 or £8,000 a year coming in, one will be no better off after the deductions have been made from the husband to give to the wife.  And when people realise that they will give their answers to this blatant misjudgment as far as the Coalition are concerned.  As far as I am concerned it is selective, divisive and suggests, in paragraph 7, that the husband will be notified in due course that his income is being reduced by £9.60 a week to be given to his wife.  In other words, they are suggesting to the wives to apply for it behind their husbands' backs.  If that is not discriminatory I do not know what is.  It constitutes blatant discrimination on the part of the Minister for Finance.  He places a value on the status of some women in their homes but, on the women who will not get the £9.60 &mdash; who are the majority in this country &mdash; he places no value at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent television interview the Minister for Finance suggested, and sniggered at the suggestion, that certain people would not get the benefit because, he said, they had not paid into it.  He would not list those who would not qualify because certainly they will be more numerous than those who will qualify. The Minister's Department estimate that it will cost £17 million next year to implement the provisions of this lunatic policy, and that it will cost £24 million in subsequent years.  I suggest to the good Minister for Finance if he could find a few other deserving areas in which he could spend this money, it would be better than giving it out by way of administration, taking £9.60 from a husband's income to transfer it to his wife, and that is all that is involved.  It is an unnecessary intrusion into family arrangements.  It has no basis in honesty and does not recognise the role of women in the home.  He has no <Col N="2470" /> knowledge of the traditions of family life. Of course, he is not long married but in a little while he will have better knowledge in that area.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to say in response to the very amusing contribution from the other side of the House that the details of this £9.60 scheme were put before the people in the last general election and the people voted for it in substantial numbers. That fact was recognised in no less than an editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> which said the Government had a mandate to introduce the scheme since the scheme had commanded widespread support throughout the country.  It surprises me now that the Deputies who take their inspiration from no less a journal than <i>The Irish Press</i> find themselves in open disagreement with that noted journal in relation to its opinion of the £9.60.</P>

      <P>In the past the work of the wife in the home was recognised indirectly.  Either the husband got the tax <Col N="2471" /> allowance or additional dole money or additional disability benefit simply because he had a wife.  She never got any money.  He got the money.  Alternatively, she got money in respect of her children but she never got money in her own right on the basis of the State and the community recognising the contribution made by her in the home not only to her family but to the community at large.</P>
      <P>This Government put before the people in the last general election for the first time in the history of the State a proposal recognising the contribution made by these women and that proposal was massively endorsed by the people. Notwithstanding the criticisms and notwithstanding the carping by Deputies opposite we shall implement it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ellis had the audacity to describe as an insult the payment of money to wives at home, giving them what the husband had previously been claiming on their behalf and, perhaps using to no benefit of theirs.  He was speaking obviously on behalf of his party. Is that what he thinks of almost one half of his constituents?  Does he regard it as an insult that the community should recognise the contribution being made by women at home?  I do not regard it as an insult, and I and the Government intend to proceed with the scheme.  We have the support of all the parties supporting the Government and when a general election comes, whenever that may be, I am perfectly certain the people will recognise this scheme as a major initiative and will give the Government who introduced it the endorsement it will undoubtedly deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ellis pretended that there are situations in homes where women are never left without the money they need. I quoted yesterday when a debate took place on almost exactly the same terms from a letter I received the day before from a wife who claims in that letter that <Col N="2472" /> her husband has an income of £15,000 a year, that he pays some of the groceries, the milk and, I think, the bread and possibly for his own clothes and an odd item for her but never gives her a single penny to assist towards the maintenance of the home.  I am not saying that type of case is common, but there are such cases, and Deputies opposite know in their hearts and souls that there are such cases.  We know the £9.60 will not solve the problem but it is at least a token step towards assisting women in that unfortunate situation who, because of the bad state of many marriages, have no money to call their own.  I do not believe a scheme designed to meet that genuine social problem should be described, as it has been by the Deputies opposite, as an insult.  I believe the Deputy who referred to the scheme in those terms will regret the use of tha language in respect of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the timing of the legislation.  The Taoiseach made it clear that the legislation concerning this payment of £9.60 will be published before the Dáil goes into the Christmas recess.  He said he did not include this particular item in the list of items that had to be taken before the Christmas recess which he had given to the Leader of the Opposition but he made it clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that if times were available and the other legislation were enacted before the Christmas recess this legislation would be introduced.  He made it clear that all that was necessary from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the administration of the scheme was that the legislation should be published so that the Revenue Commissioners would know in precise detail in regard to each individual marginal case how the scheme would operate.  Deputy Flynn tried to question the propriety of the Government in advertising the scheme.  Did he want this <Col N="2473" /> scheme designed to benefit wives to be concealed from them?  Did he not want those who might apply be denied the information which would enable them to apply?  The scheme will come into operation on 5 April next.  Obviously Deputy Flynn does not want it to come into operation, since he suggests there should have been no advertising of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The publication of the scheme was necessary because it will take time to process the scheme.  If we were to wait until after the Budget and invite people to apply in the middle of February there would be no time to process the applications. There would then be many wives who would be entitled to benefit under the scheme who would not benefit because the administrative difficulties would not have been overcome.  The people who are entitled to this money will get it because we have advertised the scheme in good time and we are asking those eligible to apply now so that there will be adequate time in which to process all their applications.</P>
      <P>To return now to the question posed by Deputy Ellis, which is supposed to be the basis of this debate, although Deputies opposite, presumably with your consent, Sir, wandered far away from the terms of the question itself, the question as to whether or not women will have a choice.  Of course they will have a choice. If a woman does not want to apply there is no reason why she should apply.  If her husband is a taxpayer paying his full tax liability the fact that the wife does not apply will not put the family in any worse financial situation because he will be able to pay £9.60 a week less tax as a result of her decision not to take the money.  There is absolutely no element of compulsion on anyone to apply if she does not want to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2474" /> Deputy Ellis, although he and his colleagues sought to criticise at great length the fact that there was an advertisement in the public press, did not take the elementary precaution obviously of reading the advertisement they were so eloquent in condemning.  Deputy Ellis asked would a husband at home looking after the household, whose wife was out of work, be able to apply.  Deputy Ellis professed to be ignorant about this situation. I would refer Deputy Ellis to the footnote, and I quote: &ldquo;In cases where the wife is the breadwinner and the husband works fulltime in the family home the husband may avail of the one half of the tax&rdquo;.  I suggest Deputy Ellis reads the advertisement and refrains from coming in here to raise this question again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis tried to pretend I was being evasive when I denied the allegation made by him that this scheme would cost £160 for each applicant.  Such a suggestion is quite ludicrous.  The position is that we are not yet able to give a precise costing of the administration of the scheme for the very good reason that we are now in negotiation with staff representatives of the Revenue Commissioners to find agreement with them on an amicable basis as to how many additional staff will be needed for the administration of the scheme and, until such agreement has been reached, it will not be possible for us to put a cost on the total administrative expenses involved.</P>

    <P>Notes: (A) The Depot prices shown for sod peat (loose), crushed peat and baled briquettes are the ex-works prices.</P>
    <P>(B) The price shown is the price per tonne for domestic housecoal sold by CDL to bellmen in Dublin.</P>
    <P>(C)  There is no formal control over the retail prices and the delivered prices of sod peat (loose) and crushed peat.  The prices shown are the average delivered prices.</P>
    <P>(D) The maximum retail price for baled briquettes is controlled by order made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  However, no formal control is exercised over the delivery charge.</P>
    <P>(E)  CDL Dublin operates a price ex depot which is agreed with NPC though not subject to a maximum prices order and delivered to consumers at a price agreed in the same way.  The prices shown are the CDL prices.  Sales by bellmen, while not controlled, are monitored to ensure that the traditional relationship between their price and the CDL delivered price is maintained.</P>
    <P>The October 1980 maximum retail price fixed by order for baled briquettes sold in Dublin, Tullamore and Limerick was 48½p per bale and 50½p per bale for Letterkenny.  The corresponding current maximum retail prices are 61p per bale and 63p per bale respectively.  I have no information on the prices of baled briquettes sold in Newry, Omagh, Strabane and Derry on the dates mentioned.</P>

      <P>The additional revenue which would have accrued to Bord na Móna on the basis of 1,000 tonnes of loose sod peat sold ex works at £41 per tonne instead of £16.50 per tonne, i.e. the approved price in operation in October 1980, would be £24,500.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The approved ex-works price of sod peat charged by Bord na Móna in the period September 1980 to 5 November 1981 was £16.50 per tonne. The current approved price of £22.50 per tonne came into effect on 6 November 1981.  The quantity of sod peat sold ex works by Bord na Móna in the preiod in question was 463,932 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the inference in the question of loss to Bord na Móna and subsidy to hauliers, direct buyers etc. due to the price of sod peat being charged, falling below the Deputy's proposed equivalency to coal price, I would point out that that aspect touches on a whole <Col N="2347" /> range of factors including the marketing strategy and channels of distribution followed by Bord na Móna.  A review of these would be a prerequisite to any worthwhile comment.</P>
    <P>If one could assume a price of £41.00 per tonne as postulated by the Deputy, this would have yielded additional revenue of the order of £11 million.</P>

      <P>A multi-storey car park with 1,000 parking spaces, developed jointly by Dublin Corporation and Irish Life Assurance Company Ltd. in the ILAC Centre at Moore Street-Parnell Street, became operational last month.  I understand the corporation recently accepted a tender for the provision of a 500-space multi-storey car park at a site owned by the corporation at Waterford Street-Marlborough <Col N="2350" /> Street, on which it is expected that construction work will commence in autumn 1982.  I am further informed that arrangements are being made by the corporation to invite tenders by public advertisement for a further 500 space multi-storey car park on a corporation site at Drury Street&mdash;Lower Stephens Street.  The corporation hope that construction on this site will commence in late 1982 or early 1983.</P>
      <P>As the projects which I have mentioned involve private developers arranging for design, financing and construction, the question of providing Government grants towards capital costs does not arise.

      <P>Plans for the 38 house scheme at Shannon, which is now in progress, were prepared by the National Building Agency at the request of Clare County Council.  I have been informed by the agency that sketch plans for a scheme of 38 houses and 28 private sites at Kilrush have been submitted to the housing authority.  In addition the agency is about to start the preparation of plans for a further scheme on a site of about seven acres at Shannon on behalf of the council. I am not in a position to say when work on the latter two schemes will commence.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the up-to-date position on the implementation of the Derry-Donegal cross-Border communication link in supplement to a reply to a Parliamentary Question on 22 November 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Professor Dooge) James C.I. Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Professor Dooge)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the joint North-South progress report on this area which was issued by the two Governments in June 1980 and a copy of which is in the Dáil Library, a detailed account was given up to that stage of progress being made in the implementation of the Derry-Donegal Communications Study which was completed in November 1977.  The following account gives an updating of the 1980 progress report so far as Donegal in concerned.</P>
      <P>(A) Roads (Co. Donegal)</P>
      <P>The first stage of the road programme for North Donegal as recommended by the consultants is being implemented in full.</P>
      <P>1980 Financing</P>
      <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study area in 1980 included £383,000 for schemes on the Letterkenny-Derry Road (National Primary N13); £75,000 for Lifford-Pluck Cross (N14); £20,000 for the Lifford by-pass part 1; £25,000 for Letterkenny by-pass and £197,000 for the Stranorlar/Letterkenny route (including Kilmacrennan Bridge section).  In addition to the above grants totalling £700,000 a general block grant of £825,000 was allocated to Donegal County Council for 1980 for work at the discretion of the council on roads other than national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> 1981 Financing</P>
    <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study in 1981 include £310,000 on the Letterkenny-Derry Road (National Primary N 13); £20,000 for the completion of the Lifford by-pass, £50,000 for the Letterkenny by-pass; £150,000 for the Stranorlar/Letterkenny route; £30,000 for Kilmacrennan Bridge (South, N56), and £80,000 for strengthening works at various locations on the N14 and N56.  In addition to the above grants totalling £640,000 a general block grant of £1,170,000 has been allocated to Donegal County Council for 1981 for work on roads at the discretion of the council on roads other than national roads.</P>
    <P>The detailed position regarding the road improvements in Donegal is as follows:</P>
    <P>Inter-Urban Roads</P>
    <P>(i) Letterkenny-Pluck Cross, N13 National Primary Outline design has been completed, a detailed ground survery has been carried out and detailed road design is almost complete.  Subject to the availability of finance it is planned to commence construction in 1983.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Bridgend-Pluck Cross, N13 National Primary</P>
    <P>Two remaining sections of this route are included in current improvements programmes:</P>
    <P>a. One mile at Manorcunningham adjoining Letterkenny-Pluck Cross route.</P>
    <P>b. Newtowncunningham by-pass.</P>
    <P>Scheme a. Construction of the scheme is almost completed.</P>
    <P>Scheme b. Design stage for this scheme has been completed.  Land acquisition proceedings are in progress.</P>
    <P>(iii) Letterkenny-Kilmacrennan, N56 National Secondary</P>
    <P>Detailed design has been completed for 1½ mile section of this route adjoining Letterkenny.  Improvement work at a bridge on the route, south of Kilmacrennan, is completed and the bridge is open to traffic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2373" /> (iv) Strabane-Lifford, N14 National Primary</P>
    <P>The proposal involves a through pass at Lifford and includes two schemes</P>
    <P>a. The Strabane-Letterkenny link</P>
    <P>b. The Strabane-Ballybofey link</P>
    <P>Scheme a is open to traffic.</P>
    <P>Scheme b was not included in the programmed drawn up by the consultants but is however scheduled in the County Programme for the second half of the 1980s. Detailed design has been completed and land acquisition by CPO confirmed.</P>
    <P>(v) Urban through routes Letterkenny</P>
    <P>A scheme linking the Letterkenny/Pluck Cross and Letterkenny/Kilmacrennan Roads has been in progress since 1977 and was opened to traffic early in 1979.  Work is continuing on the improvement of Letterkenny-Pluck Cross road in the urban area of Letterkenny.  It is intended to complete this work in 1982.</P>
    <P>(B) Tourism co-operation &mdash; North-West Tourism Co-operation Group.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Derry/Donegal study this group, which was established in 1979, was the first body representative of both tourist boards and works with private and public sector interests in identifying tourism development and promotional needs of the combined area.  A North-West of Ireland-West of Scotland car ferry feasibility study was undertaken along with the planning of a new map-brochure covering counties Donegal, Derry and Tyrone.  This brochure was launched last March and was the second in a series of three brochures spanning the entire length of the Border.  The group is continuing to examine initiatives in the Derry-Donegal area.</P>
    <P>(C) Telecommunications</P>
    <P>As mentioned in the progress report of June 1980 the conversion to automatic working of 57 telephone exchanges in North Donegal is proceeding as part of a £6.5 million development programme for the improvement of telecommunications <Col N="2374" /> in the area.  Six exchanges were converted to automatic functioning in 1980.</P>
    <P>So far in 1981 five further exchanges have been converted and it is planned to convert two more before the end of the year.  It is hoped to convert all the remaining manual exchanges within the next two years.  Methods of speeding up the conversion programme are currently being considered.  Some of the delays to the programmed were caused by an industrial dispute by the equipment contract installation staff early in 1981.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Sligo radio link was commissioned in March 1981 and it is hoped to bring the Sligo-Letterkenny link to service before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to provide direct dialling between most automatic exchanges in the Republic and all Northern Ireland exchanges in 1982.</P>
    <P>(D) Postal Services</P>
    <P>In relation to the postal services, routing of mail to and from Dublin via Northern Ireland was restored in July 1980. This has resulted in early delivery of mail to North Donegal and later times for the dispatch of mail for North Donegal.</P>
    <P>(E) Air Transport</P>
    <P>The cross-Border communications study recommended that the Governments should jointly examine in greater detail the possibility of establishing a Dublin-Derry air link initially with financial support made available to the selected operator for a trial period. Although the British Government were unwilling to jointly subsidise such an air link, the Irish Government decided in March 1981 that negotiations be initiated with an airline company to provide a scheduled service between Dublin and Derry with a subsidy from the Irish Department of Transport.  Since 8 May 1981 Avair Ltd. a wholly Irish-owned company has been operating a scheduled service between Dublin and Derry, two return flights daily Monday to Friday, inclusive.  The fare fixed at the beginning of the operation was IR£24 per single flight; this has been increased to IR£26.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" /> (F) Public Passenger Transport</P>
    <P>Prior to the private takeover of the Lough Swilly Bus Company the Irish Government had been providing short-term support for the company through CIE.  This bus company provides road passenger services from Derry serving the northern half of Donegal and it is virtually the only public transport service in that area.  The Northern Ireland Department of the Environment have consistently maintained that they are not in a position to provide financial assistance to the company.  The assistance offered to the Lough Swilly Bus Company was extended to the new owner of the company in May 1980 and discussions between CIE and the Lough Swilly Bus Company have been continuing as to the amount of financial support necessary for the continuation of road passenger operations.</P>
