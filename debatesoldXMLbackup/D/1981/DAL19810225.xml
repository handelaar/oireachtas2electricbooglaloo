    <Title>Turf Development Bill, 1980: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Before I reported progress yesterday evening I said I welcomed this Bill and I thought it was opportune that it should be introduced at this time because of the scarcity of fuel and the very high price of it.  I want to put on record that in my opinion it is now an economic proposition to develop our bogs, especially medium sized bogs, in parts of the country where Bord na Móna do not operate. They are doing a good job in the development of large bogs but they are not <Col N="161" /> able to meet the demand for their products. It is impossible for fuel merchants to open an account with Bord na Móna. There is a long queue of people wishing to purchase turf and briquettes from Bord na Móna who cannot cope with the demand.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to put this Bill into operation as soon as possible.  I have more than a general interest in its operation and the work it sets out to do because in my constituency there are sizeable tracts of bog lying undeveloped for many years.  This Bill has been anticipated in County Cavan because in the western end of the county a small society was formed.  Last year that society developed about 7.000 tons of turf in west Cavan.  All of it was not removed from that particular bog because the road to it was not completed.  If satisfactory grants are made available quickly, that society hope to take 14.000 tons of turf from the bog this year.  That is a sizeable operation and it is particularly useful when fuel is so scarce and expensive.</P>
      <P>In the eastern part of County Cavan, in the Mountnugent area, a very considerable amount of money has been spent by one man in preliminary work in developing a bog there.  He intends to spend another £60,000 to purchase the machinery necessary to go into turf production there.  He is frustrated at the length of time it is taking to get into operation. He has submitted plans to the county development team and through them to the Central Development Committee.  He has not yet been able to get his plans sanctioned.  If he had he would be in production by now.  The Central Development Committee are satisfied that the project of the person I mentioned is good.  They are satisfied it is viable and workable on a commercial basis.  Unfortunately, although he submitted plans as far back as last November, the matter has not been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to all concerned, it is possible that the change of policy in the Department of Energy and the decision to introduce this Bill has slowed up the matter.  I appeal to the Minister and the Department to get on with that task as soon as possible.  We are now approaching <Col N="162" /> the turf winning season and unless such people are paid the grants, or at least are sanctioned for them, another year's harvesting of turf will be missed. The Minister should give a general sanction, or a sanction in principle, to people who have applied for grants so that they can get on with this year's harvesting.</P>
    <P>I make that appeal to the Minister because unless sanction is given frustration will kill the operations and plans of many people.  It is important that he bears in mind the danger of losing another year's harvesting.  I understand that the Minister plans to facilitate the production and development of bogs and turf by grants and loans.  The Bill deals extensively, almost exclusively, with grants and there is not any enabling provision in it to pay loans unless indirectly under section 10, which relates to roads.  That section can be construed to enable the board to construct roads on certain terms, including the payment of money. The Minister should deal with the question of loan finance under this.  The Bill also enables grants to be given for the purchase of machinery but it specificially excludes &mdash; this may be a Committee Stage point &mdash; road transport vehicles. Section 2 (6) states:</P>
    <P>(6) In this section &ldquo;turf development equipment&rdquo; includes any vehicle, other than a road transport vehicle or any part thereof (or anything designed for use on a road transport vehicle), machine, machinery, appliance or equipment (or any part thereof), whether driven by mechanical power or not, which is designed or intended by its manufacturer to be used to extract turf for fuel or to move turf, when so extracted, to loading points for subsequent transport by road or rail.</P>
    <P>That definition is quite wide as far as turf machinery is concerned but it is equally wide in its exclusion of road transport vehicles of any description, shape or make.  If it is not amended it will inevitably exclude some necessary machinery from that grant scheme.  It must be remembered that converted tractors are necessary in the bog to get the turf from <Col N="163" /> one place to another and to transport it to the road where it can be loaded for delivery home.  Such vehicles are specially constructed, have a four-wheel drive and double wheels all round.  The Minister and his advisers should try to remedy that before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain a grant a person must be the owner of a bog or have turbary rights.  From my work as a politician and as a practicing solicitor for many years I am aware that the title to large areas of bog is very uncertain and unsettled.  It is a regular jigsaw puzzle and it is an impossibility to sort out some of the title of bogland.  In the medium and long term, and in order that the bog lands of the country may be exploited and developed, Bord na Móna should be given compulsory rights to acquire abandoned areas of bog when the owners cannot be traced.  These areas may not necessarily be suitable for the boards purposes because they may not be big enough.  Such areas are capable of development by private individuals and Bord na Móna, having acquired them &mdash; I do not say that they should acquire the fee simple of the land but the turbary rights &mdash; should have power to lease the lands out to the private sector for development. Unless some such power is taken there will not be a complete and proper development of our bogs.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the turbary rights of a bog may be owned by one person, one dozen people or hundreds of people who may live miles away.  In the old days strips of bog were given by landlords in conjunction with large tenanted holdings. Each holding had a bog supplied and it was big enough to provide fuel for the owner of the land.  In many cases the owner of the bog has lost interest in it. That matter should be looked into as soon as possible.  When the turf is extracted from such land it should revert to the owner because it is always useful for tillage, particularly the growing of vegetables.  The Minister should tell the House whether grants will be paid or made available later this year for machinery <Col N="164" /> purchased now to harvest this year's turf.</P>
    <P>I want now to revert to a point I made yesterday, that is, that the more I think about it the less sense I can see in confining the higher grants to co-operative societies.  The Bill provides for grants of 60 per cent to qualified societies and 45 per cent to individuals.  I cannot see the sense in that.  This will cause delay but that is not the worst of it.  If the higher rate of grant is confined to co-operative societies that will mean that such societies will have to be formed this year, something that will take some time particularly when undertaken by people who are uninitiated in that type of thing.  Certainly by the time such societies are formed this year's turf harvesting season will be over. As well as that, everybody knows that even in well regulated co-operative societies sometimes trouble can arise amongst the members.  At the time of the formation of the society people may have the best of intentions and their relationships may be good but it may not be long before differences occur, rows commence and that sort of thing.  Furthermore, there are many private individuals who would prefer to operate on their own, who would go into this business on a commercial scale, if they were given sufficiently generous grants.  A grant of at least 60 per cent should be made available to anybody who submits plans, who satisfies Bord na Móna that he is equipped to do the job, will do it, is owner of the bog or who has turbary rights.</P>
    <P>I believe that the main object of this Bill is to have more turf produced for fuel.  It should not matter to the Minister &mdash; and it certainly does not matter to the country &mdash; whether the fuel is produced by a private individual, be he called John Brady, because that is a Cavan name, by a co-operative society, a limited company or anybody else.  I cannot see the sense in this and perhaps the Minister would clarify the position for me.  These societies are cropping up all over the country. In the heel of the hunt they will lead to chaos because many of them will not observe the statutory regulations governing them.  I do not know but I suspect <Col N="165" /> that it is a continental phenomenon creeping in here.</P>
    <P>In all sincerity I would urge the Minister to amend this section of the Bill on Committee Stage and provide that any person who satisfies Bord na Móna that he intends doing the job, who has both the know-how and turbary rights, should qualify for a grant of 60 per cent.  My only doubt in this respect is whether or not a grant of 60 per cent is sufficiently high.  I agree that it is a substantial grant but, as I endeavoured to put on the record yesterday, people went out of turf production. It was found to be uneconomic because the cost of drainage, road building and machinery made it prohibitive. Now with the shift away from cheap energy, its scarcity and enormous cost, turf production is becoming economic. Indeed it is in the interests of the country from the balance of payments point of view that we should not be sending vast sums of money out of the country for energy until such time as we have utilised all the energy we can produce at home. Even if one has to tempt people generously to do the job again surely it is better to spend that money at home providing jobs and producing fuel rather than sending it to the sheiks of the oil producing countries.  I have no doubt that that constitutes sound economics and common sense.  The only doubt I have is whether or not the grants being provided are sufficient. Certainly a grant of 45 per cent will not encourage people to undertake the task.  It should be 60 per cent payable right across the board, to private individuals and even to commercial companies who arc prepared to spend the money in that way.  I must repeat that it does not matter who does the job. who extracts the turf, as long as good turf is produced. put on the market and as long as that turf reduces the cost of living here and does something to correct our adverse balance of payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. The extensive tour of the country recently undertaken by the Minister and his many public statements instilled an awareness into our people of the problems <Col N="166" /> confronting us in relation to energy in the future.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill will afford many people an opportunity to provide for their fuel needs and perhaps also those of industry in the future.  It is remarkable that we have over one million acres of bogland in this country, 50 per cent of which is capable of development. The Bill is directed at such development. The opportunity now exists for many people to develop bogland formerly inaccessible because of lack of finance in respect of drainage and road building. The Bill specifies that such development must be undertaken either by co-operatives or individuals.  We are aware that there are many bogland areas in respect of which it may be difficult to get co-operation amongst people in order to avail of the grants being provided for their development.  This means that much of our bogland with potential for development will remain undeveloped.</P>
      <P>In the introduction to the Bill the Minister said that the Bill indicates that applicants who apply to Bord na Móna for a grant towards the cost of the proposed bog development must be either the owner, including lessees of the bog. or those with a right to turbary over it.  I would ask the Minister to consider people who are prepared to undertake the development of bogs with no established ownership or turbary rights.  I know from experience in my own county that there are many such bogs and there are people who would be prepared to develop them with the aid given in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bog development can provide employment in the areas where it takes place.  I am glad that Bord na Móna are lending their expertise to the planning and setting up and investigation of applications for bog development.  We all appreciate the great contribution that Bord na Móna have made to the development of this great natural resource and the contribution they have made to the economy.  I have no doubt that their involvement will ensure that the development will be carried out properly.  That is important.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that Bord na Móna would consider not only <Col N="167" /> the many small bogs in the areas where they are now operating but that there would be a fair and equitable involvement in all the bogs in the country.  Most of the bogland in Donegal is mountain bog which does not lend itself to Bord na Móna's plans for development.  I would hope that Donegal and other similar areas, where there are bogs with potential, will get due consideration.  There is a vast bog urea in the Innishowen peninsula which is worthy of consideration and hopefully the people will avail of the opportunities that this Bill presents to develop the bogs there.  I might add here that consideration should be given to the establishment in that area of a small briquette factory which would provide fuel not only for that area but also for the city of Derry which is convenient to it, and would also give much needed employment in the area.</P>
    <P>It is indicated in the Bill that the county councils and county development teams will also be involved.  We know that the councils, through the local improvement schemes, have given assistance to many people for the opening of roads and for drainage to provide access to the bogs.  In cases where co-operation cannot be got amongst all the people for a particular development, would it be possible to have the work carried out by the local authorities so that unless areas complied completely with the regulations they would not be able to get grants to develop the bogs but that if the work was undertaken by the local authority, access would be made available?  I note that the Minister does not intend to cut across the moneys at present being supplied to the local authorities for the local improvement schemes and I welcome this.  I hope that there will be no diminution of funds in the local authority local improvement schemes because these schemes have been used particularly in Donegal and counties like it for opening rights of way to bogland.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister will have the right to review any application that may have been rejected by Bord na Móna.  I hope that we will not run into difficulties which would hinder this development.  It <Col N="168" /> is important to get the scheme off the ground quickly.  There is an awareness of the position in relation to energy supplies that there is a willingness on the part of the people to avail of the opportunities afforded for bog development.  I have no doubt that when the Bill passes all stages there will be a demand for grants in every county that has bog for development. The grant of 45 per cent for the individual and 60 per cent for the co-operatives is a fair and reasonable amount.  People will grasp this opportunity to get out the turf and perhaps add to their income.  There are many people who cannot develop their bogland because of lack of grant aid for roads and drainage and they will now be in a position to use this resource and get financial benefit from it.</P>
    <P>It is important that at this time the local authorities should be asked to compile and submit to the Department a list of all the bogland in their areas so that an up-to-date register can be made of the area and the conditions attached to the bogs. As various figures show, many complex regulations are attached to many of the boglands here and difficulties caused by these may not be easily overcome.  These are the points that may hinder development in particular areas and I would assume that when this Bill is passed and in operation it will be only a forerunner to the full development of this natural resource.  I would hope that people who claim certain rights on particular stretches of undeveloped bogland will co-operate with the people who are prepared to make an input into the development of those areas.  It will be the duty of every public representative and everybody who has an interest in the affairs of this country to give encouragement to the development, and every effort should be made to utilise to the full the resource that is in every county.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and hope that people will avail of the opportunities in it and that this vast national resource that we have untouched in our country will be developed to the full.  From it we know that jobs can be created and many people who have claims and rights to boglands that they are not able to develop at present <Col N="169" /> will have added value to their property from which they will be able to benefit financially.  I hope that we will benefit from the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>One could say that the humble sod has come of age with the introduction of this very important Bill into the House.  For long enough the bogmen of the country were jeered at in a certain sense, but their time has now come to play their part in the development of our country.  The fact that the Bill has been introduced at all hears testimony to the speeches and contributions made by Deputies from different sides of this House over the years in relation to this very important matter which people have felt for a long time should have been introduced ages ago.  I compliment the Minister for having introduced it.  In his Department of Energy he has brought an awareness to people right across the country of the importance of energy-saving and not using too much energy wastefully, and this awareness is needed in present economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill is very important, as many Deputies have already stated, due to the enormous awareness of the value of peat and the fact that where peat production increased the import bill for usage of oil could be cut drastically.  If the figures are to stand up to the Minister's opening address then the country will save something over £20 million in oil imports this year, and that would be a very welcome trend.  The <i>Bord na Móna 34th Report 1979/80</i> gives an indication of Bord na Móna's feeling towards turf development and further peat production.  Most of the bogs that have been taken in hand and developed by Bord na Móna are of the raised type and. with the exception of the Owen-inny project in County Mayo, all of the proposed development so far has been on raised bogs which means that the thrust for further peat development must take place on bogs that are not raised and that are on very difficult terrain, sometimes with very steep slopes and mostly in the wetter part of the country.  Most of the remaining bog lies in the western counties. Then up to 45.000 acres gross in that <Col N="170" /> region is divided, as the report states. into 200 different sections ranging in size from 50 acres to slightly over 2.000 acres and, as I have said, much of it in very difficult terrain indeed.</P>
    <P>The fact that bog development has taken place in this country for the last couple of hundred years indicates its value and importance in our traditions and our whole style of life.  The fact that it has taken place haphazardly has meant that many bogs have been wasted by bad drainage, poor cutting and lack of proper planning.  This is, I am glad to say, provided for in the Bill, in that if grants are to begiven out by Bord na Móna a proper plan for the development of the bogs in question must be produced.  It has been stressed that these plans and application forms should be simple and I trust that that point has been taken by the Minister and his Department, because simplicity in relation to this matter means expedition, one can get down to work much faster if we do not have to allow these applications and development plans to go for intensive scrutiny from one Department to another.  The board intend to develop 1,300 acres of bogland in Geesala, County Mayo, as a matter or priority and that is a welcome trend to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>The fact that Bord na Móna have been chosen at all to allocate the grants will be seen in many quarters as not realistic because this is the agency who will be giving out the grants and they could be allocating grants to would-be competitors in the field of turf development.  I realise that private developers and co-operative development would be on much smaller areas of bog than Bord na Móna are used to dealing with, but the fact that they do allocate grants would mean that they would be giving grants to potential developers in areas that they themselves might be developing later when the bigger areas of bogland have been dealt with under their authority.  Also the fact that the grants differ in relation to allocation size. 45 per cent for individuals and 60 per cent for co-operatives, indicates some distinction between the potential of this type of development by the Department.</P>
    <P>As most of the bogland is contained in <Col N="171" /> the western counties it is not really fair to distinguish or differentiate between individuals and co-operatives, as many co-operatives can run into difficulties after some time with individual differences within the co-operatives.  The fact that the boglands themselves often run into and border on boglands that have been developed by Bord na Móna would indicate that if a purpose of the Bill is to develop as much bog as possible in the shortest time and increase turf production, the same level of grants should be given to co-operatives and individuals.  In that context the western counties are recognised as far away as Brussels as being severely disadvantaged and anybody who has any practical dealings with saving turf realises it is more difficult to save turf in the west than the east. because it is much wetter.  The average rainfall on the west coast as against the east varies from something like 1,600 millimetres to 2,000 millimetres of rainfall on the west coast as against 800 millimetres to 1.200 millimetres on the east coast.  Bord na Móna have run into difficulties in this respect.  They have a period for turf cutting in respect of milled peat which is almost totally dependent on weather conditions.</P>
    <P>A few summers ago, when it rained almost constantly, the amount of milled peat produced by Bord na Móna on the west coast dropped drastically.  When an individual or a co-operative decide to apply for a grant, having drafted their development plan, submitted their applications and been allocated a grant, they then start turf production and find, due to circumstances beyond their control. that the estimated figure which was set at the beginning for production falls away drastically.  That is a point which is not covered in the Bill.  The Department have failed to see the significance of very bad weather conditions on the potential turf production on the west coast.  It is recognised as a disadvantaged area, even as far away as Brussels, and higher levels of grants are given to western areas to encourage and create incentives for people to come into these areas of production. Because of this the grants for co-operatives <Col N="172" /> and individuals in the 12 western counties should be increased either to 60 per cent flat rate or to 60 per cent and 75 per cent, if you still want to differentiate between the co-operatives and the individual.  In many cases the individual who takes the initiative deserves at least as high a grant as the co-operative.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna as the allocating body for these grants might run into difficulties. They will be allocating grants to bodies, organisations or individuals who would be competitors of the board in the field of turf development.  The amount allocated for this year under the Bill is £1 million.  That figure will not be sufficient. but it is a start and is welcome. When administration costs are taken from that £1 million and they get down to doing work for the turf cutting season. the value of the money allocated will have fallen.</P>
    <P>The £300 million development for the west of Ireland under the aegis of the EEC also takes into account infrastructural developments.  Under the terms of that clause from the EEC. bog roads and bog drainage would probably be eligible for consideration also.  Have the Department given any consideration to tying up the two schemes in the context of development and improvement of access to bogs?  Many of the bog areas in the west are in such a condition at present that people cannot get in or out because of lack of access, very poor drainage and haphazard cutting down through the years.  Many of the access roads only need minimal improvements because the season is very short and the roads only carry a certain amount of traffic for a specific period.</P>
    <P>The local improvements scheme under many of the local authorities gives consideration to bog road development and access, but priority must naturally be given to laneways which lead to houses. I recognise the fact that, although my own county probably got the largest allocation under local improvements schemes moneys last year, it is still inadequate for the amount and area of ground to be covered.  Although the Minister has made reference on several occasions to the local improvement scheme, no priority <Col N="173" /> can be accorded to bog road development by county councils because of the inadequacy of funds and because they come under tremendous pressure to ensure that roads leading to inhabited areas are improved.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister clarify in his reply what connection Údarás na Gaeltachta have with the Turf Development Bill. with the Central Development Committee and with Bord na Móna?  Many of the boglands in the west, particularly in Galway, Mayo and Donegal, are in Gaeltacht areas.  There is a scheme which used to be operated by Gaeltarra Éireann, which is at present operated by Údarás na Gaeltachta, whereby a grant can be applied for in respect of machinery for reclamation by individuals and co-operatives. In some Gaeltacht areas it is only due to a special clause in the Act that in quite exceptional circumstances an individual can apply for a grant to be allocated to him in respect of reclamation works.  Having discussed this with people in An Foras Talúntais, agricultural instructors and county development officers concerned, I know that much of the reclamation work to be carried out is on bogland that could otherwise be developed. You have to decide whether to develop it from an agricultural point of view or increasing turf production for a number of years until it is cut away to a level where you could afterwards develop it for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputies have stressed the point that plans and application forms should be very simple.  I trust that point will be taken by the Minister and his Department. The Forestry Division have acquired vast areas of land down through the years.  This is a reserve source of energy which will help in the years to come.  In fact, Bord na Móna seem to be competing in the west with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry for the acquisition of land.  Near Bellacorick the Department have acquired from private individuals several thousand acres of potential bog development area over the past few years.  I am not quite sure what level of competition exists, but I know that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry have difficulty in acquiring the <Col N="174" /> amount of land which they require for planting purposes.  I do not know whether the Bill will be expanded to include the possible compulsory acquisition of vast areas of bogland that have been held by families down through the years but which have been idle for many generations. There is distinct competition between the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Bord na Móna for such land.  I should like to have the Minister's views on this point.</P>
    <P>The area of bogland to be developed is 1.1 million hectares.  It is fair to say that the various youth employment schemes that were introduced by successive Governments, though introduced as schemes of a temporary nature, have come to play an important part in the development of our employment strategy. I am confident that this situation will continue and that the schemes will become a permanent feature of Government activity for the foreseeable future at least.  The point is that there is scope for male employment particularly in the context of this Bill.  In reply to a question from me I was glad that the Minister indicated that the biomass project for the Bellacorick district of County Mayo has entered its second phase.  That is very welcome news in the light of rumours that were circulating to the effect that the project was to be scrapped so far as that area was concerned.</P>
    <P>While we are speaking of the Bellacorick area I would urge again the setting up there of a briquette factory.  This is something that I have been advocating for some years past.  Already there is a peat burning station there for the purpose of the generation of electricity.  The replies given by various Ministers and by various Departments in respect of this question indicate that the bogland in the area is not suitable in terms of the setting up of a briquette factory.  One of the reasons given is insufficiency of bogland.  I have had consultations with shopkeepers, with supermarket owners and with people who deal in fuel and they all tell me that the tonnage of briquettes being brought into the county is unbelievable having regard to the amount of bogland in County Mayo.  If the Minister or any of <Col N="175" /> his officials travel from Keenagh to Blacksod and then through Belderrig to Ballycastle, they will find a complete blanket of bogland.  Surveys undertaken by the research station at Glenarnoy some years ago indicate that the depth of bogland in that area varies from as little as five feet to as deep as 180 to 200 feet. That is a colossal depth.  It is bogland that could be developed.  In these circumstances surely the setting up of a briquette station is warranted.  The employment potential of such a project is enormous.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification scheme completed recently in that area provided a good deal of male employment.  People were engaged on that scheme who had never previously had the opportunity of working.  The Minister should give this matter further consideration.  I am informed also by officials of the ESB that the turbine burners in the peat burning station are sufficient in size to cater simultaneously for a briquette station.  I hope, therefore, that this whole question will be reconsidered.  The employment potential of such a project would be acclaimed widely in this area which has been ravaged by emigration for generations.  If, after further surveys have been undertaken, the depths of bog to which I have referred are confirmed, steps should be taken to go ahead with the project as was the case in Littleton in County Tipperary, regardless of the situation in which much of the land is privately owned, or is owned by relatives of former owners or is in the hands of the Department or of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the minimal development of many of these bogs is required from the point of view of access.  Perhaps the Land Commission have by now prepared schemes for the allocation of all lands held by them in County Mayo.  The figures that are available indicate that several thousands of acres there are still held by the Land Commission.  From discussions I have had with officials of the commission I understand that much of these lands comprise bogland that has not been marked for allocation because the commission are of the opinion that it would be better to allocate these lands as <Col N="176" /> bog plots, to create new accesses and to let the plots to people who would be only too willing to utilise them.  To borrow a phrase, turf has been part of all we are. There must be thousands of people in the west who are having great difficulty in making ends meet.  The cost to them of two fills of heating oil per year is colossal in terms of their incomes.  That is why they would benefit greatly from being able to cut turf for themselves.  In addition, we would be helping to reduce our imports bill by way of a reduction in oil consumption.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister also whether moneys may be made available for the creation of access roads and for the improvement of existing roads.  In this way the Land Commission would be enabled to go ahead with such work and could let plots to people who would be willing to use them and also to people who may have had plots in the past but which have long since been cut away. This is a problem in the Louisburg area where for generations families have cut turf but where much of the bogland is now useless.  The Land Commission hold vast areas of bogland in that district but they say that moneys are not available to enable them to undertake the necessary works.</P>
    <P>Each year from about January until March public representatives are approached by the people of the area who wish to know whether the Land Commission have bog plots for letting. These people are interested in leasing portions of bog so that they may provide themselves with fuel.</P>
    <P>The Bord na Móna report indicated that the consumption and production of peat are related to the weather generally and to the rainfall level in particular.  The Forestry and Wildlife Service are very active in the area of conservation and perhaps they would not welcome too much disturbance of vast areas of ground that have been idle for centuries.  I do not know whether there will be a limit set in terms of the development of areas of bogland but should this not be the case there might be difficulty between the Forestry and Wildlife Service and the developers, either individuals, co-operatives <Col N="177" /> or Bord na Móna, from the point of view of disturbance of the ecology of an area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general principles of the Bill.  Some things have not been recognised by the Department, such as the fact that we are a disadvantaged area in the west, recognised as such and that the level of grants should be higher, that Bord na Móna will be allocating grants to would-be competitors.  I should like clarification of the various points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liornsa cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  Ar an gcéad dul sí'os ba mhaith liom a rá gurb é mo thuairirnse gur Bille tábhachtach an Bille seo agus dá bhrí sin cuirim fáilte roimhe.  I do not wish to detain the House but the subject matter of the Bill is of very great personal interest to me.  I regard the Bill as very significant in perhaps three ways, but its over-all significance should not be lost sight of.  First, it represents a logical development of one of our very important national resources. Secondly, the development of these resources in the manner here envisaged represents a significant contribution to the pursuit of alternative energy sources, a matter which is engaging the mind and attention of every western county at present and for some time past.  The problem of researching and developing alternative energy sources is the greatest challenge facing the western world today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the world context, or perhaps in the EEC context, this Billl may appear to be small and insignificant.  But it is important and indicates that an effort is being made to explore ways and means of developing alternative energy sources.  I was impressed by one figure in that context. I was very interested to find one particular figure in the Minister's speech when he said that turf production by the private sector is at present running at about one million tonnes per annum, 313,000 tonnes approximately of oil equivalent representing a saving to the economy of almost £50 million in oil equivalent. These figures indicate the enormous potential there is for developing alternative sources of energy.  We are very fortunate that we have this natural resource in our turf and bogland.  This has been <Col N="178" /> recognised long ago and in this context it is only right that tribute should be paid to Bord na Móna for their tremendous work in developing this natural resource since their establishment.</P>
    <P>I am personally glad that the Bill and the scheme proposed in it do not propose to supplant the work of Bord na Móna and I am particularly pleased that Bord na Mona are to be involved in the administration of the scheme.  It would be detrimental to the success of the scheme if a new administrative structure were to be set up.  Inevitably Bord na Móna must be involved in the development now proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister gives projections of the potential for development, the amount of bogland available and of potential employment, for which he cites a figure of 800.  I suppose it would not be possible to give &mdash; perhaps it is stated elsewhere or may have been already referred to &mdash; an estimated capital cost for this development based on the amount of bogland available.  The Minister spoke of 50 per cent of potential bogland being exploited.  I wonder what the envisaged capital development cost would be and the total amount of grants.  It may not be possible to quantify this accurately.</P>
    <P>My reason for raising this is that within the EEC there has been over the past year in particular considerable attention devoted to the vital question of developing alternative energy sources.  That implies, of course, alternatives to oil. Much discussion has taken place on this subject in the EEC and speech after speech has been made about it.  There is an energy committee in the Parliament and several proposals have been put forward that EEC institutions should assist in the development of alternative energy sources.  I wonder if the Minister has had discussions with his colleagues on the Council of Energy Ministers on this matter. I believe the EEC are serious about it and concern has been expressed there time and again about the need to encourage and assist any project for the development of alternative energy sources.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister looked into the possibility of securing EEC aid for this development? I think he should.  He may have <Col N="179" /> explored the possibility.  I am also aware that my colleague, Seán Flanagan, has an involvement in the energy committee in the Parliament and has been pursuing possibilities there.  I am, of course, aware of the appalling budgetary mess in the EEC at present and the fact that existing financial resources are now almost exhausted and that the EEC is inhibited in the launching or financing of important schemes, such as schemes for the development of alternative energy sources.  I know there is a financial problem, but nevertheless I think the project represented in the Minister's Bill now before the House is one that should be logically eligible for general and substantial EEC aid.  That is why I raised the point.  I have been asking if there is any estimate of the total development cost &mdash; in other words, the private input as well as grants.  Let us take a figure of £10 million.  My point is that if the EEC are serious in encouraging member countries to develop alternative energy sources, at least half that sum should be available from the EEC institutions and perhaps the Europment Investment Bank or other sources.  I am raising the point in a totally non-contentious way.  I believe the EEC should assist this type of development.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on this.</P>
    <P>I am interested in this Bill firstly in the EEC context and secondly because over the past 12 months I have been consulted by a group of people in what I call my Munster Euro constituency who are proposing to develop bogland on the Galway-Clare border.  I helped these people as best I could and brought them some months ago to the Minister's Department, where we met one of the senior officials who was most helpful. What these people were proposing was identical with what the Minister is proposing in the Bill.  I got an insight into the actual mechanics of the thing and the problems which may be encountered.  In those discussions I made the point that I sincerely hoped that grant aid would be available.  These three or four people who are proposing to develop a substantial acreage of bogland hoped that grant aid would be available.  The cost of machinery <Col N="180" /> and equipment for bogland development is very high and it could not be done successfully without grant aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made the valid point about the differential offered in the Bill in the grant level of 60 per cent to societies and 45 per cent to private individuals, but I think I know why the differential has been suggested.  However, a 15 per cent differential might be a bit too large.  The type of development proposed in the Bill lends itself admirably to co-operative development.  I imagine the word &ldquo;society&rdquo; mentioned in the Bill means co-operative.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of my term of office as Minister for the Gaeltacht, one of the Gaeltacht co-operatives undertook this type of development in Connemara &mdash; if I remember correctly it was Comharchumann Cois Fharraige.  I hope that they have gone ahead with this development. They were proposing to buy machinery to develop bogland west of Spiddal.  I would be in favour of encouragement being given for the formation of local co-operatives for this type of job, and of a special inducement being given for co-operative development where the work lends itself to it.  Perhaps the Minister would meet Deputy Fitzpatrick half way with a five per cent differential, giving 55 per cent to private enterprise and 60 per cent to the co-operatives.  Along the western seaboard and in the Gaeltacht region in particular there are 20 or 25 local community development co-operatives in a area with an enormous amount of bogland. I hope that the Gaeltacht co-operatives will respond to this incentive and explore the possibility of taking on projects for turf development in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Outside the Gaeltacht areas, there is also enormous potential.  As the Minister is aware, the Gaeltacht co-operatives are assisted by Roinn na Gaeltachta in the form of managerial grants and so forth. The Gaeltacht co-operatives are generously grant-aided by the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I have always supported this and will support any measures of grant aid to the Gaeltacht co-operatives. However, outside the Gaeltachts there are no such incentives available.  In view <Col N="181" /> of the fact that co-operatives have a major role to play in the turf development scheme now proposed in the Bill. is it envisaged by the Minister that perhaps some type of grant scheme similar to that available from Roinn na Gaeltachta might be made available to co-operatives being formed in the non-Gaeltacht areas for the purpose of turf development? I see one problem in this and the Minister and Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to it.  The Minister, like myself, had the privilege of being Aire na Gaeltachta ar feadh tamaill agus beidh a fhios aige go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann maidir leis na rudaí anseo i leathanach a hocht.</P>
    <P>It has been decided not to attempt, at this stage, to cover the questions of bog ownership or rights, or to deal with acquisition or allocation of bogland, with amalgamation of turbary rights, or with the division of commonage to facilitate turf production.  I can see the point and perhaps the wisdom of not attempting this in this Bill, because it is an enormously complex problem, particularly in the western regions of the country and specifically in the Gaeltacht.  During my four years as Minister for the Gaeltacht I was aware of good projects put forward by Gaeltacht co-operatives which have been stymied by reason of the commonage situation. The Land Commission have enormous experience in dealing with the problems of commonage and so forth.  One particular Gaeltacht co-operative in the North West had a very good scheme for developing co-operative hill-farming.  When they began to examine the titles to the different portions of land, they found that people living in Chicago and other parts of the United States who were great-great-grandsons of the original owners had a legal title to them.  One was a particularly imaginative scheme of hillside farming where there was only marginal production of perhaps a few sheep and the co-operative operation was planned, with the co-operation of An Foras Talúntais and the Department of Agriculture.  This scheme could not go ahead because 100 per cent right to the land could not be obtained.</P>
    <P>This aspect of turf development is worrying but at the same time the Minister <Col N="182" /> was wise not to get himself involved at this stage in this problem.  This scheme which is desirable and for which there is urgent need would never have got off the ground.  I am sure what the Minister has in mind is getting this scheme under way. There will, at least, be a number of areas in the country where turbary rights and title problems will not arise and the development can be got moving.  The Minister said that he did not see the ownership question as a potential source of difficulty in connection with the operation of the proposed scheme.  I hope he is correct but there will be problems.  A certain number of projects will, I hope, get off the ground very rapidly but the Minister should bear in mind that the utilisation of this new scheme at its maximum potential will be inhibited by these legal problems.</P>
    <P>I brought a group of people to the Department of Energy some time ago. They had a proposal for the development of a tract of bogland on the Clare-Galway border.  The situation in that case was typical of the type of problem that can be encountered.  If I remember correctly 70 people had rights on that land; the Land Commission had acquired portion of it and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry had a lien on another part of it. These people had to get the co-operation of the 70 people involved and then negotiate with the Land Commission and the Department.  They have been able to cope with this but it was a very big problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned a possible solution to the problem&mdash;the granting of compulsory acquisition to Bord na Móna.  I am not qualified to make such a suggestion nor would I try to put forward any legal solution, but I am very conscious of the problems of commonage, title deeds, turbary and other rights and so on.  I hope some formula will be found which will ensure that this very good scheme, which is a logical extension of the work of Bord na Móna, will not be inhibited by legal problems.</P>
    <P>I am very glad Bord na Móna. will be involved in the administration of this scheme.  I am equally glad there will be <Col N="183" /> is county engineers, county development teams and others with the necessary expertise.  This is very important because it is always very satisfactory to be able to speak from practical experience.  The people to whom I have already referred discussed their project with the Galway county development team, as had been advised following discussions with the Department.  The team gave them tremendous help and I was amazed at the local expertise available.  When those discussions were in progress I had the feeling that this Bill was in the pipeline and that it was only a matter of time before grant aid incentives would be given for developments of this kind.  I am very pleased to see county development teams will be involved.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate: this is a significant development.  The Bill meets with the approval of anybody who is conscious of the enormous potential this small island has for the development of all natural resources.  This is a very important and practical contribution to the worldwide energy debate that is going on at present. In my view, the EEC will have to wake up and realise that it is not enough to talk about energy sources but they will have to make finance available to carry out the enormous amount of research that will be needed.  I am not referring specifically to this particular measure because we are very fortunate to have this natural resource.  I am glad to see the Minister has been looking into other natural resources and a case will have to be put to the EEC so that finance will be made available to Ireland, which has not the necessary financial resources to carry out large scale alternative energy research.</P>
    <P>This question of energy is of such grave import that it transcends purely party politics.  It is a matter of grave national interest.  Should the Minister decide to put proposals to the EEC for the necessary finance for this or future schemes, he will have the full support of my colleagues in the European Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on the success he has made of the Department of <Col N="184" /> Energy since its establishment a little over 12 months ago.  He has tackled the problem with a zeal, determination and energy that has won widespread support from all sections of the community.  This is a clear indication of his determination to play a full role in devising ways and means of securing alternative sources of energy from that which we were accustomed to in recent years, that is, imported oil.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss ways of further developing our greatest national energy resource, our bogs.  We should look back with pride on the days when the late Seán Lemass decided it was important to develop our bogs.  We have come a long way since then but during the years when imported energy was comparatively cheap we were inclined to divert our attention to other sources of energy.  When the Arabs woke up to the real value of their products and decided to increase prices, every nation in western Europe which was not fortunate enough to possess its own energy resources decided to take note and felt that increased imported energy costs would have serious implications for their economies.  We should congratulate ourselves on having such a large amount of bogland available.  It is only right that we should proceed with all speed to develop the remaining portions of bog.  This Bill is a step in the right direction and deserves the wholehearted support of all Deputies in a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of grants for private turf development.  This is a matter which was somewhat neglected in the past and the new provision will encourage the small producer.  Bord na Móna have enjoyed a monopoly in turf production and private developers went out of business because it was not economic to cut turf by the traditional methods. The financial assistance now being provided will encourage many private developers to go back to the production of peat and fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of interest in this matter even before the introduction of the Bill.  For months I have been receiving queries regarding its financial <Col N="185" /> implications, the aids likely to be available and the possibilities for bog development by groups of people or co-operatives. The Bill covers all of these aspects and I am satisfied that the Minister will have no difficulty in inducing people to commence the development of private areas of bog.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Longford-Westmeath there are large tracts of undeveloped bog and we notice that Bord na Móna have become very active in the compulsory acquisition of such land. There have been court cases challenging the legality of Bord na Móna's procedure in this area and it is preferable that such bogland should be acquired by consultation and agreement rather than by depositing a notice in the Garda station or the post office or publishing it in the newspapers. Thousands of acres of bog are still held in commonage and thousands of tenants have turbary rights which may have been granted to their forefathers. In recent years it has not been economic to develop those areas but this prospect must now be examined.  Consultation is most important and is far preferable to compulsory acquisition which angers tenants. Last weekend 70 tenants asked to meet me in order to discuss the acquisition of their bogland.  They are worried about their turbary rights and their energy sources for the future.  A great deal of anxiety exists on such matters and I am sure the Minister will do everything he can to ensure the acquisition of bogland by agreement rather than by compulsion. I am satisfied that every effort will be made to assure tenants that their turbary rights will not be infringed.</P>
    <P>When turbary rights were first allowed to tenants they were allocated a narrow strip of face bank.  This was at a time when turf was produced using a spade and a barrow.  Turf cutting machinery is now available but this cannot be used by individuals because of the limited extent of their turbary rights.  Groups of tenants are now anxious to co-operate in using machinery in order to maximise their turbary rights and this type of development should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set about his task with <Col N="186" /> a speed and a determination never previously experienced in any Government Department and he has won the praise and acclamation of all sections of the community.  He has helped to ensure that people have become more conscious of energy conservation.  That is a clear indication of the success of his Ministry in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of grants for the developent of roadways into bogs, for drainage and for the purchase of plant and equipment.  I am confident that these grants will be availed of to the fullest extent.  In recent years Bord na Móna have enjoyed a monopoly in the production of machine won turf and briquettes, with the result that the market has become somewhat restricted.  Many fuel merchants discovered that they did not have access to the bogs or briquette factories in order to collect supplies for their customers.  This problem has existed in every county and particularly in my own area where one or two fuel merchants have a monopoly of the market.  They purchase the fuel from Bord na Móna and the smaller merchants must obtain their supplies from them whenever they are available.  They were fortunate enough in this relatively mild winter and many of the old age pensioners did not experience the same problems as in 1980. Many of these people were left without fuel because the smaller fuel merchants could not get supplies directly from Bord na Mona but were obliged to go to the established dealer, who seemed to be getting preferential treatment.  That was a restrictive sales practice and no doubt the Minister will examine the possibility of allowing more fuel merchants direct access to Bord na Móna.  This would create better competition in relation to the retail sale of briquettes and machine turf. Without competition we cannot guarantee competitive prices for the customers. especially the old age pensioners who use free fuel vouchers.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I have transgressed, but I have dealt with this because <Col N="187" /> I know the Minister is concerned about it.</P>
      <P>I envisage a conflict of rights between Bord na Móna, the Land Commission and the bog tenants.  I envisage long legal battles in relation to rights and I hope that the legal people involved will try to work out an acceptable system of rights.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate to have at our disposal huge acres of bogland which are the envy of many European countries.  I am a member of the Energy Sub-committee of the Council of Europe whose meetings are devoted mainly to ways and means of providing alternative energy sources. They have expressed a great deal of interest in our bogs and are curious to know how we developed the system.  Our rich boglands will enable us to avert an energy crisis at least during our time.  The development of the smaller bogs will open up a whole new area of bog development. Let us hope that the economy and the people will benefit.  Turf is bound to be cheaper than the imported fuels on which we have become so dependent in recent years.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke about the possibility of securing EEC aid for bog development and I have no doubt the Minister will pursue that as far as possible. However, it is gratifying to know that this will be funded by Irish taxpayers. That is a clear indication of the Government's determination to do everything possible to ensure the maximum use of bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to administration, the finance will be administered by Bord na Móna.  Will we have a conflict of interests between the private developer and Bord na Mona?  Bord na Móna will be anxious to secure the maximum area of bog for development and we should ensure that they will implement the scheme as impartially as possible.  If Bord na Móna wanted to acquire a stretch of bog and a private developer wished to acquire the same stretch a conflict of interest could arise and that could slow down the development. There should be a maximum amount of flexibility in the Bill so as to help avoid this sort of problem.  With <Col N="188" /> goodwill all round these problems should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and I assure him that this is a popular Bill which enjoys a large measure of support.  I wish it a speedy passage through the House and wish the Minister every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a dual-purpose Bill: it will supplement our energy needs so that we do not have to import so much fuel and it will provide employment.  We are fortunate in that we have this resource which we can utilise at a time when fuel costs are mounting at an alarming rate.  There is need for a rapid development of the bogs, as is proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the emergency years of the forties local authorities were empowered to engage suitable manual labour to extract from the bogs the fuel needs of hospitals and institutions and to transport the necessary fuels to the cities.  We have advanced technologically since then and machinery and equipment can now be utilised effectively on many bogs. Because of this we can look forward to a rapid tonnage of turf being produced. However, we should not ignore the potential of manual labour.  The craft of manual turf cutting is decreasing and few people are qualified now to use the slean. The Minister should broaden the scope of the Bill to include retraining in the use of the slean and AnCO should be encouraged to provide courses to train people in this declining traditional craft.</P>
      <P>There is a huge potential in manpower to extract turf from our bogs.  I am referring to plots attached to holdings.  Such plots of turbary were assigned to each land owner by the landlord through the Land Commission.  They were very narrow and some of them have not been worked for years.  I cannot see any machinery getting in to work them and for that reason I suggest that our youth should be trained in the craft of slean-making. AnCO should co-operate with the Department of Energy in such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the intention of the Minister to exclude tractors converted for turf-cutting from benefit in the grant scheme? Local people have invented suitable <Col N="189" /> attachments for tractors and they should qualify for a grant.  Such machines are suitable for working in small plots.  The Minister should consider changing the provision which allots only a 45 per cent grant to a private owner.  I do not see any reason why such people who may own large areas of bogland do not benefit in the same way as co-operative societies will.  Such people have a great interest in achieving the highest amount of productivity and they should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>It is vital that drainage and the construction and maintenance of access roads are given priority.  Our seasons are uncertain and unless there is proper drainage and access roads a lot of turf can be lost.  In order to carry out work on the bogs quickly in the limited period available access roads should be in good condition.  The Bill is welcome because it gives encouragement to entrepreneurs to invest in this work.  I hope our people avail of the scheme and that we do not get too tied up with red tape in administering the grants.  For that reason I would prefer to see the county development teams being empowered to recommend people for grants.  They would be in a position to assess what is available.  The provisions of the Bill are necessary and, undoubtedly, they will lead to a supplementing of our fuel supply.  It should be remembered that in the past our production of turf got us over a vital period.  The necessity for more turf production is as great now.  County councils should get involved in the making of access roads to bogs.  During the Emergency the ESB gave grants towards the provision and maintenance of access roads to bogs.  All the forces of the State should combine to help deal with this ongoing emergency until an alternative is discovered to oil. They should work to make the greatest use possible of our resources.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille Forbartha Móna 1980.  Is soiléir go bhfuil dianghá le príomhaidhm an Bhille, is e sin córas a bhunú a réiteoidh an bóthar d'fhorbairt móna, go forleathan sa tí'r trí scéimeanna deontais agus tré thacaí'ocht a thabhairt do dhaoine móin a shabháil agus a sholáthar.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> I welcome the Bill.  It is vital that we have a cheap and abundant energy supply to allow for further industrial expansion and output.  We have seen many energy mutations over the centuries from the coal of the 19th century to the oil of the 20th century.  When one considers that 80 per cent of our total energy needs must be imported &mdash; a great bulk of this heavy import dependence is in the oil sector &mdash; it is clear that we must make realistic changes.  We cannot continue to be dependent on this form of oil import forever.  Our dependence must exist for many years to come but we must continue to adapt ourselves to drastically reducing our oil import bill.</P>
    <P>To date Bord na Móna has been primarily involved in the production of turf and it is a tribute to them that turf accounts for almost 20 per cent of electricity generated here.  It provides much of the heating in our homes, institutions and industries.  An interesting fact was disclosed by the Minister in a speech recently, that only the Russians produce more turf volume than ourselves.  The Russians have paid tribute to our expertise and advances in this field.  Clearly, we owe a great debt to Bord na Móna but we must remember the shortage of briquettes that occurred in recent winters. I was pleased to read in the third development programme of the board that it is hoped to more than double the present output of briquettes creating an additional 2,200 jobs and other jobs downstream.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the potential of our small private bogs.  We have always accepted them as a national resource and now they have become a very valuable one.  There is a renewed public awareness of the need to exploit this resource but the development must be done in an organised way and on a nationwide scale. The Bill proposes a system of grants and loans for those willing and able to tackle the job in a businesslike manner.  I am concerned about mountain bog development. The constituency of Wicklow contains a lot of such bogs and we have the advantage of being close to large centres of population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> I am aware that efforts are afoot to make it possible to have deep cutting of peat without interfering greatly with topography.  This is an important aspect of turf development which we should not overlook.  Even where there are difficulties in the development of bogs we should look at the possible effects of such development on the topographical aspect. Recently we had a Conservation Year and it showed the awareness and appreciation people have in regard to the value of our topgraphy.  I hope that in our bog development we will not lose sight of the conservation aspect by allowing surface scars to develop, particularly on mountain land.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to learn that people have been making arrangements to develop small and relatively neglected areas of bog.  I have been talking to an inventor and I have confidence in his ability to produce a machine for deep peat removal without damaging topographical features. I am assured that it will remove turf leaving the surface unspoiled.</P>
    <P>So far I have not spoken about road infrastructure and the need to have the countryside left unspoiled by the transport of turf to cities.  I am concerned about the many roads through the Wicklow hills which are tourist routes because we must consider the impact of heavy lorries on such roads.  Therefore, massive infrastructural development must take place in turf cutting areas in co-operation with local engineers and district development associations.  I have in mind the excellent job done by the ESB in their Turlough Hill development.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister appreciates the wider aspects of bog development in small areas and that consultations will take place in regard to the various problems attached to developing bogs so that our great natural energy asset will become available to our people without damage to our present vistas and views.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the job he is doing in the Department of Energy. He has succeeded in instilling in the community a deep awareness of the asset we have in our bgs.  I know local communities will consider the development of bogs <Col N="192" /> in their areas in an overall national context. About 80 per cent of our total energy needs is being imported.  This will have to be reduced sharply and quickly and this Bill will make an appreciable contribution in this respect.  It will enable people to combine to develop our peat resources.  This is a good Bill but we must not lose sight of the difficulties to be encountered not only within the bogs but in regard to access roads, and we must not overlook the impact of turf development on topography and on our general tourism facilities.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an Aire san méid atá á dhéanamh aige san Roinn.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh maitheas is tairbhe ag teacht ón mBille seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good Bill and I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I look forward to its implementation with beneficial results for the country as a whole.  I speak as a Deputy from a part of the country where children would hardly know what a sod of turf looks like.  It is for that reason that I decided to make a contribution, because in the Minister's statement and in statements so far made by Deputies references have been made to the midlands and western portions of the country specifically.</P>
      <P>It is important that we appreciate that there should be a broader geographical spread as far as turf production is concerned. Some people may say there is not turf in the remainder of the country, specifically in the south-eastern areas.  I believe there is a significant amount there which could be developed and I look forward to that kind of development under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has in his office a large map of Ireland which shows exactly where Bord na Móna are operating at present and where there are supplies of turf yet untapped.  I doubt if an in-depth study of the national turf potential has been made.  I asked a number of parliamentary questions recently but I failed to get any positive response regarding the development of turf banks in mountainous areas of County Waterford. We have failed to get an involvement by <Col N="193" /> Bord na Móna who obviously are concerned with much larger commercial undertakings.  The chief aim of this Bill is to develop the smaller bogs so far untouched by Bord na Móna.  I should like to see efforts being made to get at turf supplies in mountainous regions.  It could make a contribution.  The words &ldquo;bogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;boglands&rdquo; have been used consistently here both by the Minister and Deputies.  I am aware that there are significant amounts of turf in mountainous regions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the south-eastern region one will see that Wicklow is the most mountainous area and Waterford possibly one of the most mountainous, proportionately. As I have said, mountains contain turf.  But they have never been developed on a commercial basis to any significant extent.  Specifically in regard to County Waterford, I would ask that Bord na Móna would show an interest in areas such as Ballysaggart near Lismore and in Moneyaha between Ballymacarbry and Rathgormac in north County Waterford not far from Clonmel.  There are significant turf banks there but there has not been any State involvement and no interest shown by Bord na Móna.  As a result of this Bill I should like to see an advisory body such as An Foras Talúntais coming along to each county development team to advise them as to how they might make the best use of turf banks in their areas.  I have no doubt that the domestic fuel demands in County Waterford could be met to a considerable extent if the supplies in the mountains of that county were fully utilised.  This applies also to County Wicklow and to the Blackstairs Mountains on the borders of Carlow and Kilkenny.  I noted in a document produced by the Department of Energy that the turf production listed for those counties was virtually nil.  The only turf that is saved at the moment is that saved by a few individuals.  The whole operation is not done in an organised manner.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to make allowances to groups who form co-operatives to develop turf banks.  I should like the Minister in his reply to say what kind of assistance can be given to local authorities <Col N="194" /> throughout the Twenty-six Counties to help in this matter.  I should like him to make a specific point of arranging for officials from An Foras Talúntais or Bord na Móna to meet each county development team in order to discuss ways of extracting the turf that is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech contains some interesting statistics.  The objective of the 1974 plan was to develop a total of 80,000 hectares of bogland but a few lines down in the speech there is the statement that An Foras Talúntais have identified 1.1 million hectares would be an impossibility the production of turf.  According to those statistics we are utilising only 7 per cent of the available turf banks in the country.  I realise that utilisation of 1.1 million hectares would be an impossiblity but even if we reached a target of 50 per cent it would be of tremendous value to the country in terms of our balance of payments.  On the Minister's own figures the 80,000 hectares saves us from importing 313,000 tons of oil and in money terms this represents £47 million, which is a significant figure.  I calculate that if the 1.1 million hectares were developed it would mean an improvement in our balance of payment to the extent of £602 million.  If we could develop only half that total the saving would be in excess of £300 million, a very sizeable figure.</P>
    <P>A factor that must be considered is the matter of transport.  Transport costs are so huge that often it is not a viable proposition to bring turf from the midlands or the west to the south or south-eastern regions.  It would be much better if development took place in the locality.  If possible I should like the Minister to arrange with officials to identify the areas that could be developed and to give technical assistance in the matter.  We do not know much about the workings of bogs or how to save the turf that is available and which should be utilised by the local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardFilgate" hpid="Mr. Filgate Mr. Filgate">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Filgate</NameTxt>
      <P>The House congratulates the Minister on introducing this worthwhile Bill.  It was gratifying to see the reasonableness with which all sides have approached the matter.  As one who has been very interested in the development <Col N="195" /> of our bogs and who was associated in the early stages with the old Turf Development Board.  I can record the great effort and energy of the board in their operations.  Even in the forties we were regarded as second to the Russians in the area of turf production and I think we still hold that place, if we have not surpassed them in technology.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that 20 per cent of our electricity needs is generated by turf and that is a great compliment to Bord na Móna.  Perhaps Irish people have not given sufficient thought, encouragement and praise to the board.  Against great odds during the years they have fought hard to utilise our natural resources.  As a small country we should look forward to the implementation of the proposals of the Minister.  However, as usual there will be the cynics and there will be opposition from people who do not realise the implications of involving a greater proportion of the work force in the production of turf for our own use.</P>
      <P>There are many facts we must face before we reach the stage we can say we have mastered our trade.  As was mentioned by the Minister, there is the major question of outfall and surface drainage. This is not possible to any great extent because we have problems in relation to arterial drainage but we must ensure that at local level individuals and co-operatives will be able to carry out what is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We must face the fact that there will be problems but they need not be insurmountable because much of the groundwork has been done by Bord na Móna. I suggest to the Minister that he might consider the establishment of a special section within the board incorporating the various interests, including the local authorities.  During the years Bord na Móna have carried out a detailed survey of every inch of bog.  For many years I was involved with this work and I know that data about every bog is on the files of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important point is the quality of the turf.  I cannot emphasise this aspect too strongly.  It may appear trivial to the uninitiated but it is of the greatest importance. <Col N="196" /> Turf of inferior quality costs much more to produce than good turf.  The end result is that where turf is not of good quality it will not give the efficiency that is necessary.  It will be for Bord na Móna and those concerned to ensure that the turf we produce is of good, saleable quality. The development of the CPS in Bord na Móna in 1946 was one of the greatest developments within that board.  Perhaps the Minister would consider reviving the CPS, in which the local authorities were involved with Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that when we talk about turf we should also talk about bog.  It may surprise the House to know that in certain counties we not only have bog turf but also mountain turf.  Mountain turf can be produced much easier and will dry quicker because it is on a mountain. The access roads to the mountains and to the bogs are very important in this scheme.  If we provide money for drainage work in order to produce turf and if we construct roads to save the turf, we will be giving a service to the country apart altogether from producing turf for our use.  The Minister should look at this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>We need not be ashamed of our efforts in relation to turf production over the years.  We are one of the few countries in the world who have sent technical staff to help other countries in this field.  We have been inundated with pleas from many countries to send people to advise them on producing turf in the most economical and efficient way.  This is a great tribute to Bord na Móna.  Although the provision of transport for turf is not allowed under the Bill, the Minister should have a look at this aspect, because the most important part of turf production is getting it off the bog.  It very often costs more to transport turf from the bog than it does to produce it.</P>
    <P>We must look at the ultimate service bogs can give to the country.  Experiments have been carried out by Bord na Móna on vegetable production.  If we are faced with failure in relation to this, it should be made a condition of grants that certain tracts of bogs and cut-away after the turf has been sold should be replanted <Col N="197" /> with suitable trees.  I know of places where a bog has been cut, a portion of it has been replanted, roads have been constructed, drainage work carried out and houses built along the bog roads.  We must not be content with merely getting a certain amount of turf out of a bog in order to meet a short term need: we should have a far-reaching programme in relation to bogs and what we hope to do with them afterwards.  It would be a step in the right direction if they were replanted.  I cannot stress too strongly the necessity for co-operation between Bord na Móna and the local authorities such as happened in the forties when turf was produced very economically.  I congratulate the Minister.  I wish him well and I would ask him to take note of the few points I have made in relation to what he hopes to do under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we must have not only an agricultural development plan or a bog development plan but a land use plan.  The Bill proposes to bring into the production of turf land which is either not being used or being used in a very marginal fashion for the grazing of sheep or some other activity.  I believe it is unsatisfactory that a decision about any particular piece of land should be made from only one point of view.  It is not right in this instance that people concerned with the production of energy. such as the Department of Energy.  Bord na Móna and the developers who are interested in developing a particular piece of land for bog purposes should make such a decision without bearing in mind the possible alternative uses of that land.  There is no institution capable of looking at a particular piece of land and saying what are the costs and the benefits of using it for energy production or for agricultural production.  I believe we need to establish a county land development team which will look at the land in each county and be able to give advice to the various statutory agencies which may be giving assistance about what is the best way of using the land.  For instance, without the other options being considered. we might find land being absorbed in <Col N="198" /> energy production when its best use might be agriculture or the reverse.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the lack of any real agricultural dimension to the policies of Bord na Móna on a general scale.  It is very important for the subsequent agricultural use of land, if it has previously been bogland, that a sufficiently large depth of peat be left on the surface after the turf has been taken away.  If too small an amount of turf has been left on the surface of the bog the agricultural uses which can be made of the bog are diminished and the range of options open to the subsequent users of the land are reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe any decision has been made by Bord na Móna or the Minister for Energy about the appropriate depth of peat to be left on the bog.  I believe this matter was being considered by the interdepartmental committee set up for this purpose.  I repeatedly asked questions of the previous Minister for Energy, Deputy O'Malley, about this committee and its findings.  As far as I know. no specific recommendation has been issued on this subject.  The result of the absence of a clear recommendation to Bord na Móna to go so deep and no deeper in taking turf from the bog is that we may permanently remove the agricultural potential of the land in order to get energy now.  We are taking a benefit for the present which may permanently diminish the agricultural capacity of that land for successive generations.  We cannot be sure that that is happening until we get a clear statement from the relevant agencies with regard to what the appropriate depth is.  We do not know if they are going too deep until we know what the appropriate dept is.  The possibility is that they are going too deep.  I would like to see a definite decision made in regard to that very soon.  I would also like to know what will be the appropriate depth to which the private developers of bogland will be allowed to go.  I presume the same limits will apply to them as will apply to Bord na Móna in their operations. I do not see in the Bill any reference to the appropriate depth to which turf may be won.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that Bord na Móna, or some <Col N="199" /> other appropriate agency, will be able to ensure that none of the private developers of bogs will be able to go below a depth which would permanently diminish the subsequent potential for agricultural use of the land in question.</P>
    <P>Other members of my party have referred already to the fact that this Bill discriminates against private enterprise in favour of co-operative enterprise in the grants available.  A maximum grant of 50 per cent is available to co-operatives and a 45 per cent grant is available to companies or other private enterprises. I do not see any justification for this discrimination.  If we want energy produced, the structure of the company should not be a basis for discrimination. If a company can do the work the State wants done as efficiently as a co-operative, I do not see why that company should not get the same level of grant.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the possible destruction of archaeological remains in the course of bog development.  As the House will be aware, bogs are one of the richest sources of archaeological material. In the nature of bogs, material is preserved far more effectively than it would be if it were preserved in the earth.  People will be aware that recently the fully extant remains, including the skin and the flesh, of a stone age man were discovered in a bog in Denmark.  This gave us very valuable information about the type of people who lived 4,000 or 5,000 years ago in that part of the world.  That information could not have been obtained anywhere other than in a bog. This indicates clearly the importance of considering the interests of future generations as well as the present generation. In the development of bogland we should bear in mind the archaeological dimension.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in the operation of milled peat production, in each move ment over the bog by the milled peat harvester only half an inch at a time is taken from the top of the bog.  This means that, if one is coming across an archaeological remnant, one is likely to come across it sufficiently slowly not to destroy it.  With some possible exceptions I am <Col N="200" /> reasonably satisfied that the operations of Bord na Móna will not destroy valuable archaeological remains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly we should have a treasure hunt and try to get all the antiquities out of the bogs before they are harvested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately metal detectors will detect metal remains only and not other more valuable remains of an organic character.  One has to wait until one harvests the bogs to find those. I should like an assurance that the methods of harvesting peat which will be used in the smaller bogs&mdash;and I recognise that the milled peat technology which may be appropriate to the larger bogs may not be appropriate to the smaller bogs&mdash;will not prove to be destructive to archaeological remains.</P>
      <P>I see no provision in this Bill into which a clause protecting archaeological remains could be inserted relating to the conditions applying to the operation of bog development plans submitted by operators.  Either by way of amendment or otherwise specific account should be required to be taken of the archaeological dimension.  I further suggest to the Minister that where an advisory committee is being established archaeological interests should be represented.  It is essential too that agricultural interests be represented substantially as well.  It is important that the subsequent use of the bogland for agriculture should be borne in mind.  We are not concerned simply with the energy needs of this generation but also of future generations of Irish people.  We must not destroy the agricultural potential in the course of winning the energy for our short term needs.</P>
      <P>Those are the few points I wish to make.  In common with my colleagues, I welcome the Bill.  I wish the Minister well in seeing legislation through to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few complimentary words to the Minister and his Department on bringing this Bill before us to encourage the development of our bogs.  I have a particular interest in this <Col N="201" /> matter.  For 20 years I have represented the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  Bog development has brought us great benefits. It is timely to introduce this Bill to encourage private enterprise to co-operate in developing our bogs at a stage when we need to harvest as much energy as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Bruton criticising the obvious preference in the Bill for co-operatives, rather than grant-aiding some capitalist, if you like, who might see an opportunity for himself. On the European scene when I meet an individual who knows this country, if he asks me what part of the country I come from almost invariably I say: &ldquo;I am the bog man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Bruton's concern about the amount of peat which needs to be left in the bogs, About 14 years ago I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs, the late illustrious President then Deputy Childers. He had various ideas about telephone development which did not come to fruition until recently.  He suggested that I might have a pronounced interest in Bord na Móna and the ESB and he offered me certain functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that stage a controversy was developing <Col N="202" /> between the Agricultural Institute and Bord na Móna, who were anxious to cut as much peat as possible.  I read many documents dealing with the tremendously valuable work which was being done then and has been done since in the Lullymore Research Centre.  The Agricultural Institute were advising Bord na Móna against cutting away too much turf. I have written to the Minister for Energy warning him against cutting too deeply and getting too near the marl.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary I had battles with Bord na Móna on that basis, I have no objection to putting it on record that I feel Bord na Móna cut down too deeply. Leaving nine inches to 18 inches of peat at the bottom is not sufficient.  It is sufficient for growing grass, but that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I welcome the opportunity to link the supervision and administration of this new scheme through Bord na Móna.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that in the administration of the scheme, in granting the aid and in the overall encouragement, Bord na Móna would prevent private developers from digging too deeply.  Perhaps Bord na Móna are not the proper agents in this regard because they have not shown themselves to be anything like exemplary.  I do not think the people administering the scheme can say to a private individual or a co-operative &ldquo;Leave three feet of peat there when you have finished&rdquo;, when the skeletons in their own cupboards are such that they cannot offer that sort of advice or give that type of directive.  They cannot do so when they are not playing the same rules themselves.</P>
    <P>Indeed I sympathise with Bord na Móna because those of us who know our bogs&mdash;and I am not endeavouring to cast any aspersions on the Deputy sitting opposite; I take it he has studied his bogs as well.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;knows that the further down one goes the more valuable is the sod: the blacker it is the longer will be its duration and the more value there will be for money.  This means that when Bord na Móna have cleared the field, have carried out drainage, have undertaken the task, they will find it very difficult to leave three of four feet of peat at the bottom, when all of the clearance work has been done, when it is at its most valuable and so on.  It is very difficult to preach this to Bord na Móna.  I would appeal to the Minister to bear this in mind.  I am referring to this matter only in the context in which Bord na Móna will now be the administrators of this grant scheme being drawn up.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about archaeological development and infringement in this respect.  But just because there may be a find in a bog on some occasion does not necessarily mean everything else must cease until somebody comes around poking with a stick to make sure the coast is clear before we carry out any bogland development.  That would be too restrictive. In this regard I do not go along with Deputy Bruton.  Had we carried out that practice over the years it would have prevented any land reclamation or development. I am as concerned as the next about preventing the destruction of some valuable archaeological find but this is one of the chances we must take.  I do not think there should be any regulations introduced in regard to bog development schemes whereby a potential developer, be it an individual or a co-operative group, would be hindered by someone saying &ldquo;You cannot cut a sod until such time as somebody from the National Museum or somewhere else has come round and given the all clear&rdquo;.  That would be a disastrous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope it is not anticipated that the plan to be prepared before a grant is given will be too elaborate whether in regard to a private developer or a co-operative.  We have already had a certain amount of that type of development in my part of the country without any grant aid to date. <Col N="204" /> But with the ever increasing necessity of developing our own fuel it is vital that this scheme be implemented.  Indeed I hope it will not be hindered by too much red tape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary), (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>Turnover thresholds for compulsory VAT registration were last increased in 1979.  They had not previously been increased since their introduction in 1972.  A number of factors, apart from the increase in the price index, are relevant to the determination of thresholds.  The competitive advantage to unregistered traders at the threshold increases with the threshold level, and the increases since 1972 in the positive rates of VAT reinforce this advantage. In all the circumstances, a further increase is not considered to be warranted this year in the thresholds which are already generous by EEC standards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to allocate some of the funds provided under the special programme for the development of border regions to an area outside these regions; if this would be in breach of the relevant EEC regulation; and if he will take steps to fund the project in question from national funds so that the special programme may be devoted entirely to border regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that the implementation of the special programme for the development of border counties will be directed to measures which will achieve the objective of the programme which is the improvement of the economic and social situation in the border counties.  Part of the difficulty in developing these counties arises from difficulties of access.</P>
      <P>I propose, therefore, to use the special programme to assist in the development of an airport in Sligo with the objective of providing easier access to the border counties of Leitrim and Cavan.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this proposal is in breach of the EEC regulation.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the European Community has directed its attention to our border area in drawing up its first batch of measures for the use of the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund and I am anxious to ensure that the funds available are used to the maximum lasting benefit of the counties concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister aware that the total fund involved is £20 million, half of which is put up by the EEC?  That covers a period of five years, leaving about £4 million a year to cover five counties which leaves very little money to go over each county.  If County Sligo is introduced into it and a large sum of money taken out for an airport there, which could be funded out of other sources, it is an erosion of the EEC fund for cross-border counties. In view of that, would the Minister reconsider and fund Sligo airport out of national funds and leave the border fund for border counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister has already written to the Deputy in relation to this subject.  The areas which will benefit under the fund have not yet been decided by the commission and are not likely to be decided for some months. The Minister is availing of the measure to ask the commission to support the development in Sligo.  I do not think the amount of money to be provided from the fund will do much damage to it.  I am sure that 99 per cent of the total programme will be geographically located in the five counties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Arising out of that, I note that the areas have not yet been decided upon.  Is the Minister aware that this fund was hawked through the Donegal by-election and that there were allocations there for a national park, an airport and a museum?  Is he also aware that this same amount of money is very prominently projected in the national investment plan, which is the equivalent of the capital programme for the budget?  It is extraordinary, therefore, if it has not yet been approved by the EEC that it is being worked so hard at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give an estimate of the average capital cost in terms of public money for the provision of the 18,000 jobs which increased total employment for the year mid-April 1979-80 as referred to in the Government document entitled <i>Economic Background to the Budget, 1981.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="216" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase of 18,000 in total employment for the year April 1979 to April 1980 is a net figure combining gross job creation with job losses during the period in question.  The net improvement in employment, which arose in the manufacturing, building and construction and service sectors, resulted from private as well as public investment formed in that year and in earlier years. It would not be possible to identify the public capital expenditures associated with the investment involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the House to understand that the Government are currently raising taxes and borrowing money abroad on the basis of a commitment to employment and can publish a document with our money stating that employment increased by 18,000 for the period I have given and the Minister does not know how it is being utilised or what the cost is per job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no official figures for either gross job creations or job losses.  The figure of 8,574 notified redundancies probably understates the true level of job losses for the period April 1979 to April 1980.  The Public Capital Programme for 1979 amounted to something over £1,000 million and the 1980 Public Capital Programme amounted to £1,270 million.  These increases in the Public Capital Programme will have had a positive effect on employment but other factors, such as the level of private sector activity, and the general economic climate, were also important influences. Therefore, it would be impossible to attribute directly any net increase of employment in the period to the level of public capital expenditure or to put a cost per job on the jobs created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it, from the Minister's reply, if it is not possible to calculate it on that basis, that we do not have to believe any of the figures which the Minister put out in relation to job creation as a result of capital expenditure, since the Minister is not able to calculate what the cost per job is?  Therefore, the Minister must not be capable of <Col N="217" /> projecting what the likely job creation content will be of any capital programme expenditure?</P>

Is the House not entitled to ask if, on the basis that the Minister is incapable of answering this question, we are entitled to disregard any projected levels of employment arising out of capital expenditure on the basis that the Minister is incapable of calculating what the job cost is per job created?</P>

Also, is it not the position that the figure given in the reply as being the cost of servicing the public debt is just about the amount of money that is taken in by way of taxation generally?

    <P>The increase in numbers is due to the general effects of the current international recession, The rate of increase for Longford-Westmeath is somewhat less than the national average.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to create employment in this area.  The IDA Industrial Plan 1978-82 has a target of 2,600 new jobs for the Longford-Westmeath area.  The Authority have provided 109,500 square feet of factory space in the area and a further 54,000 square feet is planned.  They also hold almost 200 acres of land available for industrial development.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Government have failed to honour their promises of 1977 in regard to providing work for the unemployed? Would he not agree also that that promise was to reduce unemployment by 80,000 &mdash; from 107,000 as it was then to 27,000?  Is the figure for unemployment not at least 127,000 today thereby indicating that Fianna Fáil were out in their calculations by 100,000? What action, if any, is planned to provide work for those unfortunate people who were foolish enough to believe that Fianna Fáil could deliver on their promises and to vote for them?  Many of these people are now out of work.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy <Col N="224" /> to the reply given to parliamentary questions on this matter previously, in particular on 4 November 1980.  While a tentative allocation of the moneys of the special fund has been made at least as far as the main headings of the programme are concerned it would be premature to decide at this stage on firm allocations in so far as specific projects are concerned. This programme is a new one and a definitive list of projects has not been drawn up yet.  As I have indicated previously all relevant proposals will be considered and a flexible approach adopted in relation to the allocation of funds.  The programme itself has yet to be approved by the European Regional Development Fund Committee and it is only as the programme is implemented that decisions will be taken on the amounts to be allocated to different projects.  This will permit a flexible approach in regard to the allocation of funds and will enable full account to be taken of competing demands in different sectors of the programme.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="227" /> to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the press report referred to.  Planning of a new headquarters building for the Department of Defence has been in hands by the Commissioners of Public Works who engaged consultants to prepare a suitable design.  The architects were Messrs. Scott Tallon Walker.</P>
      <P>The new building is required in order to house together sections of the Department at present located in separate centres, mainly Parkgate, Coláiste Caoimhín, Glasnevin, and Park House, North Circular Road, where 1,400 square metres have been rented.  It is not proposed to rehouse the Civil Defence School now at Ratra House, Phoenix Park.  Otherwise the new building will cater for the present accommodation needs of the civilian and military general headquarters staff of the Department in Dublin with provision for modest expansion.</P>
      <P>It will be constructed on a State-owned site on the east side of Infirmary Road, Dublin, and will contain approximately 19,000 square metres.  The buildings at Parkgate and Coláiste Caoimhín will be available when refurbished for other State purposes.  The space in Park House will also be so available.</P>
      <P>It is expected that tenders will be invited for the project later this year.  The building will take about three years to complete.  The estimated cost of the project at current prices is £9.4 million inclusive of architect's and consultants fees.</P>
      <P>The main works carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works for the Department of Defence in 1980 were treatment of dry rot, works to the heating system, external repairs and painting at General Headquarters; external repairs and painting at Coláiste Caoimhín; improvements to the water supply at Ratra House.  In addition the normal minor works and services were provided by the commissioners' staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Rydell Report of 1956 on flood control in the River Shannon recommended that preliminary investigations should be carried out in two stages regarding specific methods for flood control and drainage and meeting the needs of power, navigation and other uses of the river.  The first stage of the investigations was carried out jointly by the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board.  Their report, published in 1961, indicated that a solution to the problem was feasible and that the second stage of the investigations should be undertaken to determine more exactly the extent of the improvements likely to result and the probable cost.</P>
      <P>These second stage investigations, which would include field surveys and foundation explorations, office studies of engineering and cost features and studies of benefits to be derived and of economic justification, have not so far been undertaken but have again been under consideration. The investigations are estimated to cost about £1 million and would take about two-and-a-half years to complete,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are at present examining whether, having regard to <Col N="231" /> other commitments, the necessary resources, that is, finance and staff, can be made available to permit of an early start to the investigations.</P>
    <P>The EEC have decided to make a grant of 40 per cent up to a maximum of £400,000 towards the cost of the investigations. It is envisaged that the ESB and An Foras Talúntais would co-operate with the Office of Public Works in the matter.  Consultations with other Departments, that is Agriculture, Economic Planning and Development, and Finance, and with the ESB and An Foras Talúntais have been taking place since 1978 and are likely to continue.  No staff has yet been specially recruited for the investigations and no funds for the project have yet been received from the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this £400,000 has been allocated by the EEC Regional Fund as far back as mid-December and that we have been allowed a two-year period to have this survey carried out?  If the money is not taken up within that two-year period, there is a danger that we may lose it, Is the Minister also aware that the Minister for Agriculture, speaking at a Fianna Fáil Convention in Longford/Westmeath, publicly stated that this survey had already commenced?</P>

      <P>A major improvement scheme was carried out at Carnaross national school, County Meath in 1956-57.  An improvement scheme to the playgrounds was completed in 1976.  An inspector's report of 25 October 1977 recommended an extension to the school.  The Department of Education asked the Commissioners of Public Works to report on the feasibility of the extension.  The commissioners reported that the extension could be accommodated on the present site.  A grant was sanctioned on 18 August 1980. Working drawings are to be prepared shortly for the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with previous speakers in welcoming this Bill and in complimenting the Minister on its introduction.  It is positive proof that the Minister and the Government are fully aware of the need to utilise our bogs to the maximum benefit.  There is an old saying that necessity is the mother of invention.  An example of this is the fact that the world energy crisis is forcing people to seek new ways to conserve energy and to find new sources of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bog development and turf production are not new, but they are of vital importance to this country particularly at present. This Bill will provide a great incentive to owners of bogland to set about developing our bogs.  I represent a constituency which has probably benefited <Col N="277" /> more from Bord na Móna development than any other constituency in the country. I welcome the fact that this scheme will be administered by Bord na Móna officials because it is important that the board would be able to retain any tracts of bogland they might hope to develop. I hope the Bord na Móna personnel and their know-how in bog development will be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the difference in the amounts of the grants &mdash; 60 per cent for co-operatives as against 45 per cent to individuals.  He said this was discriminating against the individual, but I doubt that.  A great deal of our bogland is commonage and is held on a tenancy basis and I imagine the majority of applications under this scheme will come from such people.  Therefore, it is essential that higher grants should be made available where the bogs are held on a tenancy basis by a number of applicants.</P>
    <P>Coming from a county which has many acres of bogland, I have a great deal of experience in this area.  I see this scheme as a great advantage to smallholders.  The grants available are sizeable and, under the direction and guidance of Bord na Móna's personnel, I am confident excellent work will be done under this scheme. We have a number of bogs in west Offaly which could be developed under this scheme.  This could create a number of jobs and it would mean that more turf would become available during this energy crisis.  This scheme will help to minimise the effects of the energy crisis.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the turf development scheme proves the Minister is aware of the importance of turf development. I can visualise many new jobs being made available and more turf coming on the market at significantly lower prices than those charged by Bord na Móna.  Turf cut in a privately developed bog could be offered at a lower price than that being charged by Bord na Móna.  This could be a great help to the poorer sections of the community, particularly old age pensioners, who mostly burn briquettes and would be very happy to avail of cheaper turf.</P>
    <P>The Minister arranged for this scheme to be directed by the personnel of Bord <Col N="278" /> na Móna and applicants will benefit from their expertise.  Through the years it has been proved that these experts are world class when it comes to bog development and many people come from other countries to learn from them.  They will administer this scheme and, in the long run, that will benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I again compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation at a time when we are so energy conscious.  It highlights the fact that the Minister and the Government are aware of the necessity to ensure that our turf resources are properly developed.  I had thought that such legislation would have been introduced some time ago and perhaps the world crisis has given more urgency to the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate, not only for their contributions but also for their welcome for the Bill and the kind things they had to say.  They are very much appreciated. To advert to what Deputy Bruton has just said, it is of considerable interest to know of the wide spread of interest in the development of our bogs and in the scheme outlined in the Bill for the development of private bogs.  The number of Deputies from both sides of the House who contributed to the debate attests to that interest, which was also exemplified quite clearly in the course of my recent tour of the country in connection with energy saving.  There were discussions in relation to bogs and it is quite clear that there is a widespread interest in this matter, which was reflected in this debate.  A number of points were raised and I shall endeavour to deal with them.  If I fail to do so, they can be raised at the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most persistent criticism which has come from the Fine Gael side relates to the differentiation in the level of grant between co-operatives and individual or company undertakings.  The rate of grant <Col N="279" /> proposed in the Bill is 60 per cent for co-operatives and 45 per cent for the others.  One of the reasons for the higher rate of grant for the co-operatives is to encourage several people to share one machine.  We should bear in mind that at present these machines are quite costly. For example, there is what is called a &ldquo;Lilliput&rdquo; machine which costs between £50,000 and £70,000.  Even adaptations of other general purpose farm machinery can cost substantial sums of money.  It will be agreed, therefore, that it is desirable that such expensive machines should be as fully utilised as possible.  If we can encourage a number of people to share those machines, apart from sharing the cost, the likelihood is that the machines will be used more frequently than if owned by individuals.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more important is the point which Deputy Cowan has made.  While there will be some substantial stretches of bogland in private ownership being developed other than by Bord na Móna, the bulk of the bogland about which we are talking is likely to be developed by smallholders or small groups where the turbary rights extend only to small areas of bog.  To go back to a point made by some Fine Gael Deputies, particularly Deputy Fitzpatrick, the purpose of the Bill is to try to get more turf produced and therefore we should not be concerned about who produces it as long as we get more.  That is a point of view with which I would not quarrel unduly.  But, having regard to the realities of the situation and the preponderance of owners of small segments of bog, we must encourage them to participate and not rely simply on a small number of individuals or companies.  We want them too, but if we are to get the major effort required we must involve the smaller people.  The only way to do so is to encourage them to form co-operatives so that it will be worth their while to work together on the development of their various stretches of bog and extract useful amounts of turf from such a conglomeration of turbary rights.</P>
    <P>These are the primary reasons why there is a discrimination, if one wants to <Col N="280" /> call it that, in favour of co-operatives.  In practice I do not think it will work to the detriment of anybody.  An individual or a couple of people forming a company would be dealing with a fairly substantial stretch of bogland which would require fairly substantial investment and a grant of 45 per cent would be quite sizeable. Given the price of turf at present and the rising price of fuel, we can take it that such people can be sure of a reasonably substantial return on their investment and that a grant of 45 per cent would be a very worth-while inducement to them to enter such a business.  In the case of people with relatively small sections of bogland available there is not such an incentive, but a grant of 60 per cent should be an inducement to them to co-operate with their neighbours.  We want them to get into the business.</P>
    <P>Deputy White raised the point as to whether the co-ops would have to be formal co-ops and that if they were there would be a requirement for registration, production of accounts and certain restrictions on their activities.  The Deputy had in mind the scheme in the Department of Agriculture where two or more farmers can share a machine, buying it together and getting a grant.  This arose from the EEC farm plant scheme.  It is a very loose and almost uncontrollable type of scheme.  I recognise that there are some difficulties and an historical and traditional reluctance to form co-ops but for long-term investment, long-term commitment for bog development and for long-term returns which may be what is involved here the obligation to form a co-op is not excessive if we achieve what is at stake here.  The definition sections says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;qualified society&rdquo; means a society which is registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in respect of which a certificate has been issued under section 3 of the Agricultural Co-operative Societies (Debentures) Act, 1934, or</P>
    <P>(b)  has for or amongst its purposes <Col N="281" /> or objects the provision of turf for fuel.</P>
    <P>There is a specific provision in the Bill for registration and the formal setting up of the co-op.  There is no need for a frighteningly formal requirement.  There are many small co-ops which are not unduly burdened with paper work or formalities. When I am talking about co-ops I am not talking about major co-ops.  I envisage a number of small co-ops being formed in order to exploit privately owned bogs under the provisions of this Bill.  I will give some further consideration to the point raised but my attitude at the moment is that the balance of advantage lies in favour of formal co-ops.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard and Deputy Kelly raised a point in regard to the production of machines here.  Some of those machines are produced here and there is a growing interest in achieving more production of machines.  Also there is at least one machine from abroad suitable for use on small scale operations which is being tried out here and if suitable for our conditions it is likely to be manufactured here by a State company for use by people availing of grants under this scheme. In fact, a number of people have been devoting their inventive abilities to the production of machines suitable for the cutting of turf and the draining of bogs in Irish conditions.  They are to be encouraged and are being encouraged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard made a point about having an exhibition of suitable machines and their use, particularly in areas where Bord na Móna have not been operating. This is a good point and I will follow it up to see what we can do in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to the planting of virgin bog by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and some other Deputies raised a similar point.  It is a valid point and in so far as there is a conflict here we must try to resolve it on a practical basis.  There is liaison between my Department and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to try to ensure co-ordination. The Department of Forestry have in the past acquired a good deal of bogland and have planted it although <Col N="282" /> over the years much bogland has not been planted and they have undertaken to co-ordinate with my Department in regard to future activities.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies who quoted from my introductory speech quoted one sentence and overlooked the next.  I said that it was estimated that there are available in non-Bord na Móna bogs about 1.1 million hectares, that is the best part of three million acres but I went on to say that it was also estimated that about 50 per cent of this was suitable for development for the production of turf as fuel. Some Deputies overlooked that and were calculating on the basis of 1.1 million hectares.  Allowing for the fact that we are talking only about half of that we are still talking about something in the region of one and a half million acres.  It is important that the development of this, particularly where it comes within or may come within the interest of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, should be co-ordinated having regard to the potential use of the land for the production of fuel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised a point in relation to section 6 (2) (a) where Bord na Móna were considering acquiring bogland. Deputy Kelly thought that this was a vague expression and I would not disagree with his criticism but I would make it clear that it is intended, in connection with establishing whether or not Bord na Móna were considering the acquisition of certain boglands, that it will be a question of fact and that the board will be obliged to show concrete evidence of consideration. I find it difficult to believe that the board could show without documentary evidence that they had been considering the acquisition of boglands.  While I have the greatest faith in Bord na Móna, in their achievements and in their good faith, it is necessary to reassure other people who will be dealing with them.  For that reason I want to make certain that there can be no question of stretches of bogland being tied up virtually permanently because Bord na Móna said they were considering taking them over.  That would be unsatisfactory.  In any case where it was stated that Bord na Móna were considering taking over the bogland <Col N="283" /> there would have to be concrete evidence that they were doing so.  While I am not ruling out the possibility that that could happen without any documentary evidence, I am saying I would find it difficult to believe it could be established without documentary evidence from Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Kelly about the constitutionality of the difference in grants &mdash; I know he did not push it very far; I think he said he was merely putting it on the record that he was raising the point &mdash; I doubt that there could be any substance in it, especially as we are talking about grants which are, by definition, subject to discretion.  It is open to the Government for policy reasons to give different levels of grants in the kind of circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the use of waste.  I do not want to go off on a tangent, but I just want to point out that the corporations in Dublin and in Cork are considering at present the setting up of plants for the utilisation of waste.  The latest thinking in this area is tending to move away from that and towards the production of briquettes from waste as a more economic way of handling the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  One has to do the equation to see where the advantage lies.  Deputy Kelly asked what was meant by the word &ldquo;detrimental&rdquo; as used in section 2 (3).  I will try to deal with that in a little more detail on Committee Stage and also with the question about the provisions dealing with recovery of the grant. The Deputy raised a point, which he acknowledged was more grammatical than anything else, on section 7 (2) about the use of the phrase &ldquo;comprised of&rdquo;.  I have no strong views on that.  We will see if we can meet his point if we do not offend the draftsman unduly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Either it is right or it is wrong.  There should be some authority <Col N="284" /> somewhere to tell us whether it is right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not strike me as being wrong.  The Deputy suggested two alternatives and either would do equally well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed its usage creeping in, in the past few years.  I think it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look at it. Deputy John Ryan and a number of other Deputies spoke about priority for access roads and in particualr the need for liaison with county engineers.  I agree with that, and I have made specific provision for it in the Bill.  I envisage in due course a very considerable reliance on expertise in local authorities and county development teams by Bord na Móna.  Apart from the fact that it would stretch Bord na Móna unduly if all these applications were to be handled directly by them, there is expertise available which could be used, particularly in areas where Bord na Móna do not operate, and even where they do operate that expertise and local knowledge can be more advantageous than the greatest expertise in Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern felt that access roads and drainage were the greatest priority. In many cases roads and drains do exist but have been allowed to fall into disrepair and need to be repaired or deepened. Grants can be made available for that purpose under this Bill.  Deputy Ahern also made a valid point when she said people who were trying to form a co-operative and operate under this scheme were, in effect, groping in the dark.  I know she has personal experience because she has been trying to organise something like this in an area in her constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving some thought to how we can get across to people who want to avail of this scheme information, whether by way of leaflet or otherwise, and keeping it as simple as possible.  I will have a look at the situation Deputy Ahern was talking about and we might be able to use it as a pilot scheme to discover what is the <Col N="285" /> best method of communicating the information to the people concerned as to how to go about the whole operation of forming a co-operative, getting the plan prepared and submitted, and applying for the grant in the most effective way.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed fear that the requirement to submit a plan might involve a degree of red tape and sophistication which would offset the scheme.  Certainly that is not our intention. The larger the scheme and the more complex the work that has to be done, the more detailed and sophisticated the plan will have to be, I suppose.  Subject to that, it is my intention to keep the plan and the applications as simple as possible and not tie up the whole operation in red tape.  That is not the object of the exercise.</P>
    <P>The real purpose in requiring a plan has been approved of by any Deputy who has adverted to this matter, that is, to try to ensure that we do not allow bogs to be despoiled, or turf to be wasted, by piecemeal and unplanned development. There are a considerable number of examples of this.  This resource is much too valuable to allow that to happen.  It is essential that any work we assist by way of grant should be in accordance with a development plan which will not waste the resource.  That is the only reason for that requirement.  I want to ensure that it is kept as simple and as unsophisticated as possible.</P>
    <P>This is a simple Bill designed to try to get the scheme off the ground as soon as possible.  I indicated &mdash; and a number of Deputies adverted to this &mdash; that there are questions in regard to title, commonage and various aspects of title which will present problems in certain areas.  This Bill does not attempt to deal with those problems.  They are complex and, if I waited to try to deal with them, the Bill would be delayed for a very long time. There is plenty of bogland where we can go ahead this year without those problems.</P>
    <P>That is not to say the other problems are to be forgotten.  It is important that we should tackle them.  They do not relate solely to the development of bogland. They arise in various other areas of <Col N="286" /> agricultural development, in drainage and in different aspects of life around the country.</P>
    <P>In so far as this problem relates to the development of bogland, one suggestion made which I think is worth while and which I will be examining is that Bord na Móna can acquire bogland compulsorily where such problems exist.  What the Deputy had in mind is something along the lines of the old Land Commission operation: the Land Commission took on the burden of sorting out complicated title afterwards with claimants.  That enabled the land to be divided up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>An alternative is the action Deputy O'Malley took two years ago in the Mineral Development Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possible approach and there may be others.  From the point of view of bogland development, the solutions will take time.  We must go ahead with the Bill as it stands but I will be examining other problems and if I can find some reasonably satisfactory solutions I will be coming back to the House with other proposals.  I have no doubt that this Bill will require amendment, apart from the question of title and so on.  It will require amendment, I would say within two years at least.  The Bill is experimental, it is approaching the problem in a particular way and from experience we are bound to learn better ways to tackle our problems.  I have no illusions that this is the last word on it: it is simply a start and we will be making changes in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies spoke of liaison with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and referred to somewhat similar problems in regard to the Land Commission. It is important that there should be liaison between the Department of Energy and the Land Commission and I shall try to ensure that that will be established.  Contrary to what some Deputies said, my understanding is that the Land Commission try to ensure that people who want it will get access to turf banks.  I will check on that position and try to ensure that there will be adequate liaison between the Department of Energy and the Land <Col N="287" /> Commission when their activities overlap.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to Deputy Leonard, who referred to it, that unlike the position during the Emergency, as we called it, under this Bill there will be far more use made of machinery.  During the war years there was reliance on hand won turf, outside Bord na Móna operations, but there will be substantial reliance on machinery in this scheme.  Deputy Leonard's suggestion about pilot schemes and exhibitions in areas like Monaghan where Bord na Móna do not operate is a worth-while one which I will examine carefully. I met Deputy Leonard and a deputation during my tour in regard to an area of 2,000 acres in north Monaghan near the Border.  We are following it up and hope to have a Bord na Móna inspector there to give advice on the best method to develop that substantial local resource.</P>
    <P>In one guise or another, various Deputies adverted to the possibility of ascertaining the extent and the nature of the resources we have in the form of privately owned bogs.  Some Deputies thought we do not have this information at all and that we should use the local authorities to get it.  Deputy Filgate is under the impression that Bord na Móna have all that information.  Neither is correct.  We have a good deal of information about a great deal of privately owned bogs, but we do not have all of it, and Bord na Móna are engaged in a survey to complete the compilation of outstanding information and they expect to have it completed within a year.  In the meantime there is a great deal of information already available in Bord na Móna on bogs that will never be used by them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the differential in the grants, Deputy O'Toole said that the 60 per cent grant is not generous.  There is no grant there at the moment and it seems to me to be quite generous; in any language a 60 per cent grant is substantial. Whatever about the 45 per cent, which I regard as adequate and appropriate in the cases to which it will apply, the 60 per cent grant is quite an inducement.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole suggested a pilot scheme for building access roads to bogs <Col N="288" /> and he compared the cost of having the work done by private contractors with that done by local authorities.  He applied the same comparison in relation to drainage. This point was raised in one form or another by several Deputies and I want to make it clear that if a local authority are willing to do so they may provide access roads to bogs, they may provide the work force and the expertise by arrangement with the applicant, whether that is a co-operative, a company or an individual, and the grant will be payable anyway.  In other words, if the local authority are willing to do this work as an agent I will welcome it, but we are not limiting those operations to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I should repeat that we will get experience as the scheme goes ahead.  At the moment people seem certain that unless we make allocations direct to local authorities for the full cost of access roads the scheme will not work.  That is not correct.  I think the scheme can work but let us see the scheme working and if we have to amend it we will consider doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole asked about the amount of money being provided.  It is difficult to estimate the cost until we have had experience, but £1 million will be made available this year.</P>
    <P>An important point that was raised by a number of Deputies was whether account would be taken of the time spent in carrying out work.  The short answer is yes, people will be allowed for this but the longer answer is that what I envisaged happening is that for a certain amount of work there will be a rule of thumb method of assessing what it would cost and a grant will be paid based on that cost irrespective of how the work is done but, of course, providing it has been carried out satisfactorily.  In effect, if people can do the work themselves their effort and work will constitute part of the cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan spoke of the need to plan the use of cutaway bog and I agree with him fully.  This is another reason for insisting on a plan being submitted with an application, using the expertise of Bord na Móna in dealing with it.</P>

      <P>I will advert to the matter under another heading.  Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question of the danger of this Bill reducing the amount of turf that will be produced this year because of a hold-up by the CDC in grants until this Bill is passed.  There might have been some grounds for this fear before but I took steps to deal with the matter and I understand it has been cleared up.  However, if Deputy Fitzpatrick or any other Deputy is aware of this happening I would be glad to hear about it.  I do not wish it to happen.  My understanding is the CDC will carry on as normal until this Bill is passed but if there is any evidence that this is not happening I should like to know about it.</P>
      <P>On the question of grants for machinery, I want to make it clear that the basic idea here is that grants under this scheme are intended to assist the production of turf.  There are some machines that can be used on the drainage of bogs or in the making of bog roads but they can also be used for other purposes.  It is not the intention to devote money under this scheme to machinery used for other purposes. As far as possible it is intended to confine grants for machinery under this scheme to machinery that is either exclusively usable for turf development or is primarily usable for that purpose.</P>

      <Col N="290" /> Deputy Conaghan asked that we include cases where there is no established ownership.  I mentioned the problems in regard to ownership and I am afraid that I cannot do anything about it under this Bill.  As I have indicated, I hope to be able to do something about it later.  The Deputy expressed a fear that there would be a concentration on areas where Bord na Móna operate because they are the areas they know well.  The Deputy instanced Donegal but he did not confine his remarks to that area.  I can give him a full assurance that that is not intended and I have no reason to believe Bord na Móna would operate in that way. He also urged the establishment of a briquette factory in Inishowen to serve the local area and also the city of Derry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid they would not be suitable for the purpose.  We will have the proposals examined but there is a lot of money involved.  Having regard to the demand and to the availability of supplies of turf in both areas there may be a case for doing what the Deputies have urged but there are other considerations also. However, they will be examined. Because of something Deputy Conaghan said, I want to make it clear that the only case in which the Minister for Energy has any role under this Bill in reviewing a decision by Bord na Móna is what I might describe as the conflict of interest case. That is dealt with in the Bill and we can discuss the matter in more detail on Committee Stage.  In all other cases discretion rests entirely with Bord na Móna and the Minister has not got a reviewing role in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned Údarás na Gaeltachta and its possible overlapping <Col N="291" /> with this scheme.  The intention is that this scheme will not interfere with existing schemes administered by Údarás na Gaeltachta but any grants available under such schemes would be taken into account in determining the amount paid under this scheme.  It is clear there should be liaison with Údarás na Gaeltachta to establish who does what and I will be making arrangements for such liaison.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny spoke about the 12 western counties being disadvantaged and having a higher rainfall.  He suggested that a higher level of grant should be paid to everybody in those areas, whether co-operatives or individuals.  All I can say is that we have substantial areas of bog that represent substantial amounts of wealth these days.  They did not in the past but they do now and people should be grateful for having those resources that we are now trying to develop, hope fully to their advantage as well as to the national advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny and others expressed some apprehension that Bord na Móna who would be administering the grants scheme would, in effect, be asked to give grants to people who would be competitors of the board.  I do not think there should be any worries on that score because, as was made clear under another heading, there is a shortage of turf and particularly briquettes.  Demand far outstrips the supply.  People producing more turf will find an ample market. They will not be in competition with Bord na Móna but will rather supplement the supply by Bord na Móna.  Most of the production of Bord na Móna is milled peat for the ESB rather than for the general public.  It is not realistic to fear that Bord na Móna will be unduly influenced by the fact that they are asked to pay out grants to competitors.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked about the total capital cost, not merely State contributions, involved in the private development of bogs plus Bord na Móna.  It is not possible for me to get an estimate of the total cost because that would include an estimate of the extent and pace of bog development.  It is clear that it could be several million pounds over three to five <Col N="292" /> years.  I cannot put an accurate figure on it.  Deputy O'Donnell also raised the question about financial help from the EEC.  The EEC have given some assistance with regard to certain experiments in relation to alternative energy but on a very limited scale.  We are seeking assistance in regard to this scheme but I believe, because turf is not a commodity that is widely available within the Community, there might be objections to it on the ground that it would primarily be of benefit to us and not to other people. It might be more helpful if the Community were to spend considerably more money on alternative energy sources rather than produce reports which are trying to push us into the nuclear age, whether or not we want to go in that direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Keegan said, I want to make it clear that the procedure adopted by Bord na Móna in regard to the acquisition of bogland for their ordinary purposes is not the subject of this Bill; that is where compulsory acquisition is involved.  However, I will draw his remarks in this regard to the attention of Bord na Móna.  In regard to his remarks about the distribution of briquettes these are based on sales in the year when they were last freely available. When there is a shortage and there has to be an effective form of rationing I believe it should be based on that.  People who have come into the business later either do not get supplies or get very little.  It is unfortunate that should be so but there has to be some way of dividing them out.  That is not an unreasonable way to approach the matter.  Deputies will be aware that plans are under-way for a substantial increase in the production of briquettes.  In my introductory speech I referred to the factory at Littleton in County Tipperary, which is coming into operation shortly, and, subsequently, another factory which is being built in Ballyforan.  The net effect of this should be to more than double the supply of briquettes on the market between the two factories.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about Deputy Taylor's suggestion that we go in for retraining through AnCO for people cutting turf.  I <Col N="293" /> do not believe it will be necessary but if it is we will have a look at it.  I certainly do not contemplate it at the beginning.  I explained, in relation to the question of grants for equipment, the distinction between those which are usable for other purposes and those which are not.  Deputy Taylor felt that equipment invented for use in turf cutting for attachment to a tractor should be given a grant.  I want to make it clear that such an attachment would qualify for a grant but the tractor would not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ciaran Murphy expressed concern about the topography of Wicklow in particular and the countryside in general as a result of the work that will be done under this scheme.  I agree with him and I feel a good deal can be done to tackle this problem.  I propose to have further discussions with Deputy Murphy in this regard because it is a matter of considerable importance.  I believe we can take some precautions which in the case of his constituency and some other cases are of concern to tourism but also of concern to those of us who live in the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Deasy's plea for the south-east.  I assure him that the south-east and the mountainous areas there, where bogs exist, are included in the Bill and qualify the same as areas in the midlands or the west of the country. There is no reason for the exclusion of the south-east.  He made the point, somewhat similar to that of Deputy Jimmy Leonard, that advice and help should be given, particularly in areas where there is not a great tradition of turf cutting, and especially where Bord na Móna have not operated.  I agree with that and I believe demonstration projects might be helpful. I will be examining those possibilities.  I will examine with Bord na Móna the suggestion by Deputy Filgate that the CPS section in Bord na Móna be re-established. I will also examine the transport problem which was referred to by Deputy Filgate and Deputy Deasy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to decisions on land use and said they should not be made by the Department of Energy alone.  As far as I am aware the only conflict that arises at present in this regard is between energy use, the use of <Col N="294" /> cutting turf on the one hand and tree planting on the other, not agricultural development.  I cannot see any substantial agricultural development on bogland, although I can see it on cut-away bog.  In any event the decision is not made by the Department of Energy but by the owner or developer of the bog.  It is different when we are talking about cut-away and the inter-departmental committee, to which Deputy Bruton referred, have reported.  An interim report was published in 1979.  It certainly did not give an answer to the problem to which Deputy Bruton adverted and about which Deputy Paddy Lalor was particularly concerned, the depth to which the bog should be cut.  Since the experts who got together on it did not give an answer I am afraid I cannot undertake to give an answer here.  I can, however, point out, as was pointed out in the interim report, that there is no single answer to this.  Physical conditions that obtain vary quite a bit from one part of the country to another, one type of bog to another.  What may be appropriate to one place may not be appropriate to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot give any specific answer to that but in so far as we can, or could do so in the future, it will be controlled by the giving of grants.  In other words, it can be made a condition of the grants that the bogs in question will not be stripped down to bedrock.  A certain amount will have to be left above it.  If we knew the amount that should be left we could provide for that.  Up to now, <Col N="295" /> and in the future, where a grant is not involved &mdash; there will be a good deal of work going on where grants are not involved although Deputy Lalor seems a little doubtful &mdash; we do not have any control at all and it is up to the people concerned as to what they are going to do.</P>
      <P>There are many bogs working away valuably producing the equivalent of £47 million worth of oil, the amount we are getting from private production of turf. Those people are operating away and do not need grants to do so.  If they wish to develop further they qualify for grants but as they are operating at present they do not need grants.  There is a substantial operation in progress at present which will not be subject to any control as far as we are concerned in relation to the depth they go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to note that Deputy Cowen agrees with the different rates of grants we propose.  When the scheme is in operation we will, as he said, have turf more freely available than at present but I have some doubt &mdash; I hope he will be correct in what he said &mdash; that because it is more freely available it will be cheaper.  I would like to think that that will be so but I would not like to guarantee it.  I should like to thank all Deputies who participated <Col N="296" /> for their contributions.

      <P>When speaking yesterday I had not understood that the co-ops envisaged by the Minister were ones which would only now be set up for the purpose of taking advantage of the scheme.  If that is what he has in mind I can see the point, but I should like to know if the Minister has thought of asking the co-operative movement to advertise the scheme in their own right as being a way in which the co-operative idea can, take hold in circumstances and in districts where they were never heard of before?

I also mentioned that I was giving thought to producing a simple leaflet explaining how to go about this.  In case the Deputy is under any misapprehension I should like to make it clear that I am not saying that the co-ops envisaged under the scheme will be those which will be newly formed for this purpose because I cannot confine it in that way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I spent some time on one aspect of the inadequacies of the definition section and I now propose to deal with some others. In passing I should like to state that Deputy Eileen Desmond will be in the House for the greater part of this debate and, in common with other speakers, I hope we will have major contributions from the women Deputies on this proposed legislation. One of the major weaknesses of the section is that it does not clearly state, and probably even excludes, the possibility that any man can be charged with rape in respect of his wife.  I do not know why we have not taken the opportunity in this section to make it absolutely clear that this in fact can be the case.  Maybe it is because of some delicacy that would not have us speak of these matters.  I cannot think of any other reason because nobody can read the background or the history of relationships between men and women without becoming painfully aware that marital rape while not necessarily common is certainly possible.</P>
      <P>Several jurisdictions have already explicitly written into their legal code a definition of rape which will include marital rape, rape by the husband on the wife.  We should be adult enough now to take the same step and put beyond doubt the fact that this is at least possible.  We are all aware of the fact that intimidation of one kind or another can take place within marriage.  That is bad enough at the best of times but when that intimidation is extended directly to the area of sexual relationship there is no realistic argument I can think of for calling that other than rape.  We should not be pushing this problem under the carpet by pretending that because a man and woman are married the man may not rape the woman within the context of that relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members who have been reading the papers over the last few weeks will know of a case in another juridiction when in what was regarded as a milestone decision by a court a man was found guilty of having raped his wife in a situation in which several of his friends held the unfortunate woman down and he <Col N="298" /> assaulted her with a knife before raping her.</P>
    <P>If we are not going to be honest about it and include the possibility of marital rape in our rape legislation we will be conniving at a situation in which that kind of thing could happen in this jurisdiction and that man could not be charged with rape.  He would be charged with other things, of course; he would be charged with assault, but it is almost inescapable that anybody who commits a rape can also be charged with commiting an assault because an assault of some kind is usually a preliminary to the rape.  In this particular case I am thinking of, the assault was actually carried out with a weapon.  If that assault and if that rape had been carried out within this jurisdiction, as I understand the law, that man would have been charged with that assault but not with the rape which followed it and to which the assault was an indispensable preliminary.</P>
    <P>Of course it is difficult to prove marital rape.  It is difficult to prove any kind of rape but anybody who thinks that women, married or not, take great pleasure in malicious prosecutions for rapes that never took place has very little understanding, much less experience, of the reality of the relationships that are involved.  We must remember that one of the main facts of life in connection with rape is that the man is stronger than the woman and that the degree of physical intimidation which is involved is usually part and parcel of the act of rape.  Anybody who believes that physical intimidation does not take place within marriage as a preliminary to sexual intercourse is not living in the real world. And it is my contention that sexual intercourse which takes place as a result of physical intimidation, under the threat of violence or actual violence, should be treated as rape whether it takes place within marriage or outside it.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister between now and Report Stage to consider this definition section very carefully, seriously and soberly with a view to considering whether or not women who are married should not be afforded the same kind of protection against rape as women who are not <Col N="299" /> married.  I believe that if the Minister takes a positive decision on this it will be one which will certainly redound to his credit and perhaps also to ours as a House and as a country in Europe, amongst jurisdictions which are slowly and very painfully facing up to this very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the definition section to which one should refer as well, that is, in subsection (3).  As I understand subsection (3) there is an automatic assumption that a young person of under 14 is not capable of committing rape.  We are all aware that the age of puberty both in young men and women is becoming lower all the time, that young men and women are becoming sexually mature at an earlier age than was ever the case before.  While it would be unusual, to say the least, that in the absence of such a provision anybody of 14 or younger would be accused of rape, I am sure most medical practitioners, most psychologists and most other people in the medical profession will tell you that this legal presumption is probably, in strict legal terms, now out of date.  The situation might be met if this presumption, which is a presumption in law, were made a rebuttable one and if evidence that sexual intercourse actually took place could be adduced to rebut that presumption.  Otherwise you would have a situation &mdash; unusual, I agree; unlikely to a very high degree &mdash; in which a young male person had achieved sexual intercourse in a manner which laid him open to an accusation of rape but who, simply because of his age, was regarded as not having committed that particular crime.</P>
    <P>Questions of age are always very difficult in law.  Many of us will be familiar with the situation in Britain many years ago when two young people were accused of murder.  At that time in Britain the death penalty existed, not just for murder, but for aiding and abetting a murder. On that occasion the young person who had pulled the trigger of the gun which had fired a shot which killed a man got off with his life while the person who was with him and who had not fired the shot, who had not killed the policeman, was <Col N="300" /> adjudged guilty of murder and was hanged, all because of a particular cut-off point in relation to age and responsibility. I think that case was very influential in Britain in the end in the general campaign for the abolition of capital punishment because it showed that the strict cut-offs in relation to age and responsibility very often have the effect of creating more injustices than they were intended to solve.  The fact is that if a woman is physically assaulted, violated, by somebody who is under this technical age of 14, it is not going to be of any consolation to her or her family that technically she was not raped because actually she was, she knows it, and the person who did it will know as well.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the remarks I am making would not be taken out of any kind of context because we are talking about exceptional situations, both in terms of marital rape and in terms of the possibility of rape by people who are under this particular age.  But I do believe that because it is unlikely that we will be dealing with this kind of legislation again for quite some time, we should make every possible effort to tidy it up, make it as comprehensive as possible, so that it will deal fairly and squarely with all the legitimate issues with which it might be expected to deal.</P>
    <P>There is one final point, that is, in relation to aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring rape which, of course, is also a rape offence under this definition section.  There may be situations in which married men who commit rape offences may be aware that their wives know what has happened, but are in a position to intimidate their wives, or indeed other members of their family who may be aware that an offence has taken place, to the degree that their wives, or the other people involved, are unwilling, unable or too terrified to go to the police with the information that a crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>It would be a real miscarriage of justice if, in situations like these, innocent members of the family of somebody who has committed a rape offence should in any way be held responsible for aiding or <Col N="301" /> abetting or acting as accessory after the fact in circumstances in which the same kind of physical intimidation that was preliminary to the rape offence in the first place was used to conceal information about it, afterwards.  So I would strongly appeal to the Minister to consider, between now and Report Stage, widening the definition of rape and making it clear in particular that rape can exist within marriage as well as outside it.</P>
    <P>This is not intended in any way as a reflection on the hundreds of thousands of decent, ordinary mutual marriage relationships which form the vast bulk of Irish marriage experience and indeed the marriage experience of most countries in the world, but it is to admit and to recognise, as I have said, that if we think it important to provide this degree of protection to women outside marriage we should apply it equally to women inside marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion Deputy Keating commented that he would like to see the definition of sexual intercourse include oral and anal penetration and the use of other foreign bodies such as bottles and sticks.  He said that the reason why he would like to see this change is to bring acts of that type within the scope of the crime of rape and to subject them to the same penalty.  I have stated on a number of occasions and emphasised the Government's deep concern about cases of indecent assault on women.  I have also indicated that the Government feel that the best way of dealing with the problem is not by changing the traditional and long established definition of rape but by increasing the penalty for indecent assault which we have suggested and proposed in section 10 of the present Bill.  It is important to realise that the crime of rape carries the possible result of pregnancy and in that regard natural intercourse is an essential ingredient.  Certainly that possibility of pregnancy makes it very different from any other type of crime in this category and of course the rape offence means any of the following, as stated in section 1: rape, aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring rape or attempting rape, and <Col N="302" /> incitement to rape.  In that regard there is adequate provision in the definition and certainly to retain the definition of rape as it is commonly known and understood is in the interests of the victim.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan in quoting the definition of a rape offence on the last occasion asked that there be included in section 1(1), for example, the concealment or withholding of information after the rape by people who may have reason to know that rape has taken place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not included at all. Since rape is a felony the conduct referred to may, according to the circumstances, amount to being an accessory after the fact of felony or to misprison of felony but neither of these offences is included in the definition of rape offence. An accessory after the fact of felony is one who, knowing another to have committed a felony, aids him to escape apprehension or prosecution and, misprison of felony consists of concealing or procuring the concealment of a felony known to have been committed.  Prosecutions for being an accessory after the fact to felony take place from time to time, but prosecutions of misprison of felony are extremely rare and the existence of the offence was disputed in England until the decision of the House of Lords in 1961.</P>

    <P>Deputy Horgan raised the question of marital rape.  Again in Britain this was examined in 1976 and recommendations were made recently but still the law has not been changed in that respect.  Marital rape is a very delicate and difficult area to legislate in, as the Deputy will appreciate. We must take into consideration a number of things: the question of the proof and the fact that the law will be required to scrutinise a very intimate area of marital relationship and marital life. For that reason it is not something that we could proceed to legislate for without giving very serious attention to it.  This is borne out where the British Government have been concerned.  It is fair to state &mdash; and I have found this in speaking to a considerable number of women's groups <Col N="303" /> and deputations &mdash; that, while there was concern expressed about this particular area, the number of complaints that have been received from women which stated that there was marital rape are very few. In fairness it was said that it might be on the increase in recent years.  But at no time were any of the deputations in a position to tell me if such complaints had been reported to the Garda, so it is clearly evident that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They could report them on the basis that assautt or even indecent assault could be proceeded with.  Reports of them are few, but if they occur then we in this House would be delighted to think that they would be reported.  The existing penalties for assault and the proposed increase of the penalty for indecent assault will clearly show to wives who are in such a difficult and horrific situation that serious penalty is liable to be handed down on conviction if they were prepared to report these matters to the Garda. Perhaps changing attitudes and more modern attitudes in this area might ensure that.  Certainly in this Bill we are updating and modernising our attitude and clearly indicating our awareness of the fact that there can be very aggravated indecent assaults.  But it is now the situation that the victims of these assaults must report them to the investigating authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan referred to the question of boys under 14 years of age.  The Council for the Status of Women suggested in their submission that no person, by reason of his age, should be presumed to be incapable of sexual intercourse.  The Bill proposes to maintain the common law rule in this regard.  The case for removing this rule is simply that it is anomalous.  At the same time the point is of very little importance in practice especially since a boy who has in fact <Col N="304" /> committed or attempted to commit rape could be convicted of indecent assault and if the rule was changed and a boy under 14 was convicted of the rape offence he would, in all likelihood, be dealt with in the courts in the same way as at present.  As to marital rape, I might add for the information of the House that in South Australia, Scandinavia, some states in the US and some of the Eastern European countries, have legislated for rape within marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr Keating Mr Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of sticky points in section 1 and I do not think the Minister of State has answered fairly the question in relation to section 1(1)  about the interpretation.  We might deal with that more extensively in section 2 when we get down to the meaning of rape.  For example, to say that the penalty for indecent asaault has been increased in the Bill and that that will give adequate protection to women who have not been raped in accordance with the technical definition, which obviously is penial penetration and proof of that, simply is not good enough.  The Minister knows that there are people who for one reason or another indulge in sexual violence of a nature which in some cases in terms of its effects, physical, psychological, traumatic and so on, is worse than what we might call traditional intercourse.  There might even be people who are perverted, sick, masochistic or brutal in some way or other and who have carried on in this way and injured in every respect but because they have nor completed the act of sexual penetration they are not open to be convicted with the same severity and sanction as somebody who has committed sexual intercourse by definition of the fact that they have not managed to have this act of physical consummation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not good enough.  If the Minister were saying, for example, that the punishment or penalty for indecent assault was to be increased to the same level there might be a case for accepting what he says and it would be merely almost a question of semantics, but that is not the case.  The position in section 10 is that the punishment for indecent assault in increased from two years to ten <Col N="305" /> years.  The reality, as the Minister knows, is that it is still very possible and it does happen that somebody is brutalised for whom our protection should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I can see problems with increasing the punishment for indecent assault also because of course the definition of indecent assault is extremely nebulous and arguably could range from kissing another person against that person's will upwards.  That obviously is a problem if you are going to talk about the possibility of giving life imprisonment to somebody for indecent assault, but there is a matter for the courts and for further definition of indecent assault.  Available research shows that in the climate and environment that we have today the act of indecent assault carried to certain extremes for the gratification it affords and the brutalising effect it has on the victim, weighed as a crime which is at least as repugnant and unacceptable as the most repugnant act of rape, should carry at least the possibility of the same sentence. At all times I assume that long and typical jail sentences are appropriate for this kind of crime.  That is an assumption and I am not sure whether it is so, but as long as we have that approach to it we have a choice.  Either broaden the definition of rape to include these acts of sexual violation which are increasing in number, or increase the penalty for indecent assault to ensure that there is justice in this area. The fact that the would-be attacker is interrupted or is impotent or assuages his sexual needs in some horrific way which does not amount to traditional sexual intercourse as we understand it should not be the grounds for a less serious and grave approach to the actual sexual violence involved.  Accordingly, I would not accept what the Minister says in that regard.</P>
    <P>He mentioned also that the act of sexual intercourse being open to pregnancy somehow is a feature which makes it more appropriate for a heavier sentence. The pregnancy is a by-product, is not thought about or wanted probably by either party.  To me it is in many respects irrelevant to the manner in which we should view the severity of the crime, <Col N="306" /> unless it can be proven in some way &mdash; which is extremely unlikely &mdash; that the rape was intended to make the victim pregnant, but I do not see how that could be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even in marriage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The pregnancy argument is a physical characteristic of one kind of sexual assault.  It is a by-product &mdash; but those are not very good words to use &mdash; a result which is at one remove from the act of sexual violence and should not be used as a justification for taking a different view of the attack.  The evidence available to us is that sexual violence is increasing &mdash; we need not go into the reasons for that on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The Minister says that in his discussions with some of the interest groups they have not been able to tell him, for example, of the increasing statistics in relation to alleged rapes within marriage.  I am not surprised at that because the paucity of statistics in this area is horrific anyway.  People are not keeping statistics apart from specific reportages to the Garda of rapes, which, as we all know, are probably only the tip of the iceberg, for a number of reasons. In relation to that I ask the Minister to reconsider the question of the definition. If he does not do that I ask him to accept the possibility of increasing the punishment for indecent assault in the context of the kind of sexual violence I am talking about to compare with the punishment potential of the traditional act of sexual intercourse.  That would seem to make it at least just from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 (2) is a continuation of a very narrow definition of what is eligible to be termed rape under the Bill and I would consider it to be much too narrow.  I might as well deal with all of these subsections while I am on my feet.  Section 1 (3)  relates <i>inter alia</i> to the question of marital rape which has been raised by everybody in the House who spoke on this Bill so far.  I do not understand what the problem is in this regard.  There cannot be any justification for accepting that there should be a difference in our approach, as people concerned with justice, <Col N="307" /> depending on the relationship of one party with the other.  If, for example, we had legislation which proposed certain punishments in the event of a fellow of 17 years of age mugging a middle-aged woman but which would not apply if the woman he mugged were his mother, it would be laughed out of court.</P>
    <P>The same logic applies here.  The only spurious justification which the literature advances very tentatively in these cases is that there has been in the past a traditional notion that a woman somehow was the subjugate property of her husband and that interfering in this area was, as the Minister said, opening up areas of intimate scrutiny.  I do not want overbearing scrutiny in any area not deserving of it but the fact that the parties are married to one another should not mean that a woman has not got the right to be treated with justice.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in relation to marriage where the Government and the law insist on insinuating themselves.  It does not relieve us of the important central principle here &mdash; that this Bill is designed to protect people.  I honestly cannot and will not accept that a situation should be tolerated where any woman, merely because of her status, should get a different standard of justice, which is what this Bill does.  That situation is archaic and should be changed.  It is a practice which has grown up in common law over the years and I am disappointed that the Bill proposes to continue it. Nobody expects that people who are married would have frequent recourse to the law.  If that is happening in a marriage or in an extra-marital relationship, there may be other responses appropriate to it which might be better than dragging one's spouse to court.  A dual standard of justice is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister examples of how nonsensical that provision is.  Common law marriages are increasing.  We have the ludicrous situation where the party who have tied the knot legally as it were &mdash; a woman in that situation who has been raped by her husband has an inferior standing in law than another couple who are living together but who are <Col N="308" /> not married.  Let us assume that a woman is aware that her husband has venereal disease or some kind of congenital defect which the act of sexual intercourse could transmit to her.  There is no qualification about her position.  Suppose the man was a drug addict, or had problems of one kind or another, which clearly made him a person with whom sexual relations might not be desirable or indeed could be very dangerous to the health and welfare of his wife.  Are we suggesting this woman should, like an object, allow herself to be subjugated to repeated sexual assault against her will because she is married? That is what the Bill proposes.  It is barbaric. A married woman should have the same rights as any other woman and anyone who advocates the contrary is guilty of extreme double standards.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Horgan, I do not want to elevate this beyond the context and I do not expect it is common or frequent. However, the fact that cases are not reported is not evidence it is not common. I know of instances where the drunken husband comes home and insists on imposing his will on his wife.  A certain tradition and acceptance has grown up that to oppose that kind of behaviour will be met by violence, brutality and beatings. That woman deserves our protection.</P>
    <P>This notion dates back basically as far as the 1650s when Hale in his Pleas of the Crown wrote</P>
    <P>The husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband which she cannot retract.</P>
    <P>This is a report commissioned by the British Government and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1975. It is a report of the Policy Advisory Committee on Sexual Offences, page 12, paragraph 29.</P>
    <P>The critics of this law point out that since Hale's time wives can retract this consent.  They can get divorces and separation orders.  The courts have had <Col N="309" /> to recognise in relation to rape modern changes in attitude towards marriage.</P>
    <P>It is a lot of nonsense to talk about this being a sacred area in which the law does not intervene.  We do it all the time, whether in relation to the protection of children, to income tax assessment or any other area of family law.  The Minister or his senior colleague two days ago introduced intimate changes in relation to family law, some of which had been demanded by this side of the House a year ago.  The alleged sanctity and intimacy argument is spurious and does not cut any ice.</P>
    <P>The new recognition of changing attitudes to marriage, particularly to the status of women, underlining their equal standing in law and their equal dignity, should afford them the protection they need.  There are people who, obviously, will have qualms about this.  They may fear there will be an increase in the number of cases reported.  I hope not because in other contexts we should do our best to ensure that marriages which are in difficulty should be helped and that marriages which are doomed to failure should not take place.  It is not just a single facet we are talking about.  I argue strongly for equality of legal protection for all women, regardless of whether they are married or single.  I do not accept the case the Minister has advanced in this regard. The Minister said the number of cases reported to him by one of the groups that came to see him were interpreted to be few and rare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the numbers, it is the principle one wants to get <Col N="310" /> right.  It is no solace to know there are few or more complaints.  There should not be even one woman who has to suffer sexual assault from a man, whether he is her husband or not.  There are degrees of marital relationships.  Is it right that a woman who is separated from her husband should fear that her door will be broken down at night and that she will be raped by her husband?  Is she not entitled to the same protection as other women? Let us make women equal under the law. That is all we are asking for.</P>
      <P>Regarding subsection (3), I have certain qualms about the age limit.  Let us at least point to the fact that there is an inherent anomaly in the Bill in this regard.  The age of criminal responsibility in this jurisdiction remains, so far as I know, at the extraordinarily low age of 7, the lowest in Europe.  I am sure all sides of the House will agree that that situation is much in need of review.  However, we are talking here about the age of 14 as being the appropriate age below which a person would not be capable of being charged with rape.  Why should there be any age set?  Nobody wishes to see children being brought before the courts on certain charges but taking into account the presumption that sexual maturity is necessary before a person can commit the crime of rape, only those who are psychologically and physically suited to being able to commit such a crime would be before the courts in the first place.  I am just wondering whether, if we must set age limit, 14 is the right one. At any rate, this provision needs more justification than we have for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of one case in recent times in which a most brutal act of rape was committed and in which were involved a number of young people, some of whom had not even reached the teenage years but all of whom knew what they were doing.  I am not interested in having children locked up in prisons but at the same time we know that any age cut-off will make for certain injustices.  People of 15 or 16 might be guilty of rape without knowing fully what they were doing but others of only 12 or 13 might know very well what they were doing.  I am wondering whether there is any way in which we <Col N="311" /> could allow those prosecuting &mdash; perhaps the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; to become involved in this question.  That might set a precedent which would apply across the board but that might not be so bad, either.</P>
    <P>I am committed unequivocally so far as we are concerned to the two main elements which are causing difficulty in section 1, first there is the question either of changing the definition to include other acts of sexual denigration and abuse or at the very least of increasing the sentence in respect of indecent assault so as to make that sentence as severe as the sentence for the crime of rape.</P>
    <P>The other point is that the status of the parties involved should not relate to their capacity to seek justice in law.  In other words, any woman who is raped should be capable of taking an action against the person or person who raped her.  If the Bill goes through as it is now, I have no doubt but that if some enterprising woman &mdash; and fortunately we have had some enterprising women &mdash; should bring the case to the European Court on Human Rights she would win.  I say this because the omission of the provision I am talking about goes against every concept of natural justice.  Why should a contractual relationship deprive a woman of the same right to seek justice as would be available to a couple who, say, were co-habitating or to single people or to couples who were separated legally?  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what is the maximum penalty for rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the reason for differentiation between the maximum sentence for rape and the maximum sentence for indecent assault is in relation to the severity of the case.  What we have been arguing is that equal cases demanded equal treatment and that a rape is a rape is a rape, to paraphrase another expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with considerable care to the Minister and I think that there is a major <Col N="312" /> logical flaw in his argument.  That logical flaw can be identified if one analyses what he said in relation to the first part of our problem which is the definition of rape and to the second part of our problem which is the question of whether any act within marriage can be construed as rape. In relation to the first of these matters the Minister has insisted that any of the acts described by Deputy Keating and by myself cannot be construed as rape because natural intercourse did not take place.  In relation to the second point he is saying that a particular sexual assault by a married man against his wife is not rape despite the fact that natural intercourse did take place.  There is a fundamental inconsistency between those two cases.  We could put the matter the other way around and talk about it in terms of aggravated indecent assault.  In the case of the first example it was aggravated indecent assault because natural intercourse did not take place while in relation to the marital case it was aggravated indecent assault though natural intercourse did take place.  What is the difference? The difference is a piece of paper known as a marriage licence.  I am sure that most women who sign a marriage licence and thereby put themselves in some form of contractual relationship with their husbands do so generally speaking on the basis of acquiring rights, not of signing them away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>How would anyone describe as other than rape the kind of thing we have been talking about where it happens within marriage?  Is it to be known as making love, to use a perversion of that word?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The irony of the case I quoted earlier and which happened in another jurisdiction whereby a man assaulted his wife physically and then raped her while his friends held her down is that he can be charged and sentenced for everything involved except the actual act to which the whole enterprise is directed.  This is simply because of the marriage certificate. According to what Deputy Keating has said there is in common law the presumption <Col N="313" /> of consent on the part of the wife.  There may or may not be such presumption but even if we admit that there is we are here making it unmistakable that that presumption cannot be rebutted by any evidence.  Surely it is part of common law that presumptions can be rebutted.  It is not the Minister's job to interpret the law.  That is a matter for the courts but I would at least like to hear his observations on the possibility of a judge within the common law accepting evidence to rebut that presumption of consent.</P>
    <P>In relation to his first definition of what constituted rape the Minister said that natural intercourse was important because of there being involved the possibility of conception.  He said that this made the crime more serious.  I could not agree more but the only difference between the two cases we are talking about, that is, one outside marriage and one within marriage, is that within a marriage if conception takes place the child that is born is legitimate whereas a child born outside marriage is illegitimate. There are other anomalies in this regard. The child of any married woman is presumed to be the child of her husband unless there is strong evidence to the contrary.  That is not something I wish to go into now but when we are talking about this matter we must accept that down through the centuries questions of legitimacy and of illegitimacy have had far more to do with property and the transmission of property rights than with the question of the quality of the physical relationship between the parents of a child.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis the only grounds on which I can detect the Minister resting his case are those relating to questions of delicacy and not wanting to interfere in the intimate sphere between husband and wife.  I can assure the Minister, as I am sure Deputy Keating can also, that if a married woman is put to the point of going to a Garda station or a Counsel or a friendly lawyer to allege that her husband has effectively raped her, she will not thank anybody if she is told that <Col N="314" /> questions of delicacy forbid this particular charge being brought against some body with whom she has a certain legal relationship because what has taken place has been an act of the grosses indelicacy and one which is normally called rape and one which should surely be described and treated as rape under the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reference to marital rape Deputy Keating is failing to recognise &mdash; I do not believe it is intentional &mdash; that apart from the penalty for indecent assault, which will be ten years, under the Bill there is also a penalty for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, which carries life imprisonment, the same penalty provided for rape.  If a married woman should be subjected by her husband to intercourse while he had venereal disease, he being under the influence of drugs or drink, that demand of the husband would clearly be without her consent.</P>

      <P>I should like a little more clarification.  Is the Minister now conceding or suggesting that there are circumstances in which in the context of a married couple a court could decide that the husband had in fact raped the wife?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the charge of rape.  I want to be clear about this because if we can get agreement on this there is no great problem in this respect.  Is the Minister saying &mdash; certainly this is what I interpret him as saying &mdash; that there are cases where in relation to a married couple &mdash; there may be extreme circumstances but that is secondary &mdash; there are some cases in which it is conceivable or possible that a husband can be charged with rape of his wife. Could I get an answer to that question? <Col N="317" /> That is what I presume the Minister is saying.  Is that what he is, in fact, saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a related question which the Minister was trying to come to meet, but he did not come very far.  He said, if I heard him correctly, that it would be open to a court to decide, first of all, whether consent to intercourse had been withheld by a married woman in respect of her husband.  Then he went on to say, in relation to rape, that it was open to the court to decide whether such a prosecution should be brought.  As I understand the legal system, it is not the judges who bring prosecutions, but the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Judges do not have the right to convict people on any charges other than charges on which they have been brought before the court.  There are occasions on which judges allow people to plead guilty to lesser charges, but in those cases more serious charges are withdrawn by the prosecution.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a circularity about the Minister's case.  He seems to be saying that, if consent is withheld in a specific kind of circumstances, it would be open to the court to find that a married man was guilty of raping his wife.  We are arguing that the legal system precludes the possibility of judges changing charges in mid-stream.  The most they could do would be to refer the case back to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  When it got back to the DPP, could he, in the light of this Bill, institute a charge of rape?  I do not think he could.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making in reply to Deputy Keating was that in certain circumstances the court might hold that rape had occurred between husband and wife &mdash; in certain circumstances. According to English law, these circumstances include cases of a separation agreement with a non-cohabitation clause between husband and wife, a <i>decree nisi</i> of divorce, or a decree of judicial separation.  The Deputy is aware of these situations, I am sure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>These are situations where the court has held a particular view.  I further suggest that the court might in certain other situations hold the same view.  I think what I am saying is quite clear and understandable.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether the prosecution should be brought.  In his wisdom, he might decide that a prosecution should be brought.  I am not suggesting otherwise. This is in reply to specific matters which the Deputy instanced.  I have accepted, and do accept, that this is a very serious and delicate area; and I do not say that gross indecent assault or serious bodily harm, or intercourse without consent of the wife, does not occur within marriage. What I am saying is that this is an area where it is very difficult to obtain the proofs.  We have to be very careful when legislating for this area.  I have also referred to the difficulties which may arise in relation to the effects of such legislation on what we know and understand to be the traditional Irish concept of marriage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating mentioned the case of a common-law marriage and the question of rape within that type of marriage. Common law marriage is not recognised under our law.  It would be the same as if two people were not joined in marriage and there was an act committed under the proposed definition, without consent. Again it would be, for the purpose of this Bill, a rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to a quotation from <i>Women's Rights</i>&mdash;<i>A Practical Guide</i> by Anna Coote and Tess Gill, 1977, page 205.  This, simply paraphrased, says that at the moment a husband cannot be found guilty of raping his wife unless separation or divorce proceedings have been started.  That is under the English jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be clear about this and, with great respect, I do not wish to abuse the Minister's humanity in this regard.  I feel that he wants to help us if he can at all. <Col N="319" /> The facts are that it is not a matter for the court to decide on the basis of evidence submitted whether X, Y, or Z charge should be promoted.  It is not a matter either of any doubt or ambiguity. I have said already and repeat now &mdash; and I want the Minister to tell me whether I am right or wrong &mdash; that the fact is that marital status in itself implies that we have this dual standard of justice, that a woman who is not married can have any man charged for raping her.  A wife cannot do so, has not done so ever, and will not do so ever, unless this proposed Bill is changed.</P>
    <P>I have submitted to the Minister two examples of how nonsensical this provision is.  The first is where a man known to be, for example, a sufferer from veneral disease or somebody with some kind of endemic or congenital defect by force of his will insist on communicating to his wife or runs the risk of communicating to his wife.  That woman is not allowed to sue him for rape.  That is the fact.  Nothing which the Minister has said does any more than reveal his genuine human concern and compassion at the situation.  However, the Bill which he is promoting changes nothing since Hale's law of 1605, which says, effectively in a sentence, that the man owns the woman in a marital situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are that the thrust of common law in this respect still depends upon the territorial right or whatever the <i>rationale</i> is.  I am not concerned about 350 years ago.  All I am saying is that at the moment a woman in marriage has fewer rights than the single woman in this respect.  That is wrong: it should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, take the case of a woman living apart from her husband, though no legal separation may have been obtained &mdash; and, tragically, this is increasingly common in our society &mdash; where her husband kicks the door in at night and forces her to have sexual intercourse.  That <Col N="320" /> woman, living apart from her husband and perhaps in fear of him, cannot have him charged for rape.  Where it is clear that a woman's physical or mental well being could be detrimentally impacted upon by sexual relations, where she does not want them, rejects them and rebuts any proposals, nevertheless, in a situation where it is forced upon her that woman does not have the same right as a single woman.  The reality is that the marriage contract in this respect, as Deputy Horgan rightly pointed out, signs away rights.  The continuation of this proposal in the current Bill is, in fact, an encouragement to people not to get married.</P>

      <P>The sticking points appear to be in the first section.  If we could get over that, the rest will run smoothly.  What is fundamental now is not so much a difference of view between the Minister and myself but an apparent similarity of view, though that is not borne out by the law.  I want to be clear about this and ask it in one sentence.  Is the Minister saying that there are circumstances under which a husband may be charged with rape?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a situation which resulted in the Government bringing in this Bill and we had difficulty getting rape victims to report the matter.  That is why after very careful consideration this Bill is before the House as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that, where there are exceptions known in Britain relating to certain types of occurrences within marriage, it is possible in future in this country that that type of case would come before our courts and, in relation to some of the matters raised by the Deputy, the court might hold that, if a husband who suffered from venereal disease proceeded to subject his wife to intercourse without her consent, it was rape and accordingly convict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The only interpretation I can make of what the Minister says is that there are circumstances in which a husband may be open to be charged with rape.  I suggest that that is not the case. If the English language means anything, the Minister is telling me that in some circumstances, under some process, the husband can be charged with rape.  I am informing the Minister that that is not possible.  The Minister quoted British experience at great length&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to suggest <Col N="322" /> that the Deputy is misinterpreting me but I can take no other view.  I referred to certain circumstances which the Deputy instanced and I acknowledged that in that type of circumstance if the wife refused consent, it is very likely that the court would hold that rape occured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy there have not been any cases in this country but there are daily situations where people are constantly availing of rights which may have been in existence for many years but of which they did not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is suggesting that, by a process of having gone through the Supreme Court or the European Court of Human Rights, a change in the law would be enforced which would give women equality of rights under this Bill, I would agree with him.  But it is accepted that because a woman is married, and regardless of the relationship between her husband and herself, and simply because there is a marriage contract recognised by the State, she does not have the same rights as a single woman who is raped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quotes British examples. There is so little research done in most of these areas in this country that we have to look somewhere for guidelines.  Why does the Minister think that in 1975 the Policy Advisory Committee told the Criminal Law Revision Committee, at paragraph 32, of their report that in their opinion there was no longer sufficient ground to justify the husband's exemption and that it should be removed?  All the evidence, all the literature and the understanding among lawyers is that there is an exemption in relation to husbands. A husband has never been charged, and cannot be charged under <Col N="323" /> this Bill, with the rape of his wife.  Am I correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct. The instance the Deputy gave could not be a basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unlikely that a sane wife would be prepared to put herself at risk and for that reason she would withdraw her consent.  In that case the Deputy is suggesting the husband could not be charged with rape.  Besides the cases we know of outside the country, and we do not have any reported in this country, it is possible that the decision would be the same here also.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that in the definition there are no circumstances where we can provide for the inclusion of rape within marriage because first a number of things have to be established.  I have already referred to them and I will not bore the House by repeating them.  I want the House to understand that this is an area the Government and I will be <Col N="324" /> particularly anxious to examine.  I would not be so naive as not to believe that many horrific acts, some of them incomprehensible, can occur in marriage.  I will certainly monitor and very closely examine what can be done by way of legislation in relation to that very delicate and intimate area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not have to discuss for half-an-hour what we think we are saying.  I think the Minister is saying that he believes this Bill would facilitate a charge of rape by a man in the circumstances I outlined regardless of the marital or contractual arrangements between husband and wife.  If that is the underlying principle of the Bill, I am at one with the Minister.  But I do not think this section facilitates that.  That is a significant departure.  The Minister is saying that in some circumstances the door is open for a wife, if she feels that is the best way to go about it, to take action for rape the some as a single person could.  Deputy Horgan, Deputy Desmond and anybody else concerned about this matter would be willing to welcome that advance on the basis that we are treating people as equal under the law regardless of their marital status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not change the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough, but we cannot have it both ways.  Under the law, a wife cannot under any circumstances take the action the Minister implies she might be able to take.  I am willing to let this rest with the Minister for the moment because I believe it needs to be cleared up.  The Minister has cast doubts on the legal situation, which is that the wife has no right to take an action or to have an action taken for rape.  The Minister said it is very likely there are certain circumstances where a wife could do that, but I want to tell him there is none.  It never happened.  If the Minister wants that to happen, and the humanity he is showing in the way he is handling this Bill conveys that to me, we need to change this legislation.  I do not care very much about the technical details provided we <Col N="325" /> can at least ensure that the barbaric principle that a woman who has a legal relationship with a man has fewer rights than one of her peers is rejected.  This is happening and these women need our protection as much as anybody else.</P>
      <P>I would not accept that we should continue this double principle, where night after night a woman has to take sexual abuse and violence simply because of her alleged relationship with a man, a relationship which may have been initiated under a variety of circumstances; where a woman who is separated from her husband has not the same rights as any other woman; or where a woman is subjected to physical and sexual violence from a man who may have a physical or other characteristic which may put her health in danger.  I want that cleared up as soon as possible because there is grave doubt, although there is no doubt in my mind, that a misapprehension is being propagated, that certain married women in certain circumstances might be able to have a charge of rape pursued.  I submit that is not the case and that a change in this section is necessary if we are to bring about equality for our citizens regardless of their status.  This present exclusion is as logical as refusing to have a man charged because the person he mugged was his mother.  It is as archaic and as nonsensical as that.  Our citizens must not be treated unequally and equal standards of protection for all women should be enshrined in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for having missed the debate so far.  Without retierating what has already been said, I agree totally with Deputy Keating that it is vital that the protection of this legislation be extended to women within marriage and that this should be specifically stated in the Bill.  There is no doubt that underlying all legislation in this area is the concept of a woman as a chattel, the property of her husband.  We must move away from that concept and extend to women in marriage the rights which this Bill purports to extend to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he understands that some horrific things happen in marriage.  I do not think it is <Col N="326" /> necessary to say to any mature person or politician in this House that this is the situation.  He said that he intends to examine this area thoroughly and I appeal to him to give the matter urgent priority.  As far as I can see, a charge cannot be brought to court under this Bill by a woman within marriage.  I would ask the Minister to examine this area and to ensure that an appropriate amendment to extend the protection of the Bill to women within marriage be made before the Bill is finalised.  Obviously I do not wish this urgently needed Bill to be held up, but with the right commitment in this area it will be possible to make the necessary amendments to include these women.  This would be consistent with the thinking which we hope now prevails with regard to the equality of all persons and their integrity, whatever their status. I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us a little more on his apparent inability to help with this reasonable suggestion to extend protection to married women.  He must explain to us why he brought in a Bill of this kind when he knew of the concern of the Opposition and of women's organisations to extend the protection of the Bill to married women.  It seems an extraordinary thing that the whole ceremony of marriage &mdash; what is called by the churches the &ldquo;sacrament&rdquo; of marriage &mdash; should have the effect of depriving a woman of what should be considered to be her constitutional right as a citizen.  Section 1 (3) states:</P>
      <P>In this Act &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo; include respectively a male and a female person of any age; but this does not affect any rule of law by virtue of which a male person is treated by reason of his age as being incapable of committing an offence of any particular kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should state that this Bill excludes a married woman and the Minister should be put in the position of defending his reasons for this exclusion.  We know the reasons well.  The situation which I most <Col N="327" /> often encounter as a psychiatrist and as a politician is one in which a marriage has broken down and the lady has got a barring order, pitifully inadequate as it may be since she cannot get a divorce under our laws, or one of the many kinds of separation arrangements which can be made in court; the man from whom she has separated then returns and the fact that she had obtained an order barring this man would seem to me to be a <i>prima facie</i> case for establishing that she did not want to have sexual intercourse with him and could be reasonable grounds for her being allowed to claim rape.</P>
    <P>We seem to feel that we are fighting our way to a great truth at which nobody else in the world has arrived.  I recently heard of a case in Sweden and another in France where a lady established her case in court.  There are precedents.  Why should we not accept, even with some safeguards, that we should begin to help the married lady in our society?  She is deprived in so many other things and this is a simple matter which would not cost money.  It is simply a question of equity.</P>
    <P>I apologise that I did not hear all the Minister's case but he was quite correct in making the appalling admission that some horrific things happen within marriage. Surely that is one reason why we must look at marriage not only as a marvellous and, to many, sacrosanct institution in our society but also for an unfortunate few as a truly terrifying experience.  But we cannot isolate these few.  We have not the right to deprive them of constitutional protection under the law, the same kind of protection we give to a prostitute who can claim that she has been raped and can bring a case to court.  A married woman cannot make such a claim.  It seems anomalous and very unjust.  Can the Minister give an undertaking that before the conclusion of the Bill he is likely to introduce an amendment that would at least advance the position in some way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote something from Smith and Hogan on Criminal Law (page 402):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> Intercourse by a husband with a wife may be &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; where there has been a judicial separation or a <i>decree nisi</i> of divorce or nullity, an injunction against molestation or an undertaking to the court not to molest.</P>
    <P>The other case is in Clarence Stephen J. who</P>
    <P>thought the husband's act was unlawful because it constituted cruelty and, as such, was a cause for judicial separation.  Arguably, therefore, intercourse constituting a matrimonial offence is &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; and capable of being rape if other conditions are satisfied.</P>
    <P>The illustration given by Deputy Keating is borne out as what might constitute rape if the other conditions are satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing law in relation to rape within marriage is to the effect that a husband cannot be convicted of rape on his wife except in exceptional circumstances.  The exceptional circumstances are outlined in cases in England where courts have held a husband liable. There are no Irish cases but it is likely that Irish courts would follow the line taken by English courts and accept that a husband can be liable to conviction in certain circumstances.  English cases which held the husband liable include cases where there was a separation agreement with a non-cohabitation clause, a <Col N="329" /> decree of judicial separation, a separation order of a magistrates' court containing a non-cohabitation clause, an injunction restraining the husband from molesting his wife or having sexual intercourse with her and an undertaking in lieu of an injunction by a husband not to molest his wife.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes contended that the law regards a wife as the property or chattel of her husband and that rape is a crime against property and that this is the reason why a husband cannot be convicted of rape.  That contention as to the reason why a husband cannot be convicted of rape cannot be maintained.  The reason usually advanced to justify the husband's immunity is that the wife on marriage gives a general consent to intercourse with her husband during marriage so that the husband during marriage can never be regarded as having intercourse without her consent.  That reasoning can be regarded as anomalous in present-day circumstances and the most acceptable reason for a husband's immunity is probably the undesirability of having the law intrude into intimate affairs of married people.  This is a very delicate area.  It is also argued that the criminal law already intervenes between husband and wife in that charges for assault can be brought and if a husband can be convicted of assaulting his wife it is illogical that he cannot be convicted of rape of his wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty here is that when an assault occurs there is likely to be evidence on which a charge can be based and which a court could consider.  There would be something more than the unsupported allegation of the complainant. In a charge of rape there would generally be no corroborative evidence. The case made for rape within marriage usually refers to a case where intercourse without the consent of the wife has been accompained by violence.  In such cases a charge of assault can be brought against the husband and he could be liable to very heavy penalties.  An assault causing grievous bodily harm carries a life sentence, the same as rape.  There would be little difficulty in obtaining evidence in that sort of case.  One of the essential <Col N="330" /> ingredients for the purposes of prosecution is the obtaining of certain proofs.  It is reasonable to suggest that to obtain proof of rape within marriage would be very difficult.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the exceptional circumstances in which a husband can be held liable for rape should be set out in legislation.  The problem here is that it would be very difficult to give a comprehensive list to cover all the situations that could arise.  In relation to what Deputy Browne said in relation to Sweden I understand that in the Scandinavian countries there is provision for the prosecution of rape within marriage.  We will look into this area and examine it closely to see what can be done in a situation where we have rape committed within marriage.  It is a very difficult area from the point of view of legal intrusions.  Also a prosecution could be brought for rape and it could be very difficult to prove.</P>
    <P>We must also take into consideration the likely effects of this type of provision on the family and on the children of a family.  We must be totally satified that the interests of the family are protected when we change the law.  A number of groups of people representing certain organisations discussed this aspect with me and I was satisfied that they agreed that this area would need to be thoroughly examined.  This Bill needs to be enacted urgently to provide certain protections and we will give it close scrutiny and will try to obtain all the expert advice possible to facilitate it.  To delay this important legislation is not in the best interests of anybody.  The Deputy has been shouting for some considerable time for this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he has now got it.  I am satisfied that the Deputy appreciates what is intended in the proposed Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the Bill any longer than necessary but there is no point in us accepting half measures.  I would like to believe the Minister's promises about considering at <Col N="331" /> length certain things that will happen, but the truth is that this will probably be the only legislation on this issue that we are likely to see in this decade.  The provisions in this Bill are anathema to certain principles that some of us hold dear.  The Minister rightly says that in Britain a husband can be guilty of rape if a <i>decree nisi</i> has been granted, or if an injunction has been granted to restrain him from molesting his wife, or if he has given an undertaking to the court that he will not molest his wife, or if there is a divorce. The point is that in all those cases <i>de facto</i> they are no long married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to establish that a judicial separation does not terminate a marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I said <i>de facto</i> they were no longer married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that in the cases quoted from Smith and Hogan by me these people were not married. They are married, but they are judicially separated.  In the same way an injunction does not dissolve a marriage.  An injunction obtained to prevent the molesting of a wife by a husband does not terminate a marriage.  There are situations where British courts have held that rape where consent is absent can be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling me that British justice and the British courts are applicable in Irish courts in relation to this offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any case here to test what I am saying.  On the presumption that such cases would arise, I would be of the opinion that Irish courts would decide them along the same lines as the British courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a qualification of a qualification.  It is very unfortunate that the only arguable assistance this Bill may be to married people is where some judicial pronouncement or other had been made on them already, where <i>de facto</i> they were no longer married, where they were separated by agreement or by a <Col N="332" /> judicial separation, or where there was a divorce.</P>
      <P>We want to try to keep married people together.  We want to enchance the prospects of the marriage being a happy one. There is no point in talking about people who are living miles apart, or cities apart, or aeons apart in may respects, and the husband kicks down the door and rapes his wife, and saying that in the British courts that person might be open to being charged with rape and arguably might be open to a charge of rape in the Irish courts.  That is not the type of Bill we should have before us.</P>
      <P>What about the majority of ordinary Irish married women who are entitled, in my view, to the same protection under the law as any other woman?  Under Article 40 of the Constitution and in the European Court of Human Rights, is that woman entitled to the same protection as any other woman?  This Bill says she is not and that because she is married her rights in law are less than the rights of other women.  I reject that.  It is wrong and it is barbaric.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that somehow the protections afforded to such a woman are adequate because there is the same potential to receive a life sentence for grievous bodily harm as for rape.  That is misleading.  The charge of grievous bodily harm is a specific charge relating to what it says, grievous bodily harm.  It might have nothing to do with any attempted act of sexual relations or sexual molestation.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to put forward that argument. Why should the woman have to scurry through the law books to get justice? None of us in this House would advance the view that a married woman taking her husband to court for rape is a panacea for all ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  That is absolutely unfair.  I am saying that if, in extreme circumstances, she honestly believes there is no other way, that is her entitlement.  I would hope that it would be the last resort if there was no other <Col N="333" /> remedy for the problems involved.  In the circumstances where it is not possible to take any other action.  I contend that there should be equality in the eyes of the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a point on several occasions about circumstances where there is no consent.  That assumption is implicit in everything we are saying.  If there is consent, there is no rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The presumption is that there is consent in marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  We are speaking about cases where there is no consent and where that can be proved. No argument arises if the woman cannot show there was no consent.  We are talking about cases where there is no consent and we are arguing strongly for equality in the eyes of the law.  The Minister quoted at great length legal and other practices in Britain.  There are increasing representations from people like the police advisory committee and the policy advisory committee on sexual offences in Britain for progress in relation to the rights of married women in this respect. Sooner or later, and probably later, we will follow the British example.  In this unfortunate country we merely echo outdated British legislation as we propose to do in relation to criminal conversation a decade after they threw it out in the North of Ireland and in Britain.  We will limp into line in due course.  Could we not do the right thing for once?</P>
      <P>How can anybody defend the introduction of a Bill which makes a distinction between the rights of women on the basis that one group are married and the other are not?  That is as logical and as Christian a view as to suggest that certain categories of offenders should not be able to be prosecuted because they are related to X, Y or Z, or that a boy of 17 should not be charged with mugging because the woman he mugged is his mother.  It is nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated my case as clearly as I can.  We have established the fact that for Irish women to date the reality is that married women are disadvantaged under <Col N="334" /> the law, that is the factual position.  This Bill proposes to retain the differential. None of us wants to see an increase in the numbers of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair for the Minister to suggest that Deputy Keating was misrepresenting the position.  We have to get this clear.  We are making the case that under this Bill the married woman is deprived of her constitutional rights as a member of our society.  This is an extraordinary Bill for the Minister to bring into this House after labouring so long on it. It is one of the famous nettles which has been grasped at last but, as so frequently, in a very unconvincing way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that rape is a very difficult subject.  It is difficult for the lady and for the man who may or may not be guilty.  There is the question of proof. That is accepted by all of us.  It is a subject full of pitfalls and dangers for the man and the woman.  At least the Minister has got to the stage of introducing this Bill. We are attempting to point out to him that there is a grave defect in it.  The <Col N="335" /> suggestion about establishing evidence is a very weak defence on the part of the Minister because we have already accepted that this will be established under the machinery of this Bill between a man and a woman, or a man and a man, or whoever it may be.</P>
    <P>As happens so frequently here, we are all men with the exception of the lady in front of me, Deputy Mrs. Desmond.  It is a pity that we are not 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women to discuss this and perhaps get a little more understanding about it.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, the three of us were discussing male homosexual rape, how could we ensure that every possible legal measure was provided so that we would be protected if that problem should ever arise?  I do not think we are here applying ourselves with sufficient dedication to an examination of this?  The Minister mentioned five or six different devices which he said would be considered in other countries in cases where rape had occured.  I have cited here a case of where a lady had gone to the trouble, as far as she is permitted within the laws of the country, to break away from a marriage &mdash; full of the aggression and sadness and so on associated with it &mdash; for very sound reasons.  But we give her only the very flimsy defence that we provide in the courts, and through various settlements and agreements for separation.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be sympathetic to certain solutions.  For instance, if we were to have divorce procedures he would be likely to agree that rape could be reasonably easily established.  I think the Minister accepts that in a case in which there has been judicial separation it would be possible to establish rape in our courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that what is happening in Britain is simply an indication of how British courts have been dealing with certain circumstances.  I have no intention of confusing that with the Deputy's anticipation of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of these cases because I have heard of them in both my <Col N="336" /> capacities.  I have heard of most dreadful ones, for instance of a man under a barring order who goes out and gets very drunk, who then feels himself humiliated by the separation, comes back, and what is worse &mdash; the Minister referred to this as a very important consideration &mdash; rapes the lady in front of her children, the idea being to humiliate her before the children.  I have heard of the most awful cases.  However, in those circumstances she has not got a defence.  It is a terrifying thought that these things can happen, but they have happened and it is to protect such women that we are attempting to legislate.  My case is that in this Bill we are not giving the lady any more protection than she had.  We should establish the principle in law that if a man comes back, batters down the door and has sex with this lady without her consent he is committing rape and she can take him to court.  Deputy Keating mentioned criminal assault but it is distressing to contemplate that a woman who has been beaten and so on can go to the Garda to get some kind of defence but they find it distasteful, like the rest of us, and on the whole they tend to avoid getting involved, if they can.  The result is that the lady is absolutely defenceless.</P>
      <P>Therefore, any kind of help we can give to her against this man coming in and imposing his will on her, despite the protection of a barring order, we should provide it in this Bill because I do not think we will get a Bill on this subject again within a decade, as Deputy Keating has said, even with the best will in the world of the Minister.  Though it is good that we have got this far, I suggest that the Minister should consider this small amendment to the Bill so that our law could carry the weight of a prohibition on unwanted sex by the unwanted husband whether sober or, more frequently, drunk.  With the best will in the world, there is precious little protection the Gardaí can give to such women except, possibly, that if the man does this and the lady takes an action against him for unwanted sex, for rape, he will have to pay the penalty we decide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Minister's <Col N="337" /> arguments can be heard quite frequently when people are dealing with a situation such as this: it is the reluctance of the State to interfere in family matters.  In principle that may be right, but we can take that reluctance a little too far.  Vulnerable members of a family, whether they be children or women, require a much greater degree of intervention.  In the Minister's remarks I detected a general failure to accept that a married woman is a rational being, capable of rational action on her own behalf, always mindful of the effect such action might have on other members of her family. The argument was advanced that we have to protect the children in this kind of situation.  I submit that the person most concerned about the children is the mother of the children.  The reality is that women, particulary Irish women, go to great lengths of self sacrifice to protect the interests of their children.</P>
      <P>Any protection to be provided against rape within marriage in this country would be used only in very exceptional cases.  We have heard of hardship cases but these would not be a reflection of the situation in the generality of marriages. However, we have to provide protection for extremely vulnerable people who are abused to a great extent.  The feeling that such protection might in some way interfere with somebody else in effect denies a civil right to a section of our people. We are very much afraid to open doors, even a little chink, because there is a general opinion that if we do we will release floodgates.  We should not fear that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated this evening, we realise that there is a need for protection against this type of violence.  We appreciate there are women who are subjected to very serious forms of sexual violence within marriage and for whom some protection must be provided.  All women, whether married or single, are entitled to equal protection within this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are anxious that this legislation be updated and we do not wish to delay it any further.  However, with the right commitment it should be possible to amend the legislation within the next few <Col N="338" /> weeks in order to take account of the view, which we share with the Minister, that protection is necessary.  Now is the time to legislate and to remove the discrimination in the Bill.  The Minister and Deputies on this side of the House are agreed on the need for this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to make the amendments that we have requested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state the justification in this Bill for treating married women in a different way?  Why should a marital contract impinge on the woman's rights?  It does not seem to do so in any other area of law.  Under the other existing statutes a married woman has the same rights to take action as has a single woman.  The only possible tenuous argument that might be advanced here is the matter of intimacy of marriage or sexual relations.  There is no difference in a question of property held in common, where the woman's rights are not different because of her marital status.</P>

      <P>I was trying to be helpful. I do not understand how we can justify this difference in law merely because the people concerned are married.  This Bill should deal with rape without reference to the status of people.  Any other crime does not relate to the relationships between people.  Under law a person's rights should not be circumscribed by relationships: some mythological or national obession with sexual <i>mores</i> should not constrict those rights.  It does not make any sense.  It is just another Irish answer to an Irish problem, the same as we had before in this House.  It <Col N="339" /> is not acceptable and, with Deputy Desmond and Deputy Browne, I appeal to the Minister to give the matter further thought in order to obtain some improvements.</P>

      <P>We asked questions that arose out of an enlightening reply the Minister gave about British law.  In this country we have very mild defences for women.  Would the Minister consider enshrining some defence for women in this Bill.  Divorce is the great protection for a woman who does not want to have sexual intercourse with a particular man for the rest of her life.  Under the divorce laws she is saved from that appalling humiliation.  But in the absence of divorce in this country there must be hundreds of thousands of ladies who have to go through this dreadful ordeal for the rest of their lives.  It appears to me that there is an even more compelling case in our society for introducing into this Bill some kind of defence for a woman against the rapist in the home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to list all the exceptions.  Deputy Browne may not have been present when I replied to Deputy Keating.  He cited the situation where a husband with venereal disease subjected his wife to sexual intercourse and where the consent of the wife was not forthcoming.  In that situation it is quite possible that if the law were tested in an Irish court it would hold that it was rape.</P>

      <P>I must make the point. I have a responsibility to state that that is the position as that point has not been made in the debate.  Deputy Desmond suggested there was a refusal on the part of the Government to legislate in this area by including marital rape in the Bill. That was unfair and inaccurate.  However, with regard to legislation that intrudes on family life, the Government and I must be satisfied that it does not in any way endanger the family, subject it to any fragmentation or endanger the interests of the children.  For that reason, with regard to any measure contemplated in this context or in any context that affects family law, we must be positively satisfied that it does not endanger the family.  I do not think the Opposition Deputies are taking serious cognisance of that very important feature of family legislation.</P>

    <P>In many instances complaints are made to the Garda about assaults on wives by husbands because of drunkeness or for any other reason, but in a matter of days it is frequently found that the couple have become reconciled.  Deputy Browne said that the Garda often tend to give advice to the victim not to proceed with the <Col N="341" /> prosecution.  The Garda are acting responsibly in that situation because their experience has been that family rows are often fixed up in a matter of days, whereas a prosecution or a direct intrusion by the Garda and the law could have resulted in much more serious consequences and made a mountain out of a molehill.  This matter should not be treated frivolously or lightly for political purposes in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>When my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Meaney, spoke to this motion last night, he was outlining the legislative framework which applied to the distribution of grocery goods.  Time did not, however, allow him to deal with more recent events in this area and the manner in which the existing legislative regime can be availed of to deal with developments.  It was acknowledged by the Opposition speakers that there was in existence a code of legislation but it was suggested that this was not working. I propose now to resume where my colleague was forced by pressure of time to stop last night and to demonstrate that the present regime has been successful and where because of various innovations and other developments the specific law is found to be wanting the overall framework provides the facility with which to tackle the problems arising.</P>
      <P>In early 1978 an alliance of wholesalers and independent retailers was formed.  In its early activities the alliance sought</P>
      <P>(a)  to compel manufacturers to take steps to end the sale of their products below cost by supermarket multiples, and</P>
      <P>(b)  to win a &ldquo;functional&rdquo; discount for wholesalers from manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> This alliance gave to its members a collective negotiating strength comparable with that of the multiples and in so doing brought about a significant change in the balance of bargaining power in the trade.</P>
    <P>As a result of conflicting pressures arising from the activities of the alliance one Irish supplier found itself faced with considerable difficulties and there appeared to be a possibility that other suppliers could be similarly effected.  At the request of the Minister, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices held discussions with representatives of the manufacturers and the alliance, which resulted in a suspension for three months of the action which had been taken.  Subsequently, at the Minister's request, the commission held informal discussions with representatives of all the interests in the trade.  In November 1978 the commission made to the Minister a non-statutory report in which they recommended that the grounds on which goods might be withheld from a retailer by a supplier should be altered from selling below wholesale price to selling below net invoice price plus VAT.  They also recommended that this provision, which since 1973 had not applied to foodstuffs, and the prohibition on below cost advertising, which had not applied to non-foods, should be extended so that each covered both foodstuffs and non-foodstuffs subject only to the exception of the foodstuffs specifically exempted.</P>
    <P>In their report to the Minister on the outcome of their informal discussions the commission also indicated that they had reached an understanding with the multiples that they would refrain from selling below cost for a number of months, while the alliance for their part agreed to continue their moratorium on further action for a similar period.  The commission expressed the hope that the intervening months would be used to seek a solution to the basic problem of terms and conditions. The Minister accepted generally the recommendations and gave effect to them in the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 1978.</P>
    <P>It was evident that great unease continued <Col N="344" /> to affect the relationships between suppliers, the multiples and the wholesalers and retailers.  Certain discussions took place at that time with parties involved and it became clear that the continuing unease was largely centred on the question of below cost selling.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism accordingly requested the Restrictive Practices Commission to hold an inquiry into the retail sale of grocery goods below cost.</P>
    <P>The commission's report of this inquiry has been submitted to the Minister and is the subject of most urgent attention. The Minister expects to be very shortly in a position to publish this report and to indicate the action to be taken on foot of the commission's recommendations.  In view of the proximity of these matters it is not the intention to indicate now the type of action which is to be taken, but I would consider it desirable to recall that the aim of policy must be to foster competition wherever possible.  This policy is clearly one which recognises &mdash; but not exclusively &mdash; the importance of the consumer interest and it has underlain all of our actions in this area down through the years.  These actions have seen the dismantling of a large range of restrictions which have been of great benefit not alone to the consumer but also, to varying degrees, to the manufacturer and distributor.</P>
    <P>It will be acknowledged from the foregoing that there is in existence the facility to deal with problems which exist in the supply and distribution of goods; a facility under which developments can be subjected to most exhaustive scrutiny, generally in public, and having regard to the special concerns of the various elements involved, as represented at inquiries, and to the interests of the common good, which allows of the making of recommendations to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism for remedial action where such is considered warranted. That this machinery is availed of adequately by the Minister requires little testament over and above the evidence provided in this sector by the frequency of interventions by the Minister both by <Col N="345" /> way of bringing the relevant statutory bodies into action and by way of legislative action.</P>
    <P>It will be acknowledged that this machinery is of little use if the legislation which flows from it is not strictly enforced.  To this end the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, created the position of Examiner of Restrictive Practices, who is charged with the responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, of monitoring the operation of orders made under the Act.  If in the exercise of this role the examiner carries out an investigation into the operation of a particular aspect of an order and expresses the opinion in his report of such investigation that there has been a breach of an order, he is required to furnish his report to the Minister, who is enabled by the Act to prosecute offences.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years the provision in grocery orders which has been of greatest concern has been that which prohibits the advertising of grocery goods for retail sale at a price which is below net invoice.  When the Bill to confirm the 1978 Order, which amended the provision relating to advertisements of grocery goods for sale below net invoice price, was being debated in this House, the Minister indicated that it was his intention to enforce the provision vigorously. In this regard the House will wish to note that to date the Minister has obtained convictions in seven cases and a further three cases, about which he has received reports from the examiner, are pending. In considering these figures one should bear in mind the fact that promotions involving the sale of items below cost are not generally maintained over a lengthy period and that, accordingly, the need to advertise in a manner which would be in breach of the 1978 Order does not always exist.</P>
    <P>Apart from the prosecuting function, the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, also provides for another sanction which can be availed of by the Minister or other interested persons.  This is a provision under which an injunction can be obtained from the High Court to ensure compliance by a person with the provisions of an order.  In so far as the groceries orders are concerned, this machinery has <Col N="346" /> been availed of on one occasion when an injunction restraining a person from advertising of goods for sale below net invoice price was obtained.  That case also had the additional benefit of confirming the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;net invoice price&rdquo; which was being used for the purposes of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy O'Toole last night to the 1973 Groceries Order when he accused my colleague that &ldquo;he avoided the crunch issue, which is article 8, section 2...&rdquo;.  The Deputy later stated this provision requires wholesalers and retailers to furnish details of grocery goods imported within 14 days and that this was: &ldquo;to ensure that they import reasonably and do not go beyond what is allowed.&rdquo;  Continuing, the Deputy implied that an effect of paragraph 2 of article 8 was, &ldquo;that there is no restriction on the volume or amount I import&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Great importance is being attached to this provision and I believe that this reflects a serious misunderstanding of the provision, the reasons for it and what can be achieved by it.  For this reason, I propose to deal with this matter in some detail in the hope that the position can be clarified in everyone's mind for once and for all.  As my colleague indicated last night, the 1973 Groceries Order was made following a full inquiry by the then Fair Trade Commission in 1971.</P>
    <P>The commission in their report did not make any recommendations in relation to imports.  However, before the 1973 order was made representations were made to the Minister that Irish suppliers would be adversely affected by the operation of the then proposed order because the various requirements proposed in relation to terms and conditions of supply would not apply to manufacturers outside the State sending goods into the country. In particular it was considered discriminatory against Irish suppliers that they should be required to lodge with the Examiner a statement of terms and conditions upon and subject to which they supplied goods while the same was not required in respect of imported goods.  It was subsequently decided that it would be desirable to provide as in article 8 as it would eliminate this discriminatory <Col N="347" /> aspect of the proposed order and the requirement to notify was, accordingly, included in the order.</P>
    <P>It is to be stressed that the requirement is that a statement containing the terms and conditions upon and subject to which goods imported were purchased should be lodged within 14 days.  Such a statement does not necessarily reveal the quantity of goods imported or, indeed, indicate clearly the specific item which is being or has been imported.  Furthermore, the provision does not allow of the exercise of any control over a person's freedom to import nor does it allow of the imposition of any quantitative restriction. It was never the intention that it should allow of such.  In this regard, I am sure Deputies are aware of our various international obligations which would not permit of the imposition of such restrictions.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to this requirement, I should like to remind the Deputies that the actual provision in the 1973 order which gave rise to the inclusion of article 8 was removed from that order by the Restrictive Practices Order, 1978.  The present legal position is, therefore, that Irish suppliers are required to lodge a statement of terms and conditions with the Examiner only when the Examiner requests them to do so but the person importing is still subject to the requirement of article 8.</P>
    <P>I trust that this explanation of the background to and meaning of this provision will serve to clear up any misconceptions that exist.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made last night to the level of concentration in the groceries sector being very high and it was suggested that this level was one which had not been attained in other European countries and, also, that the legislative regimes in other countries were such that increases in concentration would not be permitted.  I am sure Deputies will agree that we could embark upon exercises which would adequately support that view or disprove it.  I do not intend to embark on such an exercise but, nonetheless, the following pieces of information will I am sure be noted by Deputies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> The recent trend in the Federal Republic of Germany has been towards greater vertical and horizontal concentration in food distributions with the trade becoming increasingly oligopolistic as a result of mergers and take-overs.  A recent report on competition in that country, which was suggested last night as an example for us, shows that the three groups recording the largest turnover in food retailing hold a market share of 41.7 per cent the six largest firms 63.8 per cent and the ten largest 71.7 per cent.  Figures from the United Kingdom suggest that the seven largest retailers control over 50 per cent of the market, while the Danish trade is represented as being the most highly concentrated in the Community with only five groupings accounting for all sales of food.  Our own situation, where the multiples share is believed to be somewhat higher than 40 per cent, does not appear to compare badly.</P>
    <P>As regards tackling the alleged monopolistic situation in this country, I will be referring shortly to the Minister's powers under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, but in this regard it should be noted that a monopoly situation as defined in that Act does not exist here in that no one enterprise, or enterprises under common control, supplies 50 per cent of the services in this sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the legislative regime which operates at present in relation to competition, it is pertinent to refer to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  There are two aspects of this Act which are of relevance to the area under discussion.  The first of these is the role of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in relation to proposed take-overs.  Any proposed merger or take-over to which the Act applies must be notified to the Minister and, in general, his consent to the proposal must be received by the enterprises involved before they may proceed with the proposal.  When a proposal is notified the Minister, having examined the notification, may either decide to allow the proposal to proceed or may refer it for more detailed investigation by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  If a proposal is referred to the examiner, he must <Col N="349" /> report to the Minister whether in his opinion it would be likely to operate against the common good in relation to the criteria in the Act.  The Minister, having considered the examiner's report, may then decide either to allow the proposal to proceed or to prohibit it absolutely, or allow it to proceed subject to certain conditions.  The criteria to which I refer include such consideration as the extent to which the proposal would be likely to prevent or restrict competition or to restrain trade or the provision of any services: the extent to which the proposal would be likely to endanger the continuity of supplies, and the extent to which the proposal is in harmony with the policy of the Government relating to the rationalisation, in the interests of greater efficiency, of operations in the industry or business concerned.</P>
    <P>This Act therefore enables the Minister to exercise control over proposed mergers or take-overs and, when he considers that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, to prohibit a proposal. The last proposal arising in this area which was notified to the Minister was allowed to proceed only after most thorough examination, including an investigation by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  The House may be assured therefore that the controls which the Minister has available to him in this area will be speedily exercised and prohibitive action taken if circumstances so warrant.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of this Act is that part relating to monopolies.  The Act enables the Minister to request the Restrictive Practices Commission to carry out an inquiry to determine whether in the opinion of the commission a monopoly exists, and, if it does, whether it prevents or restricts competition, or endangers the continuity of supplies or is likely to do any of these things, and whether such interference or restraint of trade is or would be unfair or would operate against the common good. Having considered a report of such an inquiry by the commission, the Minister may, if he thinks the exigencies of the common good so warrant, prohibit the continuance of the monopoly except on conditions specified or require the division <Col N="350" /> of the monopoly by a sale of assets or as otherwise specified.  In this regard I can assure the House that the Minister will not hesitate to use the powers available to him, including the power to break up a monopoly, if such a situation is achieved.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the House will note that there is already in existence a code of legislation which is aimed at ensuring the existence of healthy competition with consequential benefits for those involved from the manufacturer to the consumer, the initiatives taken by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in relation to the groceries sector and his intention to publish very shortly the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on below-cost selling and to take appropriate action on the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by a number of speakers, the Labour Party motion before us tonight is a two-barrelled affair. It is noticeable from some of the Opposition contributions that the spokesmen on the other side of the House find it difficult to come to grips with the inherent conflict between the two parts of their motion.  Their contributions in relation to price control have been of a significantly low key nature.  That is not at all surprising, given that this House on a number of occasions in the recent past has clearly supported the Government's price control policies in debates on similar motions from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised repeatedly that price increases are the symptoms of inflation and not its causes.  The causes of inflation are in part external &mdash; for example, increases in import prices &mdash; and in part internal &mdash; for example, increases in money incomes.  The external causes lie beyond the control of any agency in this country.  All that is possible is action to limit their effects on the Irish price levels. The strength with which the internal causes operate can be influenced by the Government, employer and industry organisations and trade unions.</P>
    <P>Firms apply for price increases after they have incurred higher costs.  The job of price control is to consider each application and decide what price increase is <Col N="351" /> justified by the cost increases that the applicant has incurred, taking all relevant circumstances into account.  As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Meaney, said last night, if all applications for price increases were rejected while the external and domestic causes of inflation continued to operate, the consequence would be highly predictable.  If firms were not allowed to recoup the increased costs of imported materials from higher prices, redundancies would occur and in many cases supplies of imported goods or materials to the Irish market could cease.  If all applications based on increased wages and salaries were rejected, the result would again be redundancies and bankruptcies.  If price control were applied in this manner, it would indeed soon become irrelevant, because no products would be available at the controlled prices and the social costs inflicted on the community would soon become intolerable.  Price control cannot be operated without reference to the general objectives of both economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>Since price increases are granted under the price control system all price control authorities tend to be identified with price increases.  Attention is invariably focused on the price increases which are recommended because they are regarded as newsworthy.  We are invariably treated to lengthy statements of despair from Opposition spokesmen &mdash; statements which as a rule, totally side-step the relevant economic facts.  Attention is rarely directed towards that part of the price increases which is prevented from occurring due to the proper operation of the price control procedures.  Since the establishment of the National Prices Commission by Fianna Fáil in October 1971 until the end of December 1980, the commission have dealt with 5,237 applications for price increases.  Of these, 112 applications were refused totally.  There were two main reasons for these refusals &mdash; the cost increases that were claimed were not adequately supported by documentary evidence or were not significant when compared to the applicants' total costs or current profits.  Of the 5,237 applications <Col N="352" /> considered, 2,545, nearly 50 per cent were allowed in part only by the Commission. There were a number of reasons why these firms were not granted the full increases sought: the increases sought in materials and other costs were not supported by satisfactory documentary evidence or were not unavoidable, in which cases it would have been unreasonable to have expected the consumer to bear the expense; the firms sought price increases to cover increases in pay costs over and above the Government guidelines; or the applicants could reasonably have been expected to offset a part of the cost increases by improvements in efficiency.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the Government approach to the problems of rising costs and rising prices &mdash; strict control on price increases coupled with major social welfare improvements. It is undeniable that the increases which the Government have provided in health and welfare benefits since taking office in 1977 have been substantial, increases in some cases of up to 130 per cent.  This is the mechanism which the Government have used for the transfer of purchasing power <i>via</i> the Exchequer to those who are most in need.  This policy, together with the strict control of prices which my colleague and I have outlined is, I am sure, the policy which the House supports and I am confident that the House will accept the Government's amended motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is as important a motion as we have debated for many a day.  First of all, I would ask the Minister seriously to reconsider the situation in regard to food subsidies, especially those for bread, butter, milk, baby foods and essential items.  The Minister touched on the situation in regard to increases for the social welfare categories but there are other people as well.  There are workers in factories and industry throughout the country.  There are people engaged in lower paid employment and for the sake of those people and their families I urgently demand the restoration of food subsidies on essential food items.  It is imperative.  I am daily in touch with those people throughout the length <Col N="353" /> and breadth of my constituency and I know many families who are suffering hardships because of the increase in food prices, in electricity and in fuel.  I call upon the Government to restore the food subsidies in sufficient quantities.</P>
      <P>At present the Irish food industry has its back to the wall and is in extreme difficulty.  All sectors are facing problems. Food manufacturers are having to rationalise and lay off staff and many face a break future.  Farmers are having to dump their produce.  Independent grocers all over Ireland are closing their doors and consumers are paying exorbitant prices for foodstuffs.  We are now so heavily dependent on food imports that the Minister is becoming powerless to control the price of foodstuffs.  Sadly there is no evidence that the Government wish to exercise any control in this area. In fact this problem has been compounded by the Government's pre-occupation with the general election.  The inactivity of the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in the area of controlling price increases, his failure to protect independent retailers, his lack of interest in food manufacturing, has allowed control of the Irish food industry to fall into the hands of multinational foreign-based corporations. Already they are dominating the Irish food industry and food import figures now suggest that more than half of the food in this country is imported from outside the State.  Thus the great efforts of many Irishmen and Irishwomen for centuries to obtain independence for this part of Ireland have been dissipated. We are militarily dominated by Britain. Now we are in danger of being dominated economically.</P>

      <P>The food industry here is being silently taken over.  Twenty per cent of our population is engaged in agriculture-related employment which is now threatened by foreign markets.  Why are the Government so insensitive to the <Col N="354" /> problems of the food industry?  It is imperative for all of us that we understand that the food industry cannot be compared with, say, electronics or engineering or with high technology industry, all of which we all welcome but which cannot be compared with the food industry. Many of the industries coming in and getting Government aid intend to export but food imports are coming in and that is the real danger.  The Minister does not seem to be grasping this situation.  I am afraid that the Minister is sleeping on the job while our food industry is being undermined and taken over by outside interests.  There are three Ministers in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; Deputy Gallagher, Deputy Meaney and Deputy O'Malley.  I honestly believe that between the three Ministers they are going to have to sit up and take notice of this real, urgent problem. There is a major job to be done for the protection of the food industry here and those Ministers are the people charged with that responsibility.  It is imperative that they give the lead to the country in trying to take control of this urgent, important matter because it is important to every person in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister made a lot of play about the role of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in keeping price increases to a minimum. He centred his case mainly on the fact that the Minister had recently allowed only a 5p increase on the loaf when bakers were seeking increases between 9½p and 10p in the maximum retail prices.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in a 13 month period between December 1979 and January 1981 there was a whopping 51 per cent increase in the price of bread.  The maximum price of bread during that period has increased from 29p per loaf to 44p per loaf.  The Minister certainly does not deserve any accolades for keeping down the increase in the price of a loaf to 5p. If the Minister had done his job in ensuring that the provisions of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973 were being fairly implemented then there would not have been a need for this price increase.  Yes, the baker needed a price <Col N="355" /> rise but this was because many of these bakers are being forced to concede huge discounts to the five multiple giants, Dunnes Stores, Superquinn, H. Williams, Quinnsworth and Tesco.  The multiple supermarkets buy only 20 per cent of all the bread baked in this country. Yet the independent retailers who buy 80 per cent of the same bread have to pay 5p per loaf more for it.  Not alone is this unfair competition but it is illegal and contrary to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order of 1973.  I am informed that this has been brought to the attention of the Minister and the Examiner of Restrictive Practices but as far as I am aware nothing has been done about it.  If the Minister was concerned about keeping down prices he would take action to ensure that the huge supermarket chains would not squeeze out the unfortunate food manufacturers by obtaining large discounts which are thrown back on the independent retailers.  This situation pertains in relation to many other food categories &mdash; soups, canned vegetables and so on.  The Minister must act to limit the uncontrolled development of super stores.  Unless he does so the alarming rate at which food imports have increased in this country will continue to escalate.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of this House to the fact that food imports last year increased enormously.  Over the last few days, while I was preparing for this motion.  I got in touch with the Central Statistics Office.  One of the most alarming facts is that imports of meat and meat products have increased by nearly 100 per cent, from £12 million to £24 million in 1980.  The importation of dairy products has increased by over 60 per cent, from £15 million to £24 million.  Imports of fruit and vegetables have increased by over 34 per cent, from £74 million to £100 million.  It is essential that we sit up and take notice.  We are sleeping at present. It is sad to see us importing dairy products, meat, meat products, rashers and other bacon items into this country when to survive as a nation we have to export these items instead of importing them.</P>
    <P>In the past the smaller grocers and the people who have helped this country to <Col N="356" /> survive have had a long history of loyalty to the Irish nation and Irish suppliers. The multiple supermarket chains may not have the same loyalty, and this is not surprising.  A lot of these multi-nationals own foodmarkets outside Ireland, especially in the UK.  Quinnsworth have an interest in Twining's Tea, Associated British Foods and Anglia Canners whose products seem to get a lot of shelf space within the Quinnsworth stores.  I admit that some of the multiples support Irish-manufactured goods, but much of this support is at a price.  Irish food manufacturers no longer sell on economic terms to the multiples.  The supermarkets now demand to see the general manager of each of their suppliers and they tell the general managers that unless they can meet the demands of the multiples then their products are not wanted.  I am afraid that food imports into this country will continue to escalate unless action is taken, and Irish manufacturers will go to the wall as well, at least some of them. Already half of the Irish food manufacturing industry is controlled from outside Ireland.  This, added to our import figures, shows the precarious state of our food manufacturing industry and that the work of the Minister and the Government in this area has come to nothing.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the Minister with much heralding announced the setting up of a working party to consider measures to promote intensified import substitutions and greater purchases of Irish goods. Nothing has been heard of the working party since and the fruits of their work are not evident in the import figures.  I wonder if they have even met, and if they have what has become of their report?  I have not seen anything about it.  People in the independent grocery trade understandably are very sore at the lack of response from the Government, in particular from the Minister for Industry Commerce and Tourism, to their problems. The independent retailers and the grocery sector feel that the Minister is anxious to do them down.  I hope that this is not correct and that the Minister will prove this to the country and all of the people involved in the field of trade.</P>
    <P>At present 40,000 people are employed <Col N="357" /> in the retail grocery sector and they are all becoming increasingly impatient, and that is understandable.  I want it to go on the record of the House that since the last public inquiry in 1972 5,000 more independent grocers have gone out of business.  Five thousand family businesses are no longer in existence and approximately 20,000 jobs have been lost.  During the course of the report of the 1972 inquiry the commission concluded, and I quote from the report: &ldquo;A question frequently raised is the degree of foreign penetration in this field.  There are now two foreign owned multiple firms operating in this country and in 1970 they accounted for something over a quarter of total sales by multiples whose accounts we examined.  Existing Irish-owned multiples did not foresee any likelihood of takeovers by, or mergers with, foreign interests in the immediate future, but this cannot be ruled out nor can the establishment of new supermarkets by foreign interests&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fact that two multi-national chains now control close on 30 per cent of the Irish grocery market is a clear indication of how wrong the commission's conclusions were at that time, and there is a great danger that the findings of the public inquiry into below cost selling conducted 15 months ago may already be outdated.  Within the last 12 months a study into unfair competition by multiples was conducted in the Carlow-Newbridge area.  That study, which was conducted by the Geography Department of UCD, concluded that 40 retailers in the Carlow-Newbridge area were forced out of business through unfair competition and that approximately 69 jobs were lost in the area.  How many more jobs will be lost before the Minister will take action? In the last eight years 5,000 small businesses closed.  When will the Government act in regard to this?  Will they act when another 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 businesses close?  Are the independent grocers correct when they claim the Minister is presiding over their demise?  There is a great danger of this and I am concerned over it.</P>
    <P>The fact that below cost selling increases prices to the consumer is no <Col N="358" /> longer in contention.  It is admitted readily that below cost selling does increase prices to the consumer.  The food manufacturers themselves in their evidence at the public inquiry into below cost selling demonstrated this amply.  Therefore, who benefits from below cost selling? Certainly not the consumers, certainly not the manufacturers and positively not the independent retailers.</P>
    <P>The amendment as set down by the Minister shows an amazing and appalling lack of sensitivity to the current problems in the grocery trade and in the food industry and as a result three of the leading supermarket chains in recent weeks have gone unpunished for their unfair and most misleading advertising.  I would like to draw to the attention of the House the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs published on 17 December, and I quote from that report: &ldquo;An advertisement for Superquinn Ltd. contained an illustration of a wide range of products and the statement `from to-day Superquinn will dramatically cut these products' prices' &rdquo;.  In one Superquinn branch at least it appeared that there had not been any reduction on that day in the price of four of the products illustrated. I continue the quotation: &ldquo;The Director issued a formal request under section 9 (6) (c) of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 requiring the Company to exercise care to avoid giving a misleading indication of previous prices&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Outside the privilege of this House some time ago I said that in my view at present there have been a lot of misleading claims in regard to adver tising by some of these supermarket chains.  One supermarket chain stated that their prices will be lowest week after week.  Then they changed from &ldquo;lowest&rdquo; to &ldquo;low&rdquo;, which is a very important difference and this fundamentally affected the whole advertisement.  In a similar advertisement they said that there was a request by the group to let them know if any other prices were lower so that they could change their prices.  I might add that that attractive offer has not been repeated in recent weeks.  A further advertisement stated that there would be no price increases.  That was an extravagant and very blatant statement.  I have the original advertisement showing that, and I have since checked the prices in the intervening period of approximately six weeks and there have been increases.  It is unfair that such advertisements should be allowed.  They are very misleading.  A lot of newspapers have taken a courageous stand in printing the articles regarding this matter because &mdash; make no mistake about it &mdash; the big supermarket chains exercise a lot of muscle. They are huge advertisers.</P>
      <P>The public inquiry into below cost selling is so long overdue that it has become irrelevant.  The Minister should take immediate action to ban below-cost selling and he should also introduce measures similar to those introduced by our EEC neighbours and limit the development of some of these supermarket chains, thereby ensuring that the element of competition will continue in the retail grocery market.  The only way of ensuring healthy competition is by insisting that our marketplace is not dominated by outside interests.  The Minister should ensure and encourage the orderly growth of the retail trade.  He must also ensure fair and just trading terms for all parts of the county, which will benefit the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole matter has been discussed <Col N="360" /> at length.  The Government must wake up to the fact that it is a very important matter.  Many of our small business are in real difficulties at present and some have closed.  The manufacturers and distributors are also in difficulties.  In my constituency, Laois-Offaly, it saddens me to see huge trucks with trailers arriving and unloading tons of food which we are capable of producing.  This message must be brought home to the people.  If we take action in this everyone will back it. It will retain essential jobs which will benefit everybody.  It will also mean that the consumers, in the long run, will be better off.  We must not allow our agricultural industry, which is so important, to be hit by imports.  Our meat factories, vegetable processing plants and so on are also affected by food imports.  We must shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo; before it is too late.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition, Fianna Fáil called for the introduction of food subsidies.  The National Coalition Government of which I was a backbencher, listened to the speeches of members of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time.  We realised that food subsidies were essential and they were brought in. The Minister's about-turn in Government of partially dismantling food subsidies was a very great blunder.  Even at the eleventh hour the Government should restore food subsidies, because they will help to reduce inflation, which is seriously affecting employment prospects in all sections of the community, but particularly in the food industry. There is a most amazing graph which Members of the Government should look at.  It shows that the rate of inflation here was starting to fall, but when the Government dismantled food subsidies the graph levelled out and has been rising and rising until we reached 20.2 per cent inflation rate in one quarter.  This has had a serious and detrimental effect on all aspects of life.  I hope the Minister will consider the reintroduction of food subsidies. It would help every section of the community.  Subsidies should be on essential food items which are used by families, widows, old age pensioners and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to withdraw <Col N="361" /> their own amendment and to accept this motion, which is in the interest of the country which we all serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess this is a subject in which I have a pronounced interest.  It is not simply and solely because of the fact that the Restrictive Practices Order which is the subject of quite an amount of discussion in the debate was an order which I made in the beginning of 1973, shortly before we went out of office.  It is a subject on which I felt very strongly down the years and it was one of the very last functions in my capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1973 when I made this restrictive order because of my &mdash; I would nearly go so far as to say vested interest &mdash; in the welfare of the grocery retail business.  One of the things that struck me last night and tonight in relation to the whole discussion is the impression being created by the speakers on the far side of the House that this development over the last 12 months is something new.  I was rather surprised when I heard Deputy Barry Desmond speaking that he did not seem to be as aware as he might have been that this is a problem which has existed for a number of years.  It is a problem I had hoped to resolve in January, 1973.  It transpired that the action I took at that stage had, of necessity, to be amended on a number of occasions and we still have the problem with us.</P>
      <P>That is why I am surprised to hear Deputy Enright appealing to the Government to accept the motion in the name of the Labour Party.  I do not wish to say anything derogatory about motions in the name of the Labour Party or about the thinking behind such motions, but when one analyses the motion before us one realises that there is nothing in it.  Last weekend I received a letter from interested parties asking me to be present in the Dáil this week for this debate and to do everything possible to help.  It was not necessary for these people to write to me because I have at heart the well-being of the small trader.  I was one of that category of people in the past but I went out of business.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  Perhaps the situation arose from my giving so much of my attention to parliamentary duties and not enough to my little business. However, I was involved in that business for long enough to be aware of the problem faced by the small trader and to subscribe fully to the anxiety being expressed on their behalf.  I would not take from that expression of anxiety in any way but we must be realistic.  The reality of the situation was outlined by the Minister a short while ago when he indicated the situation that exists in a number of other EEC countries which Deputy Deasy seemed to overlook last evening when he talked about 50 per cent of our business being done through the leading supermarket chains.</P>
      <P>The Opposition are appealing to the Government to withdraw their amendment and to consider seriously the Labour Party motion.  We have been told that this is a two-tier motion but let us consider what it consists of.  In the first half, Labour are complaining about prices being too high while in the second part they complain that prices are too low.  Their big problem would seem to be in making up their minds as to which side they are on.  On that part of the motion which deals with prices being too low we find that there is expressed grave concern about the current price war between certain retailers in the grocery retailing trade and about the prospect of bankruptcies, take-overs and unemployment in the Irish retailing sector with the consequence of higher retail prices being imposed on the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls on Dáil Éireann to call on the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism to make an order to prevent the distortion of competition <Col N="363" /> under present practices and to prohibit the limitations on offers at retail level.  In effect the motion asks simply whether the Minister would endeavour to do something about the present situation and would set about drafting a restrictive practices order that will work.  I must confess that the order I drafted on those lines in 1973 has not been found workable.  Shortly afterwards there was a change of Government and I was replaced in the Department by a Labour Party Minister who in his wisdom later that year set out to copperfasten what I had endeavoured to do.  He found some small flaws in a section of the order and changed it so that it might be more operable and more effective.  He introduced the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Order, having endeavoured to close off any possible loopholes.  However, this falling off in the number of small grocers continued during the Coalition years and we have the growth of the supermarket business.  Apparently we did not notice until relatively recently how effective the operation was.  At that time we were being afflicted by what we might call the loss-leader disease whereby supermarkets were prepared to sell some items at a little less than cost price.  The order of 1973 had been aimed at overcoming that situation, a situation which we have today and which is known as below-cost selling. It is a problem that must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I would ask the members of the Labour Party who were genuine in tabling this motion to consider seriously the Government amendment.  This amendment does not seek in any way to take from the problem that is there and we accept that there is a problem.  As is indicated in the amendment, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism intends to publish very shortly the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on below-cost selling and to take appropriate action on their recommendations.  In other words, the Minister has taken the initiative in this regard.  As has been pointed out this evening by the Minister of State, the Minister has received this report.  I suggest that what we have had these past two <Col N="364" /> evenings from the Opposition on this subject is an indication of their awareness that the problem is a matter of serious concern to the Government.  Yet, the Opposition are asking us to rush our fences, to make a hurried decision, instead of analysing what is contained in the report referred to.</P>
    <P>I recall the report on which I based my order of 1973.  That was a more general report of the commissions in connection with trading whereas the present report deals specifically with below-cost selling. From the Government we have an amendment seeking the Dáil's approval for the initiative taken by the Minister in regard to the report and asking him to take the appropriate action on the commission's recommendations.  By way of follow-up to that, we have had two Minister of State at the Department giving us the assurance of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism that within the next month this report will be published and that the Minister will then take appropriate action.  I have not heard either of the two Ministers attempting to gloss over the fact that we have a problem here.  It is accepted that a problem exists. Seven years ago I made an order which despite the patching up done on it in the meantime is still not effective in finally achieving the purpose for which it was originally meant.  I ask promoters of the motion who say we should go ahead and do something about it to accept the amendment which in effect says the report on this matter comes out next month and we then propose to take the appropriate action arising from the recommendations in that report.  I do not think it is harmful to the trade that the movers of the motion are interested in and in which hopefully the Minister is interested to adopt that course.  Their interest will be best served by awaiting the report and not by appealing blindly to the Minister, so to speak, to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Learning from my own experience as a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, from the experience of the Labour Party of the activity of their Minister who said at the end of 1973, as I did at the beginning of that year, that he was <Col N="365" /> doing the right thing for the small grocers, there is much to be said for awaiting the collective views of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I know they are an over-worked group and we cannot be critical of the fact that they have taken time to produce this report.  They have made a full investigation and have given a considered judgement in their recommendations to the Minister which he is now looking at.  He will publish those recommendations within the next month and hopefully he will be in a position almost immediately after publication of the report to produce his proposals and the kind of changes he wishes to make in the restrictive practices order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to deal with a number of points as quickly as possible in replying to the debate.  On the question of food subsidies.  I want to correct the general impression being created by the Government side that for some peculiar ideological or egalitarian reason the Labour Party are totally preoccupied perpetually with food subsidies right across the board.  This is manifestly untrue.  What we find sticking in our craw &mdash; to use an Irish expression &mdash; is that Fianna Fáil have come into office on three separate occasions and each time they either totally abolished or partly dismantled food subsidies.  Bread is becoming a very difficult issue in terms of discounts and allowances at different levels, perhaps in the case of these three items in particular, bread, milk and butter there should be an element of subsidy because they are basic commodities on which, by and large, low income families, the elderly, the deprived and families with a large number of children spend a greater proportion of their income.  That is a basic truth evident from any of the household budget surveys and evident whether you are a trader or a family person catering for three, four, five or six children.  We are not in favour of universal subsidies which we can see as wasteful of resources but on a highly selective basis we favour their introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall first deal with low cost trading and my concluding comments will be on the general supermarket structure.  As <Col N="366" /> regards low cost or below cost trading the dangers inherent in the current outbreak of what I can only classify as retailing stupidity on the part of certain individuals, that outbreak is not in the national interest or in the interest of the retailers, the suppliers or the manufacturers.  Ultimately, it is not in the interest of the consumers who are workers.  There are 30,000 Irish workers directly engaged in the manufacturing sector for the domestic market and another 10,000 or 12,000 engaged in the export trade.  If you crucify the base of the Irish food industry in the domestic market your export trade is irrelevant.  You cannot engage exclusively in exports out of the food sector; you must have some ratio of domestic to export sales and on that basis it is selfevident that below cost trading is by and large economic suicide.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said last evening: the only people who would benefit from it are the large multinationals who have moved into Ireland most effectively, have spent a great deal of money and have free access into the Irish retail setup which is unique as Deputy Lalor knows from his experience in the European Parliament and as I know from my seven years' experience in the Economic Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe.  I meet many Social Democrat members and many members of Christian Democratic parties there and they tell me that the kind of sanctioning we have in Ireland, whether as take-overs by monopolies of domestic retail outlets or in the granting of planning permissions &mdash; and I speak to my counterparts; I am chairman of half-a-million people in Dublin lin County Council area &mdash; nowhere in Britain or on the Continent of Europe would planning permission be given to foreign outlets to move into areas which have a degree of catering in the retail structure.  They would not get that permission. I have had occasion to examine the policy guidelines of the Right Honourable Mr. Hazeldene in the British Minister of the Environment and neither there, nor in any one of the structural areas of the regions of, say, France and particularly Strasbourg with which Deputy Lalor would be familiar, would they <Col N="367" /> allow uncontrolled development affecting the retailing structure to develop as has happened here.  More particularly, I want to refer to the basic damage which can happen to the economic structure.  I am not what one might call a chauvinistic, schizophrenic Irish person who considers as a disaster everything foreign coming in.  There is a certain excessive element in the Irish make-up in that regard.  I welcome foreign industry into this country and a degree of imported products, even on the retailing side.  However, we the politicians have a fundamental obligation to maintain a balance.  In the national interest, we must intrude outselves, even if we get blood on our faces now and again, into the structure of both distribution and retailing.  I listened to Deputy Lalor with great interest and had discussions with Deputy Justin Keating when Minister in relation to this area and fully appreciate its complexity.</P>
    <P>I am not very much impressed by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  I have known, witnessed and seen the past three chairmen of that commission.  I took note of the speed, effectiveness and composite view which they showed in that area.  This is a personal criticism which may be resented by the gentlemen concerned. That commission has, on occasions, acted rather eccentrically in terms of its recommendations and with some degree of confusion.  We the politicians must give the time and devote all our energies to drafting orders to control people who are anxious for profit in their own personal interest, in many respects for short-term gain.  In the long run, the consumer, the worker, the manufacturer and the supplier are crucified as a result.</P>
    <P>I am extremely worried about the latest report of the Restrictive Practices Commission which has been on the Minister's desk now for, perhaps, two or three months, according to information elicited at Question Time.  I am rather worried, when a report is not published, in case it encourages the perpetual panacea of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, that since it is a serious, complex and difficult problem, the solution of which is likely to annoy <Col N="368" /> some people, let us do nothing about it. Let us see if the politicians will stop talking about it and if the pressure groups will fade away.  Let us do nothing about it.  There will be a general election in June, September or whenever it is going to be and we might do something after that because it will not be too unpopular to become involved.</P>
    <P>There is chaos developing in the price structure.  I hope the Minister will not come in here in three or four weeks' time saying &ldquo;There is the report.  It is rather vague, rather repetitive, going back over the old ground.  There are all sorts of complexities and we could face High Court actions and further contesting of grocery orders and ultimately even constitutional questions might be involved, so we are not going to do anything about it.  If RGDATA and the IADT stay quiet about it, I will stay quiet about it.&rdquo; With due respect to a Government with 15 Ministers, 15 Ministers of State and the highest number of advisers in the history of the State, they should certainly be able to grapple with this problem.</P>
    <P>We are not unique in Europe.  There is a body of evidence available.  Deputy Lalor well knows that in the meantime we are facing the kind of situation which Deputy Lalor and Deputy Kavanagh faced here and the other members of the European Parliament also faced.  He will be going down to Erin Foods, as he went recently, saying &ldquo;We are terribly sorry. The jobs are gone because the multinational firms setting up here are importing fruit and vegetables, selling them here and not giving a twopenny curse whether it concerns Erin Foods or apple growers from Dungarvan or anywhere else.  &ldquo;We must act in the national interest.</P>
    <P>We all look at programmes on RTE about Irish history and political and coercive domination.  What, in fact, is happening in the retail distributive sector here, slowly but surely, is total economic domination.  I am a moderate and believe in a mixed economy.  I believe in retailers, private, small, large in a proper mix.  I am not particularly ideological about it. There is a great need for the Minister to act in this regard.  I hope that in about six months' time, after the next election, <Col N="369" /> whoever is Minister, we will not have yet another commission set up, another publie hearing and meanwhile chaos.</P>
    <P>The push which is on in relation to this problem does deserve a positive and definite response from the Minister.  I have a personal regard for Deputy Gallagher who is extremely competent and sensitive in this area, who has met the representatives of these organisations and has a personal concern about uncontrolled development.  He will be able to get to grips with this situation and he might, perhaps, keep Deputy O'Malley out of it.  Deputy O'Malley has a bristling attitude towards representations in this area.</P>
    <P>There is chaos at present.  Some of the larger multinationals and the large Irish supermarket owners have been in contact with me kicking up hell over what I said yesterday and some are to see me tomorrow. I believe that they have a role to play but I do not want to see Williams and Superquinn of Ireland going out of business here, to be totally dominated by three main groups, all retailing outlets, by and large.  We need to have about 8,000 or 9,000 retailers spread throughout the country who must get a reasonable deal, some even in the context of the food subsidy motion which I have advocated. I believe in subsidies on bread but I do not want to see the subsidy going to major bakery concerns who give 28 or 30 per cent discount &mdash; as I have known them to give &mdash; off bread to large multinational supermarkets, while the ordinary grocer around the corner is very lucky if he gets 10 or 11 per cent.  That is unfair competition and a waste of food subsidies and sticks in my craw.  That is a situation with which the Minister must deal effectively, even if, in the process, some of our bakery concerns selling on a selective rebate basis may find themselves before the Department's officials, explaining very clearly the situation in the context of the use of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The motion of the Labour Party is one <Col N="370" /> of concern.  I reget that, due to the shortage of time, my colleague, Deputy Bermingham, who is a small shopkeeper, was not able to contribute to this debate. I can assure Deputy Gallagher that it is not just a selective concern.  This is a problem which has been discussed in the Parliamentary Labour Party on many occasions.  Deputy Justin Keating, when Minister, pointed out all the complexities of the problem.  Deputies Lalor and O'Malley and a bevy of staff at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism have experience of it.  There were some 17,000 or 18,000 independent &mdash; and the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; is perhaps a misnomer here &mdash; relatively small retailers here about 12 or 15 years ago. They are now down to 7,000 or 8,000.  I do not want to see that figure reduced to 3,000 or 4,000.</P>
    <P>Last year we imported, into an agricultural country, about £13 million of meat and meat preparations, £15 million of dairy produce, £11 million of fish and fish products and £77 million of cereal and cereal products.  I could go on.  We imported &mdash; which was a national scandal &mdash; £67 million of fruit and vegetables. The vast bulk of those food imports came in through wholesalers and retailers, with selective deals for the large outlets in the country, and Irish domestic growers, food factory owners and workers in these firms were pushed out.  We cannot have that situation.  Let us try to come to grips with the problems we have unfortunately developed due to lack of political action.</P>
    <P>I move this motion and recommend the Minister, particularly Deputy Gallagher, to take action in this area as a matter of urgency before it becomes not only a major political issue but before it becomes an issue affecting the livelihood of Irish workers.</P>

      <P>I have given permission to Deputy Deasy to raise the subject matter of Question No. 72 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 72 is as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to reports of large-scale dumping of vegetables by market gardeners in west Waterford and east Cork; if he is aware that the over-supply situation is being blamed on imports from other EEC member states and third countries; and the action he is taking to protect the small farmers concerned.</P>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; in one context and probably I could have used it in two.  It is dumping by third countries and fellow members of the EEC which is causing our market gardeners to dump their own produce for absolutely nothing. I am calling for immediate Government action to reduce the massive imports of fruit and vegetables from the EEC and third countries which are threatening the livelihood of hundreds of market gardeners on the south coast.  I referred in my question to west Waterford and east Cork but I could have referred to all of County Waterford, County Wexford, west Cork and Kerry as well.  This problem affects growers in all these areas.</P>
      <P>The import of produce from third countries should be stopped forthwith and produce from EEC states should be banned where it is proven that subsidies in contravention of EEC regulations are being applied.  Irish importers appear to be co-operating with foreign interests to squeeze out home producers and I am asking that the National Prices Commission investigate, as a matter of urgency, the marketing of fruit and vegetables in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged that our producers cannot sell onions to supermarkets and other retail outlets at 4p per pound, while imported onions are being sold for <Col N="374" /> between 25p and 30p per pound in the same outlets.  That is just one example relating to one variety of vegetable, but there are many different types involved. Producers in County Waterford have already dumped 200 tons of onions and ploughed back acres of cabbage and cauliflower in recent months.  During the past two years over 100 acres of orchards have been pulled up in the Dungarvan area alone, while apples to the value of £7.5 million were imported during the first ten months of 1980.  That information comes from a reply to a Dáil Question on 16 December last.</P>
    <P>Imports from Cyprus have ruined the early potato market and I am requesting the Government to ban or curtail such imports until the Irish crops have been marketed.  I should like the Minister to tell me whether Cyprus is in the Common Market.  We know that on 1 January this year Greece, or the Hellenic Republics, acceded to the EEC and I want to know whether Cyprus is included.  It appears that Cyprus has been partitioned and that one part of it is dominated or governed by Greeks and the other by Turks.  Turkey is certainly not a member of the EEC and has not applied for membership.  Are we importing produce from outside the EEC without any constraints whatsoever? The Cypriot potatoes have absolutely wiped out our own growers of early potatoes, specifically in my own area of Ballinacourty.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Allen, has experienced the same problem in south Wexford, as has Deputy Corish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <P>We are importing carrots from Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  According to the Taoiseach in reply to a Dáil Question on 16 December last we imported processed foodstuffs to the value of £230 million and unprocessed to the value of £96 million in the first 10 months of 1980, a total well in excess of £300 million worth of foodstuffs mainly consisting of produce which could be produced at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take action. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people <Col N="375" /> are involved.  I am specifically concerned about areas in my own constituency such as Ballinacourty and Ardmore where onions, carrots and cabbage are grown. People there have been left with vast quantities of produce during the past six months.  The problem has been building up steadily over the years and has really come to the boil during the past few months when they have found it impossible to sell their produce.  The Government and the National Prices Commission have a duty to see that the marketing system set up here is put into proper hands and under proper control.  There is a strong suspicion that consortiums, including the major supermarkets and large retail outlets, are hogging the market and discriminating against Irish produce because they are guaranteed not alone the type of produce I refer to but other types of vegetables and fruit we do not grow here.  There is some link-up.</P>
    <P>How could Irish onions be refused at 4p per lb when the same produce is being sold for 25p to 35p per lb?  The Minister should check those prices.  Obviously, there is some underhand work going on and it is time the Government and the NPC investigated it.  If there are rings involved, they should be smashed.  We all know that such produce can come here very cheaply because the people concerned have an advantage over us as a result of their better climate while we have to endure harsh winters.  Half of the potato crop may be lost if we get frost in May and a gale in the middle of the summer could result in a severe loss in the apple crop.  Last summer our onion crop was badly affected by the dreadful weather.  Continental producers have an advantage with their climate and they can flood the country with their produce because their transport costs are very little. The refrigerated lorries which transport meat to the Continent from here are used to bring back fruit at cheap rates. Apples are a prime example.  We are reputed to have a good climate for growing apples but in the ten months from January to October last year we imported £7½ million worth of apples.  The value of apples produced at home was only £1½ <Col N="376" /> million.  At home we only produced one-sixth of the apples sold on our markets although we are supposed to be able to produce the most delicious apples of all.  It so happens that the French Government are illegally operating a number of subsidies including the illegal advertising here on TV of French apples.  I have been informed that the French Government are paying the cost of such advertising.</P>
    <P>Many other subsidies which are illegal under EEC rules are being applied.  For instance, French producers get abnormally low interest rate loans which put the Irish competitor at an unfair advantage. Transport subsidies are also paid even though they are out of order.  Those with greenhouses to produce tomatoes and so on are given a heating subsidy and those heating subsidies are in direct contravention of the EEC rules.  They should be eliminated so that our producers can get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>It has been said by importers and those involved in large retail outlets that the quality of the Irish produce is not as good as the imported goods.  In certain cases there may be some truth in that statement because there is a slap-happy haphazard way of marketing our produce.  We must bring our marketing and grading methods up to standard.  Why should the 95 per cent of genuine growers suffer because of laxity on the part of the other 5 per cent.? It is the duty of the Departments of Agriculture and Industry, Commerce and Tourism to ensure that growers are registered and licensed.  They must ensure that the produce is kept up to standard by regular inspections. Obviously, that job is not being done and it is giving the supermarkets and other large retail outlets an excuse to make a killing.  That killing is being made at the expense of the market gardeners and small farmers in west Waterford and east Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not an overall supply of vegetables on our markets at present and quality produce has been making good prices in recent months.  There have been, however, local <Col N="377" /> problems due to changes in the marketing patterns and in some instances the poor keeping quality attributable to weather conditions in the 1980 growing season.  In relation to imports of seed potatoes there is no doubt that the imports from Cyprus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of early potatoes from Cyprus last year had a depressing effect on the market.  The Minister proposes to make an order under the Agricultural Products (Regulation of Import) Act, 1938, to control those imports.  That should have the effect of controlling them.  In the context of the general import of potatoes, which last year totalled almost £4 million, some of which were imports of frozen chips &mdash; the establishment of the plant in Donegal should have the effect of eliminating that &mdash; it is true that they sold on the market some times at two-and-a-half times the price of the Irish produce.  That was because of the manner in which they were graded, presented, packaged and purchased by Irish housewives in preference to Irish produce.  I should like to put on record that our traditional varieties are the best in the world but they need to be properly graded and presented on the home market in an aggressive manner. We should not have any fear of imports from outside if we properly grade and present our own produce.  In so far as imports have been a problem, I believe that will be eliminated this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not imported any cabbage. There is a misconception about that vegetable perhaps because of a variety which is known as Dutch cabbage but that is grown here in substantial quantities.  It is because of its name that there is an impression that we import it, but we do not import any cabbage from outside.  We produce about one-third of our total apple requirement, about 12,000 tons. The domestic requirement is about 40,000 tons.  It has become a specialised growing method and the marketing has become very organised.  The horticultural <Col N="378" /> group in my Department have assigned to it in recent times the task of specifically looking into this question of marketing and the growing of apples here.  In spite of some claims to the contrary we do not have the climatic conditions annually to produce top quality apples.  Consideration is being given to altering the traditional varieties, increasing the yields and eliminating the percentage of small type of apple we seem to produce in abundance but which are difficult to dispose of.</P>
    <P>There are two major producer groups here, the Paradise group of Waterford and south Kilkenny and the Green Aces of Dundalk.  Obviously, the road forward is to have improved marketing, more research and production on a continuing basis.  We must market our produce as aggressively as possible.  In the final analysis we are not able to meet the demand on the domestic market and we require imports because of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The research of the Department is first class and it is carried out at Ballygagin Institute in Dungarvan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We produce approximately 10,000 tons of onions which is a little more that half of our total requirement. Because of the problems that have risen due to the lack of storage facilities and the change in the marketing situation &mdash; van drivers used travel around in the autumn to collect supplies for sale to retailers &mdash; it appears the situation has changed.  It is essential that that is taken into account.  I recognise the difficulties many producers are going through and I am anxious to do everything possible to eliminate this.  In the final analysis a lot of this organisation will have to fall back on the producer who must avail of the services of ACOT.  Producers must programme themselves into a tighter organised group producing top quality goods on a continuing basis.  They must eliminate the problems that have arisen up to now.  The Department will give them all possible assistance towards the introduction of a better organisation.</P>

As the person concerned is receiving <Col N="243" /> unemployment benefit at a rate in excess of his previous earnings, pay-related benefit is not payable in his case.</P>

Fitzpatrick</b><i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Social Welfare why there is a different method for assessing capital for the purpose of calculating widow's pension in order to determine the means of the applicant as against the method employed for non-contributory old age pension; and if he will outline the method used in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of non-contributory widow's pension the yearly value of capital is calculated by excluding the first £200.00 and a further £100.00 for each qualified child and taking 5 per cent of the balance.  In the case of non-contributory old age pension, the first £200.00 is also excluded, the next £375.00 is calculated at 5 per cent and any balance at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The method of assessing capital for widow's pension as compared with old age pension is designed to take account of the fact that as widows generally are younger than old age pensioners the annuity value of a given amount of capital will be lower in their case.  It also takes account of the special needs of widows with children.  Furthermore widows cannot benefit from the moiety system whereby the means of an old age pensioner are divided between himself and his wife for assessment purposes.</P>

      <P>He appealed against this decision and after an oral hearing of his case at which the question of his suitability for the particular job was adverted to an appeals officer upheld the disallowance in his case.</P>

      <P>I have received outline proposals from Kildare County Council for a new road which provides for the section of a by-pass of Leixlip within its administrative area.  Due to the location of the Dublin/Kildare county boundary a new road providing for a by-pass of Leixlip requires co-ordinated planning by the county councils.  I have received outline proposals from Dublin County Council for a by-pass of Lucan.  The outline proposals of the councils are being examined in my Department and it is intended to arrange for joint discussions with the officers of the councils to secure co-ordination of planning.</P>

      <P>Most of the buildings which are occupied by the staff of my Department or by the Garda Síochána are the responsibility of the Commissioner of Public Works and, with the exception of fire drill, the matters <Col N="263" /> referred to in the question are the responsibility of that office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of fire drill, I am satisfied that there would be a disproportionate expenditure of public time and money in compiling the information sought by the Deputy and I do not think that this would be justified.</P>
      <P>As regards the prisons and places of detention, there are special considerations. The closed prisons are constructed in such a way and with such materials as to make it highly unlikely that a fire could spread in them.  Special care is taken in constructing new places and renovating old ones to select materials for them which are non-flammable.  It is obvioulsy not feasible to have in a prison the sort of exit facilities that would be appropriate in a normal building.  However, in terms of fire precautions this is offset to a large extent by the non-flammable nature of the buildings themselves and the fact that there is round-the-clock supervision by staff.</P>
      <P>Fires may, of course, be started by people in prison deliberately&mdash;for example, during disturbances or riots&mdash;and there are procedures to deal with such situations.  The &ldquo;open&rdquo; institutions in this respect are comparable to places such as hostels and boarding schools and precautions are taken to secure them against fire hazards.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works advise the Department in relation to fire precautions in the prisons and places of detention and there is frequent consultation with that office in the matter.  Occasionally local authority chief fire officers are invited to inspect buildings and offer advice as to the precautions that should be taken.  This was done, for example, in relation to the complex of buildings at Loughan House, and the advice of the chief fire officer was taken and implemented in that case.  Reports of fire inspections, whether by the Office of Public Works or local authority chief fire officers, are not published.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on fire protection and prevention in the prisons area falls under two headings:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) Equipment, facilities, materials <Col N="264" /> etc. provided in conjunction with long term development works.  These works included, for example, new fire mains and special fire pumps at Mountjoy, St. Patricks, the Training Unit, Arbour Hill; Cork, Loughan House and Shanganagh Castle.  It is not feasible to give separate estimates of such expenditure because they form part of and are inseparable from larger contractual works.</P>
    <P>(ii) Equipment provided in normal course to augment fire-fighting potential. Expenditure is readily available only for the past five years and it was as follows: 1976, £3,333; 1977, £330; 1978, £7,042; 1979, £23,603; 1980, £29,935.</P>
    <P>Regular fire drills are carried out in all places to the extent that this is feasible, having regard to the nature of the place. It would not be feasible, for example, to arrange for complete evacuation of a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; prison.  Training courses in fire prevention and fire fighting are arranged for key personnel from time to time.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to extract from the amounts spent on maintenance and new works at State buildings the sums spent on fire protection and prevention.  Apart altogether from works designed solely to improve fire safety, many maintenance and improvement schemes incorporate, as an integral part, an element of improvement of the fire protection and prevention aspects of the buildings.</P>
      <P>The general obligation to ensure the safety of staff in State premises is formally entrusted to the occupying Department or Office.  Repeated detailed instructions have been issued to all Departments and Offices as to how this responsibility should be discharged.  The instructions, which prescribe a daily check on premises, require, <i>inter alia</i>, the carrying out of periodic evacuation drills and the regular review of evacuation procedures. I am having a review carried out to ensure that these instructions are being complied with in the many buildings for which my Department are responsible.</P>
      <P>All buildings erected by the Office of Public Works are designed to a high standard of fire prevention and protection. These standards are borne in mind also when accommodation is rented.</P>
      <P>All buildings for which the Office of Public Works are responsible have been inspected by appropriate professional and technical staff at varying intervals during the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to express full satisfaction with all aspects of fire precautions at all State buildings at all times, nor would I be prepared to agree with or promote the complacency which such a statement might suggest.  In the area of fire safety, perhaps above all others, vigilance and the encouragement of an awareness on the part of all of the necessity of achieving and maintaining the highest standards is a constant task.  It is of reassurance, nevertheless, to note that, insofar as can be determined, no outbreak of fire at State premises has caused serious injury, much less loss of life.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that, as heretofore, in all instances, including those where other considerations <Col N="267" /> such as security or economy might obtrude, the safety of staff and of members of the public will continue to remain the paramount and decisive factor.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works are responsible for the construction and maintenance of Post Office premises including the provision of fire protection measures in accordance with existing legislation and bye-laws in such premises. Office of Public Works personnel inspect Post Office premises from time to time. Expenditure on fire protection and prevention is part of building and maintenance costs and a separate record of such expenditure is not kept.</P>
      <P>Guidelines regarding fire precautions, including practice fire drills, have been issued.  Implementation of the arrangements is normally the responsibility of the person in charge of the particular building concerned but in the case of some large buildings particular officers have been given special responsibility for fire security including fire drills.  No central record is kept of the fire drills carried out in the numerous Post Office buildings throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Urgent review of fire precautions in my Department is being made to ensure the existing arrangements are adequate and that the instructions on this matter are being observed.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister for Finance is replying in regard to expenditure, inspection and reports on fire protection and prevention in all Government buildings which are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, including a number of buildings occupied by members of my staff.  Evacuation procedures have been operational in respect of the larger buildings for some time and have been activated on a number of occasions during the past year following bomb scares and were found to be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There are a number of small meteorological and radio stations around the country occupied by staff of my Department on a round-the-clock basis.  The numbers on duty at any given time are so small as to render a formal evacuation procedure unnecessary.</P>
      <P>A number of staff occupy buildings at the three State airports, Ballygirreen Radio Station, Urlanmore and Mount Gabriel Secondary Surveillance Radar Station.  Responsibility for fire prevention and protection at these buildings rests with Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>(a)  Fire inspections are carried out on all Aer Rianta buildings at least twice annually.  In addition to this airport policemen are also firemen and when on patrol carry out fire prevention inspections as part of their duties.</P>
      <P>(b)  Fire safety committees are at present being set up at all three airports and staff bodies have been invited to nominate representatives.  When these committees are fully operational they will have authority to ask for a fire inspection in any area.  Copies of the subsequent reports will be available to staff if requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Bomb evacuation drills have been carried out at all three airports but these have been kept to a minimum <Col N="274" /> in order to avoid disruption of essential services.</P>
    <P>With regard to State-sponsored bodies, fire prevention and protection are matters of day-to-day administration in which my Department do not intervene. These bodies are, however, responsible to the fire officers of the local authorities in the areas where their offices are located.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that every effort is being made to ensure the safety and protection against fire of not only staff but members of the public visiting buildings under the aegis of my Department and to ensure the safe and speedy evacuation of all such premises in the event of an emergency. The arrangements are, however, subject to review so as to identify any necessary and practicable improvements that may emerge in the light of experience.</P>

      <P>In relation to semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department, the questions raised are a matter for these bodies.  In so far as my own Department are concerned, the position is that, except in relation to fire drill, the matters referred to by the Deputy are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works. Fire drills have been carried out recently in some of the Departments premises but <Col N="275" /> not in all.  This position is being reviewed to ensure drills are carried out in all offices on a regular basis.</P>
