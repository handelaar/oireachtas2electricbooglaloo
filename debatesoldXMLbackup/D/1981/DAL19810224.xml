      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. J. Ryan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will indicate the financial effect as a result of the increase in the car registration fee from £10 to £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the increase in the car registration fee from £10 to £20 will yield <Col N="2" /> extra revenue of £6 million in 1981 and £7.75 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the car registration fee has been increased to £20, which was not the case in 1978, and that the county council road allocation for county roads has been increased by only 5 per cent while costs have increased by 32 per cent, would the Minister not agree that money taken from the motorists, to the tune of £6 million, should be reallocated by the Minister for the Environment to bring the roads up to a standard which will <Col N="3" /> ensure that our motorists will benefit from better roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to be a different question which should be put to the Minister for the Environment.  However, if the Deputy looks at the allocations for road works this year he will see that there has been a substantial increase over last year's allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information and as a member of a local authority with full knowledge of what has been granted for national primary roads&mdash;I appreciate the increase in that area&mdash;it is well known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that the county road allocation is almost the same as that granted in 1979 and although the grants for national primary roads have been increased, the grants for the roads used mostly by the people who have to pay this road tax have not been increased? That is my information as a county councillor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the revenue from the fees will be approximately seven times the cost of the administration of motor registration? Would he agree that the fee should be renamed &ldquo;motor tax&rdquo;?  It takes only £2 million to administer this scheme and the Minister is taking in £14 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that to the extent that he is taking in seven times as much as it costs to administer this registration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, from the Government's point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are looking for information and I will give it to them.  If the old tax had been implemented the figure collected would be at least £60 million.  This means there is a substantial saving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to reports (details supplied) that the Central Bank are considering changes in the <Col N="5" /> coinage in consequence of changes apparently being planned in Britain; the connection, if any, he sees between British exigencies and ours in this area; and if he will request the Central Bank, in consultation with the Arts Council, to consider a complete review of the present coinage in point of design, denomination and material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the press reports mentioned by the Deputy.  The announcement by the UK authorities of their decision to introduce 20p and £1 coins does not affect the position here. Any decisions on changes in our coinage will be taken in the light of our own circumstances and requirements.  As the Minister's predecessor indicated in reply to a written question in this House on 27 May 1980, there are no immediate plans for a redesign of the coinage but the matter is kept under review in my Department and the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that the reports, the details of which I supplied him with, are false and that the Central Bank never floated the idea of recasting our coinage in line with British coinage changes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I made inquiries from the Central Bank and they assured me that they were incorrectly quoted in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What did they say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank indicated that the Department of Finance, in consultation with the bank, were reviewing changes in the coinage and in this context would naturally look at any changes which the UK might be contemplating.  I can assure the Deputy that the position is as I have given in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is natural about it? Why would we naturally review the coinage patterns here in consonance with what happens in Britain?  What connection is there between the two currencies since we joined the EMS?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Development Committee, who report to me, prepared a report in 1977 containing proposals in regard to the inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast.  The report, which formed the basis of a Government decision on measures to improve life generally on these islands, was prepared for internal use and is not in a form suitable for publication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason a refund of income tax due to a person (details supplied) in County Meath, which has been raised with the relevant PAYE office on numerous occasions, has not yet been attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in making the repayment was caused by difficulties in establishing the taxpayer's income for the year 1979-80.  The taxpayer held two different employments in the course of the <Col N="9" /> year and was self-employed for part of that year.  The inspector of taxes asked the taxpayer to submit details of his earnings for the year but he failed to supply the necessary figures.  Eventually, the figures became available to the inspector on 16 January 1981 and the taxpayer's liability for the years 1978-79 and 1979-80 was then reviewed.  Particulars of the review were sent to the taxpayer on 3 February 1981 and a cheque in settlement of the refund due to him has now been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is ridiculous that a taxpayer should be asked on numerous occasions to produce the same documents?  Is it not also ridiculous that the mere fact that he was employed by two different employers and was for a short period self-employed should be given as a reason for holding up the substantial sums due to him for a considerable time?  This is a man who has a very low income.  Would the Minister try to arrange that the income tax authorities have sufficient staff to deal with such matters?  Obviously this is the reason these cases are not being dealt with in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

The footnote to the same table shows that £0.7 million is being made available to State bodies for re-financing purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to estimate the total number of jobs created during 1980 nor to estimate the level of gross job loss which occurred during the year.  The latest estimates for total employment published by the Central Statistics Office relate to April 1980 and show that in the year to that date total employment increased by 18,000.  Indicators relating to the subsequent period show that there has been a fall in the numbers employed in the manufacturing industry and building and construction sectors but this is expected to have been offset by a continuation of the rise in the numbers engaged in the services sector, so that on average during 1980 there was little or no change in the 1979 level of employment.  At this stage, it is not possible to estimate the net employment situation at the end of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour force increase is a major factor in reconciling the steep rise in unemployment with a continued high level of job creation.  The job figures in the second national understanding were based on the assumption of a labour force increase of 5,000 to 10,000.  It is now estimated by the Central Statistics Office that in the year to April 1980 the labour <Col N="13" /> force increased by 18,000 following an average annual increase of 23,500 in the previous two years.  This suggests that the labour force assumption in the second national understanding understated the trend.  Estimates are not available for the increase in the labour force in the period since last April.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the second national understanding commits the Government to undertake new measures to stimulate job creation and reduce job losses.  So far, the Government have taken every measure possible to meet this commitment.  In particular, I would draw attention to the £97 million package announced upon agreement of the terms of the second national understanding and to the expenditure on direct job creation schemes in 1980 which amounted to over £20 million.</P>
    <P>It would be misleading to regard these expenditures as representing the Government's only contributions to job creation. The Public Capital Programme plays a significant role in employment maintenance and creation.  Expenditure by bodies such as the IDA, SFADCo and Udarás na Gaeltachta on industrial promotion in 1980 amounted to £187 million. The total expenditure on the programme was £1,270 million of which £815 million affected the building industry and had a significant influence on employment in that sector.</P>
    <P>The employment objectives of the second national understanding will be greatly supported by the implementation of the Investment Plan 1981.  Apart from its indirect impact on employment generally, the plan will result in higher direct employment of about 10,000 mainly in building and construction, telecommunications and energy.  This extra employment will be additional to the jobs arising directly in manufacturing industry and indirectly in the services sector as a result of investment by the industrial promotion agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to absorb all the figures, but would the Minister not agree that the most recent figure of 11 per cent unemployed, the highest in the European Community, demonstrates <Col N="14" /> without doubt that the Haughey administration's job creation programme has been a disastrous failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree. These European Community figures show our unemployment rate at 11 per cent.  However, broadly speaking, the EEC calculate the employment rate by taking the equivalent of the live register from country to country as the percentage of the civilian labour force, that is excluding Defence Forces.  As legislation and administrative practices differ from one Member state to the other the EEC employment figures should only be used for analysis of trends as they are not suitable for a comparison of absolute levels of employment.</P>

      <P>On this basis Ireland are not at the top of the unemployment list.

      <P>I will repeat it.  I understand from the Minister's reply that the reason why it was not legitimate to put us at the head of the EEC unemployment tables was because our statistical system tended to understate the problem rather than the other way round.  The Minister agreed with that.  I then asked how could the Minister reconcile that with the argument which his party went to the country on four years ago, namely, that the unemployment figures understated the problem and there were actually 50,000 more people unemployed than the registered figures suggested.  Could I have an answer to that?</P>

      <P>This is a matter of great national importance.  How is it that in October last year the Government committed themselves to a net increase of 7,000 in employment which allowed for job creation and job losses and allowed for a net increase of between 5,000 and 10,000 in the work force and that those figures are so wrong?

      <P>There was an underestimation of the labour force by the Government in October or September and, <Col N="18" /> instead of the figure of 5,000 to 10,000, the figure has been proved by the Central Statistic Office to have been well over 18,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated Exchequer receipt of income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism in 1980 was £875 million.  This figure covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies and also tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It represents an increase of £228.5 million over the amount collected in 1979.  For purposes of comparison with 1979, it should be noted that the Post Office dispute delayed the collection of an estimated £10 million in 1979 which should have been collected through the PAYE mechanism but was not collected until 1980.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that dramatic difference between the other two, would the Minister not agree that the PAYE group have a very serious grievance in so far as they appear to be paying for all the other groups in the country?  Is it the accepted policy of the Government that they should be exploited in this way because they pay their dues and other are not willing to do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, all of us in the House come under the PAYE system.  I do not accept that there is exploitation as the Deputy has suggested.  The Commission on Taxation are looking into quite a number of matters. The very big increase, which was approximately 35 per cent, was due to a substantial increase in wages and salaries in 1980.  The yield would have been £120 million higher in the absence of the major income tax concessions in the 1980 budget.  It is estimated that these concessions <Col N="22" /> will cost a further £90 million in 1981 on the basis of a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the availability to industry of low-cost leasing of plant and machinery from the associated banks, as well as other financial institutions, results in a reduction in the amount of current revenue payable by those institutions to the Exchequer.  This is because of the passing on to the banks and other institutions of accelerated tax capital allowances.</P>
      <P>These institutions play an important role in providing for the requirements of Irish industry.  Accordingly, in considering the question of the effect of low-cost financing arrangements on the tax yield from financial institutions, account needs to be taken of the benefits accruing to industry from those arrangements.  The Commission on Taxation have been asked as a matter of urgency to examine this and I await their considered views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no precise estimates available of the revenue loss as a consequence of leasing arrangements between businesses and the banks generally. <Col N="24" />  The amount of revenue in question is estimated in broad terms to be of the order of £40 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first to accept the Minister's assurance that it is a job creation device.  Is it not a fact that this is a tax evasion loophole through which the banks' profits are greatly increased?  Is it not imperative, even if only in fairness to the unfortunate PAYE people, that this loophole should be closed?  Would the Minister not agree?</P>

Will the Minister say whether, for instance, it has increased the amounts to be paid in repayments of foreign debts to Britain? Presumably there would be a 25 per cent surcharge in relation to Britain and about 20 per cent to 25 per cent in relation to other currencies because of the break of the link with sterling and the consequent devaluation of our currency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <P>The 1980 post-budget estimate of income tax receipts from the self-employed, including farmers, for the year ended 31 December 1980 was £179 million.

    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> The net actual receipt of this tax was £132.6 million.  This represents a decrease of £46.4 million, or 25.9 per cent, compared with the post-budget estimate.  The shortfall was due partly to the fall in agricultural incomes, which was greater than had been estimated, and partly due to the impact of the recession on business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Stamp duties, like all other taxes, are reviewed every year in the context of the budget.  The position at present is that in the case of the vast <Col N="31" /> majority of new houses either a complete exemption from duty is granted on the transfer or a liability to the duty arises only on the value of the site.  In the case of most other houses, the duty is chargeable at the general rates applicable to the conveyance or transfer of all property apart from stock or marketable securities, and thus if any relief were granted it might have to be extended to such other property.  This relief could be costly, which would mean a higher tax burden in other taxation areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that most new house sales in consequence of the prohibition on the creation of new ground rents are effected in the Land Registry, to which stamp duty does not apply but a Land Registry fee applies? Therefore, new houses do not come into the picture at all.  Will the Minister not admit that with the increase in the price of houses the average family-sized house has been reaching upwards into brackets that attract a progressively heavier rate of stamp duty?  Will the Minister not consider adjusting that to ensure that an average family-sized house will attract roughly the same amount of stamp duty in real terms as was the case five years ago before the Fianna Fáil inflation in house values took place?  That rate has more than doubled since the change of government.</P>

In view of the large number of jobs which will arise in the building and construction industry, in which industry the duration and nature of employment tend to vary with individual projects, it is not possible to make a precise distinction between permanent and temporary employment arising under the investment plan.  Furthermore, in view of the different times at which projects under the plan will commence, it is not possible to say how many jobs listed in the statement will arise in the first six months of 1981 and later.</P>

      <P>That shallow comment ill-befits the Minister and speaks for itself.  Does the Minister accept that an assurance given by his former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy D. Andrews, in the House, when he said that overtime in the Prison Service was no longer necessary, is now the central element of the problem, because any evening after 5 o'clock there is no guarantee of how many officers will be available in the prisons and that that has led to enormous friction?

A certain amount of progress has been made and I would like to think that more progress can be made.

      <P>Will the Deputy please allow me to do so?  Deputy O'Keeffe forgets that last Thursday I gave a very full and comprehensive answer on the question of people who absconded from prison.  I also gave figures of those who came back, which the Deputy conveniently forgets today.  Let me remind him that during my term as Minister for Justice there have not been any helicopters coming into our prisons and we have not had any trucks breaking into our prisons. We have not had any explosives used by prisoners to break out of prison.  With regard to the fears which the Deputy feels exist in people's minds in regard to the way the prison system is run, the Deputy would do well to ask some of his colleagues what the situation was in my predecessor's time compared with the situation now.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third point raised by the Deputy, political promotions within the prison system, the Deputy is welcome at any time to come into the House and put the facts on the table and we will deal with them.  As far as I am concerned there was not, and there will not be, any political favouritism in the prison system.  I hope the Deputy's predecessor and his party can say the same thing with regard to when they were in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at present when a woman has to leave her job to have a baby is that there is no guarantee that she will get her job back.  Further, she will usually receive much less than her normal take-home pay.  That is a situation which could not be allowed to continue.  The Bill now before the House, in conjunction with legislation to be introduced later by the Minister for Social Welfare, remedies that situation for good.  I believe it is an important piece of social legislation and represents a further major advance in improving the position of women in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain provisions giving some protection to expectant working mothers have, it is true, been added to the Statute Book. First of all, in labour legislation, relevant protection is contained in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Employment Equality Act, also passed in 1977, and the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979. Under the Unfair Dismissals Act a pregnant employee is entitled to protection against unfair dismissal, subject to certain conditions, solely on grounds of her pregnancy or matters connected with it. The Employment Equality Act makes an exception to its general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status by allowing the employer to <Col N="78" /> give special treatment to an employee in the case of pregnancy or childbirth.  The Redundancy Payments Act provides that an employee's continuity of service is not broken where she is absent from work for a period of up to 13 weeks during which she gave birth to a child.  Secondly, the existing social welfare code entitles women who satisfy the relevant contribution conditions to receive maternity allowance for a period of 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>However well-intentioned the provisions in these Acts are, they cannot be taken as having secured maternity protection for women in employment on a statutory basis.  The three essential and inter-related elements of such protection are, first, the right to take maternity leave; secondly, the right to return to work afterwards; and, thirdly, the right to job security while absent on maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of the existence of maternity leave schemes in both the public and the private sector.  A growing number of such schemes have been negotiated, individually or collectively, on a voluntary basis.  However, I am convinced that measures designed to ensure essential protection for the safety, health and welfare of workers should not be left exclusively to collective bargaining. Action from the Government is needed as well.  I am therefore promoting this Bill to entitle female employees to take maternity leave and to return to work afterwards.</P>
    <P>Particular care has been taken to consult both sides of industry fully and medical advice on certain aspects of the Bill both before the development of initial proposals for legislation and during the preparation of the Bill now before the House.  Preliminary views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers were considered over a year ago and since then several meetings with representatives of each body have taken place.  In addition, the views of the Council for the Status of Women were borne in mind.  I am confident, therefore, that the provisions of the Maternity Protection of Employees Bill, when taken in conjunction with the new maternity allowance scheme which my <Col N="79" /> colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, will be presenting to the Dáil within a week, represent a major step forward in the social conditions and the welfare of expectant working mothers.</P>
    <P>The two vital sections of the Bill before the House are section 8, which entitles an employee to take a minimum period of 14 weeks' maternity leave from her employment; and its corollary, section 20, which entitles her to return to work with her employer after her baby is born. The Bill is designed to ensure the greatest possible flexibility in the operation of both of these sections.  As regards the allocation of the minimum period of maternity leave under section 10, generally speaking an employee must begin her maternity leave not less than four weeks before the expected week of birth of the baby and return to work not less than four weeks after the actual birth.  The remaining six weeks may be taken either before or after the birth, in accordance with the employee's wishes.  In this way I would hope that the employee may be guided by her medical advisers as to when it would be advisable for her to stop working before her confinement, taking the various relevant factors into consideration.  I should mention, too, that the provisions in sections 12 and 13 of the Bill have been tailored to take account of the possibility of the baby arriving later or earlier than expected.</P>
    <P>Should an employee wish to take more than 14 weeks' maternity leave &mdash; because, for example, she is breast-feeding her baby &mdash; section 14 of the Bill affords her the choice of taking additional maternity leave of up to four weeks. Once the Bill has been enacted, FUE and ICTU will be consulted about the making of regulations under section 16 which will permit the employee to take time off from work for the purposes of ante and post-natal care.</P>
    <P>There are, I should point out, certain differences between absence from work on maternity leave and on additional maternity leave.  For one thing, while an absence on maternity leave may attract payment under the new maternity allowance scheme, an absence on additional <Col N="80" /> maternity leave will be unpaid.  Secondly, under section 15, an employee's employment rights will be preserved during her absence on maternity leave, whereas during additional maternity leave those rights are, so to speak, &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;.  Neither pregnancy nor childbirth can be termed illnesses so it would not be justifiable to treat them as such.  Section 15 prohibits maternity leave or additional maternity leave from being reckonable against the employee's entitlement to sick leave or to other leave, such as annual leave.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that appropriate medical care, before and after childbirth, plays a large part in protecting the health and welfare of both mother and child.  Under regulations which I propose to make in accordance with section 16 of this Bill a pregnant woman will be entitled to time off from her work to attend her doctor or clinic and after her baby is born she may have time off to attend for post natal check-up.</P>
    <P>At this point I feel it appropriate to emphasise that great care has been taken throughout the Bill to facilitate the employer in the smooth functioning of his business.  For that reason the employee is required to keep her employer fully informed at all appropriate stages of her intentions as regards the exercise of her entitlement under the Act.  For instance, under sections 9 and 14, the employee must inform her employer at least four weeks in advance of her intention to take either maternity leave or additional maternity leave.  Her notification in respect of maternity leave must be accompanied by a medical certificate confirming her pregnancy and indicating the expected week of her confinement.  Her right to return to work is subject to four weeks' prior notification under section 22, with the further requirement that she must confirm her intention to return two weeks before her leave expires.  Confirmation of her original notification to the employer is required in case an employee, even where she had fully intended to return to work, is prevented from doing so by unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    <P>Complementary to the right to take maternity leave is the right to return to <Col N="81" /> work afterwards.  Under section 20 an employee is entitled to return to work with her employer in a job which is the same as, or equivalent to, the one which she held immediately before her absence on maternity leave.  It is only where an employer does not find it reasonably practicable to re-instate her in such a manner that he may, by virtue of section 21, offer her re-engagement in a suitable alternative job, under terms and conditions not substantially less favourable to her than those of her original job.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the right to take maternity leave and to return to work afterwards may be freely exercised, provided the employee complies with the notification procedures I have mentioned.  The granting of these rights would be nullified if the employer were free to penalise an employee for duly availing herself of these.  Consequently, section 17 invalidates any termination of employment or suspension given while the employee is absent from work in accordance with the legislation and due to expire during or after her absence; section 18, extends, by the period of the employee's absence, any notice of termination of employment or suspension effected before the employer had received the prior notification required under the legislation; and sections 25 and 27 amend the Unfair Dismissals Act for the purpose of deeming it an unfair dismissal if the employee was dismissed for exercising her rights under this legislation, and to enable either the employee or her employer to have recourse to a rights commissioner or to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the event of a dispute about entitlement under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Maternity Protection of Employees Bill does not deal with the question of pay during maternity leave.  As I have indicated, the social welfare payment aspect will be dealt with by the Minister for Social Welfare in the legislation giving effect to the new maternity allowance scheme being prepared by his Department.</P>
    <P>The intention is that an employee in insurable employment will receive an overall weekly amount (including the value of any tax refund) corresponding <Col N="82" /> to her average net take-home pay, during her absence on maternity leave but not during the additional four weeks leave allowed for under section 14 of this Bill. My colleague will be supplying Deputies with the details of the scheme shortly. Bearing in mind that it is the Government's intention to bring both pieces of legislation into operation by 6 April 1981, I commend the Bill to the House and urge Deputies to give it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and see it as another milestone on the long road to social justice and equality for women.  That is not to say that, like its many predecessors and especially those enacted during the term of office of the National Coalition, it will not have its problems.  I shall deal with those problems later on in my speech.  However, whatever may be those problems there is no doubt that the omission of this legislation to date has perpetrated an injustice against women.  In that regard my main criticism of the Minister would be the delay in its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of women whilst having children to have their jobs protected would be widely considered today to be a basic social and human right.  Certainly that is my view.  The implications of the provisions of this Bill &mdash; with which the Minister did not deal&mdash;will become apparent as time progresses.  Indeed the implementation of its provisions will not be without cost in terms of employment, social costs and indeed to women themselves.  It is regrettable that a likely cost &mdash; and here there is some evidence to suggest that other equality legislation has had a similar effect &mdash; will be that employers will have an additional reason for not employing women because, of course, this is a uniquely female problem.  I have no doubt that many employers will seek to avoid employing women, in many cases, as a result of this Bill, something which can only be regarded as entirely regrettable.  In the case of small employers it is more understandable.  I regret that the Minister did not address himself to what will be a very big problem for small employers and probably also for women working for them.  I have in mind here <Col N="83" /> particularly small offices, shops and so on.  But no problem that might arise as a result of the enactment of this Bill would in any way warrant delaying its introduction or a diminution of its terms because its provisions seek to eliminate an injustice which has been perpetrated for far too long, something which must be a primary consideration at all times.</P>
    <P>I have said that the provisions of this Bill will carry their social cost.  It is a feature of modern life that many mothers, through economic circumstances. are forced to seek employment.  Quite apart from the social acceptance in recent years of women wanting to pursue careers, something which is a wholly laudable development, I believe we have not given sufficient attention to the social cost to society of women with young children who would prefer to remain at home, at least in the children's earlier years, to look after them but who have been forced, through economic circumstances, to seek employment.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider instituting, either through his Department or through the Employment Equality Agency or through the Council for the Status of Women, some research into the social cost of forcing mothers who do not want to, to seek employment on economic grounds.  That is quite distinct and should be separated from the case of women who have consciously decided to pursue a career and who should be helped and encouraged by legislation and attitudes in society in that aspiration.  In my constituency there are many hundreds and perhaps thousands of women who have to seek employment to make ends meet, not for any luxuries but just to meet the basic requirements of their family and home.  Many of them feel that this has an adverse effect on their children and that in turn has serious adverse effects for society.  So there may be a very much bigger social cost involved in forcing mothers to seek employment than we have ever acknowledged.  The Minister should therefore institute research into this area to establish what, if any, is the social cost.  While we should do everything <Col N="84" /> in our power as legislators to influence attitudes in society to allow and encourage women who want to pursue careers to do so, we should also do everything in our power as legislators and formers of opinion to facilitate the mother who wants to stay at home.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that this Bill, like some other Bills, although fully intended to improve the situation of women, could in some respects have adverse consequences in relation to employment.  It is regrettable that this is so but I hope that it will have a minimal effect in that direction.  I would strongly urge employers in general to adopt a very positive attitude to the provisions of this Bill.  Having said that I want again to raise with the Minister the question of small employers.  Would it be possible to inaugurate a scheme to help the man who employs two or three people to overcome the inevitable problems to which this Bill will give rise?</P>
    <P>There is one other major feature of Irish social life that must be mentioned in the context of this Bill.  That is the fact that the female participation rate in economic activity here is the lowest in Europe.  As most of the ILO and EEC surveys will show, apart from the Netherlands, the female participation rate here is considerably lower than in any of the other EEC countries.  The conclusion we must draw from that is that there are a great deal more women in our society who would be available for work (a) if the jobs were available and (b) in the legislation and attitudes governing these matters were helpful.  Of course this Bill is a step in the right direction in that regard.  But it does mean that if we are going to follow the trends of other European societies, the female participation rate will continue to grow as the years pass by and I imagine our female participation rate will be chasing after the average rate in Europe and will catch up probably towards the end of this century. Our job requirements will therefore be a great deal more than we have already estimated.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I have mentioned this in the House but it would be wrong of me not to raise it again during <Col N="85" /> the Second Stage of this Bill.  It is not good enugh to pass Bills and to express good intentions without also doing the other things that are necessary to allow women to have full social justice and full equality.  That means making provision for sufficient jobs in the years to come.  We hear a great deal about the fact that 50 per cent of our population is now under 25 years of age.  It is also a fact that 50 per cent of our population is female and it is likely that our female participation rates will follow those of Europe.</P>
    <P>To make Bills like this one meaningful we have to create the necessary jobs so that women can take advantage of the provisions of this Bill if they want to. That has considerable implications for our whole national apparatus in relation to job creation and job maintenance.  No one has really made provision for an increase in the female participation rate and certainly not at the level that would be required for us to have a female participation rate of the same level as in Europe.  It is not that I hope or wish to have a female participation rate equal to that in Europe.  It may or may not be a good thing.  But there is a momentum in that direction which will inevitably take us into a situation where our female participation rates will be close to those of Europe.  I would therefore urge the Minister of State at the Department of Labour when this Bill is passed, or perhaps before it is passed, to go back to the drawing board with the other Ministers responsible for the job creation and job maintenance areas to see if our job creation programmes are going to be enough.  I do not have to tell the House that with unemployment growing rapidly already it is clear that our job creation efforts are not enough for today, never mind for tomorrow or the next decade.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of this Bill I would propose to table a number of amendments because I think some improvements are possible and the Bill has some flaws.  I raise two of them now and perhaps the Minister of State when he comes to reply can clarify the matter. It is clearly intended by the Bill that maternity leave or additional maternity leave should not affect annual or sick <Col N="86" /> leave entitlement.  Does that mean that the 14-18 weeks during which an expectant mother may be absent from work will be reckonable as if they were worked for leave entitlement?  In other words, many firms operate on the basis that you are entitled to X days per month worked.  I would like the Minister to clarify that.  If he does not, I would like to put down an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify that total annual leave entitlement will not be reduced by the 14-18 weeks absence.  As I read the Bill, it is not clear. The Bill says that annual or sick leave is not affected, and I presume that could be read as meaning that, if a lady was entitled to three weeks' leave for a full year worked, that leave could not be included in the 14-18 weeks but her entitlement to three weeks would be maintained as if she had worked a whole year.  That needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The second point that I am not at all happy about, although I can see some difficulty regarding it, is that during her absence from employment for maternity leave or additional maternity leave a lady would not have social insurance unless her employer was paying some remuneration during her absence.  That is regrettable and I would like the Minister to think about it again with a view to at least permitting social insurance credits during the period of absence.  I would see that as a very important improvement in the provisions of the Bill.  There may be cost involved.  Perhaps the Minister could examine it.  In those two areas at least, I see scope for improving the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is not our intention on this side of the House to delay the passage of the Bill but to help it on its way.  I hope that Committee Stage will be taken in the next few weeks and that this Bill can be enacted by both Houses well in time for 6 April when it is to come into operation.  Towards the end of his speech the Minister referred to the scheme being introduced in parallel by his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.  From what the Minister said it seems that the provisions will be reasonably acceptable, but of course we have to await the publication of the scheme before we can comment in more detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> Finally, I would like the Minister to reflect on the problems &mdash; it would be wrong of us to pretend that problems will not arise from this Bill; they will &mdash; that this Bill will give rise to and then see how we as legislators can help overcome them, especially those in relation to small employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome the Bill and I appeal to all sides of the House to put it through all Stages without undue delay.  I have valid and proper reasons for urging the speedy passing of this Bill.  One is that Ireland is the only EEC country now without such a scheme and this Bill before us today is long overdue and needed.  Furthermore, the ICTU, the Women's Representative Committee, the Council for the Status of Women, the Labour Party and the Labour Women's National Council have all sought such a scheme for many years and at last this Bill has been brought before the House for final adoption.  I emphasise and re-emphasise that the most important reason for the early adoption of this Bill today is that this scheme is part of the Government commitment within the national understanding and as such has our full support.  It is essentially a Bill providing for full and total equality for all women in employment.  For years we have listened to our women's organisations pleading with the Government and asking particularly the Department of Labour to introduce such legislation and fulfil the needs of this equality and today we have it in this Bill.  For that reason I wish it a speedy passage through the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it can be said the generosity of the Bill and the scheme can be questioned in some respects.  For example, the schemes in the UK and other countries are much more generous in their attitude towards maternity leave.  If there is to be total equality of status among all women in the EEC, this aspect will have to be looked at later.  However, we will support the present Bill in its current form because we wish to see it enacted as soon as possible and perhaps later on there can be further discussions with the <Col N="88" /> Minister on the Bill's shortcomings with a view to resolving the problems and updating the attitude of this Government to bring it into line with that of other member states of the EEC.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the very important aspect that we now need better child care facilities within and without employment.  There is also a national understanding commitment in this area and we now work towards the scheme as part of the overall attitude of this Government and the Department of Labour towards the equality of women.  This involves the woman herself and the child that has been born.  We urgently need an integrated system of maternity and child care facilities, all related to work and to the woman at work.  For that reason this Bill can be described as a watershed in the establishment of equality status for all women in our country.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of this party to propose any amendments to the Bill and I assure the Minister that he will have our full support on all Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this Bill is long overdue but, nevertheless, it is very welcome.  For economic reasons there always has been and always will be a need for some women to go out to work.  I am very glad indeed that the Bill makes provision for 14 weeks' paid maternity leave, which gives a woman a reasonable amount of time before and after her confinement.</P>
      <P>Up to now a woman who had to work for economic reasons usually found it very difficult to have her baby and to get back to work within a short space of time so that she could continue to earn money. This legislation will give her confidence. She can take time off before and after the birth to rest and make her pregnancy easier.  I am glad the Minister brought this Bill in so quickly after it was promised in the national understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that a working mother will have further problems when a baby is born.  How will she mind the baby?  It is no use having 14 weeks' paid maternity leave if she has nowhere to leave the baby when she goes back to work.  In conjunction with this legislation there must be day nurseries provided, so that the mother may bring the baby there to be <Col N="89" /> minded and to where she can go at lunch time to feed the baby.  The Minister mentioned she will be entitled to an extra four weeks if she is breast feeding and usually this is done for six or eight months.  She will need somewhere to do this in peace. Perhaps this could be incorporated in legislation dealing with children.</P>
    <P>Legislation should also be brought in to ensure that in buildings for which planning permission is sought, offices, banks and all places of employment, there should be some place set aside for women who are working in that establishment and who want to bring their babies along and leave them there to be looked after. I hope the Minister concerned will act very quickly to provide such a service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said we had the lowest female work participation rate of all European countries and that he hoped this would change.  I hope it will not change.  The Irish woman prefers to stay at home, unless she has to go out for economic reasons or is a genuine career woman.  The majority of Irish women are happiest at home where they are most needed.  The family needs a mother, especially when children are young.  It is a very happy situation when the father can provide for the family and the mother can stay at home to look after the children.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the Bill going through and it will be welcomed by all women and by politicians on both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Lemass for their contributions to the Bill.  We have taken into account some of the points they made in relation to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the delay in introducing legislation which is so desirable.  It was recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women in 1973 and, without getting into politics, I wonder what the Coalition Government were doing during their period of office. The Deputy referred to the position of employers in small businesses in relation to the Bill.  The best legal advice available <Col N="90" /> to me indicated that provision for special treatment in the Bill for those employers could give rise to constitutional difficulties.  They could not be treated as a special case since that would, in effect, mean distinguishing in relation to the treatment for the purposes of maternity protection between female employees, depending on whether they worked for small or large organisations.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been made in preparing the Bill to strike a balance between providing the essential elements of maternity protection for female employees and ensuring that employers, big and small, are facilitated to the greatest extent possible in the orderly conduct of their businesses.  This is evident from the various requirements to give the employer prior written notification before the employee can lawfully exercise her right under the bill, from the fact that her reinstatement after maternity leave may be to an equivalent job, as opposed to the same job, and that re-engagement may be offered to her in certain circumstances as an alternative to reinstatement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the cost of the legislation, both in financial and social terms, with regard to employment prospects for female employees.  In advance of this legislation trade unions had negotiated close on 100 collective agreements dealing with paid maternity leave.  In these cases maternity pay had to be borne by each individual employer concerned.  This would be a particular burden on small businesses or for people employing females in intensive industries such as the textile industry.  However, under the new maternity allowance scheme to be introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare the cost of payment during maternity leave will be spread evenly over all employers.</P>
    <P>With regard to possible adverse effects of the Bill on the employment of women, I remind the House that Ireland is the last country in the EEC, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, to introduce a statutory maternity leave scheme.  There is no evidence of which I am aware to indicate that women in other EEC countries have suffered as a result.  A recent study in the <Col N="91" /> UK showed that the contrary is the case. The Bill has been designed to facilitate the employer in the orderly conduct of his business while employees are on maternity leave and is a more positive approach than allowing the present situation to continue whereby collective agreements are negotiated in a haphazard and non-uniform manner.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill makes it clear that a woman's employment rights are not affected and will continue to accrue during maternity leave.  For that reason I assure Deputy Mitchell that absence on maternity leave will be counted for reckoning in the woman's entitlement to annual leave as if she had been present at work during the period of maternity leave.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare credits will be allowed by the Department of Social Welfare for persons in receipt of benefit.  Therefore, the amendment which the Deputy seeks is not necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that the UK legislation is more generous in terms of the length of time during which a woman may be on maternity leave.  That is true but it is the only aspect of that other legislation to which the Deputy refers.  Another aspect of it is that in England a woman must have two years' employment with the same employer before becoming entitled to maternity leave whereas under this Bill there is no qualifying period of service in that regard.  In addition, the corresponding payment in Britain is not as favourable as that proposed here.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and Lemass expressed concern about the position of women who, for economic reasons or for reasons of personal fulfilment, find it necessary to go to work.  A couple who choose to combine careers with family responsibilities may encounter practical difficulties.  These difficulties centre around the need to make suitable alternative arrangements for the care of children.  This problem is the subject of a commitment in the second national understanding of 1980.  That commitment was that the Minister would establish a working party for the purpose of examining the position of child-care services <Col N="92" /> and facilities in cases of working parents. Steps are being taken to establish this working party.  Nominations have been sought from appropriate representative organisations including trade union and employer interests, the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be promoting this legislation, legislation which represents a major step forward in social policy and which will make a significant contribution to accommodating the employment patterns of women <i>vis-à-vis</i> their family responsibilities.  It is vital that we utilise investment in the education and training of women by making it possible for them to combine careers and motherhood.  If we fail in this respect we could lose out as a nation in terms of a large proportion of the talent that is available among our female population.</P>
    <P>This legislation will help women to overcome the conflicts which many of them have experienced previously because of their natural desire to have families as well as their wish to remain in employment.</P>
    <P>The major emphasis in the Bill is on the question of the protection of the health and welfare of mothers in employment and of their children.  The enactment of this Bill will benefit about 10,000 expectant mothers this year by safeguarding them from the fear of losing their employment because of pregnancy.  In addition the legislation will prevent them from having to work up to a date close to the date of childbirth and under the parallel legislation which the Minister for Social Welfare will be presenting to the House next month, mothers in employment will be given further protection by being relieved of the financial necessity to work at about the time of confinement, a time when pressure on resources tends to be high.  Having regard to the importance of medical supervision both before and after confinement, I will be drawing up regulations regarding time off for both ante- and post-natal care.  These regulations will be drawn up as soon as possible after the enactment of the legislation and will come within section 16 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have taken considerable care to <Col N="93" /> ensure that the employers' interests are protected also.  The FUE were consulted fully during the preparation of the legislation and I understand that the Bill generally is acceptable to them.  Having regard to the notification procedures with which an employee must conform at all appropriate stages and also because of the relatively small administrative financial burden to the individual employer, the employer is being protected and will be facilitated in the running of his business to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a most desirable piece of legislation and I commend it to the House.  I thank those Deputies who have contributed for their constructive suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1980, to enable Bord na Móna to make grants, out of funds to be provided by the Oireachtas, to encourage more extensive private development of bogs for the production of turf for fuel.</P>
      <P>The increasing scarcity and cost of energy, on the import of which we are so heavily reliant, makes it imperative that our indigenous energy resources be exploited as fully and effectively as possible.  Bogland is a primary energy resource which offers an immediate prospect of more extensive development for fuel purposes; it is therefore an obvious source for attention.</P>
      <P>The present situation under which Bord na Móna acquire and develop bogs has been, and will continue to be the major contribution of turf to fuel and energy resources.  Bord na Móna's record of good planning, effective organisation and growing scale of output of turf products for electricity generation and for household fuel markets is impressive.  It is my intention that Bord na Móna continue to develop and increase their production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> The board's new briquette factory at Littleton, County Tipperary, will start production shortly.  It has an annual production capacity of 130,000 tonnes and when fully operational will provide direct employment for 120 workers, with a further 210 out on the bog producing the milled peat required for the manufacture of the briquettes.  Bord na Móna purchased to date some 70,000 hectares of bog for the production of turf and turf products.  The third programme of the board which commenced in 1974, will increase the board's acquisition of bog to about 80,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>There are many smaller tracts of bogland which could contribute significantly to our energy requirements.  Many of these would be of little interest for development under the large scale operations of Bord na Móna.  But their value could be very considerable and I believe that they could be developed by private interests for the production of fuel.  Balance of payments and market supply would be advantageously affected, and areas of hitherto useless land could be turned to profit and provide employment.  Surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais indicate that there is a remaining area of bog of about 1.1 million hectares, comprised of relatively small bogs spread throughout the midlands and western areas of the country.  It is estimated that about 50 per cent of these boglands would be capable of development for fuel production. Essentially, the Bill is designed to get such of these boglands as are capable of economic exploitation for energy purposes into production as fast and efficiently as possible through the involvement of the private interests concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not have to emphasise that the Bill is in no way intended to downgrade or prejudice the primacy of Bord na Móna as the key instrument of policy in the development of turf resources.  Indeed, it is because of the confidence I have in the board's expertise and because I know of their dedication to ensuring that all the bogland of the country is carefully used and not wasted or rendered useless by bad work methods, that I am proposing in the Bill that the administration of this <Col N="96" /> private scheme be given over to the board.  The Bill also provides for a role for the expertise in the various counties in the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The main obstacle to private development of bogland for the production of fuel is the substantial development costs involved, and the cost of modern mechanical turf cutting machinery.  This Bill is intended to provide financial assistance towards both of these.  One of my chief concerns is to ensure that the now valuable resource of bogland is developed in a planned and careful way and that quick profit despoliation of our irreplaceable asset will not be a consequence. An efficient scheme of private bog development requires the observance of standards of operation.  Cost is a major factor in orderly development.  Drainage, including outfall drainage, access roads and efficient turf cutting machinery can amount to a financial investment which could impose an excessive burden on private developers, even allowing for the improved market for turf as a fuel.  Given this situation and the inescapable need to exploit our domestic energy resources as fully and effectively as possible, it has been decided to introduce a scheme of grants on the lines proposed in the Bill to encourage more extensive private development of bogland for the production of turf for fuel.</P>
    <P>To minimise the risk of the destruction or wasteful use of bogs in the growth in turf production which these financial incentives are intended to achieve, the Bill provides for delivery to Bord na Móna of a bog development plan with the grant application.  The plan must contain such information as the board may require.  Essentially the purpose of this requirement is to enable the board to assess a project and to make grants upon terms they consider appropriate to ensure orderly development, including proper regard to the subsequent use of the cut-over area.  However, the board may dispense with a development plan where an application relates to a bog development adequately indicated on a plan received by the board in relation to another application or is in respect of minor works or minor equipment for a <Col N="97" /> proposed development on a bog which is being worked.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention also that the requirement to deliver a plan to Bord na Móna will not apply to persons seeking grant aid for machinery to cut turf under contract.  Such contractors may have no direct connection with the bog area being cut and could not be expected to prepare a development plan.  As I have said earlier, persons at local level with knowledge and experience in connection with bog development will have a role in the administration of the scheme.  I have in mind here county engineers, county development teams and others with acquired expertise.  Specifically, I see this expertise as being of particular immediate value to the board in regard to the examination of bog development plans and perhaps even in the preparation of such plans.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, included a provision in the Bill which enables the board to appoint persons to examine and approve, or indeed in some cases prepare bog development plans.</P>
    <P>Turf production by the private sector is at present running at about 1 million tonnes per annum &mdash; 313,000 tonnes approximately of oil equivalent &mdash; representing a saving to the economy of the order of £47 million in oil imports.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to give any firm indication of the likely effects of the proposed scheme in terms of increased turf production by private interests, but given suitable harvesting and other conditions it seems that an increased output of upwards of 500,000 tonnes annually would be a reasonable estimate.</P>
    <P>Realistically, it must be acknowledged that this additional output may not be got in the first few years but the potential is there.  As to employment, it is reasonable to assume that the anticipated increased activities in private bog development as a result of the scheme will mean extra jobs in areas where job opportunities are relatively scarce.  Mechanised methods of bog development and turf extraction are essential for economic exploitation, so that, initially at any rate, additional employment as a direct result of the <Col N="98" /> scheme may be limited but, when the scheme is fully operational, employment should be provided for upwards of 800. Some of these jobs will be of a seasonal nature but will fit in with the work pattern in the areas concerned, where farm work, which also has an element of seasonality, is the principal source of employment. Of course, every job in the principal bog regions is valuable but where the product is totally from a native and hitherto unused resource such employment is more valuable still and will have beneficial side effects also.</P>
    <P>Likely expenditure under the proposed grants scheme is not readily estimated at this stage.  Essentially, expenditure would depend on the number of acceptable schemes for grant assistance for private bog development coming forward and, of course, the amounts involved. Development costs will depend a lot on the physical characteristic of the bog being developed, terrain, drainage required and accessibility.  Until there is some experience of the working of the scheme a firm estimate of the cost of funding it is not possible.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Central Development Committee, knows the CDC, currently operate a scheme under which grants are made available to private operators towards the cost of turf-cutting machinery.  It is planned that the CDC scheme will be absorbed in the wider scheme now proposed.  The local improvements scheme operated by the Department of the Environment through county councils provides grants for the improvement of non-public roads.  Most of the schemes relate to roads serving the local agricultural community, but a limited number relate to access roads to bogs.  Minor drainage works, including those which serve a bog, also come within the local improvements scheme but such schemes form a very minor part of the total works undertaken.  Roinn na Gaeltachta provide grants to cover the cost of certain roads in Gaeltacht areas.  Such grants are not specifically designed to aid bog development but they have in the past been used for this purpose to a limited extent.  It is not intended that the scheme now proposed should replace any <Col N="99" /> benefits available under either the local improvements scheme or the Roinn na Gaeltachta scheme.  However, the extent to which grants may be available for access roads under these schemes will be taken into account in determining what grant assistance should be made available under the proposed new scheme.</P>
    <P>The memorandum included with the Bill explains its purpose and that of its various provisions.  I will, therefore, confine myself to the more important provisions in the Bill and to those which I think might benefit from further elaboration. As I have said, there are two main strands to it.  First, those who own or have a lease of bogland or a right of turbary over it will, subject to an approved development plan for it, be considered for grants for development works and for bog development machinery, including turf-cutting machines.  Second, persons wishing to cut turf, such as contractors, will be considered for grants for turf-cutting machinery.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates those who may apply to Bord na Móna for a grant towards the cost of a proposed bog development. Applicants must be either the owner, which includes the lessee, of the bog or have a right to turbary over it.  It is proposed that the board will administer the grants scheme and will have full discretion except in a situation where a conflict of interest between the board and the applicant might be a consideration.  The Bill lays down procedures for dealing with a proposal by the board to refuse an application in those circumstances.  This I see as a necessary assurance for bog developers.  I am satisfied that Bord na Móna would not act in an arbitrary or selfish way so as to put their own interest first and block an otherwise worthy private development.  I have provided this safeguard, however.  The application and all relevant documents have to be referred to the Minister, who may confirm the board's proposal to refuse the application or direct it to make a grant, having previously consulted the advisory committee, the establishment of which is provided for in the Bill.  It should be noted that referral to the Minister is confined <Col N="100" /> to the so-called conflict of interest situation; otherwise, as I have said, the board have total discretion.</P>
    <P>It has been decided not to attempt, at this stage, to cover questions of bog ownership or rights, nor to deal with acquisition or allocation of bogland, nor with amalgamation of turbary rights held in small plots, not with division of commonage to facilitate turf production.  These are important aspects; they raise difficult and complex issues which would require far reaching measures.  Accordingly, it was felt that the introduction of a priority measure, as this Bill is intended to be, should not be held up while these complex issues are being pursued.  I do not see the ownership question as a potential source of difficulty in connection with the operation of the proposed scheme. Indeed, the availability of grant assistance towards the cost of approved bog developments should be an inducement to those concerned to settle in a spirit of co-operation and to their own advantage, ownership and rights problems in relation to bogs, where these exist.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House as a measure which provides a basis for the encouragement of more extensive private exploitation of the country's turf resources as a means of reducing our dependence on imported coal and oil, which this year is expected to top one billion pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The party which I represent support this Bill, accept and agree with the spirit behind it and the purposes of it.  We shall not delay or hamper it in any way.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Energy that it is sensible to attract private enterprise and private capital into the energy field.  I understand, of course, that it may be necessary to provide public funds to encourage that development.  I also understand that the pace of turf extraction and exploitation must be stepped up, since our oil situation has become so bleak, and that Bord na Móna themselves have vastly increased their production over the last six or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one or two points.  In particular, I want to say something about <Col N="101" /> a point which, although it bulks very large in the Bill, the Minister in his speech did not really advert to and that is the distinction in the upper limit of the grant between private individuals, on the one hand, and co-operative enterprises on the other.  I entirely share the anxiety which I thought I heard reflected in the Minister's speech ten minutes ago to encourage co-operative activity.  The Minister will, perhaps, have the grace to recognise that I have been preaching this personally for many years and that it has not been too often heard from the Minister's party during that time.</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken as in any way pouring cold water on the co-operative idea when I raise this point. I do so not in a niggling spirit but because I think it is important while doing our best to foster the co-operative idea to keep our eyes on the economic purpose of this Bill.  The economic purpose of this Bill is to attract private money, whether co-operatively organised or not, into turf development. There will be cases, because of confused ownership situations and confused entries on title documents and so on, where it will facilitate the exploitation of a new bog if the owners instead of becoming entangled in disputes about ownership or trying to resolve these disputes simply operate a turf extraction and exploitation scheme co-operatively. While I agree that that is so.  I am thinking also of the private individual who does not have these problems but who may be deterred by the by no means marginal difference between the upper limit of 45 per cent, which is all he can get by way of a grant under this Bill, and the 60 per cent to which a co-operative enterprise, whether new or long-established, will be entitled to.  Is it sensible to make this distinction?</P>
    <P>I have been approached by one individual in connection with this Bill &mdash; I must admit he has not made this point and I am not sure if it would be applicable to his case &mdash; who recently acquired a very large area of bog which he proposes to develop.  This Bill must be an advantage to him, but he cannot understand why he is being kept to an upper limit of <Col N="102" /> 45 per cent of a grant when he does not need to work co-operatively.  I hope I do not need to explain that I am all for co-operation, but here is the case of an individual, an entrepreneur, who wants to develop this large area of bog himself. I hope we will not forbid him the right to do that.  He has not said he will be deterred by the fact that the upper limit of his grant will be 45 per cent, whereas a co-operative will get 60 per cent, but suppose he were in that situation.  Suppose he found it that last straw of impossibility to finance that development to the extent of an extra 15 per cent.  Would not the Minister's purpose be defeated so far as that individual is concerned?  As I said, I do not think this is applicable in his case but for all I know there may be other such cases.</P>
    <P>If this makes a great deal of sense, seeing the Minister is willing to stake bog development to the extent of 60 per cent of the cost and the fact that this will not break him or the State, surely there would be a case for doing away with this distinction and making it 60 per cent all round?  That would be a more sensible thing to do.  I may be wrong about that because there may be some dimension I have not understood.  If so, I cannot be blamed because the Minister's speech was silent on this point.</P>
    <P>Another question I do not want to make a meal of because I do not see a lot of substance in it but I would not like this opportunity to pass without mentioning it so that it will be on the record, to use that phrase of doubtful value, is this: is it constitutionally permissible to draw a distinction between private money co-operatively organised and private money privately organised for this purpose?  Is that consonant with Article 40.1 which asserts that citizens are to be equal before the law?  I can tell the Minister &mdash; I do not expect him to be focused on this particular point &mdash; that in EEC countries which have a provision like Article 40.1, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany, there has been very considerable litigation in which points of this kind have been raised.  We have not had a point of this kind raised in the Irish courts yet, and I do not think there would be much <Col N="103" /> substance in it here because it is true that a Government must be allowed to have discretion in constructing different categories for the purpose of policy, and they must be permitted to arrange citizens and potential beneficiaries of a scheme in different categories but &mdash; and this is the only area of doubt and I want to mention it in case it might be thought I should have done so &mdash; that distinction, or the drawing of distinctions, ought to rest on a materially reasonable consideration related to the purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to encourage turf development and I cannot see that this distinction will encourage turf development because this is a distinction which will make it easier for some more than for others.  The basis of the distinction does not seem to be related to the main object of the Bill.  As I said, I do not want to make much of that point.  I do not advance it as being a killing point and I am not sure I would stand over it if I had to argue the point in another forum.  Casual distinctions of this kind ought not to be thrown into legislation merely because the Minister has a soft spot for one form of development rather than another, when the object of the Bill, to extract more sods of turf out of the ground, would be just as well served if the distinction was not there.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has shown that soft spot, even though he has not put it in the most appropriate context, for co-operative development and I am particularly glad &mdash; perhaps I am flattering myself in assuming that this may have been the result of something I said &mdash; that the idea of co-operative energy exploitation or development has lodged in his Department.  About a year ago I suggested in a fairly elaborate speech that we should be casting around for ways of encouraging the local formation of energy oriented co-operatives which would have much the same function in regard to energy as there was in regard to the exploitation of dairying in the early days of the co-operative movement at the end of the last century and at the beginning of this century.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on to a good thing, <Col N="104" /> something which could be a seed for infinitely more important developments on a larger plain, if he asks his Department to see if there is some way of encouraging this development of energy co-operatives in localities &mdash; small towns, big towns or stretches of countryside.  I do not care what name they are given or whether it is in Irish or English.  The kind of job a co-operative like that would do, and make money out of but not immediately, would be to conduct an energy consumption audit in the population of their locality and find out the total consumption of energy of all kinds &mdash; driving cars, lighting and heating houses, the operation of machinery and so on.  Does that total seem excessive having taken the physical features into account by comparison with the national average?  Is there any way of reducing it?  They could also organise conservation efforts informally and in a way those people best understand because they are on the ground.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister or his Department or any of the organs which have taken an interest in energy conservation, but a committee of a locality trying to decide how they could spare energy in all its forms in their own area would probably produce better results.</P>
    <P>Another operation which the energy co-operative could carry out would be the gradual acquisition of marginal land and planting it with timber.  I realise that biomass work is at an experimental stage and I am not flying away with great expectations of what biomass will deliver in terms of the generation of electricity through combustion.  Some elements of forestry will increasingly contribute in that regard as the years go by and all forestry development, whether it is the rapidly growing species which will renew themselves every three or four years and which can be socially consumed, or conventional forestry, which still throws off a substantial proportion of biomass waste, it cannot be the case that development of that kind will not have a certain energy value.  Energy co-operatives of this kind could audit or review the physical characteristics of a district to see whether they lend themselves to the kind of small-scale, almost one-farm-sized, <Col N="105" /> hydrodevelopment in which the ESB are now taking an interest.  For the execution of such projects a small-scale hydro plant is now being built and the relevant semi-State bodies should get into the business of developing for sale to other countries.  The object of a small-scale hydrodevelopment of this kind would be to sell electricity into the national grid and receive payment from the ESB.</P>
    <P>The same energy co-operative could make sure that not a speck of combustible waste in the locality is uselessly burnt.  In every district at least one heating plant should be such as could be fuelled by combustible waste.  There is at least one big store in this city which obtains all its heating by burning every morning all the waste packaging from the products which they sell.</P>
    <P>Probably there are many other things which a technically more expert mind than mine would identify as being possibilities for an energy co-operative.  I urge the Minister to consider the possibility of voluntary effort, particularly on the part of teenagers who are very open to popular ideas about trying to conserve energy and contribute to the national effort, the success of which will put further away the day when we may be forced into some form of nuclear development, little though we may like it.  Young people will contribute voluntary effort to some of these unrewarding and crummy duties such as collecting waste.  I emphasised that this form of effort ought not to be despised or thought beneath notice.  Ni neart go cur le chéile, as the motto of my party has it.  While one effort in a small locality will not have any impact on the national scene, a dense network of such energy co-operative throughout the country, even in areas which are not bog development areas, could make a substantial impact.  I promise that if the Minister takes any interest in this matter I will give him all the support I can and I am sure I speak for my party in that.</P>
    <P>There are a few points arising on the text of this Bill to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  Some of them appear to be a bit questionable and I should like a week or two to put down amendments, unless I have Misunderstood <Col N="106" /> something which can be pointed out in the Minister's reply.  The Bill makes a claim that the grants which the board will be empowered to make will be for development and it does not specify that a developer must himself acquire machinery or anything of that kind.  The Minister made clear in his speech that the development grants will be grants towards the overall cost and he has specifically envisaged the use of contractors.  Does he envisage that the board, who have themselves pioneered the development of very sophisticated bog machinery, will expand their own manufacturing operations in that regard so as to provide for what must ultimately be an enhanced demand for such machinery?  He is, after all, speaking of increasing production, via private participation, from 1 million tons to 1.5 million in a year.  That must imply a very considerable mass of new bog plant and machinery. The Minister said this would not happen immediately but I should like to know whether he envisages the expansion of the board's own operations into the machinery manufacturing business so that it will not have to be imported from abroad, if there are other countries which make machinery suitable for the work here which the Bord na Móna machinery now does.</P>
    <P>In section 2(3) the Bill contains provision regarding a case where the board propose to refuse an application.  In such a case the application will be referred to the Minister who, along with a committee, will constitute a kind of court appeal. I can see the sense in that and I hope the board are not offended by it.  The criterion mentioned in subsection (3) seems excessively vague.  The application may be refused in the first instance if the development would to a significant extent be detrimental to the development of bogland by the board.  In what way detrimental?  I do not expect the Minister to go into any great detail about this but we might expect to hear what kind of practice would lead the board to decide that the proposed development would to a significant extent be detrimental to their own operations.  I do not see anything sinister in that vagueness but it would be <Col N="107" /> no harm, even for the board's own guidance to spell out what the Minister will regard as reasonable grounds for refusing.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know whether the Minister envisages that a grant made under this Bill will be recoverable in the event of its being squandered, misapplied or diverted.  I presume this must be guarded against to some extent by the provision which enables the board to attach terms and conditions to the making of a grant and it may be that the Minister intends that the grant will be paid in instalments as work progressed. It seems that the Bill as it stands contains no express provision for actually recovering from a person who has received a grant money which has been misapplied or for which value has not been obtained. I accept that every time we make a grant for a national purpose we are taking a risk.  This Bill will involve quite a lot of money and for that reason the risk should be minimised.  Either the machinery for making the grant, perhaps in instalments when the bulk of the work has been completed should be made plain in the Bill or the Minister ought to include a provision specifically for the recovery of money which has been misspent.</P>
    <P>Section 6(2)(a) entitles the board to refuse a grant and that refusal, as far as I understand it, is not a subject to appeal to the Minister in the form in which the other refusal might have been.  The board can refuse a grant where the application relates to bog which the board prior to receiving the application had decided to acquire or considered acquiring.  If the board had decided to acquire it it would presumably be on written record so that it could be shown to the Minister but there is no certainty in regard to considering to acquire a bog.  Would it be enough if a board official told the Minister that they had had their eye on that land for years and that they were thinking of taking it over?  If the Minister's intention is to streamline the operation of this new scheme he should leave out this provision which unless it is construed with extreme goodwill and diligence on all sides would allow the board to sit on <Col N="108" /> private development perhaps because of pressure of work or some other reason which allowed them to stifle its development because they had been unable to make a decision for a long time as to whether or not to acquire it.  If the board want a bog they should decide to acquire it.  But if the Minister thinks that is too tough on the board, the board should at least be required to produce some kind of concrete evidence that they are seriously considering and are actively progressing along those lines and that it is not simply a thought that flashed through somebody's mind a year or two ago.</P>
    <P>The expression in section 7(2) is bad English.  To say &ldquo;shall be comprised of&rdquo; is not correct.  The committee appointed under the section shall either consist of or shall be composed of but &ldquo;comprised of&rdquo; is not a good usage.  I am not an expert so perhaps I am wrong about this.</P>
    <P>I thank the board for the most interesting experience which they made possible for some colleagues and myself not long before Christmas when they kindly arranged for us to see the biomass experiment and the briquette factory at Clonsast.  I was deeply impressed by the evident efficiency of the board's operations so far as these two sites revealed then and I am grateful for their courtesy and the way in which the board's personnel were willing to take time off to explain what was going on.</P>
    <P>The biomass experiment, even to somebody as technically backward as I, has to work, and something tells me that it will be a success.  Even though the experiment is on a small scale it is laid out in such a way that it is possible to see which varieties are doing better than expected, which are doing well and which are failing.  That is as an experiment should be.  There is something about the look of that cut-away bog covered with the varieties of elders, willow and so on which cries out that from this form of bog exploitation important resources will eventually accrue to us and that the thing will be a success.  I hope the Minister in producing this Bill will bear in mind that either himself or his successor will have to incorporate the statutory authority to make grants for bog development proposals, <Col N="109" /> and also statutory authority to make grants for biomass proposals on areas of cut-away bog.  I and my party support the measure and wish the board every possible success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, in my constituency, many bogs of the type the Minister referred to.  These smaller type bogs were not viable for Bord na Móna to develop. I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on his tour throughout the country in an effort to educate the people on the energy needs and cost of energy.  It is frightening to think that the energy cost of this year will be £1 billion.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.  It is an effort to cut back on the huge export of £1 billion each year for energy.  The Minister will face many difficulties but he is well aware of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency the Littleton briquette factory will open shortly and when it is in full production it will contribute considerably to the national energy needs.  Over the years Bord na Móna have made great strides in their efforts to produce enough energy but this Bill will cover boglands which were never viable for Bord na Móna and I welcome it. However, there are many problems one of which is the accessibility of bogs.  Many of the bogs in my constituency have not been worked since the emergency when an emergency force worked there to produce our needs because due to the war we could not import coal.  The bogs are still viable but the roads are not there. The Minister referred to the local improvements scheme operated by the Department of the Environment.  That scheme is in operation but if the Minister's plan to develop the bogs is to be successful the money towards these schemes will have to be increased considerably.  There will be a substantial investment in machinery but the main concern is the condition of the roads.  On foot of a Bord na Móna survey in my area it was found that the greater portion of the bogland is not serviced by roads of a sufficient standard.  These roads will have to be improved especially when we consider the type of machinery that will be needed.  This will require considerable <Col N="110" /> finance.  Much more money than is provided now will be needed for these local improvements schemes if the Minister is to be successful in getting this scheme off the ground.  In my area there is a great interest in the idea in the Bill but unfortunately people have found that the money required to develop the roads into the bogs is not available.</P>
    <P>There is a need for liaison between the Minister's Department and the Department of the Environment to ensure that in future budgets, when this Bill is implemented cognisance will be taken of the need for additional and substantial moneys to enable groups of people who are prepared to develop bogland and contribute to the national energy grid to have the resources to provide access roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the board will administer the grants scheme and will have full discretion except in a situation where a conflict of interest between the board and the applicant might be a consideration.</P>
    <P>I accept that Bord na Móna are the natural body to carry out the scheme, but to ensure the success of the Bill there must be the maximum liaison with county engineers, county council development officers, agricultural committees and rural organisations.  I know several groups who have come together in my area and who are prepared to produce turf to an extent which will contribute to the national needs.  In my constituency we have had long discussions at county council level about this matter.  In the past few years energy costs went out of control and looking around us, we could see the untouched bogland which was not viable for development by Bord na Móna.  It was too big a task for the local small holders or cottiers to develop it.</P>
    <P>The first necessity is accessibility.  A big investment will be needed in machinery afterwards.  Unless the local improvements schemes are given sufficient money to develop these roads, we will be wasting our time.  In my constituency groups of people, co-operatives and rural organisations will welcome this Bill.  Money is a problem, but my top priority is accessibility to the bogs.  After that the local <Col N="111" /> people will contribute to making a substantial reduction in oil imports by the development of small bogs.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, mar le roinnt bliain tá muintir na tuatha ag lorg cabhair airgid chun na bóithre chuig na portacha a fheabhsú.  Like other speakers I welcome this Bill.  Since the oil crisis hit us, people in rural areas have been clamouring for turf development.  At every county council and regional development meeting the question of bog development has been raised.  When oil was cheap, 90 per cent of the people in rural Ireland switched over from solid fuel to oil for heating and cooking.  It was a much cleaner fuel for cooking and heating.  The tide has now turned.  We saw the mad rush for grants for conversion from oil to solid fuels.  I am sorry those grants were discontinued because only those who applied early on got the benefit of them.  Some help in this direction is needed.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill gets a speedy passage. The Minister wants to get it enacted before the next turf-cutting season.  The bones of the Bill are very simple.  It will be administered by Bord na Móna.  There must be a proper development plan.  In some areas there are hundreds of acres of bog which are not viable for development by Bord na Móna but which could be developed by local co-operatives.  The plan will ensure that these stretches of bog will not be ruined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most necessary development is the provision of access roads and drainage. We have roads which need to be improved, but because turf was not cut for the past 15 years the drains have become clogged.  In many areas drainage is the only problem.  When the Bill was mooted many of us were surprised because we did not hear enough about the involvement of county engineers, county managers and county councillors. The Minister has dispelled any doubts we may have had.  He said that persons at local level with knowledge and experience in connection with bog development will have a role in the administration of the scheme.  He said he has in mind <Col N="112" /> county engineers, county development teams and others with acquired expertise. He went on:</P>
    <P>Specifically, I see this expertise as being of particular immediate value to the board in regard to the examination of bog development plans and perhaps even in the preparation of such plans. I have, therefore, included a provision in the Bill which enables the board to appoint persons to examine and approve, or indeed in some case prepare bog development plans.</P>
    <P>That is a very important statement.  One such person should be nominated in each council area to take complete responsibility.  Otherwise the scheme will not get off the ground as fast as we should like. I have an area in mind where a group of people have formed a co-operative.  In this group there will be about 600 people and there will be turf for at least 20 years when this area is developed.  There are other areas where there might be only 50 to 60 people.  To a certain degree they will be groping in the dark.  I should like to see a special engineer in charge of small sections like that.</P>
    <P>Minor works will not need a plan.  They can get an exemption from Bord na Móna.  Everybody will welcome that. There is one contentious issue and I hope we will hear something from the Minister about it, that is, the planting of virgin bogs.  It was all right when we had a surplus of cheap oil to use bogland for planting when it was not being used for turf cutting.  The forestry people have done great work.  We compliment them, but at the same time we would ask the Minister to try to freeze the planting of virgin bog until such time as it has been cut away.  We cannot stand by while hundreds of tons of fuel go to waste at a time when people are clamouring for bogs to cut.  Available bogs should be handed out for local development and the Department should restrict planting to areas of cutaway bog.  Peat is a fine source of energy during the crisis we will have with us until the energy source other than imported oil has been developed.</P>
    <P>Again I compliment the Minister on this Bill.  We have all been asking for action in this field, but now we are wondering <Col N="113" /> how quickly the turf can be got out of the ground.  I can assure the Minister of the wholehearted co-operation of county councils and their managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister on the Bill.  In the west and north-west particularly we have been talking about this sort of action for years because we have seen the tremendous potential of our wastelands &mdash; I am sure the Minister in his travels in the country realised that great potential.  It makes one shudder to think of our enormous bills to foreign oil producers when we realise the vast reserves of turf undeveloped within our shores.</P>
      <P>I have a few criticisms and points of clarification which I will put to the Minister and to which I hope he will reply. To be realistic, what the Minister is talking about is a 60 per cent grant to co-operatives and a 45 per cent grant to private bog developers.  When he refers to &ldquo;co-operatives&rdquo; does the Minister mean groups formed in the same way as those in the farm modernisation scheme under which three, four or more farmers will get together to cut bog?  All people from the poor areas in the west and north-west realise that we have not got there co-operatives in the generally accepted use of the term.  I hope the Minister is not referring to properly registered co-operatives.  He did not make it clear, as far as I am concerned, whether this 60 per cent grant will be given to three, four, or more farmers who get together to form local groups.  If the Minister has been referring to big co-operatives he is making a mistake because they will not utilise the bogs to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>The 45 per cent grant will not appeal to most of the people I can think of who might be inclined to cut turf because they would have to make up the vast balance of 55 per cent and many small farmers, most of whom are on unemployment assistance as a back-up, would not have the finance to avail of such grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bord na Móna officers go to view the bogs I hope they will allow a certain amount for development work because we must appreciate that wages <Col N="114" /> will have to be paid for this work, particularly where bogs are in a bad state and not easy to develop.  Some of those bogs should have been cut years ago.  The Minister's idea is to encourage people to cut more bog.  It is probably the first good idea we have seen from Fianna Fáil in a long time.  The Minister is on the right track and we hope he will not make it impracticable for small farmers to avail of these grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about a plan, the requirement to submit a plan.  We are dealing with simple people and all they will understand is a simple plan to show the area of bog they intend to cut.  Now is the time to spell out all these things because none of us wants to see complicated plans being required from the small farmers.  There are too many such plans, such as planning permissions and so forth.  What should be required is a simple application form giving full name and address, the area and the site plan of the bog in question.  If such application forms are simple the response will be much greater.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about 1.1 million hectares of waste land in the country, that is, 3.3 million acres of bogland that can be developed in areas which are no good for anything else.  The Minister spoke briefly of commonage.  A person who buys a turf-cutting machine for, say, £6,000, will get 60 per cent of the purchase price but he could run into difficulty if he begins to cut commonage bog of which there would be joint owners.  I should like clarification on what such a man would be entitled to because there are many problems in the west and north-west in regard to commonages. There might be 30 owners but perhaps only five or six people would be willing to cut turf on a commonage.  The others could object if a man wanted to take in a machine, though the owners might be living in Dublin or Glasgow.  It is not a simple matter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider at a later stage taking over turf banks that have not been cut say within a three-year period and allocating them to people who would make use of them.  The Department of Lands own a considerable <Col N="115" /> amount of bogland that is not being utilised.  It is quite common to have up to 100 people looking for turf banks but the Department are not making such land available to them.  I hope the Minister will use his influence in such instances and ensure that the Department make the land available to local people.</P>
    <P>All of us are concerned about the amount of oil and turf being imported. People in small towns and villages know the value of peat and they should be encouraged to cut as much turf as is possible.  Contractors should cut turf and sell it to their customers in towns and villages, as is done in the case of coal.  I hope the Minister will deal with those points in his reply.</P>
    <P>There is no point in introducing a scheme like this unless the grants are made attractive and in my opinion the 45 per cent grant is not an attractive proposition.  One way around this matter is for three or more people to get together to cut turf and they could be called a co-operative.  Their labour should be taken into account in determining the amount of grant.  My major complaint is that the grant is too small.  The kind of people we are trying to encourage with regard to this scheme will not have finance of their own.</P>
    <P>Land owned by the Department should be made available to the people.  In addition, considerable work should be done on roads leading to bogs.  There are many such bog roads in western areas and for the hundreds of people who cut turf the 45 per cent grant is not sufficient. If they were given a grant of 60 per cent and if account were taken of the labour element some progress could be made on road work.</P>
    <P>The idea behind this scheme is right but the amount of grant is not sufficient. We should not forget that the people we are talking about do not have resources of their own.  If the suggestions I have put forward are adopted, in five or six years time the Minister of the day will be able to say this was a good scheme and it should be expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate <Col N="116" /> the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It meets a definite need in regard to the production of energy and also the development of rural areas.  The Minister mentioned that upwards of 800 jobs would be provided but I think he was being too modest in stating that figure. As the scheme develops I am sure the number will increase.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker mentioned the tour undertaken by the Minister regarding energy conservation.  He generated an awareness among the public of the need to conserve energy.  One worry I have is with regard to the extent to which private interests and individuals will avail of the facilities provided.  Bord na Móna are the only organisation involved in turf production.  The exception was during the time of emergency in the forties when local authorities were engaged in turf production.  The lack of expertise in the production and handling of large quantities of turf at that time left people wary about going into turf production in a large way.  I am rather concerned that large organisations may fight shy of becoming involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to involvement by local authorities.  It is important that they be involved in bog development and in work on the roads serving the bogs. Bord na Móna should operate pilot schemes in areas where it is anticipated that there might be private development subsequently.  This would be particularly important in my constituency where there is no Bord na Móna involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be difficult to praise Bord na Móna adequately for their work during the years.  Their work has been a prime example of how Irish skills can be successful.  However, I can see the development of the proposals put forward by the Minister as quite different from any of the massive operations carried out to date by Bord na Móna.  This scheme will help areas where the bogs have only been partially developed.  It will be of special help to areas that have not benefited directly as a result of Bord na Móna operations.  The local authorities should shoulder part of the burden.  Their initial involvement in the drainage and provision of roads will be essential.  I hope that <Col N="117" /> private interests will move in afterwards and share the burden.</P>
    <P>Local authorities with their engineering and technical staffs should be well placed to develop bog roads.  They are involved in making roads.  While the county councils can channel money from the local improvement schemes for the development of roads and drainage, in County Monaghan and in County Cavan they have so many applicants that it would be impossible to do this.  In County Monaghan we have over 400 applicants. It would not be feasible to divert that money from the local improvement schemes, so it is not likely that money will be available from those schemes for either drainage or road making.</P>
    <P>There is adequate road material available near bogland areas, especially those in mountain regions.  A lot of shale and rock can be found in those areas.  The county councils could use this.  Deputy Kelly referred to the utilisation of waste materials.  There is a lot of thinnings and forest waste in general which could be used.  There is an area in north County Monaghan where there are roughly 2,000 acres of virgin bog.  This bogland has never been developed because the roadways were only made a certain distance. The turf was harvested by the county council and later by local farmers.  This area is along the Border and there are large forests in the area.  Some of the thinnings from those forest areas could be used in generating plants.  Energy is costing a lot of money at the moment but there are millions of tons of forest thinnings and forest waste in many parts of Europe which is not used even by local people for firewood.  Something should be done about this.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the biomass scheme by Bord na Móna.  When bogs are harvested biomass production could take place.  It has been accepted in many European countries that elders and sallies can be grown in such areas.  Bord na Móna should put on an exhibition of the type of plant and equipment they have available for bog development.  As well as exhibiting turf-cutting machinery they should also show drainage equipment <Col N="118" /> and trailers and tractors which can be used in bog work.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about draining bogs but there is not that problem in mountain areas.  There is not the same problem with regard to outfall as in lowland bogs.  The most important thing required in mountain bogs is roads.  An examination should be made of all the unharvested bogs throughout the country.  There are many areas in the west where under the farm modernisation schemes a lot of drainage can be carried out.  It is important to assess the amount of turbary which is available.  Coal now costs £5 a hundredweight, so turf development is very important.  We now find that many people who have bogs of their own are very anxious to develop them.  I hope more people will become involved in turf development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister is on the right line in so far as he is ensuring the development of areas in which Bord na Móna up to now have not shown any interest.  I hope the provisions of this Bill will result in the opening up of large tracts of bog which for a variety of reasons Bord na Móna did not see fit to develop &mdash; perhaps because the pockets were too small for their type of development or because the depth of bog was not suitable for their operations.  There may be many reasons why Bord na Móna have not moved into certain sections of bog all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill shows beyond doubt that the era of cheap imported fuel is over.  We are very fortunate that we have this resource available.  I was amazed when the Minister told us that there were 1.1 million hectares of undeveloped bogland.  I did not realise there was this area of undeveloped bogland until I saw it in the interim report of the interdepartmental committee on cutaway bogs.  One cannot but be struck by the potential of the area of bogland we have.  That same report states that only one-third of the area has been developed by Bord na Móna to the extent that fuel has been extracted while the remaining two-thirds is left undeveloped.  In <Col N="119" /> addition, as I said we also have 1.1 million hectares of undeveloped bog.</P>
    <P>Like every other Bill introduced here this one does not indicate that everything in the garden is rosy.  There are a number of things I hope the Minister will look at and take corrective action on when detailed discussion of the provisions takes place on Committee Stage.  It may sound generous to give 60 per cent grants in certain circumstances.  Those who have read annual reports of Bord na Móna know that attention has always been drawn to the enormous cost of bog development from the time drainage is commenced to the time the finished product is extracted.  There is a substantial input of capital necessary initially before one can see any project being fruitful.  When one looks at that amount of work the level of grant is not so generous.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider the question of the level of grant, 45 per cent, applicable to cases other than a qualified society, which I assume is a co-op.  The 45 per cent grant categories include individuals or qualifed companies.  I am aware of individuals in my constituency, which, fortunately, has a lot of bogland, who are interested in purchasing fairly substantial tracts of bog and this Bill will help them enormously.  However, where two or three people are prepared to come together to purchase large tracts of bog it is unfair that the grant in such cases should be 15 per cent below that which applies to a co-op.  Those people are engaged in the same type of development.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told the House that the provisions of the Bill are to encourage the establishment of co-operative socities.  That is a good thing and I do not have any objection to that, but there are many cases and places where this kind of co-operative approach may be impossible for a variety of reasons.  The straw that may break the camels back in such cases may be the difference between the 45 per cent and 60 per cent grant.  The Minister should try to remove that anomaly when he comes to finalising the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of other factors may deter <Col N="120" /> development.  For example, under section 4 an application for a development grant must be accompanied by a plan indicating the bog development to which the application relates.  That plan must be in such form and contain such information as the board may require.  That all depends, as Deputy White stated, on the amount of information the board may require.  What type of plan must an applicant submit?  How sophisticated must it be?</P>
    <P>Because of the capital input and slow return until the end product becomes available for sale if individuals, small companies or co-operatives are expected to produce grandiose plans of a sophisticated nature to satisfy the requirements of Bord na Móna they will be deterred from participating in such development. That is not envisaged in the Bill, which seeks to encourage the development of bogs by private enterprise as opposed to a semi-State type of operation.</P>
    <P>In pointing to another problem that may arise &mdash; hopefully it will not &mdash; I do not wish my remarks to be interpreted in the wrong way.  Down the years Bord na Móna have done a fantastic job and provided employment for upwards of 7,000 people.  The board have also saved the country an enormous amount of money by providing native fuel.  They have carried out their function admirably, and the programme of expansion in relation to the acquisition and development of additional bogland is ahead of target.  However, because of the nature of their development down the years the board have become selfish in relation to the acquisition of bogland.  If the board were to be successful, that was one of the characteristics they had to express.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if under this Bill a company, a co-operative society or an individual will have an opportunity of gaining possession of what Bord na Móna regard as viable pieces of bog property with adequate depth of bog to produce turf for those involved.  The areas I refer to are on the periphery of bogs that are being developed by the board at present. There are many such locations. Hundreds of thousands of acres have not been touched by the board although they <Col N="121" /> are situated on the periphery of their development work.  I am thinking of the development at Bellacorick.  I should like to know if an individual or a company can acquire sections of such bog for development.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day my fear would be that applicants for bog development under this Bill would be left with tracts of bog not too attractive in relation to the kind of operation that is needed.  For example, they might not have the requisite depth, or there might be difficulty with drainage and so on.  It is important that Bord na Móna &mdash; here I am sure the Minister will impress on them and that they will react in the right way &mdash; realise the need to operate under this Bill with all the goodwill in the world towards the people who will approach them for tracts of bog.  Secondly, I hope the kind of development plans needed will not be of a type that will frighten or deter people from getting involved in these development projects in order to produce fuel.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister has included both drainage and road building as part of the development plan but might I put a small point to him in relation to these?  Speaking as a member of a local authority, the local improvements scheme &mdash; to which the Minister referred &mdash; undertakes drainage to some extent and, to a larger extent, road building.  It is well known &mdash; and I say this against myself as a member of a local authority &mdash; that in any county where the local improvements scheme operates this work can be done much more cheaply by a private contractor because of all the bureaucracy involved in a local authority operation, be that in relation to drainage or road building.  I would ask the Minister to examine this question and at least consider the implementation of a pilot scheme in relation to road building and drainage under which he would not automatically hand over road building to the local authority in the area.  He might at least establish how the costings would bear up as against the same task undertaken by a private contractor.  Naturally standards must be applied and adhered to and, at the end of the day, the local authority would lay down these standards. <Col N="122" />  For maintenance purposes and so on I would hope that these would become local authority roads subject to grants from the Department of the Environment.  The same would apply to drainage. We should examine the saving that might be effected by having drainage undertaken by a private contractor.  Such would generate employment and I hope that would prove to be the case under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I might mention one point that came across in a Minister's speech in relation to the difficulty of estimating the expenditure involved under this Bill, when enacted.  The Minister said it was difficult to estimate, that it was dependent on the number of applicants who became eligible for grants under the provisions of the Bill.  I can foresee a situation arising in which Bord na Móna, through severe scrutiny of plans and so on and the strict application of certain regulations, could keep the number of eligible applicants to a minimum and dictate the amount of money required in any given year.  I would hope it would operate from the other end.  While appreciating that at present one cannot estimate the amount of money that would be needed, for example, this year, or for the first year of the operation of the Bill, a certain amount of money should be made available, a minimum amount, which should be topped up in accordance with the increased number of applicants that would come on stream rather than have the amount of money applied relating to the number of eligible applicants from the other end.  In that event one would be allowing the board to dictate the amount of money spent regardless of what the Minister and his colleagues might feel ought to be spent.</P>
    <P>This Bill should prove to be a very worthwhile one.  Hopefully it will bring into use a massive area of this country at present lying fallow.  It will provide energy, hopefully cutting down substantially on the amount of money we must spend on imported fuel.  For that reason it is a very good Bill.  I would ask the Minister to examine the few points I have raised.  I can assure him that he will have the co-operation of this side of the House <Col N="123" /> in having the Bill put through the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief because this is a Bill into which one can go in more detail on Committee Stage.  I congratulate the Minister on its introduction and on all he is doing at present to provide alternative energy so that we will not be so dependent on oil.  Hardly a day passes without his researching other ways of generating energy.  Of course our bogs come to mind immediately.  I would differ with Deputy O'Toole on the question of allowing the same grants to companies to buy up bogs or to co-operatives who would be the actual owners.  I should like to see our bogs properly developed under this Bill.  Many bogs not at present developed are owned by farmers, shopkeepers and others around the country.  These bogs have been destroyed through the improper cutting of the turf.  In years gone past the Land Commission allocated, say, 500 or 1,000 yards of frontage of a bog to perhaps ten, 12, 15 or 20 people.  Five of those people may have cut turf on it and the remainder may not, the result being that, when one progressed three or four banks in, the turf could not be cut at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat wary about Bord na Móna being too elaborate in their development thereby frightening off the ordinary individual.  There must be an organised development of our bogs.  To date, our bogs have been destroyed because of this practice of cutting a bit here and there.  The result is that water is retained in the middle.  Bord na Móna will develop the larger bogs.  Indeed, in passing I might say that they do not pay anything like a reasonable price for such bogs. However, the Bill has to do with bogs not suitable for development by Bord na Móna, many of which are held by private individuals.  As the Minister said, there is a problem in regard to the title of bogs. Indeed, if one were to go into that question one would be left without any Bill. In the west there are old banks of bog acquired originally from the Land Commission and owned by a number of individuals.  I should like to see those individuals <Col N="124" /> forming a co-operative society.  I would not like to see such individuals being got at by any private company, with a cheque book, going out to buy up their bogs as cheaply as Bord na Móna are doing, developing them and in turn selling the turf back to them.</P>
    <P>At present those smaller people cannot cut turf in those bogs because they are not drained and there are no roads through them.  The people have to buy from Bord na Móna turf which is needed for factories and other areas for which energy is needed.  So I am trying to get it across to the people in my constituency in Galway that it would be much better for the people who own the bogs to come together and form a co-operative and get a 60 per cent grant.  I would even like the grant to be higher for that sort of development.  But I would not be keen to see speculators with plenty of money buying up the bogs from small farmers and small businessmen and so on and getting the same grant.  If I am right, the principle behind the Bill is that people who now have to go to Bord na Móna to buy turf will be able to develop their own bogs.  If the speculators are allowed in we are going to end up with three or four Bord na Mónas and I would not like to see that happen.  The purpose of the Bill is to give the ordinary turf producer an opportunity to do it properly.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, if a co-operative is formed Bord na Móna will have the administration of the scheme.  I do not know how that will work and I have certain reservations about it.  I know Bord na Móna should be involved as advisers because it is important to advise people.  But a certain amount of money could be channeled through the county councils to make roads.  I et us suppose a grant of 60 per cent is paid to about 30 people who come together to develop bogs.  Bord na Móna come along with their machines and tell them how to cut them.  I understand there will be grants for machines as well as for roads and drains.  But who is going to make the roads?  I would like the Minister to clarify that.  In other words, who does what when a scheme is laid out and roads must be provided and drains made and <Col N="125" /> machines got?  Do the co-operatives give the making of the roads to whoever they like or is there to be a grant to the county council to make the roads as laid out by Bord na Móna when laying out the bog? I would like some more details on this.</P>
    <P>This Bill is badly needed.  It is a shame to see what is happening at present with machines being hired out from the Sugar Company and various other people and brought into a bog, and when a person sees a handy place to cut a bit of turf he cuts it, and the result is that there are a lot of lakes in the middle and there is no such thing as leaving the bog in such a condition that land could be made of it afterwards.  I never agreed with the idea of developing a 16 or 18 foot virgin bog to grow crops because if there was a wet year it would be flooded and if there was a dry year and the drains were too deep nothing could be grown because the turf would be too dry.  But cutaway bog, cut down to about three or four feet from the bottom of the bog, could be reasonably well developed.  So it is important that if we go into bog development in a big way, it will be done in such a planned way that the bog will be left afterwards in such a condition as to be of some use.  The land around most of these bogs is comprised of small farms and when the bogs are cut away they could be a great addition if they were left in a reasonable condition where the drains have a reasonable distance between them, as is done by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I would like to go into this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  We have to sell this Bill.  It will not be hard to sell it because turf is very dear now.  Many farmers, shopkeepers and business people who have bogs will go in and develop them and will not have to buy turf needed for other businesses from Bord na Móna. This is what I think the Bill is going to do and I will be very disappointed if it is not a success.  I have some reservations about handing the scheme over to Bord na Móna who might well make all sorts of conditions before they will approve of the scheme.  But there must be some control and the bogs must be developed in an orderly way.  This Bill can be discussed <Col N="126" /> on Committee Stage without making a political football out of it and I am sure the Minister for Energy will accept any constructive amendments put forward.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one of the most important Bills to come before this House because of the price of energy at the moment. The Minister is to be congratulated on the efforts he is making to get an alternative source of energy to oil.  We have the bogs, a huge amount of undeveloped bog.  It is going to take time to get the co-operatives going and very little is going to happen this year.  So in the case of places where people are cutting turf already and the turf often cannot be taken out because of water.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider giving some type of grant to the county councils to make roads into those bogs so that the turf can be taken out without having to drain the bog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean to improve existing roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are people all over the country cutting turf in bogs which have bad roads and no drainage. The Minister should consider giving a grant to the county councils to improve the roads in bogs that are being used at the moment so that the turf can be taken out without having to drain the bog.</P>
      <P>The LIS was referred to.  Preference has not been given to bog roads and the amount of LIS money being spent in my county on bog roads is small.  If one builds an LIS road where there are farms involved, payment is in accordance with valuation.  If one builds an LIS road going into a bog one does it at only 10 per cent, and the same goes for drains.  However, it would not create much impression because the roads that are being done under the LIS are going into land and to houses and afterwards they are made public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not much more to say on the Bill at the moment.  I will be very interested in Committee Stage because people have been asking me about the Bill.  I have spoken with a lot of people about this bog business and some points came up.  People were afraid that the Bord na <Col N="127" /> Móna process would be very elaborate, that they would have to go to a lot of expense for grants and that the contributions they would have to put up themselves would be very high, perhaps 40 per cent.  Secondly, they wondered whether some grants would be given in the initial stage for those people who are already users of the bogs and who have very bad bog roads.  Why are co-operatives being formed in regard to the bogs that are not being used?  Would anything be done with the bogs that are being used at the moment that could be done through the local authorities giving the grants?  The Minister mentioned the engineers of the county councils and they could be used because they are well qualified to look after this.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Bill should be and is welcomed by every side of the House.  I believe that when it is fully discussed on Committee Stage we will have a good Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on everything he is doing to try to get away from expensive energy sources such as oil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The introduction of this Bill at this time is very opportune indeed and I would like to join with the other speakers who have welcomed the Bill and complimented the Minister on introducing it.  I say it is opportune now because one of our problems in the country at present &mdash; not the only one &mdash; is the cost of energy.  Most of our energy, by far the greater percentage of it, is imported at a price that makes its use nearly prohibitive, whether it is coal or oil.  Therefore, in my opinion it has become economic once more to exploit our own native fuel, turf and the bogs.  Over the years, when oil was available for practically nothing compared with its present price and when coal was reasonably priced comparatively speaking, it was not an economic proposition to use turf as a fuel.  It was not economic to develop the bogs and in many cases to draw the turf long distances.  Many people who harvested turf for their own use had to draw it several miles.  All that has changed and it is economic to exploit and develop our own <Col N="128" /> bogs, and that should be done.  It is up to us as a nation to cut down the cost of imported energy as much as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>Many people were caught in the trap ten years ago or thereabouts of building new houses and providing oil-fired central heating and electricity for cooking. These things have become exceptionally dear at present and I think it was a retrograde step on the part of the Government to cancel the grants which were available for the conversion of heating systems from oil to solid fuel.  People who in all good faith built houses and installed oil-fired central heating were entitled to assistance from the Government in switching over from that type of central heating which then became very expensive.  It was wrong that the grants should have been terminated.  Maybe it was necessary to adjust them but the Government simply axed them without any alternative or amendment and that was a very bad day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to another few things that I want to say about the Bill I would like to express the very sincere hope that the introduction of this Bill at this time would not have the effect of cutting back on turf production this year as I fear it will.  The Bill is now going through the House and by the time it gets through Seanad Éireann and Bord na Móna get authority to operate it, I am afraid we will be well into the summer.  I know from a brief discussion that I and a constituent had with the Minister for Energy on his tour to promote energy conservation that the Minister is of the opinion that the introduction of this Bill will not in any way prejudice the other grants which have been available and which were being operated by the Central Development Committee quite successfully.  My information is that already applicants for grants and promoters of turf production are being advised that everything is virtually at a standstill until the Bill goes ahead.  I am giving that information, which I consider I have on reliable authority, and I am urging the Minister to see to it tomorrow morning that this policy is stopped and that people who produced turf last year and are producing <Col N="129" /> it this year if they get road grants will be told to go ahead, will get the green light.</P>
    <P>This Bill properly operated could do a lot for the production of fuel in this country.  Indeed, Bord na Móna have over the years done a very good job and have produced a very good commodity in turf briquettes.  But it is a fact that Bord na Móna are not able to meet the demand on them for either briquettes or turf, and that is the complaint that I have been getting from people who wanted to purchase ordinary turf over the last couple of years.  Bord na Móna advertised that they were accepting orders and then closed the list on very short notice.  The fact is that Bord na Móna over the last few years are not able to meet the demand upon them.  I was rather surprised to see that the capacity of the new briquette factory at Littleton, County Tipperary, will be 130,000 tons.  Frankly, I regard that as comparatively small for a national production agency.  A small co-operative in my own constituency told me that last year, in their first year of production, they produced 7,000 tons of turf.  This year they hope to produce 14,000 tons if they get the grant to continue the road.  If one compares 14,000 tons from a little co-operative in County Cavan &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> No, they are producing the best of turf.  At the same time, 14,000 tons of turf is formidable when one compares it with 120,000 tons of briquettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to make grants of 60 per cent to a qualified co-operative society and 45 per cent in any other case.  The Minister should make a grant of 60 per cent to every applicant who is qualified. It is difficult to see the merit of the co-operative society as against a partnership or a few people coming together.  I was not here for the Minister's opening speech and I do not know if he spelled out the virtues of the co-operative as against the private individual.  If he did not do so, he should spell it out for us. One of the reasons for the production of <Col N="130" /> turf falling off was because of the cost of making roads into bogs to get turf out and the cost of drainage.  They are costs of a capital nature and I am glad they are covered here.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Callanan pointed out, there are two categories of roads &mdash; the access roads which are there for decades, perhaps generations, leading into the bogs which have fallen into complete disrepair over the years.  They would need a considerable amount of money spent on them.  There is no point in talking about county councils doing that at present, because from the allocation of funds to them in the estimates, there is no possible way they could do so.  They are not national primary or secondary roads or roads for which local authorities get direct grants.  If they are to be repaired it will have to paid for out of the 12 per cent increase allocated to the county councils this year, which is totally inadequate.  I hope the Minister has some plans for the repairing of these public roads, apart from the roads leading into the bogs. It has been suggested that the local improvements scheme could be used.  As Deputy Callanan also said &mdash; he has a wide knowledge of rural Ireland &mdash; funds from that scheme are not available for this.  The counties in which there is the biggest demand on the local improvements scheme for making access roads into houses constitute the same area where most turf can be developed &mdash; the 12 western counties.  I will give the Minister an example of the way the local improvements scheme works.  I do not think it is exaggerating to say there is a waiting list of at least five years for this scheme and in some places it is up to seven years.  In most counties the scheme is confined entirely to lanes, as they are called in County Cavan, roads which have not been taken over by the county council which lead into three, four or more houses.  Those unfortunate people have to wait for several years to avail of this grant.  There is no question, therefore, of this money being used for the purpose of repairing bog roads.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who said there has to be planning in regard to bog development, because, if not, there is no hope of <Col N="131" /> the bog being reclaimed.  Some of the best land, known as cut-away bog, is used for growing early potatoes, potatoes in general and vegetables.  It is the best for the production of these vegetables.  It would be a great pity it if was developed in such a way that the land would be useless afterwards.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to Bord na Móna to make the plans and specifications as simple as possible.  To insist on elaborate documentation will simply frighten off applicants and it will not work.  In section 5 it is provided that the board may appoint a person or persons to prepare and examine plans.  It would be a good idea to have such a person in the locality who would be available to prepare the plans and to lay out the work for farmers or other people who would be developing the turf.  There is a lot to be said for having such a person available for those who want to develop bogs, but I hope that such a person would be available to do the work quickly and that it would not be a question of requisitioning a planner and waiting an unreasonable time for him to come.</P>
    <P>Queries have been raised in regard to who builds the roads.  Under the scheme up to the present time there was no stipulation from the Central Development Committee as to who should do so.  The society in County Cavan which I have been talking about constructed their roads, apparently sufficiently well to pass the inspection which was necessary to receive the grant.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, aware of the extent to which the major price increases in food items have caused grave hardship to the most disadvantaged sections of the community, calls on the Government to restore and increase price subsidies on certain food items and furthermore gravely concerned <Col N="132" /> about the current &ldquo;price war&rdquo; between certain retailers in the grocery retailing trade and the prospect of bankruptcies, take-overs and uneployment in the Irish retailing sector with the consequence of higher retail prices imposed on the consumer, calls on the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism to make an Order to prevent the distortion of competition under present practices and to prohibit the limitations of offers at retail level.</P>
    <P>This motion is in two parts.  It calls for the reintroduction of food subsidies and for the prohibition by the Government of below-cost selling.</P>
    <P>As most Members will recall, it has been 12 months since this party tabled another motion for Private Members' Business on the question of price increases as they affect the weakest sections of the community.  In that motion of February, 1980, we stressed the inflationary effect which the part abolition of food subsidies had on price increases and we make no apology for reiterating this fundamental issue in the debate this evening.</P>
    <P>However, on this occasion we are much closer to a general election.  While this party have no intention of competing in a general Dutch auction of election promises with Fianna Fáil we give an unequivocal assurance that any alternative administration will have a firm proposal before it to extend food subsidies on such basic items as bread and milk.</P>
    <P>In January 1979 we tabled a motion also for Private Members' Business deploring the decision of the Government at that time to phase out the food subsidies, a decision which had the effect then of increasing the price of butter by 8p per pound, of increasing the price of milk by 2p per pint and of increasing the price of flour by 3p per kilo.  At that time we pointed out that that policy would have an adverse inflationary impact on the living standards of the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, the underpriviliged and of large families.  In January 1979 the annual rate of inflation was only 7.6 per cent.  Today it is more than double that figure.  We have tabled this motion <Col N="133" /> so that public opinion generally and various social organisations outside this House such as the trade union movement and, above all, that large body of marginal Deputies &mdash; notably the Fianna Fáil backbenchers &mdash; should be under no illusion as to the need to impress on the Government the necessity for ending this regressive policy of gradually eliminating remaining food subsidies by reason of inflation.</P>
    <P>Whatever views one might hold about the success or otherwise of the Coalition Government, we did take several important counter-inflation initiatives, particularly in respect of food.  We removed VAT from food in the 1975 budget and we introduced what were then substantial food subsidies on flour, bread, butter, milk and town gas.  The net effect of that action was a reduction in the consumer price index of 4 per cent.  We extended these subsidies in 1976 and in 1977 and in that way we took what in retrospect can be regarded only as unprecedented steps to maintain and to improve the living standards of the unemployed, the elderly and other vunerable groups in our society.</P>
    <P>At that time the inflation rate was relatively high but despite this the introduction of these subsidies had a considerable impact on the CPI.  Today we have an inflation rate of 17 per cent and this could be higher by the end of the year.  Our unemployment figure is at the high level of 125,000.  These figures alone would warrant the approach we are advocating. But since we raised this matter last in the House other evidence has become available to us.  For example, the National Prices Commission report which was published in June 1980 contains a section headed, &ldquo;Grocery Surveys and Typical Consumption Patterns&rdquo;.  This section analyses the six major food items ranked in order of importance for families of lowest gross income, for the head of household out of work and for the average of all household.  It is wise to point out that for the lowest income person of an expenditure in 1980 of about £8 per week on important food items there was included £2.10 on bread, milk and butter. Therefore, it can be seen that for a person <Col N="134" /> of quite low income the proportion of expenditure on these three items is substantial.  Those of us who pay 76p for a pint in a lounge bar will realise how far removed such expenditure is from the type of expenditure I have been instancing in terms of food.</P>
    <P>If we take another category from the National Prices Commission report, for the head of household out of work, of a similar expenditure of £23.50 per week on important food items £7.39 was spent on bread, milk and butter.  The price of milk has gone up since then.  For the average for all households with an expenditure of £23 per week on those items some £5.63p was spent on bread, milk and butter.  Even the most casual perusal of the data in the commission's report makes it clear that the deprived and the income disadvantaged spend relatively more on these three basic commodities.  Hence, the logic and justice inherent in our motion.</P>
    <P>Our motion is in two parts, the first of which relates to food subsidies.  It is a crying shame that when the Government can find so much money for so many admittedly important aspects of consumer expenditure but expenditure which generally pales into relative unimportance compared with the prices of basic food commodities, total inattention is paid to the need to introduce and maintain basic food subsidies for those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the second part of our motion relating to the present current retail price war, as it is called, in the supermarkets and shops.  I suggest there is urgent need for the Government to take decisive action in this area.  There has been considerable structural change in the grocery trade in the past 25 years. The major elements have been a continuous decline in the number of small grocers and the concomitant decline in the number of wholesalers.  There has been a sharp increase in the importance of just a few national supermarkets or multiples. We have had, of course, the infusion of the multinational grocery chains here.  In addition, we have had the bonding together of numerous independent grocers into voluntary chains such as Mace <Col N="135" /> and Spar which also organise much of the new cash and carry wholesale business.</P>
    <P>In 1971 it was estimated that the multiples accounted for about half of the Dublin trade and about 30 per cent in the country as a whole.  Estimates for 1978-79 showed that the multiples had increased their share of the Dublin market to about 70 per cent &mdash; that is the general assumption &mdash; and in the country as a whole their market is now said to be about 40 per cent.  The multiples comprise only five companies.  We have Tesco and Quinnsworth both of which are managed and owned outside Ireland with very large multinational financial reserves. We have Dunnes, Superquinn and Williams.  The latter is the only public company and its accounts have shown losses for the last two years and I think the first half year accounts this year or some recent accounts showed further losses. We have also the voluntary chains, AVG Group and the independents, RGDATA.  In the past two years they formed a joint trade association named the Irish Association of Distributive Trades.  This group has become quite powerful and influential and I think the Minister and my colleague, Deputy O'Toole, would concede that this group is developing a fairly strong sense of political muscle and intends to exercise it in a very determined way.  Therefore the situation is that the grocery retailing trade is dominated by the big five.  We know they are working on fairly tight margins generally.  I understand their margins may be even narrower than those in Northern Ireland or the UK.  At present they are competing fiercely with one another and the remainder of the trade is controlled by the IADT group.</P>
    <P>I do not know, from anything I have read or from people I have spoken to whenever I have gone abroad as a member of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe, of any country where concentration in grocery retailing is as high as in Ireland with a market dominated by so few firms.  I suggest that the impact of this structure on the food manufacturers and suppliers is very great.  We know only too well that the <Col N="136" /> food manufacturing sector is not terribly strong.  It comprises roughly 60 individual firms employing about 45,000 people.  A number of them are British subsidiaries and in several cases already there has been a loss of employment in those firms with the decision to cease production in Ireland and to import goods direct from Britain.  Most of these firms serve only a few customers and even if they lose just one supermarket account even for a couple of weeks some of them face closure. The supermarkets have enormous buying power and can force suppliers to reduce prices with the threat of taking away their account.  This happens very much during a price war.</P>
    <P>If the suppliers do what the supermarkets ask, the counter balancing sector, the IADT group and the other supermarkets naturally demand similar price reductions, thus forcing the suppliers into a loss-making situation.  This House must look very calmly and dispassionately at the situation.  Nothing is easier in a price war than to whip up emotive reaction and in the process the extent to which the State might be in a position to intervene could become extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>In 1978 there was a price war among the supermarkets.  We know that the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Examiner &mdash; and I am being perhaps a bit harsh, but correct in saying this &mdash; made a rather confused situation somewhat worse on that occasion.  Following this the Restrictive Practices Commission held a public inquiry into below cost selling in the grocery trade in December 1979 and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, &mdash; and here I want to be harsh on him &mdash; promised quick action within six months.  The publication of the RPC report and action by the Minister, if I recall rightly, were expected in October and then promised before Christmas. Then, three or four weeks ago they were promised within a month and in this motion tonight they are promised shortly.  There is a limit to the extent to which vocabulary can encompass promises.  I want to bring to the attention of the House the fact that the report has not yet been published and the action by the <Col N="137" /> Minister is not yet entered.  This is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>On another aspect of the current situation, the present legislative position is that advertising goods for sale below cost is illegal, but selling goods below cost is legal.  The manufacturers' suppliers are permitted to withhold supply from a retailer who is selling below cost.  However, as I explained earlier, this does so much harm to the income of the suppliers that they could not keep it up for very long.  I gather that the CII managed to get concerted action from all the major suppliers to withhold supply from the multiples who are selling below cost.  As we well know, it is very difficult to maintain a united front because of possible loss of profits.  Also, the income of individual suppliers without adequate reserves can dwindle.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the big five are all using general advertising but are shedding goods in many instances on selected items below cost.  This affects the small voluntary chains and especially the small independents who must pay much higher prices for their goods than the supermarkets and, therefore, become uncompetitive.  It is quite clear that employment is being lost in the distributive sector at present and there are a number of reasons for this.  There is, of course, the recession.  We have the long running secular decline of small independent shops, caused partly by the rural-urban population shift and by the greater mobility of shoppers, the new housing estates, the new planning permissions and, of course, the supermarket price war.  I want to stress that possibly a loss of employment is occurring in the food processing industry in the agricultural sector, in this situation.  Any sizeable loss by firms in food processing will have a serious impact on the agricultural sector.  There is an urgent need for action by the Minister, and an urgent need for the Cabinet to consider the matter.  I do not know what internal policy decisions are being taken by the Department but, by reading between the lines, one gets the impression that the Department's view in the matter is to take a low profile.  This is quite evident by the non-publication of the RPC's <Col N="138" /> report and absence of any resulting order by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The price war has gone on long enough.  We have waited far too long for action from the Minister in this area. Unless he takes action some of the Irish supermarkets may be forced into a loss-making situation and will just not survive. Secondly, quite a large number of the smaller individuals will certainly go to the wall and suffer even more grievous harm. Thirdly, the same could happen to some of the firms in the food processing industry.  The total employment effect, unless the Government take action, could be extremely severe.</P>
    <P>It has been argued strongly that, if all the multi-nationals are at one another's throats and the supermarkets are tearing the guts out of one another on the prices front, this is great for the consumer.  I want to stress that the benefits to the public of the multiples having a price war are exceptionally short-termed; they are purely ephemeral.  In the long run the public will be far worse off.  In the first instance, below cost selling is related to an extremely small range of items.  They are important items, but confined to a particular group.  The price margins on other commodities are jacked up to pay for the price war on other items.  We must bear in mind, in respect of a price war, that the consumer does not benefit at all.</P>
    <P>Of greater importance is that a price war causes so much instability in the distribution sector and the supplying industries that it causes bankruptcies, take-overs and a chaos of structural change internally in the industry.  We now know, for example, that Tesco several weeks ago entered into this price war and once the big multi-nationals enter, there is an automatic substitution of imported products for Irish products.  The imported products are brought in to this country and dumped in the context of a price war. This could result in firms like Williams, who have had two years of running losses, and Superquinn &mdash; I am not naming firms in any derogatory sense, but because I am worried &mdash; being literally taken over.</P>
    <P>If the price war is allowed to continue, it could result in these firms being either taken over or going bankrupt and the <Col N="139" /> Irish retailing scene will be dominated by foreign owned multinationals and multiples.  That is a worrying situation.  If the present price war continues, within the next six months', the big five could become the big three &mdash; Williams and Superquinn will be gone for their tea.  I have not mentioned Dunnes because, in my opinion, they have sufficient financial strength to survive but they would still have problems.</P>
    <P>It would also mean that there would be a demise of a substantial part of the food processing industry internally, with the result that grocery retailing would be dominated by two multinational firms who would probably rationalise, reduce the number of their branches and retail mainly imported products.  That is a serious situation.  The Minister should take immediate action to ban the below cost selling syndrome which is at present in operation.  I know he intends taking action some time in the future but it should not be beyond the ability of the Department to take action now.  What is needed is to put a lower limit on the present damaging price cutting.  This would not prevent price competition.  I am as much in favour of price competition as the next person and I fully believe consumers should get the best possible deal but, in the long run, price wars benefit nobody; suppliers will go out of business, Irish supermarkets and small traders will be crucified and the scene will be dominated by Tesco, Quinnsworth and one or two other firms.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce an order to ban below cost selling.  He should try to do something about the limitation of special offers at retail level. At present a retailer can make a special cheap offer where his customers buy two or three packets of a certain commodity cheaply.  A lot of that would stop if there was a limitation on sales to customers.  At present enterprising people can buy six dozen or the dozen items in these special offers.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency to control and prohibit below cost selling.  I suggest that there are plenty of examples of competition in prices in the EEC and even Australia. <Col N="140" />  In the United States, the bastion of free enterprise, if one were to indulge in below cost selling, one would land oneself in the courts.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to make an immediate statement on this question and to take immediate action.</P>
    <P>A further major political issue facing the Minister is the extent to which the multinational retailing groups, particularly Tesco or the group owned by Westons, should be permitted to set up shop in any part of the country without restriction.  In 1966 there were about 17,000 small independent retailers throughout the country; today there are 7,000 or 8,000.  The number of these retailers has been halved largely because of the development of the multinational and domestic supermarkets.</P>
    <P>At present there are current major local authority planning and development disputes in, for example, Mallow and Galway, highlighting this serious problem.  I appreciate that this is a very complex and difficult problem.  There is no way of reconciling the demands of consumers who want a supermarket in their own estate and large shopping centre facilities, and the demands of local established traders who want to protect their interests, which is understandable. The Minister is caught between them.  He should make a greater effort to try to control the situation under the mergers and monopolies legislation.  It is possible to influence this situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask his colleague, the Minister for the Environment to urge local authorities to include in their draft development plans revised specific criteria relating to the intensification of retail trading in their areas of jurisdiction. There are many examples in Europe &mdash; in France, Italy and Germany &mdash; where that legislative approach operates quite effectively.  In those countries it is not very easy to set up shop, buy a supermarket and take over.  The rules of competition, location and development are quite complex and much more restrictive than in this country.  Therefore, it should be possible for the Minister to take action in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unduly harsh on <Col N="141" /> the Department but the culture and philosophy of this Department are that if a problem is causing trouble at first they do not do anything about it until the hullaballoo stops and when the fuss is over they might do something about it.  In my view the fuss about the price war and multinational operations in the retailing sector is becoming a major political issue which will not go away.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has great insensitivity. He bristles at this situation and is not prepared to do much about it.  He gets people's backs up.  I have had representations about his approach.  They were so bad that I was taken aback.  I am normally a moderate and I am a supporter of many of the industrial development attitudes of the Minister and the total honesty of the man in many areas, but I urge him to shed his bristling insensitivity in this area, publish the report, take action &mdash; he will not satisfy everybody &mdash; make the order prohibiting below cost selling then meet the retail trade, consult with the major groupings in the trade &mdash; the people in the supermarkets whose interests are very considerable &mdash; and try to assist the parties in this area.  This is possible.</P>
    <P>I make that plea because I am gravely concerned about the 45,000 jobs in the Irish food industry, a number of which are concerned with exports.  Up to 20,000 jobs could go because we must have some domestic selling base in order to have effective exports and profitable outlets. I am also concerned about a large number of jobs in the retail and distributive areas. Ireland could become just another relatively small market conurbation for a large retailing multinational firm importing between 600 and 800 items here, thus causing considerable suffering to domestic industries.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that there are no easy political solutions to this, more could be done than at present.  I would ask the Minister of State to convey our views directly to the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Meaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann,&rdquo;<Col N="142" /> and substitute &ldquo;affirms its approval of the measures being taken by the Government to control prices in the present difficult economic circumstances and, notes the existence of a code of law relating to competition in the grocery sector, from which the consumer has derived substantial benefits, the initiatives already taken by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in this area, his intention to publish very shortly the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on below cost selling and to take appropriate action on the Commission's recommendations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a relatively short time ago, mid-December last, to be precise, that I spoke to a somewhat similar motion &mdash; again from the Labour Party &mdash; to the one before the House tonight.  It is my hope that on this occasion, unlike the last one the debate will deal with the realities of the economic facts of life.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion tonight before the House refers to the impact of rising prices particularly on the less protected sections of the community.  It is an undeniable fact that since taking up office this Government have been particularly concerned to ensure that the effect of price increases on the most disadvantaged sections of the community is softened in so far as is possible taking into account all the considerations involved. This concern has been practically expressed.  Improvements in the State's health and welfare systems have been regarded as a central element in successive budgets and the price control procedures operated by my Department and by the National Prices Commission have been tightened up considerably to ensure that only the minimum unavoidable price increases are allowed to occur.</P>
    <P>The Government's degree of awareness and concern for the plight of the less-advantaged sections of the community were amply demonstrated in the recent budget.  In common with all budgets since 1977, the recent budget provided for major improvements in the income of the less well-off sections of the community.  I would like to quote some figures to emphasise my point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Since 1977, unemployment benefits have been increased by over 96 per cent; widows' pensions have been increased by 123 per cent; contributory old age pensions have been increased by 120 per cent; non-contributory old age pensions have been increased by 123 per cent and childrens' allowance have been increased by 161 per cent.  If these increases are compared with the rate of inflation during that time, it will be agreed that never in the history of the State have the increases been so much greater than the increase in inflation.  That is right and proper because this section of our community is still not getting enough.</P>
    <P>The Government in their last budget announced that personal and adult dependant rates of long-term weekly social welfare benefits would be increased by 25 per cent.  The cost of these social welfare and other health improvements is estimated at £144 million, all of which will be directed towards those sections of the community who are in greatest need.  Of this sum £111 million will be met by the Exchequer.  I cannot see the point in asking the taxpayer to subsidise food eaten in expensive restaurants.  That is what subsidies would mean. The money collected from the taxpayer should be used where it is most needed, that is, towards providing social welfare payments.  The Opposition are saying that this money should be divided so that the wealthy also get their share.  It cannot be denied that very good increases in benefits were given in spite of difficult economic times.</P>
    <P>Applications for price increases are regularly received by the Department and cannot simply be refused point blank.  The consequences would be predictable, however, if all applications for price increases were to be rejected while cost increases continued to occur.  Company bankruptcies and redundancies would occur within a short period.  In many cases supplies of goods to the Irish market would cease altogether.  Given the increased cost of imported materials and the size of the increases in money incomes which have occurred in recent years, increased costs nowadays can only <Col N="144" /> very rarely be met from profits or fully offset by improvements in productivity and efficiency.  Price control operated in this way would be irrelevant.  No products would be available at the controlled prices and the effects would soon become intolerable.  The consequences of exercising this option would be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>Another option open to the Government would be to refuse to allow certain price increases which were justified and grant subsidies to make good the difference.  A number of commodities are at present in receipt of Government subsidy.  The cost of these subsidies runs to about £40 million annually.  Beyond a certain point, however, expenditure on subsidies becomes a wasteful and highly inefficient way of assisting the less well-off.  Resources are diverted to better-off households who under any normally objective set of criteria do not require this kind of subvention of their daily expense of living.  It is the Government's belief that subsidies, applying, as they do, irrespective of individual needs, do not sufficiently discriminate in favour of the less well-off sections of the community.  Moreover, subsidisation can lead to distortion in consumption patterns and hides the real cost of a product or service.</P>
    <P>The Government have not exercised either of these two options.  Instead, as I have said, the Government have on the one hand rigidly controlled prices having regard to the economic facts of life and, on the other, have made significant improvements in the level of social welfare benefits payable to the less-protected sections of the community.  I have already given examples of the increases which have taken place since 1977.  These increases have been impressive and underline the Government's commitment.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion makes specific reference to major price increases in food items.  The way in which the applications for such price increases are dealt with under the price control procedures evidences the strict way in which these procedures are operated.  There was a price increase of 5p approved on bread in January this year.  The bakeries concerned had looked for increases in some <Col N="145" /> cases of up to 9p and 10p in the basis of their increased labour costs, increased energy costs and increased overhead costs.  The prices division of my Department and the National Prices Commission subjected the bakeries' applications to stringent examination and, as a result, the National Prices Commission recommended that the allowed price increase be restricted to 6½p.  It has often been said that the Minister only rubber stamps price applications but this is a special case where the Minister, having considered the commission's recommendations, decided that a price increase of only 5 pence should be allowed.  It can be seen, therefore, that by virtue of a very strict operation of price control the price increase finally allowed on this very necessary and very basic food item was almost half what it might have been.  In so far as food is concerned, the retail price of 18 basic food items is strictly controlled by maximum prices order.  I can readily assure the House that all price increase applications, whether in respect of food items or any other commodities, are subjected to stringent examination in order to ensure that only the minimum unavoidable price increases are passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The operation of a strict price control system has resulted in real benefit for all sections of the community.  For example, in the latest 12-month period, January to December 1980, the records show that the National Prices Commission considered price increase applications claiming increased costs of £557.71 million on an annualised basis.  Of this amount only £458.27 million in increased costs was actually allowed.  This means that the prices of the products and services covered by the 526 applications involved rose by about 18 per cent less than they would have risen had the applicants not been subject to detailed price control.  It also means that consumers had to pay £99.44 million less for those goods and services than they would otherwise have had to pay.  Indeed, this figure almost certainly underestimates the saving to consumers as very many of the increases sanctioned relate to ex-factory prices.  Retail prices are generally fixed by adding a percentage <Col N="146" /> margin to the prices at which retailers buy.  If the average retail margin on costs were 25 per cent, which is a relatively low average figure, then the saving to consumers would be in the region of £130 million.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the approach which the Government have adopted to the problem of rising prices &mdash; strict control on price increases coupled with major improvements in social welfare benefits &mdash; is the correct one and the one most suited to existing economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the grocery sector is probably the sector most affected by the advances made here over the past number of decades.  We have seen many changes in the manner of preparation, presentation and sale of foodstuffs.  We have seen many changes in the social fabric of our society, entailing certain changes in the pattern of distribution of population, increases in standards of living and changes in consumer attitudes and expectations.  These changes have had, of necessity, implications for our traditional lifestyles and, understandably, for various trades and professions, some of which have disappeared while others have adapted to meet the increasing challenges posed by the developments which occurred.</P>
    <P>We have had problems with local traders and local grocers for some time and there are fewer of them now than there were some years ago.  This process has been going on for a long time.  It went on during the Coalition period and during the Fianna Fáil period.  Deputy Desmond referred to certain aspects of it, but to make a political issue of it will not help the position one bit.  Two Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Deputy P.J. Lalor of Fianna Fáil and Deputy Justin Keating of the Coalition Government, signed Restrictive Practices Grocery Orders, on 21 February 1973 and on 18 October 1973 respectively.  This adequately illustrates what I am getting at.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in this evolutionary process it was recognised that there was a need for a policy framework within which the various economic sectors would develop in accordance with the <Col N="147" /> interests of the common good.  One reflection of this policy was the enactment in 1953 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act which facilitated the tackling of various undesirable practices which existed.  It is of interest to recall here the words of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the late Deputy Seán Lemass, that &ldquo;the aim of policy must be to foster competition wherever possible and to introduce that element of risk into every trade which will force those engaged in it to strive towards maximum efficiency at all times&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the Fair Trade Commission were established and given the powers to carry out inquiries into the supply and distribution of goods and to make recommendations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for action to deal with any abuses identified.</P>
    <P>Shortly after their establishment the commission noted that there was creeping paralysis of price competition in large areas of distributive trading and a tendency towards the freezing of distributive arrangements without allowance for economic change.  Among the practices which were recognised as being widespread were limitation or regulation of entry to trade, resale price maintenance by manufacturers, price fixing and margins fixing by trade associations, punitive action against traders who have not observed such fixed prices or margins and various other devices which were alleged to restrain or suppress competition unfairly or to the disadvantage of the public.</P>
    <P>One of the first areas which received attention by the commission was the grocery sector, and in view of the clear importance of this sector this was not surprising.  This was the first reflection of a concern that competition in this sector should be fostered but that such competition should be fair and healthy, a concern which has been evident up to the present.</P>
    <P>The first inquiry was held in 1955, at a time when the extent of price competition was quite limited, a number of products were still subject to price control while <Col N="148" /> others had their resale price fixed by the suppliers, and the modern type of supermarket had not yet emerged.  The inquiry covered foodstuffs, with some exceptions, and household necessaries commonly sold in groceries.  The main issue at the inquiry was whether resale price maintenance was contrary to the public interest.  In their report the Fair Trade Commission concluded, <i>inter alia,</i> that price competition at retail level would be beneficial to the public and they recommended that individual or collective action designed to secure the maintenance of resale prices should, therefore, be prohibited.  On the other hand, they deemed it necessary to have certain safeguards against excessive price cutting.  It was recommended, for example, that a supplier should be permitted to withhold goods from a retailer who was selling the goods to the public at a price lower than the wholesale price charged to retailers for the goods.  The commission also examined and made recommendations in relation to terms and conditions.  In essence, they sought to maintain as much flexibility as possible and their recommendations were designed to ensure that terms and conditions of supply would be reasonable and would be applied equitably to all persons seeking supplies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave effect to the commission's recommendations in the Restrictive Trade Practices (Groceries) Order, 1956, which he subsequently amended in 1958.</P>
    <P>A general review of these orders was held in 1966, but in their report the Fair Trade Commission considered that no further measures to regulate the grocery trade were necessary or could be recommended having regard in particular to the evolving state of the trade at that time.</P>
    <P>Persistent complaints alleging the existence of unfair trading practices in the food trade continued to be received by the Fair Trade Commission, and in 1971 the commission undertook a public inquiry into the supply and distribution of grocery goods for human consumption.  Fresh fruit and vegetables, fish, milk, cream and ice cream, intoxicating <Col N="149" /> liquor and soft drinks were excluded from the scope of the inquiry.  &ldquo;Household necessaries&rdquo; sold in grocery shops, which had been covered by the 1955 inquiry, were also excluded.  There were two main reasons for limiting the 1971 inquiry, First, the vast majority of the complaints received by the commission in the years prior to the holding of the inquiry related to foodstuffs and, secondly, the inclusion of &ldquo;household necessaries&rdquo; would, in the opinion of the commission, have presented difficulties in regard to definition and would have led to a considerable extension of the range and duration of the inquiry without adding significantly to the effective consideration of the broad issues involved.</P>
    <P>The main issue at the inquiry was the question of terms and conditions of supply.  In addition, there were numerous complaints about certain practices which had been adopted in retailing, particularly by supermarket multiples, such as sales below purchase price, trading stamps, redeemable vouchers, certain advertising practices and private label brands.</P>
    <P>The commission's report, dealing only with foodstuffs with the exceptions stated above, was submitted and published in 1972.  In relation to terms and conditions, the commission concluded that in certain cases these discriminated unfairly against certain buyers.  Their proposals for dealing with these problems related to such matters as quantity terms, volume discounts and supplementary terms, and were designed to ensure more equitable and realistic terms and conditions while at the same time maintaining the flexibility of previous orders.  The commission also considered the position in relation to below cost sales and their views in this regard could be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>The prohibition of sales below purchase price plus taxes, whether or not a percentage is added, would present formidable, and possibly insuperable, problems in application and enforcement.  The avoidance of anomalies would require such a degree of relaxation that prohibition might well prove to be ineffective in practice.  In assessing <Col N="150" /> a net purchase price, the inclusion of rebates based on future performance would be difficult, as it would entail anticipating a percentage that could vary with performance.  To exclude rebates would mean that the figure for a particular outlet earning a rebate would not be a true net purchase price for the products concerned but an invoice price plus a margin that could vary for different products.  The need to make allowances for indirect price reductions resulting from the use of trading stamps or vouchers would further complicate the problem. Exceptions would need to be made for sales of perishable goods in danger of deterioration &mdash; a flexible concept &mdash; for end-of-season sales of seasonal goods, for termination of business sales to take account of price reductions by a supplier since date of purchase, and for prices charged in good faith to meet competition.  The latter exception could make it very difficult to establish a breach of the prohibition, but failure to provide for it could result in prohibiting an outlet from selling below purchase prices to meet the prices of a competing outlet where the prices of the competing outlet, possibly &mdash; though not necessarily &mdash; through special offers, were equivalent to or higher than its net purchase prices plus taxes. In such circumstances a prohibition would represent an unreasonable and unfair restraint on competition.</P>
    <P>In the relevant report the commission went on to point out that the fixing of a minimum selling price on any basis would constitute a form of official resale price maintenance, a major reversal of a policy which had brought considerable public benefit, and that whatever basis might be chosen as a minimum the way would be opened for pressure to have it progressively raised.</P>
    <P>The commission said: &ldquo;A prohibition of sales below purchase price would limit ... the scope for the employment and development of the retailers' skills in meeting competition and particularly competition in prices which is vital to trade&rdquo;.  Such a prohibition would also <Col N="151" /> channel competitive drives into the area of non-price competition, such as &ldquo;gift&rdquo; and &ldquo;prize&rdquo; schemes, which would probably be to the disadvantage of both consumers and independent retailers.</P>
    <P>The report recognised, however, that the practice of below cost selling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>... has undesirable features.  Where widespread advertising is concentrated largely on such prices, a misleading impression is conveyed of the prices in the outlet concerned, as the great bulk of them must reflect a margin covering retailing costs and yielding a profit. The advertising of such prices conveys an impression to the consumer of the value of the product which, by discouraging stocks and display by outlets unable to meet the losses entailed in matching a price below purchase price, can adversely affect the distribution of the product.  More seriously, such advertising creates an unfavourable impression to an unwarranted extent of the prices in independent outlets, resulting in serious losses in sales, thereby accentuating the tendency to domination of the trade by multiple organisations.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it recommended that &ldquo;the advertising by the retailer, or by anyone acting on his behalf of any commodity at less than the net purchase price which he paid for the commodity in any medium outside his own premises should be prohibited&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This recommendation was accepted by the Minister, and Article 6 of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973, provided as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  A retailer shall not advertise or cause to be advertised for sale grocery goods at a price that (after the deduction of the cost to the retailer of any discount or other benefit given by him on a sale of the goods) is less than the price (after the deduction of any discount received by the retailer) at which he purchased the goods.</P>
    <P>(2)  Paragraph (1) of this Article does not apply in relation to the advertising <Col N="152" /> of goods at the place where they are on sale.</P>
    <P>This order applied, however, only to foodstuffs with some important exceptions, and it remained permissable to advertise the excepted foods and all non-food groceries at prices below cost.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973, and the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) (Amendment) Order, 1973, which related to foodstuffs only. gave effect to the commission's recommendations in these and other matters. As a result of these orders the power of a supplier to withhold goods continued in relation to non-food groceries, while in the case of foodstuffs it was revoked having regard to the prohibition of below cost advertising in their case.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the commission carried out a special review, by means of public inquiry, of the operation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1973, as amended, which, as stated, related to foodstuffs with specified exceptions only.  This review was undertaken as a result of representations to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices in regard to the definition of certain terms in Article 2 of the order and in regard to the interpretation of Article 3.</P>
    <P>In his report requesting the review, the Examiner indicated that some manufacturers who had introduced new terms in accordance with the 1973 orders were advised by a number of supermarket multiples and a retail buying group that their products would no longer be stocked, following which the manufacturers withdrew these new terms.  In their report the commission recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> amendment of the existing orders to provide greater latitude to the supplier in formulating distribution arrangements best suited to his marketing strategy and consistent with equity in their application.  The Minister gave effect to the commission's recommendations in the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) (Amendment) Order, 1978.</P>
    <P>In early 1978 an alliance of wholesalers and independent retailers was formed.  In its early activities the alliance sought (a) to compel manufacturers to take steps to <Col N="153" /> end the sale of their products below cost by supermarkets multiples, and (b) to win a &ldquo;functional&rdquo; discount for wholesalers from manufacturers.  This alliance gave to its members a collective negotiating strength comparable with that of the multiples and in so doing brought about a significant change in the balance of bargaining power in the trade.</P>
    <P>As a result of conflicting pressures arising from the activities of the alliance, one Irish supplier found itself faced with considerable difficulties and there appeared to be a possibility that other suppliers could be similarly affected.  At the request of the Minister the Examiner held discussions with representatives of the manufacturers and the alliance which resulted in a suspension for three months of the action which had been taken.  Subsequently, at the Minister's request the commission held informal discussions with representatives of all the interests in the trade.  In November 1978 the commission made to the Minister a non-statutory report in which they recommended that the grounds on which goods might be withheld from a retailer by a supplier should be altered from selling below wholesale price to selling below net invoice price plus VAT.  They also recommended that this provision, which since 1973 had not applied to foodstuffs, and the prohibition on below cost advertising, which had not applied to non-foods, should be extended so that each covered both foodstuffs and non-foods subject only to the exception of the foodstuffs specifically exempted.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the House will note that there is already in existence a code of legislation which is aimed at ensuring the existence of healthy competition with consequential benefits for those involved from the manufacturer to the consumer, the initiatives taken by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in relation to the groceries sector and his intention to publish very shortly the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on below cost selling and to take appropriate action on the commission's recommendations.  That report will be published within a month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the Minister's last few sentences.  He said there is in existence a code of practice and legislation which ensures certain things.  If what the Minister said was true we would not be discussing this motion. That is the reality.  There is legislation on the Statute Book dealing with the grocery trade, price control and restrictive practices, but it does not work.  That is what the hullabaloo is about.</P>
      <P>The motion put down by the Labour Party refers to the hardship caused to certain sections due to continuously increasing prices of basic food items.  Reference is made to the price war and all its consequences and ill effects.  The amendment refers to the measures being taken by the Government to control prices in present difficult economic circumstances and notes the existence of a code of law relating to competition in the grocery sector.</P>
      <P>I took careful note of what the Minister said, and on three occasions he mentioned &ldquo;the economic facts of life&rdquo;.  It is time members of the Government realised that there are economic facts of life and that they were always there.  However, they seem to have been suspended since 1977 when that party put before the country an election programme which saw everything rosy: everything could be solved by diligent scrutiny of the issues and the application of proper solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now know that the economic facts of life caught up with that philosophy, and we are now paying for the ineffective and inefficient approach of that party. The Minister tried to put the best face he could on it by giving us a long litany of social welfare benefit increases.  Why would there not be increases?  The Minister tried in a hamfisted way, in listing percentage increases, to make virtue out of necessity.  Surely he did not expect social welfare beneficiaries to have taken decreases since 1977?  That is not an answer to the terms of our motion.  He told us of measures taken by the NPC to ensure that prices were kept in strict control.  We recall the specific undertakings given in 1977 in relation to the NPC, that they would be restructured, that certain amendments would be effected and that <Col N="155" /> where the Government had control, power and influence, unnecessary price increases would not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I will not bore the House by telling what has happened in the meantime.  We all know that those undertakings have been ignored or denied.  Certainly they have not been fulfilled.  We all know, and the Minister can ascertain this if he goes out into the street, that any housewife will say prices are rising at an exorbitant rate and that, despite what the Minister has said, social welfare beneficiaries are not banking much of their weekly allowances despite the so-called massive increases given by the Government.  They are spending every penny and calling for more because price increases have run riot.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to deal with subsidies and said they were an ineffective and wasteful way in which to try to ease the burden on the less well off.  I remind the Minister that in 1975 it was they, in opposition, who proposed that food subsidies be introduced.  The National Coalition were in power.  For two-and-a-half-years afterwards they boasted that they were responsible for providing £61 million in subsidies.</P>
    <P>What did they do when they came into office and since then?  Despite the fact that inflation is now as high as it was in 1975 they began to cut back food subsidies.  When we applied subsidies we also gave social welfare increases.  We introduced, for instance, the unmarried mothers' allowances.  Our actions incidentally gave a fillip to the producers, the farmers, by keeping prices at a realistic level.  Yet the Minister now tells us that food subsidies are an inefficient and wasteful way to do things.  He has a very short memory. He mentioned the Restrictive Practices Act and gave a long dissertation on the history of legislation in that area, going back 25 or 26 years.  The grocery industry comprises 40,000 people engaged in an industry worth £900 million at current values.  They are not interested in what happened 25 years ago.  They are much more interested in what will be happening 25 years hence, because they and their families depend on the orderly expansion <Col N="156" /> of the industry.  They are interested in what is being done in 1981 rather than being reminded of 1955.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the 1973 Act, to which I will refer in a few minutes.  His references were very selective.  He avoided the crunch issue, which is Part VIII, section 2, and this concerns the price war which forms part of this motion. Much has been said about the price war which has gone on during the past couple of weeks.  In the past 15 years the numbers in the independent grocery trade have decreased from 17,000 to about 8,500.  This is not unique to this country; it is widespread throughout Europe, but with the difference that in the past number of years our European colleagues took corrective action to arrest that decline.  They did it for two reasons, one positive and one negative.  The positive reason was to create real competition in the trade, and the negative one, to ensure that the monoplies would not be created.</P>
    <P>Here we are in 1981 when we have reached the stage where our grocery trade is monopolised, where five companies have a market share of 50 per cent of the total, the other 50 per cent being in the hands of the remaining 8,500 independent retail outlets.  In other countries in the EEC they did not allow the percentage of market share to rise to that degree before taking corrective action. We have reached that stage now.  The question is, do we allow that slide to continue, do we allow that monopoly to build up, or do we not allow it?  If not, what action will we take?</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that this side of the House have put their cards on the table. We have given an undertaking publicly that we will introduce a Private Member's Bill containing provisions that I hope would result in corrective action being taken to arrest the decline in the independent sector of the trade, secondly, that would ensure proper, ordered planning of the grocery industry and, thirdly, that would ensure real and lasting competition in the industry resulting in the most fair deal possible for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Since the price war started there have been noises made in certain localities regarding the benefits accruing to a community <Col N="157" /> from the existence of a supermarket in that community.  Generally speaking, the consumer lobby has been very responsible in coming out publicly and saying that in the long term this is not a good thing for consumers.  This has been said by the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the ICA and the Irish Housewives Association who collectively represent the largest consumer lobby.  It is not only from the distributive trade sector, it is not only from the RGDATA people who have a vested interest in this matter that we are hearing howls of derision and objection.  It is from people who have not a vested interest other than being consumers seeking the best bargain possible.</P>
    <P>The price war goes a little further than the effect on prices and the effect on the independent retail outlets.  We have only to look around us to see the volume of imported commodities, particularly food, now adorning the shelves of many of the major supermarkets.  This is happening at a time when our balance of payments is in an unhealthy state, when unemployment is rising and when we could do with some incentive to encourage home industry and home purchasing.</P>
    <P>On that point I come back to the Restrictive Practices legislation which states that the wholesale and retail trade must furnish details of grocery goods imported within 14 days.  This is to ensure that they import reasonably and do not go beyond what is allowed.  However, a further provision in that legislation states that it is not necessary to do this if the goods are of the same kind as other goods for which a statement has been furnished to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices. In other words, if I import a commodity called X for which I furnish a statement, it appears from the provisions of the legislation that I can keep on importing commodity <Col N="158" /> X until I am blue in the face.  As long as I do not import article Y, there is no restriction on the volume or amount I import.</P>
    <P>In 1981 we are faced with a serious problem in the retail trade industry.  The Restrictive Practices Commission during the course of 15 months prepared a report which they delivered to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  Their remit was to comment and report on undercost selling.  I appreciate that the Minister must consider the contents of the report and must ensure that whatever he extracts from it is worth while and will have a good effect on the industry but it is beyond the bounds of reasonableness to expect that it would take him nearly five months to report to the House and to the trade on what he intends doing.  It is now a question of what he will do rather than when he will take action.  No matter when he reports, unless the recommendations made by him are worth while and to the point he might as well forget about the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>The nub of the problem is undercost selling.  Multinationals went to suppliers and manufacturers and, under the pressure of volume purchasing, they extracted from them terms they were not entitled to in the first place and which could not be availed of by the independent retail trade.  They got the terms and, of course, like everything else, somebody must pay for concessions given.  It was the independent grocer who paid for the concessions.</P>

      <P>On 21 November 1980 the North Eastern Health Board wrote to my Department indicating that the number of births in this small maternity hospital are decreasing steadily and that the hospital is regarded as totally inadequate from the structural and service viewpoints and asking me to make a decision as to the future of this maternity unit.  However, this is primarily a matter for decision by the health board in the first instance.  If they decide to discontinue this maternity unit my consent to this step would be needed. A letter informing the health board to this effect has been issued by my Department.</P>

In view of the circumstances of his case arrangements have been made to pay him weekly in advance of medical certificates which in future will only be required at monthly intervals.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment in this case, which is regretted, was due mainly to the change-over in January 1981 from the system of insurance numbers to RSI numbers for the purpose of payment of benefit.</P>

      <P>A widow, who is in receipt of a widow's pension from my Department, is not liable for any deductions from her earnings in respect of social insurance and health contributions.</P>
      <P>A widow in receipt of a contributory pension at the full rate is paid half the appropriate personal rate of disability or unemployment benefit in the event of illness or unemployment; if she is in receipt of contributory pension at a reduced rate the half-rate of disability or unemployment benefit is increased by the amount of the reduction in the pension. If her pension is non-contributory, the rate of benefit payable depends on the rate of pension and can range from half the appropriate personal rate of disability or unemployment benefit to the full rate, plus appropriate increases in respect of dependent children.  Pay-related benefit is payable in full in all such cases.</P>
      <P>A widow, who is not in receipt of a widow's pension is, however, liable for the full appropriate social insurance and health deductions from her earnings from employment.  In such circumstances, she qualifies for the full rate of disability or unemployment benefit in the event of illness or unemployment.  Pay-related benefit is also payable.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to disability benefit in 1980 was, however, governed by the number of contributions in the 1979 contribution year.

      <P>The person concerned has been paid all disability benefit due to 17 February 1981, the date of the latest certificate received.  The delay in payment of benefit was due to the fact that he failed to quote his RSI number on the medical certificates forwarded by him to the Department despite the fact that he was requested to do so on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>He recently notified my Department of the non-receipt of certain cheques, and a list of cheques which issued in January 1981 has been sent to him.  He has been asked to indicate which cheques have not been received by him, and on receipt of a reply, replacement action will be taken.</P>
