      <P>This Bill was introduced in the middle of December last to give effect to the meeting of the second moiety of rates for certain agricultural holders with a valuation of between £40 and £60. It has not been dealt with in the House and local authorities have not yet seen the statutory implementation of a Government directive.  What proof have local authorities now that they can expect to see the Bill which was introduced earlier on today's Order being passed during 1981?</P>

      <P>It is intended, subject to agreement with the Whips, to have the Second Stage of No. 1 taken next Tuesday. It is correct to say that the original Bill, the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) (No. 2) Bill, 1980, was intended to give statutory effect to the relief of the second moiety of rates granted in 1980. However, further concessions on rates leviable on agricultural land were announced in the budget statement of the Minister for Finance before the Second Stage was ordered.  The benefits that were extended to the farming community in the original Bill have now been subsumed in the other piece of legislation.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P>In page 8, before line 12, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, the amount of rent paid by an individual on a principal private residence, which exceeds £10 but not greater than £50 per week, shall be deducted from the total income of that individual for the year 1981-82 and any subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that yesterday, on behalf of Deputy O'Leary, I supported this amendment.  I should like to know if the Minister has any thoughts in relation to any prospects of relief being afforded in relation to rent payments in respect of private accommodation. Is there any working paper or document available at Government level which might afford any measure of relief to such persons?  It is not my intention to press the amendment but I was wondering if there was any intention of granting relief.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick of the Minister's party alluding to the need to give relief to persons paying substantial rents for private accommodation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the ordinary <Col N="2882" /> relief afforded to mortgage holders.  It has been suggested that because of mortgage relief the Government should consider giving relief in the direction I have asked.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that the general intention of the Labour Party amendment was that persons paying at least £10 and not more than £50 per week for rented accommodation should get some mortgage relief for such payments.  The Minister told us he could not find his way to accepting that amendment but perhaps we might tease out from him if any thought is being given to that principle within the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.  It may feature in the next three or four weeks in a certain campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment designed to provide some measure of tax relief in respect of people living in rented accommodation is desirable because if those people were living in a house which they had the ability to purchase they would get tax relief on the interest being paid on any loan they took out for that purpose. As a general rule one can say that people living in rented accommodation are less well off than people living in their own house because it is usual that they live in rented accommodation because they do not have any option.  They live in such accommodation because they cannot afford to buy a house of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat ironical that there should be a tax relief for people who can afford to buy a house of their own on the interest they pay whereas those who cannot afford to buy a house do not get tax relief on any of the payments they make. The result of this has been a diminution in the amount of available rented accommodation because the rents that can be charged in these circumstances are not sufficiently remunerative to encourage people to provide adequate amounts of this accommodation.  The result is a scarcity of rented accommodation in many parts of this city and other major towns. Deputy O'Leary's amendment will have the effect of making much more rented accommodation available in the medium term, because by giving relief to the tenant <Col N="2883" /> in respect of his or her rent it would become more profitable for both potential landlords and potential tenants to enter into more arrangements for the leasing of housing accommodation and we would have more rented accommodation, an easier situation in the housing market and more mobility in our economy, since rented accommodation is a more mobile product.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance argued that any introduction of relief on income tax for rented accommodation would lead to an increase in demand for rented accommodation but no increase in supply, and hence to an increase in the rents and the benefit therefore going to the landlord. This, of course, is not true because rented accommodation can be made available relatively easily.  The conversion involved internally in most houses to make them available for rental can be carried out relatively quickly.  There is no need to buy sites or to get planning permission in most cases because making available rented accommodation usually involves merely relatively minor internal reconstruction. In the event of relief being made available for rented accommodation the supply could increase to meet the increased demand very quickly.</P>
    <P>It is quite the opposite in making relief available for new house accommodation. It is not possible to make new house accommodation available quickly.  An increase in demand for new house accommodation generated by an increased housing grant, such as the present Government have made so much of introducing, is not going to be matched by an increased supply as quickly as would be an increased demand for rented accommodation, because it has to involve the purchase of new houses.  The concession for which the Government have the money to introduce &mdash; namely, the increased grant for new house accommodation &mdash; is certainly going to have the effect that the Minister mentioned of benefiting builders rather than home owners because supply cannot be increased physically quickly enough to match increased demand.  The opposite is the case in respect of the concessions <Col N="2884" /> sought in this amendment and, therefore, the case that the Minister has made has no substance.</P>
    <P>I do not know the basis upon which the Minister made the estimate of £40 million as the cost of this concession.  I am sure he is well aware that many landlords who are letting rented accommodation at the moment are not paying tax.  If tenants were able to claim their rent or even a part of their rent as relief against the tenant's income tax they would return the name of the landlord and in many cases this would lead to the identification for income tax purposes of landlords who hitherto had not been paying tax on the rents that they received.  Far from costing money, a concession of this nature could generate increased revenue.  The Minister, of course, in making his estimate took no account whatever of this phenomenon.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary's amendment may go too far in so far as it proposes to allow the whole of the rent up to a certain ceiling as allowable expenditure for expenses purposes on the part of the tenant. Even if a part of the rent were allowed, that would be my preference. That would have the effect of giving some relief to the tenant but it would also have the full effect of identifying landlords who have been avoiding income tax.  If the Minister wanted to make a constructive move in this direction he need not have gone the whole way with Deputy O'Leary's amendment but he could have introduced his own amendment which would have cost less because of restricting the relief to less than the whole of the rent payment for the purpose of the income tax of the tenant while at the same time having the full effect of identifying landlords who might not at the moment be paying tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adopted a shortsighted attitude in refusing this amendment, and it is significant that in this Finance Bill the same Minister proposes to give relief to landlords who build rented accommodation.  They are going to get tax relief, but the proposal to give relief to the tenants as proposed in Deputy O'Leary's amendment is rejected by the Minister.  We see his scale of priorities. <Col N="2885" /> He is happy to see an income tax relief going to landlords who build accommodation on the income that they might derive from the rents, but he is not happy to see any relief going to the tenant in respect of the tenant's income tax.  That indicates his approach and the type of people who have influence on him in making policy decisions.  It indicates a totally wrong scale of priorities and a wrong approach to the solution to this problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before line 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;For the year 1982-83 and any subsequent year of assessment the amount of reliefs and allowable deductions from the total income of an individual for income tax purposes, and the amounts specified in section 3 of this Act, shall be increased by the percentage figure as represented by the Consumer Price Index to mid-February of each year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 9 is to introduce indexation in the income tax code.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would not do this, but it is appropriate that this matter be considered on Report Stage also.  It is of great concern to working people in respect of their taxation that <Col N="2886" /> the Government are able, through what is euphemistically termed buoyancy of revenue &mdash; namely, the fact that tax allowances do not in many cases keep pace with inflation &mdash; to get increased revenue without the necessity of coming into the Dáil and getting sanction for that simply because inflation has devalued the allowances and a higher burden of real taxation is charged solely as a result of inflation without any approval by this House.  That is taxation by stealth, and indexation would remove the possibility of taxation by stealth &mdash; namely the increase in the real burden of taxation without the sanction of the Oireachtas &mdash; by increased allowances.  Indexation does not prevent a Government from increasing the real burden of taxation if they consider it necessary, but it does prevent the Government getting increased revenue without the sanction of the Oireachtas.  Consequently, this amendment is an appropriate one to be considered on Report Stage as it was regrettable that the Minister has not seen his way to accept this because it would not have prevented him from increasing revenue in future years.  It would merely make him do in the open what he and other Ministers of all parties have in the absence of indexation been able to do in the past by stealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is exactly the same as that put down by Deputy O'Leary on Committee Stage which was withdrawn after a very brief discussion.  I pointed out at that stage a number of things regarding indexation. Of course, there have been many calls for indexation of the personal allowances and the rate band structures, but I will demonstrate to the House again, as I did on Committee Stage, the progress that has been made in that whole area during the term of office of the present Government. Individual taxpayers have benefited to a far higher degree or extent than they would have done had the allowances and structures been linked to indexation. I said that in the budgets of 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981 the full year cost to the Exchequer of the improvement in the <Col N="2887" /> allowances in the rate band structures was £500 million.  During the period of those four budgets had indexation as suggested in this amendment been used, the full year cost would have been only £324 million.  Therefore the taxpayers because of the policies and because of the action of the Government have in fact run well ahead in that respect.  There is £176 million of a difference.  I can appreciate the Deputies opposite raising points like this because during the term of office of their Government this did not happen.</P>
      <P>The improvements have been substantial and have been well ahead of what they would have been had there been indexation.  I would also like to say that the Commission on Taxation must be looking at suggestions like this and when they report they may well have suggestions to make regarding this.  As I said, the taxpayers have benefited to a far greater extent than they would have done by indexation.  After a very brief discussion on Committee Stage the same amendment was withdrawn by Deputy O'Leary.</P>

    <P>I would like to point out to the House that there is a minor drafting correction to the amendment in paragraph (a) of the new section 17.  In the second line &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; should read &ldquo;subsections&rdquo;.  It is a minor drafting amendment.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to extend the relief from Corporation Tax provided by Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 1980, <Col N="2895" /> that is the 10 per cent scheme, to trading profits arising to companies from a number of areas: (1) Sales of cultivated mushrooms cultivated within the State; (2) sales of fish produced in a fish farm within the State; (3) repairs to ships carried out within the State and (4) engineering services, design and planning rendered in connection with certain engineering work executed outside the territories of the member states of the EEC where the work in connection with such services is carried out in the State and certain trading operations of non-manfacturing carried on at Shannon Airport.  That is mainly what is involved in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that when we replaced the export sales relief scheme with the new 10 per cent scheme I referred to, obviously certain approvals had to be obtained from the EEC.  Furthermore, approval for any subsequent alterations to it, such as are now suggested, will have to be obtained as well.  In the case of ship repairs full approval has been obtained. Approval in principle has been obtained in other areas and further discussions are taking place on the engineering services, design and planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the significance of the fact that the section to which I referred says: &ldquo;In determining what constitutes an initial investment for the purposes of this provision the Minister shall have regard to the principles for the time being applied by the Commission of the European Communities in accordance with the powers vested in it by Articles 92 to 94 of the EEC Treaty.&rdquo;  This does not say the Minister shall have regard to regulations made by the European Commission. If it were regulations made by the European Commission people who wished to know what their position was in regard to this relief would be able to refer to some legal tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2896" /> The section says &ldquo;the principles applied by the Commission of the European Communities&rdquo;.  These may be administrative principles which are not formulated anywhere in statute, European or Irish.  People, therefore, wishing to know their position have, within the terms of this amendment, no means of doing so because it merely refers to administrative principles.  I cannot see how legislation such as ours should include administrative principles applied by an agency outside the State which need not necessarily be formulated in writing.  The idea of our making legislation based on what the Commission officials may informally say to someone else in the Community and making the effectiveness or otherwise of our legislation contingent on that type of negotiation, of which people in this country may be quite unaware of and have no means of becoming aware, is introducing into our legislation something which should not be in it.  It makes the legislation so completely imprecise as to be valueless.  What does the Minister mean by the terms he has used in this context?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are specifically referring to the Shannon operations.  That condition limits the extent to which existing companies in Shannon, who have qualified under the Shannon exemption scheme, will be able to avail of the new relief.  Details of how it will operate have yet to be finalised with the Commission.  The legislation, as it is presently drafted, provides that the Minister will not certify any existing trading operations as relevant trading operations for the purpose of the new relief unless certain initial investment has been undertaken.  This latter term &ldquo;initial investment&rdquo; has a technical meaning in the context of the principles laid down by the Commission for the co-ordination of regional aid systems.  That is basically the reasons for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the discussions to extend that scheme it was agreed that the relief would be granted subject to the principles laid down by the Commission.  The benefits and the advantages are obvious.  The <Col N="2897" /> Deputy asked why such a section is inserted.  The reason is, as I have tried to explain to him, that the principles will be based on the concept of aids to initial investment for jobs creation.  It is in the interests, basically, of extra jobs in that particular region and the aid that existed under the export sales relief to that type of industry in the Shannon region.  It is merely endeavouring to assist those industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the principles now applied by the Commission in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are based on a concept of aids to initial investment or jobs created and specify limits to such aids for different regions in the Community. In the case of the services sector, if aids were limited by reference to initial investments, little aid could be granted to that sector in comparison with the manufacturing sector.  It is the alternative measure by reference to aid per job created which applies to this sector.  Details of the principles have yet to be worked out with the Commission but they are in the interest of these extra jobs in the Shannon region.</P>

We are trying to identify non-manufacturing companies at Shannon which can avail of this relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that a company with a project which is receiving aid of less than 17,500 u.a. shall not be subject to any control by the Commission? What is the relevance of the figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The relief will be available only to new activities starting on or after 1 January 1981, the date the 10 per cent scheme was introduced. Existing activities which qualified for relief under the Shannon exemption scheme may, however, qualify provided there has been a fundamental change in the carrying on of those activities involving new investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now saying that existing activities at Shannon shall not qualify for the 10 per cent corporation tax unless they are involved in new investment.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and these are the details we are trying to work out at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that new activities undertaken on or after 1 January 1981 will qualify for this purpose. How can a firm which is contemplating investment at the moment or has made investments in the last five months know in the light of this section whether it qualifies when the Minister is unable to tell us the principles being applied by the <Col N="2899" /> Community in regard to this matter?</P>
      <P>Presumably these companies will be liable to tax in respect of new activities from 1 January 1981.  On what basis will they be taxed between the period 1 January 1981 and the date when these new principles are enunciated by the Commission? If it transpires that the Commission laid down principles which are at variance with what that company expected when the investment was made, will they find that, in respect of incomes received from 1 January, they will be at a higher rate of tax than the 10 per cent rate they expected?  This is the point I have been trying to make all along.</P>
      <P>Although this section is extremely long, detailed and wordy, it means little or nothing and provides no guidance simply because there is no guidance as to what the principles are.  I do not understand why the term &ldquo;principles&rdquo; is used. The Minister referred to Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty of Rome.  Article 94 says:</P>
      <P>The Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, make any appropriate regulations for the application of Articles 92 and 93 and may in particular determine the conditions in which Article 93 (3) shall apply and the categories of aid exempted from this procedure.</P>
      <P>Given that there is specifically a power in Article 94 to make regulations to apply Articles 92 and 93, I do not understand why the Minister refers to &ldquo;principles&rdquo;, instead of saying, in determining what constitutes an investment, that the Minister shall have regard to actual regulations, which he is empowered to make under Article 94, which will be in writing, and to which people can refer and know exactly where they stand.  These principles are not referred to in any article of the Treaty of Rome.  There is no procedure whereby principles may be enunciated under any of the three articles referred to by the Minister.  How will people know whether they are entitled to the 10 per cent rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section is designed as an incentive to invest, people will have to know <Col N="2900" /> before they make the investment if they are eligible.  We are using this section as an incentive to invest not only in the future but also to investments which may have taken place since 1 January.  Yet those people have no means of knowing whether they are eligible for the 10 per cent rate.  That is not much of an incentive. I would like the Minister to indicate why he is using the term &ldquo;principles&rdquo;, and what are the principles in operation at the moment?  He did not tell me about that.  He said something about an initial allowance in regard to investment but his answer was not even a sentence with a verb&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been listening to a lecture from Deputy Bruton, obviously delivered for the benefit of other people in the House.  He is reading well this weather, playing to that group of people.  We cannot deny him that privilege. We know too well what a malfunction he performed when he was in different Departments.  He is now the new found professor, lecturing us across the House.  Let me educate him.  The principles he referred to are those laid down in a communication from the Commission in February 1975, referring to regional aid throughout the Community.  It goes on to state that the Commission, with experts from member states, may sit down and discuss the details of how to co-ordinate and avoid distortions in different areas, or to adjust the principles to areas such as those we are trying to cover here, that is, the introduction at Shannon of assistance for new and existing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy should known, existing companies will have relief available to them until 1990 in the form of Shannon <Col N="2901" /> export sales relief, if they so wish.  New companies, if they have fewer than 50 employees, are not restricted as to the amount of relief.  That is the position we are endeavouring to incorporate here in the interests of generating further activity in Shannon.  When the Deputy across tries to lecture me, I am saying to him that while this Government are here, and we will be here for a long time, we will continue to ensure that by every means open to us the principles of 1975 will be applied to the best advantage of the various parts of Ireland so that there will be additional job creation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me the Deputy is opposing this section.  If he is, let him come out and say so.  If he does not want to have this aid extended to Shannon industries let him tell us, or is he arguing against our negotiating details of the principles that he does not know about but which were contained in a communication from the Commission of 26 February 1975 and relating back to 1 January 1975?  The Government will continue to negotiate the details of those principles to the best advantage of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for at last telling me where the principles are to be found.  If I had not pursued the matter we would not have known that the principles are contained in the communication of 26 February 1975.  Indeed people who might have been concerned to avail of such aid would not have known about it because during the debate on this section there has not been any mention or any explanation of the communication or where the principles were formulated. The Minister said the principles are in a communication of the Commission.  A communication to whom?  Where and for whom was it published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have got that far.  Would the Minister please tell me what are the principles?  This is the first reference I have heard or seen to this communication in the debate or in the <Col N="2902" /> section.  As an Opposition Deputy as competent as anybody else at trying to interpret the laws of the land, I did not have any way of knowing about the existence of this obscure 1975 communication addressed to someone as yet unstated. Apparently that communication is to determine the meaning of legislation we are trying to enact in 1981.  Not having had the opportunity to see the communication in time, the Minister might have been sufficiently thoughtful to let me know that this was relevant to the section. If he had let me know I would have read the communication.</P>
      <P>Not having read the document, would the Minister tell me what are the principles contained in the communication, in broad terms?  One cannot determine the significance of this section if one does not know the details of the principles.  Apparently details of the principles still have to be worked out.  What has been worked out and what remains to be worked out and when will the negotiations be concluded?</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to pretend I am opposed to the section because I asked questions about what the section meant. Of course I am not opposed to the section. I am in favour of relief by way of grants to industries, but relief for which people do not know whether they qualify or not is worthless.  It is in order to ensure that the relief will be sufficient and that people will know whether they qualify for it and therefore make the investment we are all trying to encourage that I have been asking the Minister to explain these matters.  Instead of making partisan points, I would have thought the Minister would have welcomed the fact that I had sought details so that the section would become more fully understood and so that the objective we all have in common, to encourage the establishment of industries, would be more fully achieved.  I am surprised the Minister has adopted this attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept responsibility to tell any Opposition spokesman what his role should be.  He should do his homework, as I had to do in my Opposition days.  However, I will <Col N="2903" /> try to give him as much information as I can on the position that applies now.  The principles are based on the concept of aid to industry for jobs created and they specify limits to such aids for different regions of the Community.  In the case of the services sector, if aids were limited by reference to initial investments, relatively little aid could be granted to that sector in comparison with, say, the manufacturing sector.  The alternative method for applying aid in respect of jobs created is applied to this sector because obviously there is a different structure in the services sector, as the Deputy should be aware.</P>
      <P>Under the principles currently applicable, the maximum aid for jobs created from 1 January 1981 is £12,106.  The Commission have agreed that businesses below a certain size would not be subject to any limit on aid because, being small, their effect on Community trade is insignificant, and it has been agreed that for the services sector the criterion used in identifying the size of the business being carried on should be the number of employees and that for the purpose of identifying non-manufacturing companies at Shannon, any company with fewer than 50 employees will be regarded as not subject to any limit on relief.  However, any company with 50 or more employees must be subject to a limit, to be determined in accordance with the principles.  The details to be worked out, therefore, are in respect of companies with more than 50 employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Where, obviously, is between our own people here and the Commission.  When?  As soon as possible. I am not in a position yet to say when specifically.  But it is a matter of urgency that is being pursued with all possible speed in the interests of employment in Shannon.  With regard to the maximum which has yet to be agreed, I was going to give the Deputy those points.  It can be <Col N="2904" /> identified by reference to a number of things &mdash; the number of employees, the reference rate which will be changed from year to year, and it appears that there will be a rate particular to the beginning of each accounting period, the exchange rate and the period over which relief is granted.  These are details that have yet to be worked out but will obviously be pursued quickly in order to get the maximum benefit for that type of activity in the Shannon region.  The Deputy asked why it was introduced in this Bill, and why it could not be finalised before the introduction of this section. The Deputy will appreciate that if I had not brought in this amendment it could not have been introduced until next year's Finance Bill and I believed that it was important enough to introduce it in this year's Finance Bill despite the fact that some of the details have yet to be finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will the details be set out?  Will they be set out in any regulation which can be referred to by people wishing to know whether or not they qualify?  Will it be merely an administrative agreement between the Minister and the Commission?  If that is the case it would be unsatisfactory for people wishing to know whether or not they qualify because it would not be accessible in a public document.</P>

      <P>On the question of the employees, the Revenue Commissioners will be making the regulations.  In the other areas it will be a matter for the Minister for Finance when the communications are received from the Commission and, of course, they will be available through the normal channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not provide for the making of regulations.  Subsection (9) says that the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to subsection (8)(a) and to provide for any ancillary or consequential matters.  But there is no provision in the section for the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations in respect of subsection (2)(b) which is the <Col N="2905" /> section in respect of which the Minister says regulations will be made.  I would like to know under what power these regulations will be made.  I will repeat that for the Minister when he is finished.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the regulations will be made to set out these details.  The section, however, does not confer powers for the making of regulations for this purpose.  There is a power for making regulations in respect of subsection (8) but there is no regulation-making power in respect of subsection (2)(b).

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier to the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners would make regulations in respect of employee numbers.  The Minister would then issue a certificate in respect of the other criteria.  Subsection (2)(a) and (b) means that it is at the Minister's discretion to decide whether to issue a certifircate or not when the details have been worked out.  That discretion rests with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the basis upon which the Minister may or may not decide to issue a certificate is to be laid down not by the Minister but on the basis of principles applied by the Commission of the European Communities. To say that the Minister may or may not grant a certificate is not an answer to the problem because people will not know whether or not the Minister will be able to issue such a certificate unless they know what the principles are. The Minister said that these principles would, in part, be laid down in regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the number of employees. I pointed out that there is no power in the Bill for the making of such regulations. I will repeat what I am concerned about here.  Will the conditions be sufficiently precise for people to know whether they qualify or not and to know therefore, whether it is worth their while seeking to set up this investment in Shannon? <Col N="2906" /> I would like the Minister to indicate how these powers are going to be exercised.</P>

An initial investment would be interpreted as investment in fixed assets, the creation of a new establishment, extension of an existing establishment or engaging in an activity involving a fundamental change in the process of an existing establishment.  Investment in fixed assets by way of the taking over of an establishment which was closed or would have closed had such takeover not taken place would also be deemed as an initial investment.  The manner in which initial investment is defined is identified in the regional aid systems of the Member States and will be examined by the Commission in the course of its review of existing aid systems under Article 93 (1) of the EEC Treaty.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism will give a licence to operate.  If this is forthcoming the Minister for Finance may if the request complies with the details of the interpretations, issue a certificate in respect of the company.</P>

      <P>Then how will people know whether they qualify or not?  The whole purpose of legislation and the purpose of this sort of debate is so that people will know what the law is after these provisions have been made.  The Minister is now telling us that the applicability of this section will be determined by agreements which will not be published. We are wasting our time discussing this section if its applicability is based on agreements which have not been made and when made will not be published. The Minister will accept that it is not a satisfactory way in which to encourage investment here, to make laws which are so obscure that people will not know whether or not they qualify.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy who had a brief innings in the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Deputy is far removed from the scene.  If we pursued the Deputy's line the details of every IDA project would have to be discussed here.  This is enabling legislation to benefit the Shannon region and not a great number will be involved in it.  From his brief experience on the fringes of the Department of Industry and Commerce the Deputy should be aware that certain exemptions have existed in Shannon.  The details here relate to initial investment aid.  The Revenue people will make regulations in relation to the number of employees but under the existing Shannon exemption scheme a certificate is given at the Minister's discretion and there are no published rules or regulations.  The Deputy is not with it, possible due to lack of experience.  If we were to lay down rigid guidelines we would inhibit rather than encourage and promote industrial development. If the Deputy is opposed to the help we are trying to give to the Shannon region he should say so.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to elicit from the Minister what the section means.  I regret that the Minister has to engage in personal remarks so as to get time to be briefed by his officials in order to answer my question.  It is a pity that the Minister cannot answer the question without making a lot of irrelevant remarks at my expense which are merely taking up the time of the House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of incentives is to encourage people from abroad to locate here. The IDA have the job of selling Ireland abroad and this section and the incentives in it will be one of the major ways in which to encourage investment particularly in the Shannon region.  The IDA and others concerned with promoting Ireland, the private individuals who may meet foreign industrialists, might wish to explain the incentives available here.  If I met a foreign industrialist I would like to be able to tell him what incentives are available but the problem in regard to this section is that the Minister is not able to say what the incentives are because he cannot say whether or not he would be able to issue a certificate under this section because the principles under which he may be able to do it are not yet agreed with the Commission and even when they are agreed they will not be published. People would like to know whether they can qualify, in advance of sending somebody from abroad at considerable expense to talk to the IDA.  Having gone to that expense they could well discover that they did not qualify on the basis of agreements which have not been published and to which the Minister refers in this section.  Why is the Minister not prepared to publish the agreements?  If the Minister were to say that the agreements would be published we would know that when an agreement was entered into it would be published and people would be able to know whether or not they qualified. Will the Minister be so kind as to indicate that he will publish agreements? If that is done I will be satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have some idea of the confidentiality involved in the approach to projects of <Col N="2909" /> this nature.  We do not lay down in public the IDA criteria for any project and the IDA have been extremely successful.  We are talking here about the Shannon Airport area which is controlled by SFADCo.  The necessity is there for a licence by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism to operate there in the first place and a certificate from the Minister for Finance is also necessary.  As the amendment says, a certificate may be given with or without conditions as the Minister considers appropriate.  New companies know in advance that they are subject only to a restriction of over 50 employees because in their case the term &ldquo;initial investment&rdquo; is not relevant.  The certificate under the existing Shannon exemption scheme is at the Minister's discretion and each case is looked at on its merits.  After Commission principles are communicated, they are published in the Official Journal but not in advance. I am not trying, as the Deputy seems to infer, to hesitate to lay down rules and regulations but I am taking into account the practicality of doing it as it should be done.  We are basically talking about initial investment.  The Deputy seems to be saying that we should publish certain regulations.  I put it to the Deputy that each project can be totally different and it is unreal for him to talk about laying down certain rules in that sort of situation. There is no change in what is happening at present in respect of the issue of certificates other than where we are talking about the initial investment where certain details have to be worked out. New companies know in advance that they are subject to a restriction of over 50 employees.  In the Shannon region we are talking about mostly small industries employing sometimes considerably fewer than 50 employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is exaggerating.  Basically this amendment introduces tax changes in respect of a group of things &mdash; including the Shannon Airport region.  It is in the interests of encouraging further activities in that region.  Since the fifties successive Governments have treated it as an exempted area.  What we are doing here in the main is merely giving a concession to some small employers and it is <Col N="2910" /> certainly in the interests of jobs in the Shannon area.  There is nothing sinister or wrong in what I am doing here.  The certificate under the existing Shannon exemption scheme is at the Minister's discretion.  There are no published rules and regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of certificates is not at the Minister's discretion.  It is quite clear that in determining an initial investment for the purpose of issuing a certificate he is bound by the principles laid down in Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore it is not at the Minister's discretion.  The Minister has also said that the interpretation of these principles shall be contained in an agreement entered into by the Minister with the Commission of the European Communities. That would be an agreement made once and for all which would apply henceforth.  I asked the Minister would that agreement be published and he said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I cannot understand how anyone could know on what basis the Minister would issue a certificate unless the terms of the agreement entered into are known. I cannot understand how the Minister would wish to conceal from the public the terms of an agreement which he will enter into in the future with the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe for one moment that there is anything sinister in this, but there may be something sloppy, or something that will not work involved in this, simply because if one does not publish the basis upon which the Minister may issue certificates, no one knows where he or she stands.  I never said that I wanted to know, or have published, the details of individual negotiations with individual firms.  I am not concerned with that at all. What I am interested in are the principles of criteria for the granting of certificates, those principles which will be contained in an agreement which the Minister says will not be published.  How can one interpret principles on the basis of an unpublished agreement?  As I said, the Minister <Col N="2911" /> does not have discretion because he is subject to these principles, which are not only obscure at the moment but, if one is to understand correctly, will remain obscure.  How can the Minister, or I or anyone else, in whatever capacity we may be, going abroad to try to sell this country and to get people to locate their industries in Shannon, sell it on the grounds that these people may get the 10 per cent tax relief if they qualify on the basis of principles which are contained in an agreement which we will not publish? One would not be in a very strong position to try to sell this country on that basis and that is what I am trying to elicit from the Minister and get him to elucidate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy used the word &ldquo;sloppy&rdquo; and I would not agree with that.  It may be true to say that this is premature, but it is sensible and desirable that it should be.  One could, of course, in typical conservative style, wait until next year's Finance Bill to introduce this and allow a year to go by when all the details of interpretation and so on had been worked out with the Commission. I would not like to do that, because a whole year would be lost.  The Deputy has said that we are somewhat premature but we are premature in the interests of the Shannon region and I hope that the Deputy will accept that.  Interpretation of the principles is one thing but changes in those interpretations obviously will be communicated and will be, as the communications themselves are, in the <i>Official Journal.</i></P>

He has selected in this amendment a particularly small area, I wish it were very much bigger, but it is particularly small.  We are talking about services within the confines of the Shannon region, for the most part about small service industries.  This section is largely a framework for the relief to which I have referred.  Changes in the interpretation of principles by the EEC will, of course, be published; but at the end of a day a certificate, with or without conditions, must be issued by the Minister for Finance.

So far as I know the term used was &ldquo;closely akin to manufacturing&rdquo;.  Because of that situation we considered ourselves justified in having the concession extended to these two areas, but the Deputy will appreciate the difficulties of extending it further.

      <P>The application of the 10 per cent rate to an additional sector of the economy would appear to me not to be something that could be determined <Col N="2917" /> to be contrary to EEC rules.  If the Minister were to decide in the morning that he wished to apply the 10 per cent rate in order to retain profits in agriculture as distinct from the income taken up by the farmers &mdash; I am not asking the Minister to do this but I should like to have the matter clarified since the farming organisations are looking for this concession &mdash; would that be contrary to EEC rules? If so the farming organisations who have been seeking this 10 per cent rate would like to be made so aware.</P>

      <P>I am not saying specifically that that is the case but such a situation could possibly be described by the EEC as amounting to aids to agriculture. However, this is a totally different area.  We are not talking about bringing in sectors who are not included already in the old scheme but we are trying to accommodate within the new scheme some of those who enjoyed the benefits that applied under the old export sales scheme.  I appreciate the reason for the Deputy mentioning agriculture, particularly when fish production and mushroom cultivation have been mentioned, but both these activities benefited under the old scheme.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy is talking about involves an entirely different area because it would not be confined to agriculture.  There would be the construction and many other sectors also to be considered. Apart from the question raised by the Deputy as to whether there could be problems with the EEC in respect of any such move, there is the whole question of budgetary considerations, of how taxes are imposed and so on.  This would be going back to the Commission on Taxation, to what is their view on corporation tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that fish farming and mushroom cultivation are analagous to manufacturing.  The Minister is aware that poultry and egg production and, to a large extent, pig production, are analagous to manufacturing because of the intensive nature of such production.  While there might be a case for not extending this to all of agriculture, those aspects are so industrialised that there could be a case there.  I can see at some future date the Minister wishing to assist those sectors by applying the 10 per cent rate to them.  I should like to know if that can be done now and that is the reason I am raising this issue.</P>

The other forms of production mentioned by the Deputy were not.  The Deputy can take it that there will be no objections to that development.</P>

    <P>Provided that where the house is sold more than once before it is used, the provisions of this subsection shall have effect only in relation to the last of those sales.</P>
    <P>(b) Where expenditure is incurred on the construction of a house by a person carrying on a trade or part of a trade which consists, as to the whole or any part thereof, of the construction of buildings with a view to their sale and the house, before it is used, is sold in the course of that trade or, as the case may be, that part of that trade, the person who buys the house shall be treated, for the purposes of this section, as having incurred in the qualifying period expenditure on the construction of the house equal to the relevant price paid by him on the said sale (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as `the first sale') and, in relation to any subsequent sale or sales of the house before the house is used, paragraph (a) shall have effect as if the reference to the amount of expenditure which falls to be treated as having been incurred in the qualifying period were a reference to the said relevant price paid on the first sale. (8)  A house shall not be a qualifying premises if it is occupied as a dwelling by any person who is connected with the person who is entitled, in relation to the expenditure incurred on the construction of the house, to a deduction under subsection (2), and the terms of the qualifying lease in relation to the house are not such as might have been <Col N="2927" /> expected to be included in the lease if the negotiations for the lease had been at arm's length.</P>
    <P>(9)  A house shall not be a qualifying premises unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it complies with such conditions, if any, as may be determined by the Minister for the Environment from time to time for the purposes of section 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, in relation to standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services therein, and</P>
    <P>(b)  persons authorised in writing by the Minister for the Environment for the purposes of this section are permitted to inspect it at all reasonable times upon production, if so requested by a person affected, of their authorisations.</P>
    <P>(10)  Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, shall have effect as if a deduction under subsection (2) were a capital allowance and as if any amount by way of rent deemed to have been received by a person under subsection (5) were a balancing charge.</P>
    <P>(11)  An appeal to the Appeal Commissioners shall lie on any question arising under this section or under section 23, other than a question on which an appeal lies under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, in like manner as an appeal would lie against an assessment to income tax or corporation tax and the provisions of the Tax Acts relating to appeals shall apply and have effect accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 are connected and they have the effect of replacing sections 22 and 23 of the Bill as passed in Committee by two new sections.  The provisions in question provide for a special allowance of 100 per cent of construction expenditure, including certain costs of conversion of existing buildings, incurred after budget day and before 1 April 1984 in the provision of moderate-cost <Col N="2928" /> rented residential accomodation. I appreciate that the Deputy was rather critical of this decision earlier and I should like to make a number of points in relation to this now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not in relation to this section.  The Financial Resolution related to another one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as usual, is incorrect.  This morning the Deputy was criticising this move by the Government in arguing another amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that there are many valid reasons for this move.  There is first of all the stimulus it will give to increased employment in the building construction industry.  We are all aware that housing lists in urban areas are a matter of concern to the Government, local authorities and the community, and I hope that the introduction of the sections in the Finance Bill will aid both areas substantially.  The activity generated not only within the building industry but also in the allied related distribution industries should be compensatory factors. I intimated to the House on Committee Stage that the existing sections were being replaced in their entirety because they required a number of amendments, the bulk of which are of a technical nature although one or two involve substantive changes.  I shall try to explain what is involved.</P>
      <P>The most important change is that, in the case of a flat, the new tax relief will not be given where the total floor area exceeds 75 square metres, about 800 square feet.  This new maximum floor area, which replaces the existing maximum of 125 square metres, will operate to exclude luxury flats from the scope of the relief while retaining the incentive for flats of moderate size.  Another major change will provide that a certificate of reasonable value must be in force where a new house or flat is purchased from a builder and subsequently let by the purchaser. This will ensure that relief will not be given to persons who buy premises for letting which are not regarded by the Minister for the Environment as representing reasonable value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2929" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reasonable value at the time of building or at the time of purchase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Reasonable value for what it costs at the time of purchase. I will deal with the point later.  This will ensure that relief will not be given to persons who buy premises for letting which are not regarded by the Minister for the Environment as representing reasonable value.  That is extremely important and hence the need for a certificate of reasonable value.  Where a house or flat is let by the person who built it or had it built, there will, of course, be no sale price and in these cases there is no change in the requirement that a certificate of reasonable cost should be obtained.  It has been urged that expenditure already incurred before budget day should qualify for relief.  In fact some Deputies opposite made that point last week.  One of the technical amendments &mdash; subsection (1) (b) of the new section 22 &mdash; makes it clear that any expenditure related to work carried out in the qualifying period will qualify for relief so that houses or flats in the course of construction on budget day will get relief for that port of the expenditure relating to work done after that date.  To allow relief for all expenditure incurred where a house is partly constructed before budget day would be inconsistent with the main intention of the sections which is to stimulate new investment leading to new building activity and employment creation in the building and allied industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, new capital allowances normally operate from a date not earlier than budget day and are confined to expenditure incurred after budget day. Before dealing with the section in detail I should like to point out that the proposed relief for the provision of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation has been widely welcomed both for the assistance it will give to the construction industry and for the effect it will have in adding medium-priced houses and flats to the pool of rented accommodation throughout the country. <Col N="2930" /> I have just set out in general what is involved in the sections.  Does the Deputy wish to make any point at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (a) in the definition of &ldquo;lease&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(which for the purposes of this section includes an unwritten agreement to any tenancy)&rdquo; after &ldquo;lease&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to encourage the provision of rented accommodation. For the purpose of deciding whether accommodation qualifies as rented accommodation the section states that it shall be leased or subject to a lease to a tenant.  My amendment seeks to determine whether or not &ldquo;lease&rdquo; in this context will include the type of unwritten weekly agreement which applies to much of flat accommodation in this city and in other towns.  As the Minister is no doubt aware, most people living in bedsitters or flats are not there subject to a written lease.  They are there subject to an agreement whereby they may stay there each week more or less at the discretion of the owner.  This is the position with furnished accommodation but not with unfurnished accommodation.  I am putting forward this amendment not because I think necessarily that it might be a good thing, in fact, I think the amendment might be the wrong thing to do.  I am putting it forward simply to find out exactly what is the position.  Will people who set up accommodation with a view to letting it in this way &mdash; unsatisfactory from the point of view of the tenant in that he or she does not have any clear statement of his or her rights &mdash; be capable of benefiting from this concession?  That is the purpose of the first amendment.  The second amendment is in a sense related in that it is concerned to ensure that people who let accommodation having availed or availing of the tax concession conferred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The second amendment is to ensure that people who benefit from this concession in so far as they may be relieved of tax on the rent they received from accommodation after the coming into force of this section shall charge fair rents and operate on a fair basis.  The amendment which I am putting in here is obviously not complete in the sense that it merely says &ldquo;to the fairness of the tenancy agreement&rdquo; as one of the things which may be determined by the Minister for the Environment in determining whether a person is qualified.  Obviously, one would need to be more precise as to what one means.  Again, my amendment here is not concerned with changing the law but merely with raising a question which I think the Minister would need to answer.</P>
      <P>To sum up, the purpose of my two amendments, which are designed more to elicit information than to change the section is to ask (1) will someone who lets property on an unwritten agreement qualify for this section, the unwritten agreement, of course, being unsatisfactory in any respect from the point of view of the tenant, (2) is there any power within this section to prevent relief being obtained by people who charge unfair rents or operate tenancy subsequently on a basis unfair to the tenant?  Having made those two points I would like to comment on one point which arose in the Minister's introduction to the section.</P>

      <P>What happens to a certificate of reasonable value where the property is built by one person who obtains a CRV in relation to it and sells it to someone else who then sells it &mdash; for instance if there is a delay?  I build a property and a CRV is given, say, in February of 1982. There is a delay of two or three months. Meanwhile property values go up, as they tend to, and I sell the property three months later to another person at a price higher that that related to the CRV because there has been an intervening period during which property values had gone up, and that is a perfectly legitimate operation.  Will the other person be able to avail of the relief, having bought it at a price in excess of that related to the CRV, having bought it later than the CRV was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The first of Deputy Bruton's amendments seeks to ensure that the term &ldquo;lease&rdquo; will be treated as excluding an unwritten agreement to any tenancy.  The definition in section 80 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which is used for the purpose of this section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;lease&rdquo; includes an agreement for a lease and any tenancy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows from this that any tenancy agreement, written or unwritten, is covered by the definition and the term is interpreted in this broad way for the purposes of taxation of rental income.  As regards the present section, as long as the lessor is receiving rent from the premises under any lease or tenancy he may claim relief under the section for appropriate <Col N="2933" /> construction expenditure.  In the circumstances the amendment proposed appears to be unnecessary.  As the Deputy said, he is taking questions as much as anything else by way of these amendments.</P>
    <P>On the related amendment, section 22 (9) (a) provides that the premises shall not qualify for relief under this section unless, and I quote&mdash;</P>
    <P>it complies with such conditions, if any, as may be determined by the Minister for the Environment from time to time for the purposes of section 4 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, in relation to standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services therein...</P>
    <P>There is no provision in that Act for the imposition of conditions relating to the fairness of a tenancy.  The fairness of a tenancy obviously is something referred to by the Deputy in his amendment and that question is a matter between landlord and tenant and is very much dependent on the circumstances of each case.  It would not be fair to expect an inspector of taxes to exercise a judicial role in such a matter and in the absence of a provision in general law, which would be a matter for other legislation such as the Housing Act to which I have referred.  There is no way in which a condition as to fairness of tenancies could be attached to this section, or, if there is, it is in another area.  If such a condition could be imposed it might be necessary for the purposes of policing it to exclude from the relief all unwritten tenancies because their fairness could not be demonstrated and they could well be the fairest of all.  It would be impossible to set criteria for determining fairness, because the terms of a tenancy are those agreed between the landlord and tenant.  As long as the terms do not involve any breach of the law it is not clear how anything other than a subjective view of their fairness could be taken.  If the rent seems high, it was, after all, agreed at the time of the tenancy.  If it or any other matter is not in accordance with the tenancy agreement, <Col N="2934" /> recourse to the courts would be available.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the general question of legislation relating to private rented accommodation is being reviewed by the Minister for the Environment, and that is appropriate.  As I have said, it is unfair to expect the inspector of taxes to operate to some extent in a policing role and to try to adjudicate on whether a tenancy is fair or otherwise.  When I say it is being reviewed by the Minister for the Environment, as the Deputy knows, certain aspects are before the Supreme Court at present in the matter of constitutionality and no doubt my colleague, Deputy R. Burke, will be looking at those very closely.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to ask the question about the transfer after three months.  This is the kind of section that I like to hear the Deputy debating on because a lot of soul-searching has gone into preparing this section and I would be interested in hearing any points made by him.  He referred to the delay in sales. We have covered the situation where the sale takes place after a period.  In other words, if A, after a period of years, having claimed the tax relief, disposes of the property within three or four years, there is a clawback in that case against the original owner.  The new purchaser gains the benefit for the remaining years up to the maximum of 10 years.</P>
    <P>The case the Deputy referred to was where the builder builds and fails to sell or, for some reason, holds the property, presumably without renting it, and then sells it.  We will say, for argument's sake, that it was built in February 1981 and that a certificate of reasonable value has been granted for a figure of £40,000.  If there is a delay up to December of that year, for example, he may then sell the house to the purchaser.  If he sells at an increased price he will, of necessity, have to go to the Department of the Environment for a further certificate of reasonable value, which he may not get, depending on whether the new increased selling price is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is probably trying to ensure that there is not a speculative effort by someone to make a profit on the <Col N="2935" /> transaction and then add the benefit to the new person by way of income tax relief.  There is no reason why the original builder cannot sell but there is no guarantee that he will be able to get a certificate of reasonable value at the new price. That would be a matter for the Department of the Environment to decide at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain what he means by a clawback? He said that if a person had built the accommodation, rented it and availed of the tax relief for three or four years in respect of the rent received, then sold it to somebody else who could continue benefiting, the first party would be subject to a clawback.  I do not see why he should be subject to a clawback because he has only availed of a tax relief to the extent of the rent received by him as a means of compensating for the costs he has already incurred.  If the rent did not exceed the costs incurred he would not have availed of the relief to the full so he would be passing on the ability to somebody else to avail of the remainder of the relief available to him in the form of a relief on the subsequent landlord's income tax.  That fact would be reflected in the price at which the property was sold because the person buying it would know he or she had a certain amount of tax relief which was also being bought from the owner of the property.  I cannot see how there would be any need for a clawback in that situation because the amount of tax relief claimed by the initial landlord is already limited by the costs incurred and the amount of income tax for which he would be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This, basically, is a <Col N="2936" /> provision to prevent the allowance being used for any other reasons than what it is intended it would be.  The relief is against rental income not necessarily related entirely to the project.  It is a tax relief against rented income.  If A sells after four or five years he would not be selling for the good of anybody's health.  There would be a profit element in it.  The income relief allowed for the period for which it was rented would be a clawback. The purchaser could avail of the balance of the remaining years up to 10 years.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (5) provides for a clawback if during the period of 10 years the premises cease to be let or otherwise cease to be a qualified premises.  It could be extended beyond the space limitations we have laid down in the section or it could be sold by the landlord.  The clawback will be effected by deeming the landlord to have received an amount by way of rent sufficient to cancel the deduction received by him or which under the section he would be entitled to receive at that time.  In effect, the clawback matches the relief already given which can at that time be claimed.</P>
      <P>It may be argued that only a portion of the relief allowed to the person disposing of the premises should be clawed back and a correspondingly reduced amount allowed as a deduction to the successor. However, the granting of the allowance is conditional on certain criteria being met in relation to the house for a period of 10 years.  If a person divests himself of a house in the relevant period, he is also divesting himself of the responsibility to satisfy the criteria and is passing the responsibility on to the successor.  If the full clawback was not made at the time the premises changed hands the successor might breach the conditions under which relief was due and at that time it might not be possible to recover the relief granted to the original owner.  If the new owner did any of the things I have mentioned earlier that could put it outside the terms of the scheme, this could give rise to various schemes whereby qualifying premises might, for the purpose of tax avoidance, be transferred between connected persons prior to a change of use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2937" /> For that reason the clawback I have referred to is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complicated section and it is very difficult to understand what it is all about.  The fact that it has only been introduced in the last few days does not help matters.  The new section 22 states:</P>
      <P>Where a person, having made a claim in that behalf, proves that he has incurred expenditure on the construction of a qualifying premises, he shall be entitled, in computing for the purposes of subsection (4) of section 81 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the amount of a surplus or deficiency in respect of the rent from the said premises, to a deduction of so much (if any) of the expenditure as falls to be treated under any of the provisions of this section as having been incurred by him in the qualifying period...</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the amount of income tax relief he may claim is related to the amount of expenditure he undertook originally in building the premises.  That is my reading of this section but it seems to be different from what the Minister said.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is a limit.  I am trying to figure why there has to be a clawback because he can claim only as much in tax relief as he spent.  If that limit already exists and if he sells the premises within the ten year period not having availed of all the relief, why must there be a clawback on the relief he obtained?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The bones of these subsections have been before the Deputy for some weeks.  I admit new sections have been inserted because of the many amendments made, most of which were technical.  On the point the Deputy raised, there are two reasons why this would have to be the case.  In the first three years he is entitled to offset his income tax relief against rental income, not necessarily confined to the particular building we are talking about.  He may have <Col N="2938" /> got substantial relief over the three year period and he is now about to sell. Because of that, in justice, the clawback should be there and should be allowed to the new purchaser.  It can go on beyond ten years, but the proviso here is that he must hold it for ten years before the clawback disappears.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The other reason is that there might be a danger of manipulation if we did not have that clawback.  After five years he could hold the tax relief, then sell the premises for purposes of a change of use and it would no longer be rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the landlord could avail of all available relief related to the building cost in the first five years and in the sixth year, without selling the property, changes the use, can we clawback then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The clawback still applies.  Subsection (5) provides for a clawback of relief if during the relevant period of ten years the premises ceases to be let or otherwise ceases to be a qualifing premises, for example by extending the space limitations, or it is sold by the landlord or passes in any other shape or form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant period and the qualifying period are different.  Is there a definition of the relevant period anywhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Suppose the man who got the <Col N="2939" /> benefit of the tax relief died and for the purposes of winding up his estate to pay capital acquisitions tax his widow had to sell the premises, would she have to refund that amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a valid point. The clawback and allowances under subsection (5) will take place where a qualifying premises passes on a person's death and the appropriate allowance under subsection (6) (a) will then be made to that person's successor in title provided the premises continue to be a qualifying premises.  If the premises pass to a surviving spouse and continue to be used as a qualifying premises, it has been suggested that the provisions of subsections (5) and (6) (a) should not operate and the allowance should be treated as continuing without interruption.  This would obviate any hardship which might ensure from the clawback of relief from the estate of the deceased person, even though the full allowance is subsequently available to the successor.</P>
      <P>However, if as suggested, the provisions of subsections (5) and (6) (a) were not operated and if probate were taken out in the year of death&mdash;for example take year three&mdash;then by virtue of section 211 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, no additional assessment could be made in the deceased's estate after year six.  The surviving spouse could sell the premises after that time, say in the middle of year seven, and it would not be possible to assess the deceased's estate so as to recover the allowances which had not been clawed back.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i>: It does, if I understand the Minister. Say a man constructs a qualifying premises for residential purposes and within the first five years he has availed of all the tax reliefs to which he is entitled on the basis of his expenditure and then he dies, then, as I understand it, if the premises remain a qualifying residential premises and are not sold by the widow, there will not be a clawback.  If, for financial or other reasons, the widow has to <Col N="2940" /> sell the premises, will there be a clawback?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would not see difficulty in the earlier years because obviously we are talking about an extremely valuable property.  Under the relief provisions structure it is very unlikely that cases of hardship of the nature the Deputy is thinking about will arise for a number of years.  In the meantime, the terms will be reviewed before 1984 and that is the year in which to review the problem in the light of practical experience of serious hardships being encountered.  By 1984 the property will obviously be a valuable one.</P>

In order to pay acquisitions tax the widow might be forced to sell.  That is not the type of situation the Minister has been trying to deal with.  The type he is dealing with is a case where a property would be sold voluntarily to make a quick profit.  The Revenue Commissioners might force the widow to sell.</P>

      <P>I want to make the point that the Minister should consider this in the context of possible legislation to encourage people to draw up fair tenancy agreements.  What I am asking is that under new tenant legislation only agreements which are fair and comply with certain standards would be deemed to qualify for relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not foresee any major problems in the initial year.  Deputy Bruton spoke about allowance <Col N="2941" /> against capital acquisitions tax and I cannot foresee this as creating any hardship because the threshold is very high and the person concerned will have very valuable property.  I have all the sympathy in the world with the case made by Deputy Fitzpatrick but as I have said the matter will be coming for review in 1984 and it is extremely unlikely that hardship cases will arise in the meantime.  I sympathise also with Deputy Bruton's sentiments in regard to fair tenancy agreements, but the Finance Bill is not the appropriate vehicle to deal with that matter. The Minister for the Environment is investigating this area, and as well this area is the subject of an action in the courts and therefore is <i>sub judice.</i>  I share the Deputy's anxiety to have progress made in that area but it is a matter for the Department of the Environment.  The position at the moment is that there should be an unwritten tenancy which could be much fairer than any written one.  If we adopted the Deputy's suggestion we would be putting an impossible burden on the tax inspectors who would have to decide what are fair and unfair tenancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My theory is that the Minister may have dismissed too lightly the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself about hardship in the case of a widow.  It is all very well to say that a widow may be well off because she inherits valuable property, but suppose she gets a lot of property but no cash and as a result of her husband's tax allowance may still have to pay capital acquisitions tax as well as income tax.  The clawback of the income tax relief enjoyed by her husband would mean she would have to <Col N="2942" /> sell.  What little remained after the payment of capital acquisitions tax would go to pay the income tax.  The Minister has said this will not arise in the next year or two but the Act we are making here today will apply ultimately until 1994, ten years. In effect, there will not be an effective review until 1994.  Now is the time to remedy that situation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If I understand the position correctly, I do not think the Minister's argument that because the property is valuable and that it will be appreciating, there can be no hardship in the next few years, is valid.  There need not be, assuming that the deceased person had considerable assets or assuming that the deceased person was not heavily in debt. But there could be a case where his business went wrong and in fact he was not possessed of any money and was heavily in debt.  Even if he is heavily in debt, because he has availed of this income tax relief his widow will have to go further into debt to pay back the amount of the relief which her deceased husband had benefited by.  For that reason I say that the Minister's argument about there being no likelihood of hardship arising within the next few years is not a valid argument.  Hardship could arise and I think it is unfair.</P>

We are giving a rather generous concession and it is understood that there would be some conditions laid down.  The point was made here by both Deputies that the widow might be in difficulty.  But the widow in a capital acquisitions tax situation would not have any problem about taxation unless her property or assets realised more than £150,000.  That is a very sizeable sum.

      <P>I move amendment No. 13a:</P>
      <P>In page 26, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;CHAPTER VII</P>
      <P Just="Center">Profits or Gains from Dealing in or Developing Land </P>
      <P>27.&mdash;In relation to the computation for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax of the profits or gains or losses of any period ending on or after the 6th day of April, 1981, section 17 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) (a)  Where, apart from this section, all or some of the activities of a business of dealing in or developing land would not be regarded as activities carried on in the course of a trade within Schedule D but would be so regarded if every disposal of an interest in land included among such activities (including a disposal of an interest in land which, apart from this section, is a disposal of the full interest in the land which the person carrying on the business had acquired) were treated as fulfilling both of the conditions specified in paragraph (b), the business shall be deemed to be wholly a trade within Schedule D or, as the case may be, part of such a trade and the profits or gains thereof shall be charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D accordingly.</P>
      <P>(b)  The conditions referred to in paragraph (a) are:</P>
      <P>(i)  that the disposal was a disposal of the full interest in the land which the person carrying on the business had acquired, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the interest disposed of had been acquired by such person in the course of the business.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section that we brought in yesterday and which Deputy Bruton <Col N="2946" /> objected to as being a late entry at this stage of the Bill.  I apologise to Deputy Bruton and the other Deputies for introducing this section so late.  But having studied this problem of tax avoidance with the people concerned I felt justified in introducing this and I also felt that the Members opposite would agree that it was right to introduce it although I appreciate that it is later than one would have liked.</P>
    <P>The new provisions are designed to counter tax avoidance schemes in the land development area which are becoming more widespread and, if not stopped, would cost the Exchequer many millions of pounds.  I am well aware that the complex nature of the legislation and its late circulation will have given Deputies little time to study its terms in detail.  However, I hope that, when I have explained the background to its introduction, the House will agree that I had no alternative but to introduce it at this time.</P>
    <P>Over the past year or so the Revenue Commissioners have become aware of the prepartion of tax avoidance schemes in the area of land dealing and development, schemes which involve the operation of several artificial transactions and which are designed to deprive the Exchequer of the tax properly attributable to the profits derived from those developments.  The schemes already put into operation and those which, it is believed, are in course of preparation will, if successful, cost the Exchequer close to £30 million, a figure which will increase as the years go by.  The schemes devised involve multiple &mdash; and quite artificial &mdash; transactions in land between connected companies with the sole objective of dramatically reducing the tax base of the group of companies as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is a feature of this type of sophisticated tax avoidance scheme that the profits to be earned and which are planned to escape the proper tax charge do not emerge for a year or so after the scheme has been set in motion.</P>
    <P>Second, accounts are not presented to the Revenue until a considerable time after the transactions take place.  Thus, it was not until relatively recently that the Revenue were in a position to assess the <Col N="2947" /> full extent of what was happening and to consider what steps ought to be taken to counter these operations.  As will be appreciated, the drafting of the complex legislation now before the House was not an easy task but if it were not to be introduced now, a further year would be made available to tax planners to exploit these devices to the further detriment of the Exchequer and the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might give an illustration of what is happening and the artificial nature of the schemes devised, based on two actual cases at present before the Revenue, showing how the avoidance schemes have been designed to operate. One of the cases is based on a leasing operation and the other involves the creation of an annuity which is charged on the land to be developed.  It is important to note that, in each case, all the companies involved in the planned operation are within the same group.</P>
    <P>In the leasing case, a small piece of land was acquired at a cost of £40,000 and flats were built, which brought the total cost to £200,000.  The associated company, to which the developed property was ultimately transferred, claimed, legitimately, in computing their profits on the sale of the flats, a deduction in respect of the £200,000 which they expended in acquiring the property.  But they also claimed a deduction of a further £200,000 which they did not expend but which, because of intermediate operations between the companies, was artificially generated.</P>
    <P>These intermediate operations in essence involved the granting of a lease by one company to a second company, the sale of the reversion to a third company, and the subsequent acquisition by the second company, which already held the leasehold interest, of the reversionary interest.  If the company's claim is upheld the loss of tax in this case, because of the adoption of the scheme, will amount to close on £100,000 and other cases following the same line will deprive the Exchequer of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>In the annuity case there was a similar <Col N="2948" /> type of operation involving three companies in a group.  As a result the land dealing company claimed as a deduction in computing their profits not only a sum of £60,000 which they had expended in acquiring property but also a sum of £800,000 which they did not expend but which had been artificially generated within the group by way of creating and cancelling an annuity.  The loss of tax involved in this case is over £350,000. Again, it will be seen that if these manoeuvres are not countered there will be a heavy leakage of revenue which no Government could countenance either in terms of money or in terms of equity.</P>
    <P>These schemes make use of an alleged weakness in section 18 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, which was an anti-avoidance provision. The Revenue view of the section was rejected by the Appeal Commissioners but an appeal by way of case stated is being taken to the High Court.  A final decision in the matter is unlikely to be available for a couple of years and it is therefore necessary to take legislative step to secure that, if there is a flaw in section 18, it should be closed immediately. Even if the outcome of the case is favourable to the Revenue, it is felt that these avoidance schemes can be adjusted so as to escape the tax charge in other ways.</P>
    <P>Before going on to explain the terms of the new legislation, I want to emphasise three points.</P>
    <P>The legislation is not intended to hit any genuine case or to inhibit any genuine commercial structure.  It is not intended to do other than secure the proper tax charge on actual profits.</P>
    <P>The new measures will apply only in respect of periods of account ending on or after 6 April 1981.</P>
    <P>Because of the short time available to draft the provisions, it may be that tax planners will be astute enough to find further ways to get round them.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, appropriate at this stage to refer to the clear warning in my budget speech that tax avoiders could not continue to rely on their schemes being successful merely because of the long delay between the birth of those schemes and <Col N="2949" /> the enactment of corrective legislation.</P>
    <P>In the light of what is happening in this area, it may well be that any amendment of the present legislation which may be found to be necessary next year or the year after should be made operational from the commencement of the present legislation.  Tax planners should bear this in mind if they apply their energies to new ways of getting round the legislation at present before the House.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that abuse of the tax system in this manner should be stopped.  If it transpires that the anti-avoidance provisions now proposed operate in practice so as to impose a charge where it would not be just and reasonable that such a charge should be imposed, the Revenue Commissioners will make use of any means open to them within the limits of their role in the care and management of the taxes not to apply the new legislation to such cases.  If this is not possible, amending legislation will be introduced to ensure that genuine commercial transactions which have no tax avoidance elements are not jeopardised by the new legislation.  The essential object of this legislation is to ensure that real profits are taxed in a just and reasonable manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister, now that he has explained what he is trying to do, that it should be done at top speed.  I accept that if this sort of thing is going on it should be stopped and every means should be used to stop it.  We cannot afford to have this sort of measure adopted by individual companies to frustrate the just collection of taxes.  It is highly unsatisfactory however that legislation &mdash; in this case legislation introducing not an amendment but five new long sections into existing law &mdash; should be introduced in this manner on Report Stage.  The Minister said that it may be that in some cases, because of the haste with which the legislation has been drafted, it might have unintended effects in doing damage to genuine transactions. I appreciate that the Minister also said that he would do everything in his power, both legally and administratively, to ensure that that does not happen.  The <Col N="2950" /> Minister however admits the possibility. If the legislation had been introduced in time there would have been a greater opportunity not just for Members of the House but for people outside to give us information which we could use to eliminate these unintended deficiencies.  By introducing the amendment so late the Minister makes it harder for this appropriate legislative correction process to operate.</P>
      <P>A very crucial question is when did the Appeal Commissioners determine that the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of these sections of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, were not the correct ones?  Until then the Revenue Commissioners thought there was no problem.  As soon as the Appeal Commissioners made the ruling they knew there was a problem and they should have immediately taken action to put it right.  For us to decide on whether or not the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister acted with sufficient speed we must know when they first came to know whether or not action was necessary. For us to know that we must know when the Appeal Commissioners made the relevant determination.  Before I go further, will the Minister answer that question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get the date for the Deputy, but first I have a few more points.  I am satisfied that this legislation will close this door without hurting the genuine transactions to which I refer.  What I have said is safeguarding the interests of the genuine person carrying out the genuine transaction in the unlikely event of there being a loophole. Another aspect is that it was only in recent times that the magnitude of the problem was established.  I then had the option of waiting until next year's Finance Bill or of bringing in an amendment as I have done.  I appreciate the Deputy's support for stopping tax exploitation of this nature.  I had the choice of allowing a leakage to continue for a whole year or of bringing in a section late in the day.  I took the wiser choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would dearly love to have given the Deputies more time to consider the <Col N="2951" /> amendment which is before us.  I take the Deputy's point that it is a long amendment. It took some considerable time to draft, because of its complexity and my absolute insistence that every step be taken to protect the genuine transaction which, from all our points of view, was extremely important.  It is sad that people find ways and means around our tax laws to the extent that has occurred in the case which I brought to the notice of the House.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if I did delay, I have no apology to offer to anybody because I was ensuring that, as far as possible, the person involved in a genuine carrying on of business would not in any way be adversely affected by these amendments.  It was important that I should achieve that.  It was to safeguard the position in the unlikely event of there being someone undeservedly or unfairly hurt by the amendment that I made the points which I did make at the outset.</P>
    <P>The first decision &mdash; and there were two &mdash; of the Appeals Commissioner was made in late 1979, early 1980.  The second decision was made three or four months ago, in 1981.  Both of these decisions are involved in the case before the High Court.  Not only was that date important but, obviously, that decision had not yet been taken by the Appeals Commissioner. The Revenue Commissioners had the difficulty of establishing the position as they saw it, along with the obvious magnitude of the problem and its ramifications. All those matters have been very recent and very disturbing.  However, I want to compliment the Revenue Commissioners on bringing the matter to my attention.  I had the option, and the Deputy would have had no crib if I had taken it, or leaving the matter over until next year.  I would not have been doing my duty as Minister for Finance if I had not, at the first possible opportunity, introduced what was a very complex amendment.  While apologising for what Deputy Bruton would call its late entry, I make no apology on behalf of the Irish people that I should bring it in this year. To delay a further year could have cost the Exchequer millions of pounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall put it this way.  The Revenue Commissioners were aware from late 1979 that there was a problem and did not propose any legislative measures to deal with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent of the problem became more evident as time went on, but the latest decision was taken three or four months ago, according to the Minister. This Finance Bill was introduced only one month ago.  The Revenue Commissioners had all the evidence, it would seem, three or four months ago.  Why did they not introduce measures to counteract the situation on the original Finance Bill which was only introduced a month ago?  The Minister may say that they did not know all the possible difficulties in drafting it and that is accepted.  However, could they not have done what the Minister has already done in the case of the concession regarding rented accommodation, that is, introduce a section, at least giving people notice of the broad lines on which they were thinking and, on Report Stage, substitute another section? At least people had something to go on in respect of the way the rented accommodation legislation would work because they had the original section which was subsequently replaced by another one.  As far as this matter is concerned, they had nothing to go on, <Col N="2953" /> because there was no section whatever. That is a failing.  I do not want to make a meal of this.  There is no Member of this House, or of any official body, who does not succeed, on occasion, in doing less than he or she would wish to do.  I am sure that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister would have preferred to introduce the legislation properly and in time.  It would seem that they had the time to do so.  I feel that they should have done it, but I have made my point.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a few queries on the section.  It is an extremely long one, as the Minister has pointed out.  Firstly, I notice that section 27 (1) (a) changes what was originally section 27 in the 1968 Act.  Whereas, in the 1968 Act, the profits referred to were being taxed under Case IV of Schedule D, under this new section they are to be taxed under Case I of Schedule D.  Now, Case I of Schedule D relates to quarries of stone, slate, limestone, or chalk, quarries of pits of land, gravel or clay, mines of coal, tin, lead, copper, pyrites, iron and other mines, ironworks, gasworks, saltsprings and works, alum mines and works, waterworks, streams and water canals, inland navigations, docks, drains or levels, fishing, the rights of markets and fairs, tolls, railways and other ways, bridges or ferries and other concerns of like nature having profits arising from or out of the lands.  It also contains any trade not contained in any other schedule.  I am not quite sure why it is necessary to change that from Case IV, which is simply tax in respect of any annual profits or gains not falling under and not charged by virtue of any other schedule.  The two appear to mean the same thing.  The change does not make sense to me.</P>
      <P>Secondly, at the bottom of page 2 it says:</P>
      <P>An account shall not be taken of any sum which is paid or payable at any time by a trader as consideration of the forfeiture or surrender of the right of any person to annuity or other annual payment unless the annuity or other annual payment arises under a testamentary disposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand that as meaning that <Col N="2954" /> something which is passed in a will &mdash; which is a testamentary disposition &mdash; shall be taken account of for the purposes of this section, I cannot quite see why a will is something which one should consider to be a means of tax avoidance. No-one has control over the date of his or her death and could hardly use death as a means of avoidance of tax.  If I am not misunderstanding the section I would see the inclusion of testamentary disposition as among the factors that can be taken into account as a basis on which taxed property passing would be taxed, as not being appropriate.</P>
    <P>Another point which must be taken into account is in respect of the provision for valuable and sufficient consideration, all of which is required to be brought into account for computing, for the purposes of income tax and corporation tax, the income of the person to whom that consideration is given.  That does not seem to make much sense because account must be taken of all these matters anyway. Therefore, to say that one may not exclude from account matters that must be included in it seems to me to be an unnecessary and complex procedure.  We know that matters that are liable for tax must not be excluded.</P>
    <P>The next point relates to 18 (3) (ii) (II) (A) which reads:</P>
    <P>has not at any time carried on a business of dealing in or developing land which is, or is to be regarded as, a trade or a part of a trade,</P>
    <P>That relates to a particular class of people. If any consideration is given to one of those people who at any time has carried on this business, that fact may not be excluded from account regardless of the circumstances.  Therefore, if I had been a developer 20 years ago but had severed all contact with that type of business, I would be treated differently from another person in exactly the same situation but who had never been a developer. A particular class of people should not be treated differently from others merely because of something they did in the past.</P>
    <P>The next item relates to paragraph (II) (B).  Another type of person to whom a <Col N="2955" /> transfer of property must be taken into account is someone who is not and was not at any time connected with any of the following persons:</P>
    <P>(aa)  the trader,</P>
    <P>(bb)  a person who is or was at any time connected with the trader, and</P>
    <P>(cc)  any other person who, in the course of a business of dealing in or developing land which is, or is to be regarded as, a trade or a part of a trade, holds or held an interest in land upon which the annuity or other annual payment was charged or reserved,</P>
    <P>What do the words &ldquo;connected with&rdquo; mean in that sense?  Could they not mean anything?  I am sure the Minister had a specific idea in mind in using this term but there is no definition of it.  I presume it means a financial connection or does it include merely people who have been related by blood or by marriage without there being any financial implication involved?</P>
    <P>Another point here is a drafting point. I refer to paragraph (4) which reads:</P>
    <P>(4) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a sum (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the said sum) is payable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by a person (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the relevant person) who is not the trader,</P>
    <P>(ii)  as consideration for the forfeiture or surrender of the right of any person to an annuity or other annual payment....</P>
    <P>Am I to take it that (i) and (ii) relate to a person who is not the trader and that they both apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy blame us for being confused?  Is he not confused himself?  The section as numbered relates to the new Bill but the Act we are amending is the 1968 Act &mdash; section 17 of that Act.  The next point related to the question of annuities.  The Deputy may take it that what I said at the outset was that we are only interested in ensuring that the person who is using the system for an artificial annuity is controlled, in other words, that those with a genuine annuity in whatever circumstances exist <Col N="2957" /> shall not be interfered with.  To illustrate what is intended perhaps I could cite an example for the Deputy.  If I take a particular case and refer to it as case Y, the case involved in the creation of an annuity. Let us say that company D had been dealing in land and at the relevant time held 30 acres.  Company E was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of company D, the latter having subscribed £800,000 for shares in company E and shortly afterwards company E paid to company D the sum of £800,000.  In consideration of this amount of money, company D undertook to pay an annuity of more than £140,000 to company E.  The annuity was secured on the 30 acres referred to.</P>
      <P>At this point the £800,000 which company D had given to company E in subscription for the shares had come back to company D as consideration for the annuity.  The object of the exercise was to burden the 30 acres with the payment of the annuity.  Company D sold the land which was encumbered with payment of the annuity to another associated company, company F, for £60,000 and the latter company, through the acquisition of shares in company E, acquired full ownership of that company.  Company F were now in a position to secure cancellation of the annuity and could sell the 30 acres without any encumbrance or burden. Company F sold the unencumbered land for £900,000.  The company, relying on a certain interpretation of section 18 (2) (c) (iii) of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, claimed it was entitled to deduct in addition to the cost of acquiring the property, £60,000, a sum of £800,000 which it did not expend but which represented the market value of the annuity that was artificially created for this purpose.  The amount of tax involved in this case is more than £350,000.  The Deputy may take it that the annuities about which he is concerned are safeguarded.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) (II) (A) refers to someone who has not at any time carried on a business of dealing in or developing land which is to be regarded as a trade.  That seems to exclude a class of persons regardless of when they may have carried out the development of land.  This provision may be necessary but, on the other hand, it could be unjust in that it might include persons who had given up developing land many years ago and are not involved in such undertakings now.  The section appears to include them if they were involved at any time.  Perhaps the Minister would consider putting in a limit of say, five years?</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to have a look at it.  I do not think the Deputy should be worried about this matter. The purpose is to protect the genuine transaction.  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate from the example I gave, there could be a very considerable time lag of years from the beginning of the operation to the ultimate tax situation. The Deputy suggested the inclusion of ten years but land could be held for much longer than that time.  I think the Deputy might be complicating the situation even more.</P>

      <P>Section 20 (6) of the amendment reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) where, whether by a premature sale or otherwise, a person directly or indirectly makes available to another person the opportunity of realising a gain, the gain of that other person shall be treated as having been obtained for him by the person first mentioned in this subsection, and</P>
      <P>What is meant by a premature sale?  In section 20 (10) there is the following provision:</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (c) shall not apply to so much of any gain as is fairly attributable to the period, if any, before the intention to develop the land was formed...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2960" /> That seems to involve the Revenue Commissioners in deciding the state of a person's mind about when he formed the intention to develop land, but who can state when that person first thought of developing land?  It is a very difficult section to interpret.  I wonder if that problem had been adverted to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about subsection (6) of the amendment. That explains how a gain could be obtained by one person for another.  It is for the purposes of subsection (3).  The Deputy asked me to define the word &ldquo;premature&rdquo;.  Obviously it is the dictionary definition &mdash; occurring before the usual or proper time.  It is for the purpose of preventing a gain in a transfer from one individual to another.  It is to protect that situation developing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (10) of the amendment refers to the fact that the Revenue will be involved in deciding fairly when a person first formed the intention to develop the land.  That is completely subjective.  You might make up your mind to do something and not do it for two or three years.  The Revenue will be involved in some sort of psychological inquiry as to whether you had made up your mind.  I wonder is that feasible for them.  Perhaps the Minister has to have something as loose as that to catch the people he wants to catch, but it is not very satisfactory to have the law based on the judgement of an inspector as to subjective states of mind.  It is not precise.</P>

      <P>It is a question of accepting the word of the individual.  I take the Deputy's point but there will have to be realism in all of this.  Eventually it might finish up in the courts and they could decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (10) of the amendment deals with the case of land which although not originally acquired with the objective of making a gain from its disposal is developed at a later stage with that objective.  In such a case the subsection restricts the gain chargeable under this section by applying the rules relating to <Col N="2961" /> case one, thereby ensuring that the land is deemed to have been purchased for a consideration equal to its market value at a time when the intention to develop it was formed.  One must deal with the factual situation.  If there is a dispute it can be decided by the courts. I do not think there is anything to be gained by pursuing this or changing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I agree with Deputy Bruton when he says avoidance of tax in the manner described by the Minister is highly undesirable and should be stamped out.  I take it the cases the Minister quoted are real cases with the names left out.  They show a very extensive avoidance of tax under the law as it stands.  Therefore it is quite legal.  I agree that the law should be amended.  Since as far back as the introduction of the PAYE system of income tax I have always thought that the tax system as a whole should be fair and equitable.  People in the PAYE system&mdash;and they go right up to the top so long as they are not self-employed&mdash;have to pay their full amount of tax and it is only correct that the tax system should be fair and equitable and that everybody should pay his fair contribution.</P>
      <P>I was a bit alarmed to hear the Minister saying one of the reasons why he has to introduce this amendment on short notice is that there is a case stated pending in the High Court and he anticipates that it will be two years before that case is disposed of.  If that is so, it discloses an entirely undesirable state of affairs and shows that, for some reason or another, the courts are not working as expenditously as they should be, or giving the service they should be giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case because the person affected is the State, the Minister can come in here with a new section in a Bill to protect the State.  Suppose this fault in the law or this uncertainty in the law was not the concern of the State alone and, instead of the State and a private citizen, two private citizens were involved, this would have to remain in abeyance for two years, we are told, until the courts got around <Col N="2962" /> to dealing with it.  That should not be.  It is far too long a delay.</P>
    <P>There have always been delays about these cases stated in regard to income tax, and so on.  They should be cut out. If there are delays extending up to two years in the courts, or in any section of the courts dealing with common law, or equity, or criminal law, or anything else, somebody is at fault.  Something needs to be amended.  The system needs to be changed.  The Minister gave this reason in a very casual way.  Attention should be drawn to it and the responsible Minister should look into it with the President of the High Court to see if this sort of delay can be shortened and a proper service given.</P>

      <P>In page 26, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.  &mdash;(1)  This section is enacted to prevent the avoidance of tax by persons concerned with dealing in or developing land.</P>
      <P>(2) (a)  In relation to the computation for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax of the profits or gains or losses of any period ending on or after the 6th day of April, 1981, Part IV of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 18:</P>
      <P>18.  &mdash;(1)  Where a business of dealing in or developing land is, or is to be regarded as, a trade within Schedule D or a part of such a trade, the provisions applicable to Case I of that Schedule shall, as respects the computation of the profits or gains of the business, have effect subject to the subsequent provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) (a)  Any consideration other than rent or an amount treated as rent under section 83 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for the disposal of an <Col N="2963" /> interest in any land, or in a part of any land, shall be treated as a consideration for the disposal of trading stock and shall accordingly be taken into account as a trading receipt.</P>
    <P>(b)  Any interest in any land which is held by a person carrying on a trade (hereafter in this section referred to as the trader) and which has become trading stock of the trade shall thereafter, until the discontinuance of the trade, continue to be such trading stock.</P>
    <P>(c)  Where the trader has acquired an interest in any land otherwise than for consideration in money or money's worth, he shall, subject to paragraph (d), be deemed to have purchased the interest for a consideration equal to its market value at the time of acquisition.</P>
    <P>(d)  Where at the time of acquisition of an interest in any land the trade had not been commenced or the interest was not then appropriated as trading stock, the trader shall be deemed to have purchased the interest for a consideration equal to its market value at the time of its appropriation as trading stock.</P>
    <P>(e)  Any consideration (other than receipts falling within section 81 (1) (b) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the profits or gains arising from which are, by virtue of that section, chargeable to tax under Case V of Schedule D) for the granting by the trader of any right in relation to the development of any land shall be taken into account as a trading receipt.</P>
    <P>(3)  Account shall not be taken of any sum (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the relevant sum) which is paid or is payable at any time by the trader as consideration for the forfeiture or surrender of the right of any person to an annuity or other annual payment unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the annuity or other annual payment arises under&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2964" /> (i)  a testamentary disposition, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  a liability incurred for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  valuable and sufficient consideration all of which is required to be brought into account in computing for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax the income of the person to whom that consideration is given, or</P>
    <P>(II)  consideration given to a person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(A)  has not at any time carried on a business of dealing in or developing land which is, or is to be regarded as, a trade or a part of a trade, and</P>
    <P>(B)  is not and was not at any time connected with any of the following persons&mdash;</P>
    <P>(aa)  the trader,</P>
    <P>(bb)  a person who is or was at any time connected with the trader, and</P>
    <P>(cc)  any other person who, in the course of a business of dealing in or developing land which is, or is to be regarded as, a trade or a part of a trade, holds or held an interest in land upon which the annuity or other annual payment was charged or reserved,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)  the relevant sum is required to be brought into account in computing for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax the profits or gains of a trade of dealing in or developing land carried on by the person to whom the relevant sum is payable.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a sum (hereafter in this subsection <Col N="2965" /> referred to as the said sum) is payable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by a person (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the relevant person) who is not the trader,</P>
    <P>(ii)  as consideration for the forfeiture or surrender of the right of any person to an annuity or other annual payment, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the said sum is not required to be brought into account in computing for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax the profits or gains of a trade of dealing in or developing land carried on by the person to whom the said sum is payable, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the trader incurs expenditure (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the cost) in acquiring any interest in land upon which the annuity or other annual payment had been reserved or charged,</P>
    <P>then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the trader shall be treated as having expended in acquiring that interest an amount equal to the amount which would have been expended if the right had not been forfeited or surrendered, and</P>
    <P>(II)  the excess of the cost over the amount determined in accordance with subparagraph (I) shall be treated for the purposes of subsection (3) as having been payable by the trader as consideration for the forfeiture or surrender of that right,</P>
    <P>and for the purposes of this subsection all such apportionments and valuations shall be made as appear to the inspector or, on appeal, to the Appeal Commissioners, to be just and reasonable</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply where the relevant person carries on a trade of dealing in or developing land and pays the said sum in the course of carrying on that trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2966" /> (b)  Any provision of section 18 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, which applies in relation to the computation of the profits or gains or losses of any period ending before the 6th day of April, 1981, but which, by reason of this section, does not apply in relation to the computation of the profits or gains or losses of any period ending on or after that date, shall, in particular, not apply in relation to the determination of the value of the trading stock of a trade at the commencement of any period ending on or after that date.</P>
    <P>(3)  Part IV or the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following sections for sections 20, 21 and 22:</P>
    <P>20.  &mdash;(1)  This section shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a gain realised before the 6th day of April, 1981, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a gain accuring to an individual which, by virtue of section 25 (private residence) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, is exempt from capital gains tax, or which would be so exempt but for the provisions of subsection (10) of that section.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section and in section 21&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `capital amount' &rdquo; means any amount, in money or money's worth, which, apart from this section, does not fall to be included in any computation of income for the purposes of the Tax Acts, and other expressions which include the word &ldquo;&ldquo;capital' &rdquo; shall be construed accordingly;</P>

    <P>(3)  This section shall apply in any case where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  land, or any property deriving its value from land, is acquired with the sole or main object of realising a gain from disposing of the land,</P>
    <P>(b)  land is held as trading stock, or</P>
    <P>(c)  land is developed by a company with the sole or main object of realising a gain from disposing of the land when developed,</P>
    <P>and any gain of a capital nature is obtained from the disposal of the land&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  by the person acquiring, holding or developing the land, or by a person connected with that person, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  where any arrangement or scheme is effected as respects the land which enables the gain to be realised directly or indirectly by any transaction, or by any series of transactions, by any person who is a party to, or concerned in, the arrangement or scheme,</P>
    <P>and this subsection shall apply whether the said gain is obtained by any such person for himself or for any other person.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where this section applies, the whole of any such gain as is mentioned in subsection (3) shall, for all the purposes of the Tax Acts, be treated&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  as being income which arises at the time when the gain is realised and which constitutes profits or gains <Col N="2968" /> chargeable to tax under Case IV of Schedule D for the chargeable period in which the gain is realised, and</P>
    <P>(b)  subject to the following provisions of this section, as being income of the person by whom the gain is realised.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of this section land shall be treated as disposed of if, by any one or more transactions, or by any arrangement or scheme, whether concerning the land or property deriving its value from the land, the property in the land or control over the land, is effectually disposed of, and references in subsection (3) to the acquisition or development of land or property with the sole or main object of realising a gain from disposing of the land shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>(6)  For the purposes of this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where, whether by a premature sale or otherwise, a person directly or indirectly makes available to another person the opportunity of realising a gain, the gain of that other person shall be treated as having been obtained for him by the person first mentioned in this subsection, and</P>
    <P>(b)  any number of transactions may be regarded as constituting a single arrangement or scheme if a common purpose is discerned in them, or if there is other sufficient evidence of a common purpose.</P>
    <P>(7)  In applying this section account shall be taken of any method, direct or indirect, by which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any property or right is transferred or transmitted to another person, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the value of any property or right is enhanced or diminished,</P>
    <P>and, accordingly, the occasion of the transfer or transmission of any property or right, by whatever method, and the occasion when the value of any property or right is enhanced, may be <Col N="2969" /> treated as an occasion on which tax becomes chargeable under this section.</P>
    <P>(8)  Subsection (7) shall apply in particular&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to sales, contracts and other transactions made otherwise than for full consideration or for more than full consideration,</P>
    <P>(b)  to any method by which any property or right, or the control of any property or right, is transferred or transmitted to any person by assigning&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  share capital or other rights in a company,</P>
    <P>(ii)  rights in a partnership, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  an interest in settled property,</P>
    <P>(c)  to the creation of any option or consent or embargo affecting the disposition of any property or right, and to the consideration given for the option, or for the giving of the consent or the release of the embargo, and</P>
    <P>(d)  to the disposal of any property or right on the winding up, dissolution or termination of any company, partnership or trust.</P>
    <P>(9)  For the purposes of this section such method of computing a gain shall be adopted as is just and reasonable in the circumstances, taking into account the value of what is obtained for disposing of the land, and allowing only such expenses as are attributable to the land disposed of, and in applying this subsection&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where an interest in land is acquired and the reversion is retained on disposal, account may be taken of the way in which the profits or gains under Case I of Schedule D of a person dealing in land are computed in such a case, and</P>
    <P>(b)  account may be taken of the adjustments to be made in computing such profits or gains under section <Col N="2970" /> 84 (2) and 85 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>(10)  Subsection (3) (c) shall not apply to so much of any gain as is fairly attributable to the period, if any, before the intention to develop the land was formed, and which would not fall under paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection; and in applying this subsection account shall be taken of the treatment under Case I of Schedule D of a person who appropriates land as trading stock.</P>
    <P>(11)  If all or any part of the gain accruing to any person is derived from value, or an opportunity of realising a gain, provided directly or indirectly by some other person (whether or not put at the disposal of the person first mentioned in this subsection), subsection (4) (b) shall apply to the gain, or that part of it, with the substitution of that other person for the person by whom the gain was realised.</P>
    <P>(12)  Where there is a disposal of shares in&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a company which holds land as trading stock, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a company which owns directly or indirectly 90 per cent, or more of the ordinary share capital of another company which holds lands as trading stock,</P>
    <P>and all the land so held is disposed of in the normal course of its trade by the company which held it, and so as to procure that all opportunity of profit in respect of the land arises to that company, then, notwithstanding subsection (3) (i), this section shall not apply to any gain accruing to the holder of shares as being a gain on property deriving value from that land (but without prejudice to any liability under subsection (3) (ii)).</P>
    <P>(13)  In ascertaining for the purposes of this section, the intentions of any person, the objects and powers of any company, partners or trustees, as set out in any memorandum or articles of association or other document, shall not be conclusive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2971" /> (14)  For the purposes of ascertaining whether and to what extent the value of any property or right is derived from any other property or right, value may be traced through any number of companies, partnerships and trusts, and the property held by any company, partnership or trust shall be attributed to the shareholders, partners or beneficiaries at each stage in such manner as is just and reasonable.</P>
    <P>(15)  In applying this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any expenditure or receipt or consideration or other amount may be apportioned by such method as is just and reasonable, and</P>
    <P>(b)  all such valuations shall be made as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the section.</P>
    <P>(16)  For the purposes of this section partners, or the trustees of settled property, or personal representatives, may be regarded as persons distinct from the individuals or other persons who are for the time being partners or trustees or personal representatives.</P>
    <P>(17)  This section shall apply to a person, whether resident in the State or not, if all or any part of the land in question is situated in the State.</P>
    <P>21.  &mdash;(1) (a)  Where a person (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the first-mentioned person) is assessed to tax under section 20 and that assessment to tax arises in consequence of and in respect of consideration receivable by another person (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the second-mentioned person)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the first-mentioned person shall be entitled to recover from the second-mentioned person any part of that tax which the first-mentioned person has paid, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  if any part of that tax remains unpaid at the expiration of six months from the date when it became due and payable, it shall be recoverable from the second-mentioned <Col N="2972" /> person as though he were the person so assessed, but without prejudice to the right to recover the tax from the first-mentioned person,</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 28, to delete lines 6 to 28 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Hydrocarbons.  32.&mdash;(a)  In this section &mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to remove from the Finance Bill the increase the Government are imposing on the price of petrol and diesel oil.  This has been recognised by many people as the most undesirable feature of the recent budget introduced by the Government. It is particularly hard on people who have to use their cars to get to work.  Many people live a considerable distance from their work place.  As a result of increases in oil prices paid to people in the oil producing countries, they have already had to bear substantial increases in the price of petrol which they must use to get to work.  Now the Government intend further to increase the price by the imposition of these additional duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that at this stage it is too late in the day for the introduction of an amendment of this nature to make any difference because the Government have made their calculations.  If this item of revenue were to be removed the budget would be even more unbalanced than it is already.  It is not my intention to make the Government's budget more unbalanced <Col N="2975" /> than it is already.  Particularly in recent years the Government have been having far too large deficits on their budgets.</P>
    <P>In introducing this amendment I am not seeking to change the shape of the budget after the event because it is too late.  The considerations I am putting forward should have been taken into account by the Government before introducing their budget.  However it is appropriate that we avail of this Report Stage to point out to the Government and the people the serious consequences of the increase in petrol price, so central an element of the budgetary strategy of the present Government, a strategy which involved a direct increase in the cost of living, an increase so serious in the first quarter of this year that in the second quarter of this year, in order to undo some of the damage they had done in the first quarter, the Government were forced to introduce subsidies which will cost almost as much and perhaps more at the end of the year than the amount of revenue they will gain from the increased petrol price.</P>
    <P>If ever there was a budgetary strategy that was counter-productive it is that pursued by this Government in this budget. The increase in petrol price, pushing up the cost of living, threw calculations workers and employers had made in the wage agreements they had negotiated into disarray by achieving a disproportionately large increase in the consumer price index in the first quarter of the year, directly as a result of this budget and in particular as a result of the increased petrol price.  That dislocation was so serious that in the second quarter of the year the Government had to come along and spend a lot of money in the form of subsidies to try and undo some of the damage done in the first quarter.  Therefore we have a zig-zag budget policy, going in one direction in the first quarter of the year and in completely the opposite direction in the second quarter.  There has been no sense of consistency, no sense of direction in the approach of the Government either to the management of national finances or to the scope and <Col N="2976" /> shape of taxation and the methods whereby revenue should be raised.</P>
    <P>In introducing this amendment at this stage I am not seeking to have the petrol tax increases done away with.  It is too late in the day to do that because the Government are already raising that revenue and, were it to be done, the budget would be thrown into even further imbalance. I am using this opportunity to make the point which must be made about the inconsistent manner in which the Government have approached taxation, in particular their handling of inflation &mdash; the imposition of excise duties on the one hand, which increase the cost of living, to be compensated for a few months later by subsidies which reduce it.</P>
    <P>A further point I should make about this matter is that in many cases the increases imposed by the Government in these duties increase substantially the costs of Irish industry.  As we know, the level of duty on energy paid by Irish industry is already substantially ahead of that paid by competing industries in other countries.  This falls particularly heavily on native industry which has been in existence for some time.  New industries, with new investment plans such as those we discussed earlier this morning, can get tax concessions which in many cases more than compensate for the high level of taxation they must pay on the energy they use.  New and, in many cases, foreign industries do quite well under our tax code.  Not only in many cases does existing Irish industry not benefit under the various schemes devised by the Government for attracting investment here &mdash; because it has made its investment and its job is running a business rather than making new investments &mdash; but it must pay the high levels of excise duty levied in particular on energy under our tax system. The level of energy taxation on industry in this country is significantly higher than that on the same products in other countries.</P>
    <P>I have put forward these amendments in order to indicate the serious inconsistencies in the policies of the Government in the hope that, by so doing, they will have some effect in influencing public <Col N="2977" /> opinion in the matter of increases in taxation of this type.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's speech could be described as a Second Stage one rather than moving an amendment on Report Stage.  I presume I will have the same freedom of facility to answer all the points raised by him.</P>
      <P>I shall commence by referring to the amendment put down by Deputy Bruton and say that the Government, when preparing the budget, had to have regard to the many diverse sectoral interests that had to be taken into account.  They had to assess how best all sectors could be treated in a reasonable way and where extra revenue could be raised.  Of course, as is always the case with a concerned Fianna Fáil Government, social welfare recipients rated a very high priority group.  For the second consecutive year we increased the social welfare long-term recipient benefits by 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;such as cigarettes, tobacco, drink and petrol had to be considered as a less harsh way of raising revenue than direct taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Deputy Bruton, displaying in a consistent way the continued inconsistency of Fine Gael spokesmen in different areas and locations, is moving an amendment advocating the removal of the increase but not saying where the extra revenue is to be found.  That is typical of the policies suggested by them or the motions and amendments they have introduced on this and many other Bills.  I would say to Deputy Bruton, that no Minister for <Col N="2978" /> Finance wants to make any further imposition by way of taxation, direct or indirect, if he can avoid doing so.  But considering this was a year in which the greatest ever social welfare benefits were given, substantial income tax reliefs, aid to the disabled never given prior to this, concessions to the farmers everybody agreed that were needed, some item of revenue had to be looked at and on this occasion the indirect taxes were those chosen.  I regret that there had to be any increase of any indirect tax but the reality of the situation is that we are the Government who cater for a broad sector of our people. Is the Deputy suggesting that we should not have looked after the social welfare people, that we should not have looked after the farmers, that we should not have helped the PAYE sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In imposing taxes the Minister for Finance should have regard to their effect on our economy in general.  I am afraid the Minister for Finance, in proposing a tax of 15p per gallon on petrol, on top of a tax of 20p per gallon last year, totally disregarded their overall effect on the economy, on the cost of living, on our competitiveness in the home and foreign markets and their effect on demands for wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his party are very fond of laying the blame for everything on the cost of energy, attributing all the ills and evils that are facing the economy to the astronomical increase in the cost of fuel and energy.  In that atmosphere one would have thought the Minister would have avoided petrol which, due to circumstances beyond his control, is going up in price rapidly anyway.  On top of the increases imposed by the oil-producing countries, on top of the increases resulting from the fall in the value of our £ against the dollar, the Minister puts on another increase and the effect of it goes right through the economy.  It is manifested in the cost of transporting goods <Col N="2979" /> from place to place and so puts up the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we have now reached the stage when people have to use transport fuelled by petrol to get to work resulting in increased cost of travelling. In addition the cost of CIE transport is enormously increased as a result of these taxes.  That body is already losing millions and tens of millions of pounds per year. In fact it is being allowed to run down by the Government because they increased its operating costs and refused to give it any increased subsidy.</P>
    <P>In latter years it was nice to see the rural parts of Ireland being repopulated, to see people who worked in cities and provincial towns being prepared to live several miles away from their work and drive in and out each day because, I suppose, they like living in the country and because they can get sites for houses there cheaper than immediately beside the towns.  Now they are confronted with this tax on petrol which makes it much more expensive for them to live.  That is most unreasonable.  It is an entirely inflationary proposal in the budget and the result is that it makes us less competitive on the foreign market; it aggravates our balance of payments situation and the balance of trade at a time when our trade balance according to the Central Bank publication and other publications recently is absolutely alarming and has gone beyond danger point.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that we should tell him where to get the tax but it is his business as Minister for Finance in introducing proposals like this to weigh up their effect on the economy and raise the money in a way less damaging to the economy.  When we were dealing with motor car tax I tried to extract from the Minister the amount of money raised by this additional taxation this year.  I understand at least £50 million extra is raised by this 15p per gallon.  That coupled with the new tax on motor cars represents a despicable piece of double dealing on the part of the Government who got into power in 1977 on the basis that motor tax would go and that motoring would <Col N="2980" /> become less expensive for the young and the not-so-young.  The Government went back on that as they went back on so many other promises they had held out. The net result is that motoring is now much more expensive even in real terms than when this Government took over in 1977 and there is no apology or explanation from them.</P>
    <P>That might be understandable if the present members of the Cabinet said that their predecessors in the party made mistakes. That might get them out of that, but here we have a situation where the country is suffering, the cost of living is going up, wages are going up and as a result we are not as competitive as we could be on the home market.  Consumer goods are coming into the country in hundreds of millions and a proposal such as the Minister is putting before the House makes it easier for foreign goods to undercut Irish goods on the home market. That is a very large part of our trouble. Because our manufacturers and producers are less competitive on the home market they have a smaller base and are as a result very much less competitive on the foreign market.  Less goods are being produced and we now have mass unemployment, unemployment at the rate of 160,000, as counted by Fianna Fáil.  If we counted the number of unemployed in the manner used before Fianna Fáil changed the rules I am sure that figure would be at least 140,000 at present and we have been told by the experts that before the end of the year the unemployment figure will have increased.</P>

It is crazy economics and it shows the straitjacket which bad management of the economy since the famous manifesto of 1977 has landed us in.  No government with room for manipulation or that had got themselves into a straitjacket situation would be doing a thing like this. It is too bad that the country must suffer because of the bad management of our economy.</P>

      <P>In pages 30 and 31, to delete lines 31 to 47 and 1 to 21 respectively.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 is concerned with removing the increase in the motor tax which is misnamed a motor registration fee in the Bill.  This Government obtained power on the basis of promises, one of which was to abolish motor tax. Since then they have been progressively re-introducing it in the form of what they call a fee.  This year the revenue from this so-called fee for the registration of motor vehicles is going to be about £13 million. The cost of administeration of this fee comes to no more than £2 million, so the revenue will make a profit of £11 million on this fee.  The nominal position in regard to fees charged by this State is that they do not cover, or just barely cover, the cost of administering the service given.  In this case the fee charged is yielding a revenue of five or six times as much as the cost of administering the service.  Therefore, to call the motor tax a fee is a complete misnomer.  We are proposing in this amendment, perhaps in the dying days of this Dáil, to reveal the complete falsity of the promise, on which the present majority in this Dáil was obtained, of abolishing motor tax.  In practice, that tax has been re-introduced.</P>

      <P>Is the amount advanced not something that is capable of being established on a standard basis in view of the fact that under the supplementary welfare provisions there are clear criteria as to the amount which may be advanced to people under the Act?  Would the Minister not agree that he had already available to him sufficient information whereby he could have determined the amount that ought to be deducted without delaying the payment of the balance which was certainly due?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money granted under the supplementary welfare allowance varies in accordance with the family circumstances.  The problem, from <Col N="2986" /> the point of view of the social welfare officers is that the legislation of this House passed by Deputies on the far side and Deputies on this side, is that that money can only be deducted from arrears.  They must, therefore, determine what the amount is to deduct it from any arrears that are paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position generally in relation to the payment of the various social welfare benefits, pensions and allowances is normal except in the case of disability benefit where some delays have been occurring since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>All the pension books for old age, retirement, invalidity, widows pensions and so on, totalling approximately 404,000, were distributed at the various post offices and sub-post offices in time for payment at the increased rates provided for in the budget.  The increased rates of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are also being paid to recipients at employment exchanges from the first week they were due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a changeover from insurance numbers to RSI numbers came into effect from 5 January 1981 for the purpose of payment of benefit.  The main difficulties in connection with this changeover arose on claims for disability benefit, due mainly to the fact that in many cases medical certificates and claim forms did not contain both numbers.  This led to difficulty in identifying the claimants to whom these forms related.  I am sure it will be appreciated that the changeover involved a major administrative change, affecting as it does over one million insured persons.  Because of the magnitude of the change it was considered that some initial difficulties might arise until claimants became familiar with the new arrangements.  Every effort was made, however, in advance to devise systems <Col N="2992" /> to overcome all foreseeable problems.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that there are on average some 70,000 disability benefit payments, including a pay-related element, made each week.  This has been the level of payments for some time and this number of payments has been made each week throughout the period from the beginning of this year.  These payments alone totalled almost £31 million between January and March.</P>
    <P>While there have been serious difficulties in connection with the changeover, I can assure the Deputy that these were tackled promptly and no effort was being spared to deal with them.  The various measures that have been taken have, I am glad to say, produced results and the position generally is not far from normal.</P>
    <P>If, however, the Deputy is aware of any cases in the Limerick area in which he considers that claimants are experiencing hardship through delay in payment, I will arrange to have the cases investigated and payment of benefit issued as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that we have so many social welfare queries down and the unusual delay, would the Minister tell us the best way a Deputy can get an answer to a particular problem?  Is it by ringing or writing to the Department or by putting down a parliamentary question, which involves the Department in considerable expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this method means considerable inconvenience in the Department and makes other work more difficult.  Normal dealings with Deputies have to be set aside so that officials can deal with parliamentary questions.  The Deputy mentioned the large number of questions on today's Order Paper.  Many of them were put down before Easter but were still left on the Order Paper.  Written answers would fit the bill in most cases because nearly all have been paid for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understood that from 1 May the staff would agree to the phones in the Department being put back on.  We have been informed that the non-use of phones <Col N="2993" /> is associated with a grade claim across the civil service generally and until this matter is resolved the phones will not be put back on.  This means we have communications difficulties, but we are doing everything we can to have the position resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us have had to resort to parliamentary questions. Despite the co-operation I get from the Minister's office, it must be admitted that the parliamentary question gets a reply in six days while letters written to the Department will get an acknowledgement but not a final reply for some weeks. I realise that putting down parliamentary questions takes up a great deal of time in the Department and is an expensive process, but Deputies have been so frustrated that they realise this is the best way to elicit information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set my office aside to deal with Deputies' queries, and we have been doing our best to deal with them.  I accept what the Deputy says in relation to parliamentary questions.  The problem would not be so bad if most of these questions, which had been put down before Easter, and which have been dealt with, were taken as written. Our main problem is righting any anomalies which still exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens is this.  The question is put straight through to the section.  The time of the staff dealing with parliamentary questions at that level is completely taken up and they are not available to write back to Deputies unless they work overtime, as they have been doing.  We have increased the staff numbers to try to meet that situation.  What Deputy Corish said is true.  When a Deputy sends in a query an acknowledgement is sent out straightaway.  When the query comes back from the section, it is <Col N="2994" /> attached to the Deputy's letter and a reply is prepared.</P>

      <P>Pay-related social insurance <Col N="2995" /> contributions are collected by the Collector-General of the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE system on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have intimated that end-of-year returns from approximately 10,000 employers registered for PAYE are still outstanding.  A breakdown on a regional basis is not available and until returns are submitted it would not be possible to state how many employees are involved or the amount of PRSI contributions due. Action is, however, being taken in outstanding cases to secure compliance with the relevant statutory provisions.  In suitable cases the employers are prosecuted from failure to submit the end-of-year returns.  At present 305 of these prosecutions are awaiting hearing.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts there is provision for the grant of special contribution credits which enables payment of benefit to be made immediately in all such cases.  This ensures that claimants do not suffer any loss or reduction of social welfare benefit arising from the negligence or failure of an employer to pay outstanding contributions or to make the necessary end-of-year returns to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>It is therefore in the interests of both employers and employees to ensure that end of the year returns are submitted promptly to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 16 February 1981 and has been paid from 19 February, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit due to 11 May 1981 has issued. He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delay in payment initially was due to the fact that he quoted his insurance number instead of his RSI number on the <Col N="2996" /> earlier medical certificates submitted in support of his claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 29 October 1980.  She was not entitled to payment however as contributions were not paid by her employer in respect of her employment from 1975 to 1980.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries it has been decided that her employment was insurable. Pending collection of the contributions from the employer, special credits have been awarded which enables payment of benefit to be made from 29 October 1980. Cheques paying all benefit due from that date have been issued.</P>
      <P>The question of her entitlement to pay-related benefit is being investigated and any benefit due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 20 February 1981 and has been paid all disability benefit and pay-related benefit to 4 May 1981.  The delay in payment of benefit was due to the fact that the RSI number on some medical certificates was misquoted by the claimant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 14 April 1980 to 7 October 1980.  Payment was refused after that date following an examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the decision and in that connection she was again examined by a <Col N="2997" /> different medical referee who was also of the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>The claim was then referred to an appeals officer for determination and an oral hearing of the appeal was arranged for 11 February 1981.  She did not, however, attend the hearing but her husband, who attended as her representative, informed the appeals officer that her medical condition was more complicated than the condition for which she was certified.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the appeals officer deferred a decision on the claim pending the result of a further medical referee examination which was arranged for 4 May 1981.  The medical referee who examined her on that date also considered her capable of work and the case has now been again referred to an appeals officer who intends holding an oral hearing of the appeal in the near future.  She will be notified of the date, time and place of the hearing as soon as the necessary arrangements have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay in payment of unemployment benefit to the person concerned is that inquiries had to be made to establish her contribution record before her entitlement could be decided.

His entitlement to pay-related benefit is being investigated and payment due, if any, will issue on completion of inquiries.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment of benefit was due to the fact that he quoted his old social insurance number only on some of his medical certificates submitted to my Department in connection with his claim.</P>

      <P>Payment of pay-related benefit could not be made initially on the claim until details of his earnings in the relevant income tax year had been ascertained. This was done towards the end of March 1981 and all payments since that time have been issued on the due dates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite an exhaustive search there is no trace in the records of my Department or in the ESB district office, Waterford, of an application for a free electricity allowance from the person concerned.  I have now had an application <Col N="2999" /> form issued to her and have advised her as to what she should do before returning it to her local ESB office.</P>
      <P>when the completed form has been returned to my Department her application will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this woman definitely submitted an application last October when she reached old age pension age?  The slip-up obviously occurred in the Minister's office and I should like to have the matter investigated. The woman is distraught.  She has approached several Deputies.</P>

All disability benefit, and pay-related benefit due, less, amount reimbursed to the health board of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, has been paid to 16 May 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 27 March <Col N="3000" /> 1981 and has been paid from 31 March 1981, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due, less the amount reimbursed to the health board of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, has been paid to 2 May 1981.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment was due mainly to the necessity to ascertain the amount of supplementary welfare allowance due for refund to the health board.  When the amount advanced was established the balance of benefit due was paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put down these questions lightly.  I am a bit blue in the face from writing to the Department. Why has the situation not improved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy to go back here to what I said earlier during Question Time when we had a general discussion on the whole thing.  The Deputy was not here at that time, but if the Ceann Comhairle agrees we will go back on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These questions relate mainly to several weeks ago, some before Easter.  Basically the position has improved.  The questions relate to matters which arose when persons were not quoting RSI numbers or for various other reasons.  The only continuing problem now is difficulty in communication with the Department.  This is related to a grade claim, an across the board civil service claim which is at present under discussion and which we hope to have sorted out.  It has nothing whatever to do with the Department of Social Welfare but action in relation to the claim is being taken in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the volume of complaints from the public in regard to non-payments and underpayments is as great as ever, that it has not improved?  I am getting the same volume of complaints.  For instance, today I got a letter from a woman whose husband has been out of work since 31 January. He has five children and since 31 January <Col N="3001" /> he has been paid disability benefit at a single man's rate, £40.45 a week.  How is that man expected to live?  Why cannot cases like that be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the figures for payments being made weekly.  The average figure for disability payments is 71,000 cases a week.  Week in, week out, we have been paying about £73,000 for disability benefit payments.  So the general level of payments is up to the normal level.  I accept that there are outstanding problems and we are anxious to find those and have them sorted out.  We have a communication difficulty which I have adverted to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister got any way by which these queries can be answered when the Dáil is not in session? I find that these parliamentary questions are the only way I can get results.  If I <Col N="3002" /> write to the Department I do not get a reply for three or four months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that one of the problems is the volume of routine parliamentary questions which are being put into the Department and take up the time of the staff who deal with ministerial questions and questions for Deputies.  Once the parliamentary questions are not there they will be able to bring their other work up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to pay-related benefit could not be established until particulars of his previous net weekly earnings were <Col N="3004" /> known.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a simple answer to this question.  What recourse do the public have when it comes to non-payment of disability and pay-related benefits when the Dáil is not sitting?  Do they have to wait three or four months?  I know that one Deputy has resorted to sending telegrams to the Minister, but do we all have to do that?  What recourse do we have once this House closes down for four or five months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I said here earlier &mdash; and again I am sorry the Deputy was not here for a discussion &mdash; that I have placed my office and my staff available on overtime. The Deputy is very welcome to come in to meet them.  I know some Deputies deal with them personally on the telephone.  I know that we have a specific person in the Department dealing with a secretary for the Deputy and dealing continuously with that secretary for the Deputy.  It is a bit annoying then to find that, notwithstanding the very excellent service which is given, the Deputy in question puts down questions which have been answered some time ago.  That is the service which is available.  What happens is that the question currently is dealt with; it is passed on to the section in the Department and they are asked for the information that is requested by the Deputy. An acknowledgement is sent to the Deputy and as soon as the information is available for the Department the replies can be prepared.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 21 February 1981 and was paid all disability <Col N="3005" /> benefit and pay-related benefit due from 25 February 1981 to 4 April 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  The delay in payment of benefit was due to the fact that he quoted his insurance number instead of his RSI number on the medical certificates submitted in connection with his claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How up to date has the Minister got with regard to this cross-indexation that he has been speaking about?  Surely if a person submits his insurance number the Department should be able to relate it within a matter of minutes.  How advanced is the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking now about something that was paid a good while ago.  People are now quoting their RSI numbers.  The percentage who were not quoting their RSI numbers initially was between 25 and 30 per cent.  That is down now to between 8 and 10 per cent. At anytime one will get 7 per cent of people who will either give a wrong number or no number at all.  We are virtually back to the normal quotation of numbers. The system is vast with 70,000 claims in a week for disability benefit and we still have cases coming up which, because of the communication difficulty, have taken some more time to resolve.  But, by and large, the system is back to normal or is close to it.</P>

      <P>Although the investigations in this case have not yet been finalised, it has been ascertained that the person concerned has sufficient earnings to enable a partial payment of pay-related benefit to be made.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, arrangements have been made to make an interim payment of pay-related benefit this week.  When the inquiries are completed, the balance of pay-related benefit, if any, due will be paid as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if, in view of the need for a comprehensive timber processing industry, he will state the reason the Government have decided not to purchase a company (details supplied) in Waterford in view of his powers under the Forestry Act, 1946; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>As I already informed the Deputy in reply to a question on 4 March 1980, it is not intended to take over or nationalise Munster Chipboard Limited.</P>
      <P>The Government made every effort to achieve the re-opening of this mill and at one stage negotiations had been finalised with an Irish company.  As the Deputy will be aware, the company concerned withdrew from the proposed takeover because of the action of a small group of picketers.</P>
      <P>The operation of the particle board mill at Scarriff and of the proposed medium density fibreboard mill at Clonmel, together with other smaller existing outlets, will utilise all the smaller material coming from our forests for a considerable time to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the sole reason why the takeover did not <Col N="3016" /> take place was because of a picket by a few people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there was an Irish company actually ready to move into this mill and take it over and that the action of a small group of picketers dissuaded them from so doing.  Subsequent events may also have led them to make that decision, but the action of the group of picketers in no way helped to encourage the company concerned to move into the Munster Chipboard premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the premises could be used for some other purpose, I did mention that with the particle board mill at Scarriff and the medium density fibreboard mill which will come on stream in 1983, we will utilise all the available small materials and have maximum utilisation of all the small timber available in our forests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I can share a definite kinship of interest there with the Deputy, because the people in Athy, where there was a wallboard factory, would have the very same sentiments.  I assure the Deputy that timber being exported through the port of Waterford is a purely temporary measure.  It is timber in excess of our present needs which nobody wanted.  We got some people to take it for two or three years.  These people are tied up after that.  We have made provision since then that every bit of timber will be utilised in Clonmel, once that period is up.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 to 68, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under their terms of appointment, postmasters contract to provide certain services as well as the necessary accommodation and other facilities.  They are not required to give active personal service, but are paid an inclusive sum, related to volume of business and range of services, to provide for all expenses.</P>
      <P>The rates of remuneration and other conditions under which postmasters hold appointments have been settled on the basis of agreements negotiated with the Irish Postmasters' Union under the agreed scheme of conciliation and arbitration. The general rates of remuneration were last adjusted with effect from 1 March, 1980 following agreement on a union claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Postmasters' Union has recently submitted claims embracing the particular matters referred to by the Deputies and other matters.  Representations have also been received in support of these claims.  The issues concerned are the subject of current negotiations at the conciliation council.  The proceedings of <Col N="3023" /> the council are confidential and it would be inappropriate to comment on the position regarding these negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the responsibility for the post offices and for accountability for them but they do not have to give personal service.  In other words, they can hire people to do the work involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to be misleading.  Sub-post offices vary in size from very large to very small, depending on the district concerned.  In the very large ones there is sometimes the situation in which those who are the sub-postmasters may not be actually working on the premises.  However, they are responsible for every function of these sub-post offices.  If anything were found wrong an office could be closed on that account but they do not have to give personal active service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  Since the foundation of the State we have had various forms of discussions, both at conciliation and arbitration and otherwise, as to the best method of payment for postmasters. Many methods of payment have been tried out and public, private and individual investigations have continued but at the end of the day, and as recently as this year, it has been found that the best mode <Col N="3024" /> of remuneration for these people is the one that is in operation.  Admittedly, the remuneration of those in the smaller sub-post offices &mdash; and there are very few of those &mdash; is not great.  Presently we are in conciliation and arbitration on the matter and I cannot, therefore, discuss publicly the situation other than to hint that the point being raised relates to something that we would like to see being done.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to remove from the Finance Bill the authorisation for an increase in the so-called motor registration fee, which is in fact motor taxation.  Normally the process is that a fee charged by the State covers the cost of administration of a particular service provided by the scheme.  If that were the position in respect of motor registration one could accept that it be regarded as a fee, but in this case the revenue to be derived from this so-called fee is £13 million whereas the cost of administering motor registration amounts to no more than £2 million, thereby giving the State a profit of £11 million or more than five times the cost of the service.  Therefore, what we are talking about is motor taxation and not a fee.  The Government were elected to office in 1977 on the basis of a number of promises and now that this Dáil is meeting this afternoon for what may be the last time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we can say that one of the most notorious of these promises was the one to abolish motor tax.  It is to expose the fraud that lies at the heart of the strategy which resulted in Fianna Fáil's majority in 1977 that I am putting forward this amendment.  I wish to demonstrate that what we have here is motor taxation that was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance who is sitting in his seat on the basis of a promise made by his party to abolish such taxation.  This taxation is imposed on the motorists about whom Fianna Fáil were so concerned in 1977 and when, in the same Finance Bill, they were increasing dramatically the price of petrol, a commodity that is a necessity for anyone who has a car.  The truth must be told about what <Col N="3045" /> is really happening and it is to expose that truth that I have moved the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse what has been said by Deputy Bruton and to say that the crawling back by the Government on the promise to abolish motor taxation should be exposed for what it is. It is nothing short of reprehensible.  To refer to the tax being imposed as a registration fee is to treat the people with contempt, to have no regard for their intelligence.  What we are talking about is a tax imposition with a net gain to the Exchequer of £11 million out of a total income of £13 million.  This point has not been lost on the electorate.  That is why there is so much dithering on the part of the Taoiseach and his Government about when they should go to the country.</P>
      <P>I recall distinctly that on the night of the budget, when the Minister went on television to justify his actions, the Taoiseach was in this House dealing with the duty imposition on oil.  In regard to this taxation on cars he said that the amount that would accrue to the Exchequer would be £13 million gross.  He made the point that, had the old taxation system in existence until 1977 been allowed to continue, motorists would be paying in the region of £57 million, not £13 million. However, the Taoiseach did not point out that since 1977 the imposition of oil duty on motorists has come to a massive £50 million.  When that is added to the £13 million the total is £63 million, which is the amount motorists have to pay, not £57 million which would have been the amount had the tax been left as it was. Motorists are worse off now than they were in 1977 and they know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister or the Government saying that the abolition of road tax was carried out in order to help motorists.  The burden has been put on them to an even greater extent and it has been done in a most furtive way.  However, motorists are well aware of what has happened.  The call by Deputy Bruton to delete this provision is merely asking the Government to do what they promised in 1977.  Incidentally, that <Col N="3046" /> promise gained for them many thousands of votes.  However, the people are waiting to give their verdict and they will give it with a vengeance.  I am not the only one saying this.  Polls have been carried out by independent agencies and this fact has emerged.  This promise made by Fianna Fáil is being treated with cynicism by those to whom it was directed.  They have been fooled, and they know it.  Even though there may be delay in decision-making upstairs, the people's minds will not be changed on this matter.  They are waiting for the opportunity to give their verdict and this is one of the factors on which they will make their decision when the time comes.</P>

      <P>There is no difference in the arguments put forward now by Deputies opposite than those put forward on Committee Stage.  They are trying to create a false impression that this is anything other than an increase in the registration fee.  It is an increase in the registration fee.  I endorse what the Taoiseach said when the budget was introduced, that the income will be in the region of £13 million.  In addition, I wish to state that, if the same rate of tax existed now as was the case until 1977, they would bring in approximately £40 million and, if the rates were increased in line with the figures suggested by Deputy O'Toole, the amount would be greater. He said the amount would be £57 million, but my figure is approximately £65 million. Despite the efforts of the Opposition to put a different construction on this matter, the people are well aware of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 31, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;40.&mdash;Value-Added Tax shall be charged, levied and paid on furniture and carpets, manufactured in the State, as if these goods were imported goods to which section 15 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 applies&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3048" /> This concerns a problem that is particularly serious in my constituency.  Apart from the income derived from mining, the town of Navan gets much of its economic sustenance from the furniture and carpet industries, what might broadly be described as the furnishings industry.  The goods in these categories are very expensive and they tend to remain in stock for quite some time in retail outlets before they are sold.  A difference in the method of calculating value-added tax &mdash; for instance, with regard to the collection date &mdash; between imported goods in this category and domestically-produced goods means that the latter are at a disadvantage. As I understand it, the position is that in respect of imported furniture and carpets VAT is not charged and due to be paid until the goods are sold at retail level to the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in the case of Irish produced carpets and furniture, value-added tax falls due at the time they leave the factory to go to the shops.  As I have indicated, the delay between the time an item of furniture goes to the shop and when it is actually sold to the consumer could be anything up to five or six months because, being a high value product, it tends to remain in stock for quite some time.</P>
    <P>The traders who are selling these goods to the consumer usually hold their stocks on the basis of borrowed money upon which they are paying interest.  It is borrowed money which enables them to finance the holding of stock from the time it arrives at the shop until it is sold to the consumer.  In the case of furniture and furnishings that may be six months.  Interest rates being what they are, the cost involved could be anything up to 7 or 8 per cent of the cost of the item, that is, the interest alone involved in simply holding the item in stock for half a year.</P>
    <P>If they have to pay value-added tax on imported goods but not until the item is sold to the consumer, they make a considerable saving because that money does not fall due until much later, and no money has to be borrowed to finance the VAT payment until after the item is sold. Conversely, an item sold to them by an <Col N="3049" /> Irish manufacturer includes VAT and, therefore, at the time the item comes into their shop they have to borrow money to pay the VAT straight away.  There can be a difference of up to six months in the payment date for value-added tax between imported and domestically produced products to the disadvantage of domestically produced products.</P>
    <P>This might not be a very significant matter if furniture and furnishing bore a relatively low level of VAT, or even a modest level of VAT such as the 10 per cent rate.  The amount of additional money which would have to be borrowed for six months would constitute only 10 per cent of the value of the product. Furniture and furnishings bear the maximum 25 per cent of the value of the product rate of value-added tax.  In the case of Irish produced products, retailers have to borrow money to the extent of 25 per cent of the value of the product for six months, assuming there is a delay of six months between arrival at the retail outlet and sale.  That may not always be the case.  The average period may be less than that.  That is an extreme situation which can occur.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put very strongly to me by people in the furniture industry in particular and the carpet industry in Meath.  They feel that, because of the way the tax code operates at the moment, it puts them at a disadvantage as against foreign competition in imported furniture and furnishings.  As the Minister is aware, we are having increasing problems with the penetration of our market by imported furniture and furnishings.  The furniture manufacturers in Navan and elsewhere in Meath have asked me to raise this matter in the Dáil, which I am now doing.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to making some concession on this issue. The amendment I am proposing is to the effect that VAT will not fall to be paid on furniture and furnishings until such time as the items are actually sold to the consumer in all cases, both in the case of domestically produced furniture and furnishings and imported furniture and furnishings, so that there will be no disadvantage <Col N="3050" /> resting upon Irish producers of carpets and furniture.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Bruton had to say on this amendment and on Committee Stage when he introduced this subject, my preference, which is well known, would be to ensure that the domestically manufactured product is favoured in every possible way. Here we are dealing with the choice which is open to a person between importing and purchasing from a domestic manufacturer and whether or not the VAT system favours one above the other.</P>
      <P>In either event VAT on the eventual retail sale will arise and be paid at precisely the same time, namely, at the end of the accounting period during which the sale occurred.  I accept that is not Deputy Bruton's point but I want to start from that base.  Regarding VAT on purchases by retailers in the case of imports, in practice the retailer pays and reclaims VAT simultaneously at the end of the accounting period in which the import is made.  In the case of domestic purchases the retailer claims a VAT refund also at the end of the accounting period in which the goods are invoiced to him, and pays VAT to the manufacturer or wholesaler when the invoice falls due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus the question of a VAT incentive or disincentive to purchase domestically hinges on whether the period of trade credit offered by the domestic manufacturer or wholesaler exceeds the 50 days average time lag between invoice and receipt of VAT credit from the Revenue authorities.  In practice, it appears that the relevant period of credit in general is more than 50 days, thus implying that there would be a marginal VAT advantage from the domestic purchase.  In other words, the indications we have are that the margin would be in favour of the domestic purchaser rather than what is being alleged by Deputy Bruton.  I say &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; because we are talking about a very marginal situation.  In all the circumstances I am satisfied from an examination of the matter that the present arrangements remain appropriate and <Col N="3051" /> accordingly I do not believe the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that because of the structure of this debate it is not possible for me to question the Minister about some of the things he said.  It is only by questioning him that one could arrive at a true understanding of the position.  I understand the Minister said that the money must be paid at a date following the end of the accounting period during which the sale was made. The relevant question is: which sale?  Is it the sale to the retailer or the sale by the retailer?  My understanding from the manufacturers to whom I have spoken is that, in the case of imported furniture, the relevant date of sale is the date of sale of the item to the consumer, whereas in the case of domestic producers the relevant date of sale is the date of sale to the retailer.  That is my understanding.  I do not know if the Minister will contradict that.  Perhaps he will.</P>
      <P>Therefore the position is that it is possible that in respect of two consignments of furniture, both arriving on the same day in a retailer's store, both of them sold six months later &mdash; in view of the fact that the accounting period for value-added tax is a two month period &mdash; the payment on the domestically-produced furniture would fall due in the first two-month period whereas the payment on the imported item would not fall due until the next payment period but one. That is my understanding of the position. Although the Minister did not specifically deny what I have said he seemed to suggest that I was interpreting the results incorrectly.  Unfortunately I cannot question him on that to establish exactly what he meant by what he said.  But that is my understanding of the situation and I am putting it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is the fact that in order to obtain what the Minister describes as a marginal advantage to the domestic producer as far as value-added tax is concerned, the domestic producer has to give a credit period of more than 50 days.  I <Col N="3052" /> am not aware of what is the normal credit period in this situation.  But if, in order to prevent themselves being placed at a disadvantage as far as the retailer is concerned domestic producers of furniture have to give longer credit periods than they would otherwise give, or than competing imported producers have to give to put themselves in the same position, then that is just as much a disadvantage to the domestic producer.  If the domestic producer, as a continuing practice, has to give a longer credit period than the importer &mdash; by virtue of the operation of the value-added tax system &mdash; then, of course, that additional interest payment which has to be met by the domestic producer will be reflected in the price of his product because he must build the extra interest into the price he charges. Consequently his product will be artificially dearer than the imported one by virtue of the operation of the value-added system if value-added tax forces him into giving a longer credit period &mdash; in order to attain the situation the Minister says is advantageous &mdash; than he would otherwise give or than an importer would give.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I am unable to question the Minister about the situation.  It is a pity I am not able to do so because we would perhaps be able to tease this out and reach a better understanding on both sides of the House of what is exactly the situation.  That is not possible at this stage but I have availed of the opportunity to make the case on behalf of the manufacturers in my constituency.  I hope an opportunity will present itself in the not too distant future to put this matter right.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 32, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;43.  &mdash;The Second Schedule to the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>`(xxi)  hay and silage making'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with the position of farmers who are unable to get contracting services.  Since the making of silage has become common it has become very necessary to be able to obtain the services of a contractor exactly at the right time that the grass is ready so that good silage will be made.  If, at the time that the grass is just turning and starting to run into seed, one is not able to get the contractor, a week or two passes and the silage is not cut, a lot of the goodness in the grass goes up into the seed and the silage subsequently made is not as nutritious or digestible for the animals.  This timing in regard to the making of silage, getting it cut at the right time, can make all the difference between a profitable and unprofitable season for the farmer. <Col N="3054" /> All of the advice being given at present suggests that this is so.</P>
    <P>Therefore the position is quite serious if there is any evidence that the availability of contracting services to farmers at the right time, in sufficient quantity, is in any sense diminished.  Suggestions have been made to me that because of the operation of the 10 per cent value-added tax on the services provided by contractors, and the serious bookkeeping requirements this imposes on them, many people who were in the business of providing contracting services to neighbouring farmers have ceased to do so. This has meant that many farmers simply cannot get their silage or hay cut at the time they want it.  It has been suggested to me that one way of alleviating this situation would be to provide that hay and silage contracting services should bear the lower 3 per cent rate of value-added tax which already applies to the building and construction industry and the services provided in that industry.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of my amendment. I hope that, as a result of doing so, the serious problem of the availability of contracting services will be sympathetically investigated by the Minister, that he will see his way either to accepting this amendment or making some similar provision that will assist in the maintenance and increased provision of contracting services in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Hay and silage-making services provided by agricultural contractors who are registered for value-added tax purposes are liable at the lower rate of VAT, namely, 10 per cent. However, any such VAT paid by unregistered farmers is covered by the flat rate VAT rebate of 1 per cent while registered farmers may reclaim such VAT in the normal way as VAT paid on the service required as part of their business. Furthermore, hay and silage-making services provided by very small contractors, or by farmers using their own machinery, who do not have to register for VAT purposes, are of course VAT-free. I should say &mdash; and the Deputy well knows &mdash; that hay and silage making is <Col N="3055" /> just one of the many services now provided by agricultural contractors.</P>
      <P>In addition to the quite favourable VAT position I have just outlined, building, drainage and reclamation services provided by registered contractors are all regarded as being liable to the special low building rate of VAT, that is 3 per cent, and any such VAT paid on grant-aided work can be reclaimed directly even by unregistered farmers.</P>
      <P>All in all the Deputy must accept that any further reliefs in this area &mdash; even were such possible given the constraints of EEC membership obligations &mdash; would be difficult to justify to the rest of the Community or indeed on the merits of the case.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is, briefly, to empower the Minister for Finance to make available capital moneys up to a limit of £350 million for the development of the telecommunications services.  This Bill differs from earlier Telephone Capital Bills in two respects.  Telephone Capital Acts provided for capital expenditure on the telephone service only.  This Bill seeks to make provision for capital expenditure on telegram, telex and data services as well as providing the capital required for development of the telephone service.  The second difference is <Col N="3056" /> that Telephone Capital Acts sought to make sufficient funds availble to cater for five years; the present Bill, however, seeks to make provision to advance funds for a shorter period.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the changes from earlier Telephone Capital Acts, it might be helpful if I were to explain briefly how the telephone service is financed. Expenditure on the telephone service is broadly of two kinds.  One is expenditure on the day-to-day operation of the service and on the maintenance and upkeep of existing plant.  This expenditure, which is normally balanced by telephone revenues paid into the Exchequer, is met out of moneys voted annually by this House.</P>
    <P>The other kind of expenditure on the telephone service is capital invested in development works such as the provision of new telephone exchanges, trunk routes, underground and overhead cables, and the installation of telephones for subscribers.  The moneys required for these works are issued out of the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance on the basis of annual allocations of capital to my Department as part of the public capital programme.  These moneys form an increasingly significant part of the public capital programme.  The moneys have been made available under the authority of Telephone Capital Acts which are enabling Acts empowering the Minister for Finance to issue moneys out of the Central Fund for this purpose.  The capital provided in this way and the interest payable on it are repaid in the form of annuities extending over a period of 25 years, provision being made for these repayments annually in subhead G of the Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>The practice heretofore has been that all expenditure on the telegram, telex and data services, whether on day-to-day maintenance or development, has been met out of moneys voted annually by this House.  A distinction has not been made between the method of funding maintenance and of funding development of these services because the annual development costs have, in general, been relatively small.  While the capital sums needed for development of the telegram, telex and data services are still small in <Col N="3057" /> relation to the costs of telephone development, they are significant enough &mdash; up to £15 million over the next two years or so &mdash; to warrant making provision for them as a capital expense and it is proposed that the funding of capital expenditure on these services should now be brought into line with that for telephone development.  It is anomalous that the funding of a new telex exchange or of a new data centre should be treated differently from that of a new telephone exchange and this Bill includes provision to bring them into line.</P>
    <P>There is one other accounting change to which I should refer.  That relates to the treatment of renewal of existing plant and equipment.  Much of this expenditure at present is borne on the Vote.  Replacement plant and equipment increase the earning potential and life of the assets. Moreover, in the case of telephone exchanges, for example, an old exchange is simply not replaced by a new one of the same kind.  The new one provides modern facilities and usually makes provision for growth for a period beyond the capacity of the equipment being replaced.  Normal commercial accountancy procedure is to treat such replacements as a capital charge and it is proposed to bring expenditure on renewal of telecommunications plant and equipment into line with commercial practice. The effect is not significant &mdash; about £5.5 million would be transferred from Vote to capital in the current year on this basis &mdash; but it is desirable, nevertheless, that good commercial accountancy practice should be followed.</P>
    <P>Telephone Capital Acts were normally intended to provide the capital needed for a period of about five years ahead. On this occasion, however, provision is not being made for such an extended period, the reason being that, as Deputies will be aware, it is planned that responsibility for operating the telecommunications services will be vested in a State sponsored body expected to be established next year.  The new body will have powers to raise its own capital and will be expected to do so from the outset. However, it is not possible to be certain <Col N="3058" /> at this stage when exactly the new body will be established and it is regarded as prudent to make provision for any possible delay that might arise in establishing the State sponsored body and for any difficulty the new board might have in raising quickly the capital it required. This Act would simply empower the Minister for Finance to make issues from the Central Fund; it would not require him to do so and the amount for which authority is now being sought will be drawn on only to the extent necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that it is planned to have telephone development to the value of £100 million financed from private sources this year.  This is not covered by the provisions of this Bill.  The aim will be to raise funds in this way also next year; the amount will be dependent on overall requirements and particularly on the success of the arrangement this year.</P>
    <P>There have been 13 Telephone Capital Acts since 1922 making provision for the advancing of capital for telephone development. The last such Act, in 1977, provided for advances of up to £350 million. This sum represented the estimated cost in 1977 terms of meeting capital requirements during the period from mid-1977 to mid-1982 for the programme of work then envisaged.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year, advances made under the 1977 Act amounted to about £270 million and the balance remaining will not be sufficient to provide for this year's investment programme.  The need for a new Act now, rather than in 1982, is due to two factors &mdash; the acceleration of the telephone development programme announced by the Government in July 1979, and which is being implemented as rapidly as possible, and the effects of higher costs since 1977.  The acceleration of the programme has given rise to a demand for capital substantially in excess of that envisaged when the 1977 programme was being prepared.  For example, the amount spent last year was over £123 million and the approved allocation for this year is £220 million.</P>
    <P>Despite prolonged industrial action in 1978 and in 1979, which drastically restricted the work that could be done in <Col N="3059" /> those years, the programme of work then envisaged has been overtaken and the foundations laid for much more rapid progress in the period ahead.  The current targets are to make 80,000 connections this year and 100,000 connections next year.  At present, about 90 per cent of subscribers have an automatic service, this will be increased to 96 per cent by the end of 1982 and most of the remainder should have it by the end of 1983 or certainly early in 1984.</P>
    <P>The local distribution network throughout the country, comprising mostly underground cabling in built-up areas and overhead cabling elsewhere, was considerably expanded.  But, of course, very much remains to be done to get into a position where applications for telephones can be met promptly, as envisaged in the current accelerated development programme.  This is the major area of difficulty in meeting the objectives of the current programme.</P>
    <P>In the period since the 1977 Act was passed many new automatic telephone exchanges were installed and over 60 additional automatic exchanges were provided in replacement of manual exchanges at various centres throughout the country, including Letterkenny, Roscrea, Edenderry, Bailieborough, Rathdowney, Knock, Kingscourt, Newcastlewest and Kiltimagh.  Major extensions and replacements of existing automatic exchanges were carried out or are in progress at several locations in Dublin including Shankill, Beggars Bush, GPO, Santry, Belcamp, Blanchardstown, Rathmines and Ballyboden.  In all, new equipment was installed at about 175 locations by the end of 1980.</P>
    <P>The quantity of equipment installed in automatic exchanges for connecting subscribers' exchanges lines was increased by 22 per cent.  About 2,500 extra trunk circuits were added to the system last year alone and additional trunk equipment provided at numerous centres. Direct dialling of calls to over 50 countries has now been made available to over 60 per cent of non-coinbox subscribers in automatic areas and direct dialling of calls to selected centres in Britain and <Col N="3060" /> Northern Ireland is now available to all non-coinbox subscribers in automatic areas.</P>
    <P>The number of international circuits, not including those to Britain, was increased by over 33 per cent.  New telephone buildings and extensions to existing telephone buildings were completed in about 120 centres.</P>
    <P>Because of the integrated nature of the telephone system, the full benefits of numbers of schemes already completed will not become evident until complementary works have been carried out. Many main and complementary projects are in progress on which heavy expenditure has been incurred but these will not be completed for some time yet.</P>
    <P>In introducing the 1977 Telephone Capital Bill my predecessor envisaged the use, at least on an experimental basis, of electronic exchanges.  Since then several telecommunications administrations have decided to use digital electronic exchanges.  Following international competition in 1979, the Department selected two suppliers of this equipment last year, namely Telectron Ltd. of Dublin, providing French-designed equipment, and L. M. Ericsson of Athlone, providing Swedish-designed equipment.  The equipment is to be delivered under long-term agreements providing for manufacture of the exchanges here to the maximum extent practicable as quickly as local manufacture can be arranged. The first deliveries of these exchanges from both suppliers are expected to be in service later this year.  Digital exchanges will be the main type installed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not have to tell Deputies that much remains to be done to improve the standard of our telephone service.  There are still significant problems in the service, particularly the comparatively large number of subscribers having only a manual service, the unsatisfactory quality of the STD service in many areas and the big waiting list for telephones.  However, improvements are beginning to be experienced already and will be more evident with the passage of time, but it will take up to the end of 1984 before these problems <Col N="3061" /> are resolved in the country generally.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the work programme for the coming years, there are some general aspects of telecommunications to which I propose to refer.  Telecommunications, and in particular the telephone service, which provides the basic infrastructure for all telecommunications services, have an economic and social importance for society that was not always appreciated.  An efficient and developed telecommunications service is an essential adjunct to the industrial development needed to provide jobs both in the short and long terms.  New jobs will be needed to provide for the growing labour force and also to replace job losses in some of the older declining industries.  Many of the newer industries are at present and will be in the future in electronics and computer areas which will make much heavier demands on our telecommunications services than the older industries.  In addition to an increased demand from business and industry there is also a growing demand by private residence subscribers.  I might add that pressures similar to those being felt here are being experienced throughout the world in countries undergoing the rapid development stage of telecommunications as we are.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications are a capital intensive industry and it has been noted in studies of the telecommunications service on an international basis that for each £1 of income it is necessary to have £3 of capital invested in equipment.  This is the reverse of most manufacturing industries where the capital invested in the equipment is the order of one-third of the annual turnover.  From a financing point of view, therefore, telecommunications are more appropriately compared with capital intensive activities such as housing than with manufacturing industry. The fixed assets of the Department's telephone business at the end of 1980 were £455 million while the income for that year was £155 million.</P>
    <P>At present the average capital cost of connecting a new subscriber to the local network is approximately £1,100, and this does not take into account the additonal <Col N="3062" /> investment necessary to increase the capacity of the trunk network to cater for the extra trunk call traffic generated. This heavy investment in the existing network explains, in part, the difficulties of modernisation.  The life of telecommunication plant can be up to 40 years and any new equipment must be compatible with older equipment.</P>
    <P>At present it is necessary for countries with highly developed telecommunications services to invest from 1/2 per cent to 1 per cent of their gross national product in telecommunications just to keep pace with modern developments.  In our case, however, we will have to spend over 2 per cent of our gross national product per year for a few years to raise the quality of the service to an acceptable standard and to meet existing and expected demand for telephones.  After the development period the investment requirements will drop to the normal level, but a relatively high level of investment will be necessary on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>In the telecommunications service the average investment in land and buildings on an international basis is about 5 per cent.  In practice sites and buildings accounted for up to 22 per cent of the capital investment of £123 million here last year.  This year the figure is expected to be 27 per cent and gives some idea of the size of the building programme that has had to be undertaken by the Department in building up the infrastructure of the service to the desired level.  Altogether some 500 sites and buildings are being provided in the current development programme at a cost of about £120 million.  These buildings are required for new trunk and local telephone exchanges, for extension or replacement of existing exchanges, for conversion of the remaining manual exchanges to automatic working, for staff headquarters and for staff training centres, for stores and for motor garages.</P>
    <P>This development is necessary to meet the stated objectives of the current five year programme, which are:</P>
    <P>Raising the quality of the telephone, telex and data services for subscribers to the level in other EEC countries and maintaining it at that level;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3063" /> Providing a fully automatic service, including subscriber trunk dialling, internally and internationally for all subscribers;</P>
    <P>Increasing the rate of connections so that applications for telephones can generally be met on demand;</P>
    <P>Laying the groundwork to cater for continuing growth.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to deal with developments in the period ahead.  The current development programme covers the period 1980-1984 and is estimated to cost over £800 million at 1980 price levels.  Well over half of the total sum of £800 million will be invested in 1981 and 1982 with a gradual levelling off of expenditure in the rest of the period.  About £80 million of this £800 million will be advanced under the Telephone Capital Act, 1977.  The sums required are clearly substantial by standards of this country, but it may be helpful in appreciating how capital intensive the telecommunications service is if I say that, despite the much more developed state of the services there, investment on telecommunications in Britain has been running at the order of £1.5 to £2 billion pounds a year over the last ten years or so and will apparently continue at this level at least.  The £800 million will be spent under the following main headings:</P>
    <P>subscriber and local network development,</P>
    <P>local exchange development,</P>
    <P>trunk development and</P>
    <P>buildings.</P>
    <P>Under the subscriber and local network development programme proposed the number of connections will be increased from 60,000 last year to 80,000 this year and to 100,000 next year.  In the years after that the rate of connections will be further increased to 120,000 a year, if the level of demand in the meantime should warrant this.  These rates of connections, if achieved, should on the basis of present forecasts of demand effectively eliminate the waiting list by the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3064" /> I should like to stress two points in relation to this.  The first is the enormous task involved in increasing the rates of connection as proposed.  To provide a telephone connection involves the wiring of customer's premises, the installation of the phone, having a pair of wires from each telephone, whether in overhead or underground cable, back to the nearest exchange, having spare terminations in the local exchange to which the phone can be connected, and having adequate capacity in the trunk exchange and trunk circuit network to carry the extra traffic generated.  The work involved in providing a telephone is broadly the same from one year to the next.  It will be realised therefore that increasing the annual rate of connections from a little over 40,000, the highest rate achieved before last year, to 120,000 is a major undertaking.  In particular it will require a very substantial increase in the local cabling network, whether by laying underground pipes and cables or by erecting poles and stringing wires overhead &mdash; all of which are highly labour intensive as well, of course, as being expensive.  I have made this point before and repeat it now because there seems to be a fairly widely held view that increasing the connection rate of new telephones is a relatively simple task; it is not.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make is that it is hard to forecast with confidence what the level of demand is likely to be over a five-year period.  Demand is affected significantly by the general state of the country's economy which, in turn, is dependent on the state of the world economy and particularly that in the main countries with which we trade.  A further uncertainty in assessing the demand for telephones is what effect the more ready availability of telephones will have.  However, what is clear is that, based on experience, there will be a greatly increased demand for telephone service in the years ahead.  For example, in the three years, 1969 to 1971, the annual rate of application was 25,000; in the years 1974 to 1976 it was 37,000 a year; and in the years 1978 to 1980 it was 57,000 a year and still growing.  A growth trend can be expected to continue for some time and development <Col N="3065" /> plans are on the basis that it will do so.</P>
    <P>Connections on the scale envisaged will bring the total number of telephones in service to 800,000 by end 1982 &mdash; 23 telephones per 100 head population &mdash; and to over one million by the end of 1984 or 28 per 100 head of population. These figures will still leave this country lowly placed in the European league table for telephone density but there are factors such as the bigger family size in this country which may always leave telephone density in this country lower than in other advanced countries.</P>
    <P>To reach the figures I have quoted it will, as I said, be necessary to expand greatly the subscriber underground and overhead plant network throughout the whole country, both urban and rural areas.  In addition to that provision must also be made so that a high level of connections can continue to be made in the years immediately following the current programme period.</P>
    <P>To meet the demand for new subscribers' lines additional automatic exchange equipment will be provided at virtually all existing exchanges.  Over the next two years, some 300 new exchanges will be provided or existing ones extended. These will include major installations at Ballyboden, Belcamp, Clondalkin, Crown Alley, Dolphins Barn, Finglas, Terenure and Tallaght in Dublin and Athlone, Ballinasloe, Bantry, Carlow, Castleblaney, Cavan, Ceanannus Mor, Clonmel, Cork &mdash; ten centres &mdash; Donegal, Drogheda, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Galway  &mdash; Shantalla and Mervue &mdash; Kilkenny, Mullingar, Naas, New Ross, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford and Wexford, to name but some of the bigger centres in the provincial areas.  All the remaining 450 manual exchanges will, it is planned, be converted to automatic working by end 1984.  The aim is to change over almost 300 of them over the next two years but it is not possible to be certain at this stage that this can be done as the volume of work involved in conversions by way of overhaul and replacement <Col N="3066" /> of linework, changing of instruments and so on is very great and staffing resources may be inadequate to cope with a peak of work of this kind over such a short period.  However, every effort will be made to meet this target.  As the programme progresses, digital equipment will form the greater part of the equipment being installed.  In all, subscriber exchange capacity will be increased by about 440,000 lines by the end of 1984 making it possible, in so far as subscriber exchange equipment is concerned, to give service to that number of additional subscribers.</P>
    <P>The development of the trunk system to enable the volume of traffic offering at present to be carried without difficulty and to handle the normal traffic growth as well as that generated by the increase in the number of customers is a major objective of the programme.  The new trunk exchange opened at Adelaide Road in Dublin recently, which will be brought fully into service on a progressive basis over the next few months, will allow of several thousand extra trunk circuits being brought into use on the main trunk routes to and from Dublin city.  This should greatly improve the standard of STD service on these routes and, indeed, has already brought substantial improvements on some routes, but it will not eliminate altogether the congestion being experienced in the Dublin trunk exchanges and on the routes to and from Dublin.  That will have to await the opening about the end of this year or early next year of a further exchange being installed in Dublin at present and the provision of a digital exchange on order to be installed next year.</P>
    <P>Almost all existing trunk exchanges will have to be supplemented and most trunk routes will have to be strengthened during the period of the current programme ending in 1984.  Action is in train to do this.  Naturally, some schemes are more advanced than others.  I have referred to trunk exchange development in Dublin already.  New trunk exchanges are expected to be opened at the following centres outside Dublin this year:</P>

    <P>Many other smaller, but nevertheless important, routes will also be strengthened. Altogether, it is planned to increase trunk circuit system capacity by the end of 1984 by about 30,000 extra circuits in microwave radio links, over 20,000 extra circuits on coaxial cables and about 20,000 more by underground cabling, multiplex equipment and optical fibre cables.  The number of trunk circuits in use at present is about 33,000 and that puts the projected additional system capacity into perspective.  Work on improving the trunk exchange and trunk circuit system will, of course, be a continuing <Col N="3068" /> feature, and the development work carried out in the next few years will have to be built on in the years after that, but the major work will be done over the next two to three years.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, calls can be dialled by customers to selected centres in Northern Ireland and Britain.  The centres are Belfast, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester.  Discussions have been taking place with the British Post Office for some time past on extending direct dialling to all areas in Northern Ireland and Britain as any extension can take place only in co-operation with the British Post Office.  There are difficult technical problems involved for which it had not been possible to provide acceptable solutions. As a result of recent technical developments, however, and in particular the introduction of digital exchanges, it is now expected that it will be possible to find satisfactory solutions to the technical problems.  Discussions with the British Post Office have, therefore, been intensified and I am hopeful that a substantial extension of direct dialling to centres in Northern Ireland and Britain will be possible within the next two years or so.</P>
    <P>International direct dialling is now available from non-coinbox lines for about 60 per cent of all subscribers, having been extended to subscribers in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Drogheda, Dundalk and Athlone over the last two years or so.  New trunk exchanges now on order include the equipment needed to enable subscribers dial their international calls and this year it is expected the facility will be made available to users in Bantry, Ceanannus Mór, Donegal, Kilkenny, Longford, Mullingar, Naas and Tralee.  This facility will be extended to other centres according as new trunk exchanges are installed in the centres switching their trunk traffic.</P>
    <P>With the spread of automatic service there will be a run down of telephone operating staff over the next few years but there should be no overall redundancy of full-time staff.</P>
    <P>International traffic has been growing at a much faster rate than internal traffic <Col N="3069" /> and the existing international telephone exchange is being extended to cater for this growth.  A second international exchange in Dublin is planned for 1985, but much of the advance work will be done in the period up to the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>A satellite earth station, which will provide circuits for traffic to North and South America and part of Africa, is planned to come into operation in 1984. A site for the earth station has already been acquired near Midleton, County Cork, and preliminary work on the design of the earth station is in progress. This country has already shares in international telecommunications satellites and is at present exploring the question of taking shares in a European satellite planned to come into operation in 1983-84. My Department are also keeping in close touch with the development of business satellite systems which are beginning to be used extensively in the United States with a view to assessing the scope for their use here.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in acquiring sites and in having buildings erected quickly have in the past been a main cause of slowing telephone development.  Measures taken over the last few years and currently being taken should ensure that in about two years these are no longer a barrier to progress.  Virtually all the sites for the 500 buildings needed have been acquired and by the end of this year work on about 400 of these will either have been completed or be in progress.  I have already referred to the cost of putting right deficiencies in accommodation.  This expenditure is, of course, essential and is being well spent.</P>
    <P>I propose now to refer to a number of other developments that will have an impact on the quality of service.  The first is the introduction of trunk dialling payphones. A small number of trunk dialling payphones have been in experimental use in selected public call offices in Dublin and provincial areas for some time with satisfactory results.  Payphones providing this facility are now being installed in the busiest public kiosks in Dublin and at other centres throughout the country. The aim is to instal them in all public call offices over the next two to three years <Col N="3070" /> and they will be made availble for rental to subscribers who opt for them.  In addition, trials of a new type of payphone suitable for installation in supervised locations such as public houses, shops, hotels, and so forth will take place in this period.</P>
    <P>There are at present approximately 38,000 coinboxes in the country, including over 4,000 public telephones in kiosks and call offices.  About 30 per cent of all calls via telephone operators are made from coinboxes.  The new payphones providing the trunk dialling facility will therefore have a dual benefit in enabling callers to make their calls more quickly and in reducing the demand for operator assistance, thus helping to secure the benefits that should follow from extension of the automatic service.</P>
    <P>Policy in regard to provision of kiosks in urban areas is that they are installed only where they are considered likely to pay their way and existing facilities are regarded as not meeting the need for public telephone facilities.  However, the need for more kiosks in expanding urban areas is recognised and numbers of additional kiosks are, for example, being provided in the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas at present.  The needs of other housing estates in the country generally are also being reviewed.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 kiosks have been provided in rural areas in replacement of call office telephones in rural post offices where the use likely to be made of the kiosks would justify this.  The stage has now been reached where all but about 300 of the call office telephones in rural post offices have been replaced by kiosks.  A programme is being drawn up at present to replace these call offices by external telephone kiosks over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In addition, kiosks are now being provided in rural areas where there is no local post office but where the use likely to be made of a phone would justify its provision.  In deciding whether a kiosk should be provided in such cases regard is had to social and demographic factors, such as the number of houses in the catchment area, the density of private telephones and whether there are churches, schools and shops in the area which <Col N="3071" /> would affect the use likely to be made of a public telephone.  The number of kiosks being provided in rural areas is being extended gradually on this basis and this programme will be continued.</P>
    <P>A scheme is also in operation whereby local authorities may have kiosks provided at their request under guarantee against loss in areas where their provision would not be justified on the basis of the Department's criteria.</P>
    <P>A decision in principle has been taken to introduce a mobile public radio telephone service as soon as possible.  A survey has been carried out to determine the likely size of the market.  The technical requirements are now being examined and an order for the necessary equipment will be placed as soon as possible.  The service will be introduced initially in the Dublin area and will be extended later to other centres, if the demand warrants this.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of other new services that it is proposed will be offered to customers in the course of time, but in the short term the priority must be to improve the basic services and it is proposed to concentrate resources on doing this.</P>
    <P>As in other countries, the telegram service is in decline and this trend is expected to continue.  It is unlikely that any major capital expenditure will be incurred in development of this service over the next two years or so.  The telex service is expanding rapidly and there is a waiting list of some 1,500 for it.  A new telex exchange is being installed in Dublin at present and a number of sub-exchanges are being provided at key centres outside Dublin.  It is planned to meet some 2,000 applications this year and the aim is to get into a position by the end of next year where there will no longer be delay in meeting applications for telex service.</P>
    <P>There is also a growing demand for data services and here too it is proposed to increase the rate of installation substantially this year and next year so that it should be possible to respond quickly to applications.  A service enabling data users to access data banks in other EEC <Col N="3072" /> countries was opened last year and this year a similar service will be opened to the United States and Canada.</P>
    <P>Turning to the financial position of the telecommunications service, the general principle is that, taking one year with another, the services should pay their way.  The charges for the services have had to be increased at intervals in recent years to maintain income and expenditure reasonably in balance.  Investment in the services is therefore largely paid for by the users.  For almost 40 years until the 1971-72 financial year the telephone service operated at a profit.  The period since then has been one of exceptional difficulty for the finances of the service, due to a combination of factors &mdash; high rate of inflation, high interest rates, economic recession and industrial action.</P>
    <P>A programme of rapid expansion in a capital intensive service such as telephones normally results in a temporary worsening of the financial position.  A return on the investment of some £120 million in buildings will not, for example, begin to be received until the exchanges for which they are required are brought into use or the staff to be housed in them are recruited and even then only a partial return is usually received as buildings cater for requirements for many years ahead.  A rather similar situation applies to telephone exchanges and trunk circuits. Where therefore, a major expansion of the basic infrastructure is undertaken over a short period a temporary worsening of the financial position is inevitable.  However, as the development programme proceeds the financial position will improve.  The connection of big numbers of additional subscribers to the network will yield substantial extra revenue from connection and rental charges as well as generating extra call traffic. The improvement of the trunk network should also lead to a growth in traffic. The financial position of the service should therefore improve on a gradual basis and should be much improved by the end of the programme period in 1984.</P>
    <P>In practice an appreciable part of the capital invested comes from within the service.  Of the capital required over the next two years, about £70 millions will be <Col N="3073" /> met from depreciation provisions.  Over the past few years loans amounting to almost £165 million have been made available to the Minister for Finance from the European Investment Bank and other EEC institutions for development of the telephone service.  Grants of about £75 million from the European Regional Development Fund have also been approved for telephone projects.  These loans and grants have, I need hardly say, been most welcome.</P>
    <P>The development programme will have a dual effect on employment.  In the first instance an improved standard of telecommunications service should enable existing business and industry to function more effectively and should be helpful in attracting foreign industrialists to establish industries here, both of which should lead to extra employment.</P>
    <P>It will also facilitate this on-going effort to attract more industry to the more remote parts of this country and advance still further the Government's stated policy on decentralisation.</P>

The accelerated programme has generated substantial extra employment in all of these already and it is expected that in the current year the investment of £220 million which forms part of the Government's investment plan will provide jobs for some 4,480 more.  A high proportion of these jobs will be on skilled or semiskilled work.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="3074" /> I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil morán ama fágtha agam.  An mbeidh deis againn an cheist a phlé an Mhairt seo chugainn? We on this side of the House have no objection to this Bill, which can be described legitimately as an interim measure.  As the Minister pointed out, the 13 Telephone Capital Bills introduced since the foundation of the State usually made provision for a five-year period.  This Bill is making provision for a shorter period.  Because of a decision of the Government a new State board, An Bord Telecom, has been set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and this Bill will provide the money to keep the show going.  Previous Bills made provision for capital expenditure on telephone services only, whereas this Bill is making provision for capital expenditure on telegrams, telex and data services, as well as providing the capital required for the development of our telephone services.  I have only six minutes left this evening and I do not know if I will have an opportunity next week to discuss this Bill.  That is in the hands of the Taoiseach and the Lord.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the outcome of the election or what Government are in power, the modernising and streamlining of our telecommunications system must be a top priority.  We must admit that our telephone service is the worst in Europe. Despite the apparent spurt of activity over the past year and the various programmes outlined by the Minister, there is yet no real evidence of any significant improvement in that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he said that as a nation we must recognise the significance and vital importance of a modern, highly efficient telecommunications system.  This is vital to our economic development and social progress.  We must be prepared to take the necessary steps to ensure that we will have a telecommunications system comparable to that available in other EEC countries.  It has been said again and again by spokesmen for industry, tourism and the export industry in particular that telecommunications are Ireland's weakest point.  A <Col N="3075" /> major Córas Tráchtála survey of 1,600 exporting firms carried out last year found that 72 per cent, or almost three-quarters, of those firms singled out the telephone service as the greatest obstacle to business.</P>
    <P>If we in this small island on the periphery of Europe, a country which depends on exports to provide to provide the economic lifeblood of the nation, are to make progress, develop our economy and provide full employment, we must recognise that in this day and age a properly developed highly efficient telecommunications service is a necessary prerequisite, and a <i>sine qua non.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister gave a comprehensive review of the plans and programmes envisaged.  As I see it, we are faced with three matters of very grave urgency. First, two State boards, an Bord Poist and an Bord Telecom, must be established with the minimum of delay.  I would like to see the White Paper issued as quickly as possible, because in the absence of that White Paper a comprehensive debate on the telecommunications system is not possible.  Second, we must replace the antiquated technology in our telecommunications system with the most modern and sophisticated available. I agree with replacing the antiquated technology in our telecommunications system with modern digital technology.  In my relatively short period as a Member of the European Parliament I have seen the tremendous achievements of the application of micro-chip technology to telecommunications in particular. Third, in view of the enormous capital expenditure that will be involved, the enormous demand for new technology, products and processes, it must be a major Government objective to ensure that the maximum amount of that equipment is manufactured and assembled here.</P>
    <P>The joint venture between Telectron and the French company is a good development, as is the setting up of a subsidiary company in Athlone by a Swedish firm. This enormous problem must be tackled vigorously and courageously.  In this <Col N="3076" /> modern age, the availability of a fully developed highly sophisticated and efficient telecommunication service is clearly necessary for the economic and social development of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for having given me the opportunity to raise this matter.  With your permission, I propose to speak for ten minutes.  Deputy FitzGerald wishes to contribute as does the leader of my party.  They will have five minutes each and this will still leave the Minister ten minutes in which to reply.</P>
      <P>In the short time I have, I wish to raise the violence and the civil disturbance and damage to public and private property that have occurred in the general central areas of this city in recent weeks, particularly in recent evenings.  We have now here a situation in which the main thoroughfares of the city have witnessed vicious so called demonstrations. O'Connell Street, Stephen's Green, Dawson Street, parts of Merrion Square, North Earl Street and Abbey Street, just to mention some of them, last night bore the brunt of this vicious form of violence, and it is necessary and appropriate that in this House the political parties and the Government should record in no uncertain terms our condemnation of this type of activity and place on record our determination that the people of Dublin and of the country visiting Dublin, visitors to our city from at home and abroad, will have the right to the freedom and enjoyment to walk and to drive through the streets of Dublin in a peaceful and normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually every business in Dublin has suffered from that kind of vicious behaviour. I am chairman of Dublin County Council.  The offices which the council occupy fronting O'Connell Street had just one brick thrown through the plate glass window and the cost today just to replace that glass will be £600 to the <Col N="3077" /> taxpayer.  That is for one large plate glass window.  We can reckon, accordingly, that tens of thousands of pounds of damage has been brought about this activity.</P>
    <P>I want to lay at rest the kind of shrugging off by some people of their responsibility for what has been happening.  It is alleged that this has been done by merely a hooligan element latching on to so-called peaceful demonstrations.  I do not think I could give a better authority than a high ranking Garda officer, quoted tonight in the <i>Evening Herald.</i>  He said:</P>
    <P>People of considerable influence are gathering around them highly suspect people and doing nothing to restrain them.  They brought petrol bombs, some of them laced with sugar, that would stick to bodies.  They brought golf balls and missiles into O'Connell Street.</P>
    <P>He went on to say, and I thoroughly agree with his observations:</P>
    <P>The organisers try to slide away from their responsibility by saying these are breakaway groups, but they are responsible for every man, woman and child who gather behind their banners.</P>
    <P>This top ranking Garda officer went on:</P>
    <P>Meetings have been held throughout the city and the suburbs to recruit the rowdies to create havoc in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to put that kind of protest on record here.  In so doing I want to say that whether it happens in Dublin city or in the constituency I represent, Dún Laoghaire, those of us who make this kind of protest are entitled to do so without having, as happened to me when I protested about the depredation to a public monument in Dún Laoghaire, our families threatened.  I pay tribute to the Garda who did their utmost in difficult circumstances, many of them got injured, to try to restrain this kind of thuggery. Those armchair generals, who hide behind the facade of public meetings hoping the situation will get out of hand slowly, should know that Dáil Éireann <Col N="3078" /> said they can put their opinions where their mouths are and if they want to stand in a general election and face the electorate for the kind of so-called political demonstration they represent, they will have the opportunity in the near future.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister strongly to ensure that every possible effort will be made in a democratic way to prevent this kind of violence being continued in our city.  On many occasions I have spoken at political meetings at the GPO and I cherish the right of the citizens of Dublin and the country to assemble in a peaceful, calm and rational manner to state their political views, no matter how extreme their views may be, but I draw the line when people foment a degree of violence and then slide away from responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The damage to tourism, I can say from my certain knowledge, by way of cancellation of hundreds of bookings in Dublin city hotels, and the damage to central city trading, can be reckoned in hundreds of thousands of pounds.  I urge the Minister to ensure, through normal, fair and democratic enforcement of civilised activity, whether demonstrations, parades or marches, that this kind of vicious violence will not be allowed to recur.</P>
    <P>That is why I raised this matter this evening.  I raised it because the matter could get quite serious and we must not slide away in any way from our responsibilities. I know the Minister has already spoken in reply to a question raised by Deputy Mitchell about the CIE buses and so on.  But it does require a necessary degree of repetition and reiteration of our rejection and condemnation and abhorrence of that kind of activity of anybody, irrespective of political beliefs, in this city last evening and the evenings past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all grateful to Deputy Desmond for raising this matter and giving us the opportunity in this House at this point to express the feelings of the people of Dublin and of the nation at what has been happening in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt about the gravity of the situation.  There is a deep concern that public order is threatened in <Col N="3079" /> Dublin.  This concern is widespread.  It is felt among CIE workers who most courageously went to work on Thursday last and find themselves now at risk and having their buses taken from them and burned.  It is found among traders whose business are being disrupted and destroyed by the effect of this violence. It is found in people's attitudes to the centre of the city: they are concerned for their safety if they go there.  It is found among the public in general.  There are parts of Dublin which have now become &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas.  It is to be found outside Dublin also where, day after day, we have had cases of homes being burned, homes belonging to people who are English or what has been described as Anglo-Irish and whose property is at risk from those who are fomenting and supporting these disturbances.</P>
    <P>There has been general widespread admiration for the restraint and skill of the Garda in coping with the problems they have had to face.  But we need an assurance in this House that, contrary to the reported statements of a number of gardaí a couple of days ago, there were no &ldquo;hold back&rdquo; orders given from on high in respect of breaches of public order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We need an assurance that there were no &ldquo;hold back&rdquo; orders given from on high in respect of breaches of public order in the early stages of these events because, if any such indications were given to the Garda, it was as a result of them that there was a tolerance of unlawful acts at the beginning that could have been a serious contributory factor to the escalation of violence which we have experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I would like to comment on the fact that last Thursday the vast majority of the people of this city and country went to work.  Some freely chose not to do so, as is their right.  But the vast majority went to work but it was only as the day passed and in areas where intimidation occurred that people were forced to close their premises and a situation arose where businesses ceased to operate and <Col N="3080" /> closed their doors.  I had occasion to report, as phone calls came into me during that day, to the Minister's office numerous case of intimidation.  I have to say that wherever I had any evidence there was quick action on the part of the Minister's office in sending the Garda to the areas in question, although in some cases the premises had already been closed and there was nothing they could do at that stage.  But it is significant that there was no general closure and it was this that brought about intimidation by people desperate to create the impression that there is solidarity with a movement which clearly is willing to commit violent acts and encourage violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is good reason to believe &mdash; and I think the Minister is aware of it &mdash; that the initial violence in the St. Stephen's Green area and in Dawson Street was initiated with the approval, despite denials, of the people organising this whole movement as a means of warning people what would happen to them if they did not close two days later.</P>
      <P>Finally &mdash; and this has to be added, I think &mdash; I would like to say that some of this problem reflects our failure as a community to deal with social problems involving the alienation of young people from society in parts of this city because of the way we have allowed these areas to disintegrate and have provided the young people in them with no hope or prospects for the future.  We in society as a whole, we who hold authority in this House, bear some responsibility for that alienation which has contributed to the violence that is at present taking place.  It excuses nothing, but it is something that we have to bear in mind also.  In the meantime we are entitled to ask the Minister for an assurance that in the days ahead before the House meets again public order will be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, like Deputy Desmond, I have protested by marching and holding public meetings.  I have on occasions been involved in the organising of protest meetings in this State.  Along with the right to hold such peaceful forms of protest, there is the responsibility on those that organise them to ensure that they are peaceful.  They cannot evade that responsibility repeatedly.  It can happen on one occasion that an organisation organising a march can have a small section break loose and commit violent acts, but it cannot happen repeatedly.  If they are not in a position to properly steward and control the people they attract to protest, then they forfeit their right to protest because, let us make no mistake about it, there is considerable fear among ordinary people in this city over the last two or three weeks.</P>

      <P>There is another disturbing aspect and that is the introduction of the petrol bomb as a means of protest. The Garda in this country operate under <Col N="3082" /> the direction of the democratically elected Government and the Government bear the responsibility to ensure that people can exercise their right to go about their business in safety.  I know that there are certain circumstances &mdash; and possibly this is one of them &mdash; where the people organising want a confrontation and there may have been a hold back by the police because they did not want to oblige.  This is a possibility.  I am not saying it is a fact.</P>
      <P>We are here to make it known that as far as we are concerned we will ensure that the citizens in this city will not be deprived of their right to walk in safety in the main thoroughfare and in the centre of the city generally.  Another aspect which is a major contributing factor to some of the goings on in the city is that in parts of the city it is quite normal for the people to have to endure violence. For years people have been living in terror because of vandalism which can be related directly to the social conditions in which these people live and are kept.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contribution to this debate and I assure them and the House that every effort is being and will continue to be made to deal with vandalism and damage to property arising from the present spate of marches and demonstrations in Dublin.  Protest marches organised by H-Blocks supporters have become exceedingly violent and gardaí on duty at the British Embassy and in other areas have come under vicious and apparently planned attacks by demonstrators using petrol bombs, bottles, stones, sticks and other offensive weapons. Due to the efforts of the Garda the demonstrators have been limited in their <Col N="3083" /> attempts to cause very serious damage to property and they are quickly dispersed when they set out on their rampage of violence.  Having regard to the options open to demonstrators in choosing their line of retreat from the scene of the demonstration it would be difficult if not impossible to prevent some damage being caused to property.  In their efforts to protect such property a number of gardaí have been injured in the past few days.  On the occasions of expected violent demonstrations up to 1,000 members of the force are deployed in the Dublin metropolitan area.  I am satisfied that the gardaí involved in dealing with these problems have, at great personal risk to themselves, been successful in preventing more serious damage to property and by their intervention they have succeeded in quickly dispersing those involved in the activities.</P>
      <P>Arising from last night's disturbances seven people have been arrested six of whom have been charged with stealing from shops.  The other person has been charged with assaulting the gardaí.  The Garda have the full support of the Government in their difficult task and I have no reason to believe that they will not be able to contain the situation.</P>
      <P>In relation to a suggestion which I attribute to Deputy FitzGerald that somebody somewhere gave orders to the Garda to hold back, that suggestion is not true.  With all the knowledge that any Minister for Justice should have in a situation like this, I say that that is not true.</P>

      <P>I too join with the Members of the House in expressing my condemnation of what is happening and I accept that there is a widespread concern at the situation which is developing. The CIE workers have my sympathy in that they who were good enough to do what they did on Thursday last are now being singled out for special attention.  I condemn out of hand the actions of those who burn houses in any county whether they be owned by Anglo-Irish or English people.  I am sure that all of us have <Col N="3084" /> nothing but the highest admiration and appreciation of what the Garda are doing and of how they are doing it.  The Garda Commissioner has the full confidence of this Government and, I am sure, of the House in handling the situation as he sees it on the ground.  There will be no interference from anybody.</P>
      <P>The Assistant Commissioner who has responsibility for the Dublin metropolitan area has available to him 1,000 gardaí and he can have every garda in uniform made available to him if he wishes.  We can also call on others to help the Garda if necessary and we are prepared to do so.  I too am concerned to see that law abiding citizens can go about their ordinary business.  I too believe in the right to protest.  I have never had the pleasure of speaking on a political platform before the GPO but I have been involved in peaceful protests and that is a right every Member of the House will defend.</P>
      <P>Those who appeared on platforms in front of the GPO within the last week or so making inflammatory speeches did a lot to bring about the situation that we are discussing.  I am satisfied that those people are being investigated by the Garda and those investigations will result in a submission to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is as it should be.  It has been said that small groups are breaking away and that the main group are not responsible for them.  It is now a common view that the small breakaway groups are part of the big group who are taking credit for their very existence on the streets.  It is common knowledge that on the night of the Dawson Street-Nassau Street-Stephens Green violence the black flags were being picked up along the way afterwards.  I am concerned about the situation and I am giving my full backing to the Garda to deal with the situation. The Garda Commissioner knows that all the resources of the State are available to him to restore and maintain order in this city and in all parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Garda for their restraint, a restraint which is perhaps difficult for outsiders to understand.  Let us recognise that they are the professionals in this field and that we must be guided by them. They must select the best means to deal <Col N="3085" /> with the situation.  It is not a question of standing back or of being asked to stand back, it is a question of knowing how to deal with this situation.  If the Garda Commissioner wishes to transfer every garda in the country into the city to maintain <Col N="3086" /> law and order I will be glad to sit down and help him to do whatever is necessary to restore law and order.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 May 1981.</P>

This concession eliminated a long-standing difficulty for persons leaving the Army and wishing to take up employment as civilian drivers.

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the responsibility of sanitary authorities to make such provision as they consider necessary to ensure that a sufficient supply of water is available for fire fighting <Col N="3028" /> purposes in their areas.  I have, however, made inquiries of Dublin Corporation, the sanitary authority concerned in this case, and their report indicates that the chief fire officer, Dublin Fire Brigade, considers that the position in regard to water supply in the areas mentioned is generally satisfactory.  Strict water pressure control is at present being exercised in the city but extra supplies are expected to come on stream very shortly from the new aqueduct from Ballymore Eustace, which has been undertaken in order to ensure that water production is sufficient to satisfy all demands.  In the event of an outbreak of fire, the Waterworks Department are always notified and, where required, turn-cocks will report to the scene to divert supplies into the area.  All first response fire applicances in the Dublin Fire Brigade carry 400 gallons of water for immediate use and are equipped with pumps to increase the water pressure for fire fighting.  The fire brigade will also make use where necessary of any open source of supply, for example, rivers, canals, ponds, storage tanks and so on.</P>

These regulations provide for substantial penalties if waste is disposed of so as to endanger health or harm the environment. Accordingly, if there is illegal dumping in Dublin County Borough it is a matter to be dealt with by the corporation. I would suggest, therefore, that the Deputy brings the matters raised in the question to the attention of the relevant corporation officials.</P>
