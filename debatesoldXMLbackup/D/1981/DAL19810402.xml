      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;The references in section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, to the Dublin Metropolitan District are&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;Any references in the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1977, or the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1962, to the Dublin Metropolitan District shall be deemed to be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for these amendments arises as follows.  The Bill as introduced refers only to section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor <Col N="878" /> Act, 1962, which section provides that the county borough of Dublin is deemed to include the whole of the Dublin metropolitan district for the purposes of the licensing laws.  When the Bill was being drafted it was thought that, in the event of an extension of the Dublin metropolitan district, the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the operation of the Licensing Acts as they apply to all licensed premises would be maintained by defining the Dublin metropolitan district, as referred to in section 35 of the 1962 Act, as being the Dublin metropolitan district as it existed at the time of passing of that Act. However, there are other references in both the Licensing Acts and the Registration of Clubs Acts to the Dublin metropolitan district which need to be taken into account to ensure that the <i>status quo</i> is not disturbed.</P>
    <P>Section 56 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, as inserted by section 6 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, and as amended by section 6 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, relates to the hours during which drink may be sold in registered clubs and provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that, in the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork, drink may not be served on any week-day between the hours of half-past two o'clock and half-past three o'clock in the afternoon.  It also provides that, for the purposes of the section, the Dublin metropolitan district shall be deemed to be a county borough.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 21 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, refer to hotels and provide, <i>inter alia,</i> that in a county borough a new hotel to get a licence to sell drink must have 20 bedrooms, while elsewhere the figure is ten bedrooms.  Sections 19 (5) and 21 (1) and (2) of the 1960 Act deem a county borough, for the purposes of the sections, as including the Dublin metropolitan district.</P>
    <P>The amendments, therefore, are necessary in order to ensure that, when the Dublin metropolitan district is extended, (a) registered clubs outside the Dublin County Borough and the existing Dublin metropolitan district, which at present may serve drink on any week-day between the hours of half-past two o'clock and half past three o'clock in the <Col N="879" /> afternoon, may continue to do so, and (b) there will be no change in the conditions under which a new hotel outside the Dublin County Borough and the existing Dublin metropolitan district may get a licence to sell drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be more in the amendments than in the Bill. As I understand it, the purpose is to ensure that the Dublin metropolitan district is extended beyond the borough but that the original licensing laws appertaining to the borough will not carry over with the extension.  There is a basic policy decision here as to whether the rules that apply in Dublin should extend into the larger area.  As I see it, the provision regarding the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; is the main one.  There are other provisions regarding bar licences in hotels and so on.</P>
      <P>On the basis that the Government view is that the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; provision should not extend beyond the existing area, it is obvious that we are dealing with an amendment that is merely of a technical nature.  I accept the technical amendment but I suppose I am at a late stage in raising the point as to whether it would have been wiser to have had a much broader review of the situation at this stage.  I accept that this is not perhaps a Committee Stage debating point.  However, since I entered the Dáil I have been of the opinion that there was need for a comprehensive review of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts in general.  I am disappointed that this Bill will deal with only a minor point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister is aware, holds a number of areas of dissatisfaction for us.  We note the passing of the Bill with mixed feelings because &mdash; without spending too long on it &mdash; its essence is that the characteristics it will give to the courts, allied to and compounding the existing problems being experienced in the courts, are major difficulties over areas of jurisdiction.  I would hope that some of the more gloomy forecasts we have been making here in relation to the very unsatisfactory nature of the District Court, particularly in relation to handling family law matters, will not be borne out.  Since Committee Stage I have discussed the matter further with people whose job it is to be aware of these problems.  I am convinced that the system of dealing with family law cases, as outlined in this Bill, is one which will lead to most serious difficulties, difficulties relating to families in distress, with marital problems, difficulties over guardianship of infants, difficulties which should not be dealt with by the District Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not delay the House or the Minister by repeating what I said on Committee Stage.  However, I should outline that, despite all our protestations to the <Col N="883" /> contrary, despite the concern expressed by people on all sides of the House, the principal characteristics of the courts after this Bill is passed will be that they will be dealing with areas that should not be dealt with by them, areas of sensitive, delicate adjudication, analysis, arbitration, which should not be dealt with by an adversary system.  The courts will remain still largely a domain in which financial power gives one a decided advantage, and the greater financial power the more the advantage.  The courts will remain an area in which, for many people, they do not see any great solace or any great belief that here is something that gives them retribution but is instead something which oppresses them.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>None of these situations will be improved by this Bill.  As far as I am concerned what is in the Bill, with the exception of the very sensible increases in financial jurisdiction &mdash; which are in some cases no more than are minimally necessary to update on account of inflation &mdash; does not constitute an improvement. Indeed had our amendment been accepted it would not be necessary in a number of years' time to introduce a similar, technical Bill in this House in order to continue to update on account of soaring inflation.  Had our amendment been accepted this would have been automatic but apparently the essential common sense of that suggestion did not meet with the approval of the Minister.  Instead we will have a series of these kinds of Bills whenever the obvious injustice of outdated fine limits, outdated mental distress limits and so on, brings home to the Government of the day that something needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we have very mixed feelings indeed about many of the fundamental elements of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to keep under review the particular difficulties relating to family law cases.  I honestly believe that in this respect the Bill is misguided.  I can only hope that the hurt caused people, despite the very best efforts of many district justices, will not be grieviously damaging and that sooner or later &mdash; I hope sooner <Col N="884" />&mdash; we will have the common sense in this House to try to tackle the problem of marriages in difficulty, preferably along the lines we suggested earlier in the House, some months ago, which of course was shot down with a venom that I found surprising, even allowing for the political inhibitions, to put it mildly, of some Members of the House.</P>
    <P>That being said, we hope this Bill will effect some improvement.  I know it will in the area of financial jurisdiction.  I hope the Minister will be courageous and honest enough to be ready to come back here if he sees the scandalous situation that can arise in the District Courts.</P>

Such a system cries out for introduction, because it is apparent that the problems of marital difficulties are now buried very deeply, in case we might have to grapple with them and do something about them.  They may have to become an avalanche threatening our very stability before we have the guts and the manliness to stand up and say that here is a problem that must be tackled. Apparently it is not to be tackled today.</P>

      <Col N="885" /> SECTION 10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Having again inquired into a problem presented to us in subsection (2) I am not at all happy that the Minister is correct in his attitude and I would ask him to review his attitude to the section because there now appears to be written in for the first time since the abolition of rates a new distinction between certain categories: (1) people who did not pay rates and do not now pay rates and (2) people who in the Minister's view still have a superior or prior right to be involved in a hearing for malicious damages primarily or almost exclusively because at some time in the past they paid rates.  They were participants in a system which was abolished because it was fundamentally unjust and inequitable.  But that right is not merely to apply to people who had their own homes and paid rates.  It is also now to apply to new home owners.  It will, for instance, apply to new home owners who purchase their houses in 1983 or 1985. We encourage home ownership and the mere fact that the person has the ability or the financial capacity to purchase his own home gives him a right stronger and superior to the right of anybody else who is not paying rates and does not own his own home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In truth, neither the new home owner nor the tenant of local authority housing or private housing accommodation, of which there are 300,000 to 400,000 now pay rates; but the fact of home ownership, for some reason which seems routed in a historical idea that those who own property should have a stronger right &mdash; it is purely historical in that context &mdash; will still give people a stronger and greater involvement in such hearings. That is unacceptable and does not gel with what I would regard as a proper system of social justice particularly in the area of malicious injury in which public moneys are involved.  Persons living in private rented accommodation, whether <Col N="886" /> they be students or workers, and the thousands of tenants in local authority accommodation should have an equal right to a say in how malicious injury compensation is handled.  The fact is they do not have the same say.  That is my point.  They do not have the same right and neither do they have an equal right.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to continue this distinction. We could argue that people who used to pay rates should not have the right taken from them.  What we are concerned with here is that people who in ten years' time take out a mortgage or have the finance to buy their own homes &mdash; that is very difficult at the moment &mdash; have a different right.  Such distinctions tend to divide society.  I do not pretend there will be a major schism over the subsection but, as it stands, it is inequitable and should be removed.  Nothing the Minister has said so far convinces me to the contrary.  The word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; should be replaced by some other word relating to a person's residence in a local authority area.  That would be a step towards realising, regardless of property status, that we all have a common interest in the welfare of the community, a common interest in ensuring that vandalism, malicious injury or damage are all contained and that the increasing growth of such dire statistics is stayed.  This does not do anything of that nature but simply says the same order prevaileth.  Even now, when we have decided to get rid of the basis of such distinction, we will nevertheless continue a notional idea, and not just continue it but re-introduce it whenever anybody purchases a home.  That is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should really give further consideration to the points made by Deputy Keating.  We are talking here about the joinder of a second local authority where one local authority will be requesting the court to involve a second local authority.  The definition of &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; must be looked at.  A cursory examination of the definition section does not indicate who exactly is to be classified as a ratepayer.  This is fairly obvious in the early days of malicious injury legislation but nowadays this is not the case.  Rates are not paid on domestic dwellings and some farmers are entitled <Col N="887" /> to agricultural relief.  What is their position? Is the person with under £20 valuation a ratepayer even though he pays no rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should that person be entitled to come in under the proceedings when he has no direct financial interest over and above any other member of the community?  It seems to me, whatever about the position of a person who is paying substantial rates as opposed to somebody who is called a ratepayer but who does not pay anything, there may be some case for involving the person who is actually paying a substantial sum and giving him some entitlement.  But there is no case whatever for giving special entitlement to the person who is called a ratepayer but who does not pay any rates.</P>
      <P>I recollect that in certain situations awards over a certain amount were passed on to the Central Fund.  If that is the case, any taxpayer who pays taxes to the Central Fund has an interest in the outcome of the case, because indirectly that taxpayer, the same as the ratepayer making up the county council awards, will ultimately have to pay his or her divisible share to provide the funds to pay the award.  Why should anybody who has an interest in such proceedings not be entitled to appear?  Why confine this at all?  It seems to me that in framing the subsection to confine the entitlement to a ratepayer of the local authority it is too restrictive in some of the instances I have outlined.  Would it not be proper that any person, whether a ratepayer or not, a ratepayer who pays rates or a legal ratepayer who does not pay rates, a taxpayer, or not, a resident within the local authority area or not, would if he has an interest in the proceedings have an entitlement to go along and appear on the application? That subsection should be reframed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine a situation where people <Col N="888" /> who might live in another part of the country might have a particular interest in a particular application before the court.  There might be strong public feelings about the matter.  There might be some group promoting some cause who would like to present their new point to the court.  I am a great believer in always providing as many safety valves as possible. If people have something to say in a restrained and legitimate manner, why preclude them?  Since the Minister is providing for the right of persons to appear on the application before the court he should go the whole hog, and reframe the section and not confine it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider reframing the section to give entitlement to anybody who shows a legitimate interest to the court.  Where the court is satisfied that a person has a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the application, that person should be given the right of audience on the application.  I have, having dealt with many of those applications, never seen anybody wanting to appear in a court.  It was always purely a matter between the applicant and the local authority.  I do not believe that the provision will be much used or abused.  When the provision is being made it should be left open to everybody.  I urge the Minister on later Stages of this Bill or in the Seanad to consider the point I have raised in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is a very satisfactory one.  In another part of the Bill it appears that an award could be levied on a small area.  This section changes that.  We are told that this was done by the solicitor for the local authority stipulating the area for levy.  I doubt if this was legal in many cases.  Even if it was legal, it was a wrong practice.  Up to now there was a huge delay in the awarding of compensation, because it usually came out of rates struck for the year after <Col N="889" /> the award was actually made.  I know of a case where a delay of two years occurred.  A man who got in touch with me this week is in serious financial trouble owing to damage caused and the difficulty caused by the recession.  He has been given a decree for £40,000.  That money is not payable for a long time to come.  He is not sure how long it will take.  It is quite wrong that that should happen.  We should also bear in mind that such sums have not any element of interest or compensation attached to them. Therefore, anything that will improve that and allow for immediate payment once the claim is substantiated is a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), between lines 33 and 34, insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) in respect of any damage or loss to the extent that compensation therefor has been recovered under any other statutory provision or under the common law or to the extent that reparation therefor has otherwise been made by or on behalf of the person who caused the damage or loss;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a new provision and is designed to rule out the possibility of a person being compensated on the double for damage or loss he has sustained. It will ensure that compensation will not be payable under the Bill to the extent that a person has received compensation under any other statutory provision or under the common law or to the extent that reparation has been made by or on behalf of the person who caused the damage or loss.  There are a number of provisions in statute law which empower courts hearing criminal cases to order the offender or his parent or guardian to pay compensation to the owner of property <Col N="890" /> that he has damaged.  There are provisions of this kind in the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, the Children Act, 1908, and the Road Traffic Act, 1968. Under some of these provisions the courts may order the payment of compensation up to a specified limit only. The amendment will also prevent the award of compensation under the Bill in a case where a person whose property has been maliciously damaged recovers damages in civil proceedings against the offender.  Neither will compensation be payable where reparation had been made by or on behalf of the offender.  This would include payment of conscience money or payment made in a case where a judge adjourned a criminal case in order to give a defendant an opportunity of making reparation.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision here for a reduction in or for the exclusion of compensation so as to ensure that a person is not paid twice is obviously sensible.  However, there are one or two queries arising from the wording of this section and particularly subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is in accordance with the law of negligence that apportionment can be made in a case where blame attaches both to the plaintiff and to the defendant and that the plaintiff's damages are reduced by an appropriate percentage.  That is a reasonable provision and it means that a person's compensation may be reduced as a result of his being partly to blame for the damage. It is not unreasonable that cognisance should be taken of the fact that a person failed to take reasonable precautions and that that failure resulted to some extent in the damage in question being caused. The provision regarding a person being expected to take reasonable precautions is proper, but I should like the Minister to clarify the word &ldquo;precautions&rdquo; in this context.  I have been trying to ascertain the kind of difficulties which confront judges in these situations.  Is it not some-tionmen <Col N="891" /> what woolly to talk about a person's conduct in relation to his taking any precaution which might reasonably have been taken by him to avoid the damage or loss concerned?  We should try to spell this out more clearly, because otherwise we will not know whether precautions in this sense include, for instance, private insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>They would include locking up property, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not unreasonable, but what about a person who does not have property inspected regularly?  This is an adversary situation.  There would be a temptation on the part of those who would not wish to concede the award to endeavour to imply that the person had not taken precautions.  Therefore, what do we mean by &ldquo;precautions&rdquo;?  What are the criteria on which a judge would base his decision in this regard?  As worded, the provision is very loose.</P>
      <P>In any situation of a claim for damages one could think of circumstances in which it could be argued that the plaintiff should have taken certain precautions.  For example, let us assume that a person's car is stolen and destroyed.  If the door had been locked but if there were no other safety devices in use, could it be implied that reasonable precautions had not been taken?  Alternatively, if a car is stolen after it has been parked in an area in which there is a higher rate of such incidents than in other parts of the city or town concerned, could that be regarded as contributory negligence?  If this is to be the case, there could be discrimination against certain categories of people, and indeed against TDs who are obliged to visit some of these areas as often as possible.  If we do not clarify this whole situation, we could be providing an escape hatch and that would be unjust and would lead to abuse of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his welcome for this section in the main. Reasonable precautions are precautions that one might expect to have been taken <Col N="892" /> by the plaintiff.  What the court would deem to be reasonable in this regard should be a matter of interpretation by the court.  The decision should rest with them as to whether any action or any omission on the part of the plaintiff contributed to the damage.</P>
      <P>The use of the words &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo; here are no different from their use in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended.  In that context it is a matter for the courts to decide on the reasonableness of the driving, to decide whether there was a contributory factor on the part of the driver.  The same applies here when we talk about precautions that might reasonably have been taken by a plaintiff to avoid damage or loss to property. In many cases the question of whether reasonable care was taken can be assessed only in court where all the facts are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy used by the Minister is not fair.  The origin, the causation and the contributory factors in respect of a driving offence all fall within a very narrow ambit.  There are only so many factors that can contribute to such an offence and these are fairly predictable. One could almost list them.  There may be less obvious factors such as lack of attention, distraction or questions of concentration, but these are very subjective and are difficult to quantify.</P>
      <P>In this legislation the questions relating to malicious damage or to loss are very widespread and the spectrum of possibilities is enormous.  All I am endeavouring to do is to ensure that the courts have some guidelines on which to base their decisions.  Otherwise, the situation of different standards would continue.  One judge would be regarded as being particularly scrupulous about the definition of precautions while another would take a more lenient view.  In fairness to the Judiciary and to the citizens, we should clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies where compensation is concerned.  One type of malicious damage might be regarded by one judge in a different light from that in which it would be regarded by another, <Col N="893" /> but these are human elements for which we cannot prescribe in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot do anything about the latter.  There are different types of malicious damages.  There are damages, for instance, to cars and there is damage to other personal property.  It is not within our power to influence what may or may not happen in this respect but we are now approving a Bill which is intended to guide us on how we should deal with compensatory matters.  I am less than satisfied about that reference which is a bit sloppy and woolly and will lead to certain difficulties even if we include examples of the sort of precautions that might be taken.  I am willing to believe that in any case of malicious damage one of the first steps that will be taken will be taken by the people who have an interest in ensuring that a claim is not granted to imply that adequate precautions were not taken and because damage is being done to a property or something owned by somebody else, the obvious things are that there were not adequate safeguards, adequate security, locks and attention to the full range of security matters.  There is no answer to that unless you have people minding their property 24 hours a day.  Without delaying unduly on this I see room here for serious problems to arise.  The Minister should consider re-drafting that subsection to make it clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>A person is not expected to do any more than take reasonable precautions and neither is he to be unreasonable about the kind of precautions he might be required to take.  It would be unfair to require him to take precautions so costly that they would exceed in personal cost to him the actual value of what he was protecting.  There might also be a situation involving the physical impossibility of somebody staying up all night to watch a lock-up store because it was in a particular area or because his car had to be parked in a particular street where he lived and because of the incidence of unsavoury acts there.  We must also recognise the reasonableness of the person concerned taking certain action, <Col N="894" /> something related to his own capacity and the value of the property involved and other circumstances.  The court where all of this knowledge of circumstances is available is the only place that can decide on whether reasonable precautions were taken.  &ldquo;Reasonable&rdquo; is a very necessary and desirable measurement of the type of precautions taken.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is used in many areas of the legal system I do not envisage any situation where the court would, because of this particular matter, be unreasonable in the interpretation of the two lines to which the Deputy referred or that the court would have any motive for interpreting them in a very strict or stricter manner than they interpret them in another area for the purpose of minimising damages by being able to show, after interpretation of &ldquo;reasonable precautions&rdquo;, that there was some negligence or some contributing element from the owner of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>If I accept what the Minister tells me is reasonable it would not also necessarily be right on all occasions. I am sure the Minister would not deliberately mislead me.  Assume somebody's car is stolen.  He had locked the door but had not put on another safety lock of any kind.  Has such a person taken reasonable precautions?  Assume that a person, perhaps against the advice of his insurance company, does not use a steel shutter to protect the plate glass window of his retail premises in an area which has had problems of vandalism and breakages.  The owner feels the shop is reasonably safeguarded and has an alarm or bell system which, of course, does not protect the window.  Has such a person taken reasonable precautions?</P>

      <P>We should not deal in this area at all.  You could have a situation where one shopkeeper did not put a steel barrier while the other 20 shopkeepers in the same area did put it up and had not their property damaged.  Would not the person who did not put up the barrier, having regard to the knowledge he had of the precautions taken by the others, be very likely deemed by the court to be unreasonable?  I can only presume what the court would say.  The Deputy cannot come along with an illustration and then carry on with a list of assumptions about his doing this or that or the other and we could say he could be described as taking or not taking reasonable precautions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the record note that as far as I am concerned lines 13, 14 and 15 are liable to give rise to significant confusion and will probably redound to the disadvantage of those who cannot argue cases against those who can because, putting it simply, the reference to any precautions which might reasonably <Col N="896" /> have been taken is too wide and too woolly for clarity.  Even Solomon in all his glory would have difficulty in making up his mind as to what that meant.</P>
      <P>On subsection (3)(c) might I ask, in the reference to damage to or loss of coins, legal tender notes, bank notes, or currency of any country, any postal orders or post office money orders or any postage or other adhesive stamps, or articles of personal ornament, (including watches and jewellery) kept otherwise than as part of stock-in-trade, why are those excluded?  What is the thinking behind that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a similar provision in the Criminal Damage (Compensation) Act in Northern Ireland and in the preparation of this legislation that Act was looked at.  Some of the information that became available was very valuable in so far as it was found that where a provision was there to include such items as are referred to in this part of the subsection there could and would very likely be an encouragement to defraud or engage in fraudulent activities. It also provides for the legitimate aspect of the matter when it states &ldquo;articles of personal ornament, including watches and jewellery, except otherwise than as part of stock-in-trade.  If you have a coin collector and part of his stock-in-trade is coins or ornaments, that person would be protected under the Act.  The evidence available to us, having looked at the situation elsewhere, clearly indicates that this proposal is proper and correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems, with respect, to imply that there is very great reliance, as we hear every day in this House, on statutes on the British Statute Book for the delineation of what we draw up here.  If this party were drawing up this measure doubtless we would be accused of all kinds of antics.  It is extraordinary that the &ldquo;Republican Party&rdquo; has to rely so greatly on the alleged wisdom of statutes of another jurisdiction.  The Minister has advanced two grounds for justifying excluding from damages, say, damage to a person's jewellery.  That could mean a <Col N="897" /> watch.  It does not have to be very elaborate, ornate or expensive jewellery but basic items which perhaps a person has accumulated over the years which somebody could smash maliciously with a hammer or some other object, or a person's life savings could be stolen or set on fire if a room, for example, is vandalised in that way.  These possessions are outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The only reasons the Minister has advanced are that the parallel legislation operating in Great Britain says that it is right that it should happen, and secondly the inclusion might encourage an outbreak of fraud among the populace.  I have a higher view of the mores of the Irish people than would be implicit in that.  It does not bear up.  If persons have a propensity to fraud there are many opportunities available to them not confined to these aspects of possible malicious damage.  You cannot deny people justice on the grounds that making it available to some &mdash; because that is what we would be doing &mdash; would somehow be providing others with opportunities to take advantage.  If that is the case we are in serious trouble because any new legislation could be looked at in that light. There are always those who will abuse and it is the job of the legislators, the Garda and other agencies of the State, to deal with that.  It should not inhibit us from introducing enlightened and positive measures.</P>
      <P>A hypothetical and perhaps typical example is an old person whose home is vandalised, whose small life savings are burned when a room is set on fire and whose one or two heirlooms, maybe an old watch given by a deceased parent, are smashed or broken.  Such people cannot claim for malicious damages, but a multi-million-pound company can.  That is nonsense and it is another indication of the thinking of this Government which is implicit in all the legislation that has come before us.  Whether it be the Courts Bill or others, there is the same tendency to come down on the side of those who have already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see this measure as potential discrimination against people who would have <Col N="898" /> to rely on the coins, legal tender notes or banknotes which they might have.  It is fundamentally unjust that we should make that discrimination if we believe in the idea of compensating for malicious damage and malicious injury.  That compensatory ambit should include any possession where the material loss to the person is shown.  It should not exclude those elements and items because we feel they might be more conveniently open to fraudulent abuse or on the basis that the British dreamed up this measure as well, so it is probably right.  We are getting that every time we ask questions on some of the issues which arise on legislation which is linked perhaps in some way to British legislation.  That is an extraordinary attitude on the part of the Government and the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I still contend that it is not a good justification to imply that because another jurisdiction introduced legislation it necessarily should apply here.  In commonsense and natural justice there is no validity for excluding those items proposed to be excluded in section 12(3)(c).  It is illogical and does not gel with the commonsense and obvious loss which arises if damage is inflicted on the properties outlined there. I submit strongly to the Minister that we should, therefore, not include that exclusion, we should reverse what is proposed here, so that people suffering a loss arising from the damage in these cases would be as entitled as anybody to lodge a claim. The Minister knows that the fraud he refers to or the possibility of it is a matter for the courts.  They can adjudicate on it and, God knows, if they have the wisdom to be able to interpret what the Minister means by the first paragraph of section 12 when he talks about any precautions which might reasonably have been taken by the person, they should not have problems in making up their minds about the difference between fraud and non-fraud in subsection (3)(c).</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the exclusion he proposes there in the context of natural justice.  The loss, if it is there, should not be circumscribed by the nature of the properties or possessions involved.  A loss is a loss is a loss, and the concept should apply right across the board to any area of personal possession or property where it can be alleged that malicious injury or damage was inflicted. It should not be circumscribed by any outmoded notions we might have here about a massive outbreak of fraud and abuse among certain sections of the people. I believe that the courts will have sufficient commonsense to make that distinction because both sides will be heard in relation to any such claim.</P>

The reality is that the proposal to exclude <Col N="904" /> is nonsense.  It conflicts with the situation where other items of property, which may be more valuable but may not be of such personal importance, can be compensated for but a watch which may have been handed down for generations cannot be compensated for.  Neither can life savings which may be hidden away in a biscuit box.  This is allegedly because the Minister has some divine knowledge about the inherent flaws in the Irish character which would give rise to massive outbreaks of abuse.  It is nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Section 12 is a completely new section introducing new provisions to the malicious injury code and changing the nature of that code.  Subsection (1) is introducing what I might call contributory negligence.  If I leave my car outside my house instead of putting it into a garage and locking it, a court may reduce the amount of compensation that I would otherwise be entitled to receive because they would conclude that I should have kept the car in the garage.  That is contrary to the whole spirit of a malicious injury code.  If my car is wantonly and maliciously damaged by someone who has malice towards me or is reckless in his actions, the amount of damages awarded to me should not be reduced in this way, especially at a time when people are forced for economic and other reasons to convert garages into extra rooms because of the high cost of building.  I am entirely opposed to the introduction of this provision of contributory negligence to the malicious injury code.  It is foreign to it.  I would not be altogether against the reduction of the first £100 because there was always a provision in the code to discourage small claims.  The figure was £5 under a code which operated for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Keating that it seems quite unreasonable to exclude valuable articles of personal ornament, including watches, from the malicious injury code.  These items can be of great value and in these times of raging inflation people sometimes buy them as a protection.  They will now be excluded from this code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> I do not agree with the reasoning behind section 12(3)(d).  It proposes to exclude from the code damage to unauthorised buildings for which planning permission has not been obtained.  That should be stated in another way.  Quite frequently, through carelessness or otherwise, people go on with building without getting planning permission.  However, the building is not always contrary to the planning rules and regulations in the area.  When they later apply to have the building retained that permission is granted.  If a building for which planning permission has not been obtained is maliciously damaged, the owner should be entitled to claim malicious compensation provided the planning authority confirm that if he had applied for permission to retain the structure it would have been granted.  If the planning authority grant planning permission for a new similar building, that person should be granted malicious injury compensation.</P>
    <P>The malicious injuries code is following the past too slavishly and does not compensate people for consequential loss or for other matters for which they are entitled to be compensated.  Suppose a shopkeeper's premises are maliciously damaged.  He can be compensated for damages to the building but he will not get compensation because he has been out of business for six, 12 or 18 months. That man could face financial ruin. Therefore consequential damages should be paid.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the malicious injuries code or in this Bill to introduce any provision for compensation for personal injuries.  I may be told there is already in existence a personal injuries board or tribunal, but if that is so it has been there for only a few years.  In many respects it may be described as a board which makes <i>ex-gratia</i> payments and there is no provision in that code for compensation to dependants who have lost a father or the breadwinner.  Neither is there any appeal from the personal injuries board.</P>
    <P>This attempt at updating malicious <Col N="906" /> injuries claims is a poor effort and does not show very much imagination.  Section 12(3) (d) is nearly an indication to people to destroy buildings about which there is a dispute under the malicious injuries code.  It appears to say that if these buildings are damaged the owners are not entitled to compensation, and that is an indication to people to take the law into their own hands.  The least that should have been done here was to include a proviso that, if the injured party succeeded in getting an order to retain the building, he should qualify for compensation.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any comment on section 12(3) (d)?  What is the position under that proposal, the effect of which is to deprive or disadvantage somebody who is allegedly the owner of an unauthorised structure on the possibility of a malicious damage claim? What is the position if he has applied for permission to retain it?  What is the position if a person inherits a property which may have an illegal structure on it?  If he already made an application for permission to retain, would he be entitled to lodge a claim?  Does the Minister see any difficulty in respect of the basic allegation contained in any presumption that a person owned an unauthorised dwelling?  Is there a conflict there?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section confers jurisdiction on the District Court for the first time. The malicious injuries code, which compensates a person whose property was damaged, has worked well and with a minimum of trappings, red tape and expense.  I wonder if this section, which extends jurisdiction to the District Court, is not going too far.  This means cases will be tried in every District Court area in every county, whereas if they were confined to the Circuit Court they would be heard in the main towns of each county. In the long run that would be probably more convenient for witnesses.  Time will tell if this was a wise decision, but I have grave doubts about it.  I suppose a district justice could arrange to hold the hearing in the main town if an application was made, but the hearing of cases in the Circuit Court with an appeal to the High Court worked very well over the years and I have my doubts whether giving jurisdiction to the District Court is a good thing.</P>

For that reason it was felt a court of lesser jurisdiction would suit.  Furthermore there was the question of access and proximity to people paying such claims.  Also it has been the spirit of legislation including the recent Courts Bill that the District Court be given considerable additional jurisdictional powers, and it would be out of line with that concept in the Courts Bill if we were to exclude the hearing of malicious injury cases in the District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the justification for subsection (2) which says that:</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations setting out the scales of solicitors' costs and fees of counsel which will be applicable where the costs of an application for compensation under this Act are payable by a local authority, and the power of any rule-making committee to make rules of court shall be limited accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is in essence another matter in which the Minister may circumscribe the local authority in relation to the moneys that they may pay in relation to solicitors' costs and fees where the costs of that application are payable by a local authority. Why is a distinction being made now between that and the existing procedures with regard to costs?  If the Minister were introducing a Bill which endeavoured to do something about regulating solicitors' costs and fees and legal costs generally it would be a very worthwhile exercise which would benefit the public, but that is not what is being proposed.  It is being proposed that in specific cases, notably those where the costs of the application of compensation are payable by a local authority, there will be a difference of <Col N="909" /> approach which will tend to depress such costs.  It looks as if this provision is put in to deliberately reduce the cost which can be awarded to an applicant.  The effect is that the applicant may have to carry portions of his own costs.  If the costs are so many thousands of pounds and if this section is applied we may end up with a situation where a person has to pay a part of his own costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister should justify why the ordinary proceedings regarding costs should not apply.  These proceedings are at present fairly strict.  It is simply not adequate just to reduce them further particularly for a category of people.  It is not the lawyers who will suffer but the claimants who will have to pay the difference, because I have no doubt that when the dust of battle dies down the approach to the legal costs which was outlined by Charles Dickens in his famous novel <i>Bleak House</i> where the sum involved was a lot less than the actual costs and so on, is still appropriate in 1981.  The person who will lose out is the person who would in any other case have been treated differently and would have got the costs whatever they were.</P>
    <P>If the problem relates to the scale of costs and the concern of the Minister for Finance and of the Minister for Justice is that this burden is too great, the problem should be tackled not by making scapegoats out of people applying for malicious damages but by dealing with the problem of the actual scale of costs.  There is no justification for making fish of one and fowl of the other, particularly in the area of malicious damages which will apparently have a different approach in relation to costs.  If that approach is right it should apply right across the board, but if the approach to costs and the procedures governing it applying generally are correct then by implication the approaches proposed here are wrong. We cannot have it both ways.  What is the justification for this proposal?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that there should be greater control over the level of the amounts that local authorities are required to pay in respect of the cost of successful claimants.  Where a court <Col N="910" /> orders a local authority to pay compensation for malicious damage to a claimant, the court will also award him his costs against the local authority.  This is in line with ordinary civil procedure, and it will continue unchanged after the enactment of the Bill.  Under section 16(2) of the Bill, which is a new provision, a local authority against whom a claim is initiated will be enabled to lodge money in court in the same way as in ordinary civil actions.  If the claimant accepts the lodgement, the local authority will be liable to pay the claimant's costs.  In these cases, therefore, where a person takes proceedings under the Bill and obtains compensation he will also be paid his costs on a &ldquo;party and party&rdquo; basis by the local authority &mdash; that is, from public funds.  These costs would be determined in accordance with scales prescribed in rules of court &mdash; as at present &mdash; were it not for the proposal that they should be determined in accordance with scales to be prescribed in ministeral regulations.</P>
      <P>The reason behind the proposal is simple, namely, that proceedings for malicious damage compensation are essentially different in a number of important respects from ordinary civil actions.  The local authority is not a wrongdoer who is being sued for damages as in an ordinary civil action.  In a sense, of course, the local authority stands in the place of the person who causes the malicious damage. But that is no more than a fiction.  In reality, this legislation is a non-profitmaking system of communal insurance against malicious damage to property, and there is no reason why a person who is awarded compensation out of public funds, that is, local authority funds, should also be awarded the same level of costs as a successful litigant in a civil action.  There is no question but that he should get costs &mdash; but since they will be coming out of public funds the provisions governing them should be more stringent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, one item in the present scale of costs laid down in Circuit Court rules for an applicant's solicitor in a criminal injuries compensation case is an instructions fee, that is a fee for taking particulars of evidence, attendance on <Col N="911" /> witnesses, preparing proofs, which is discretionary as to amount.  The actual amount to be allowed is fixed on taxation by the county registrar, subject, as in the case of every other item, to an appeal to the circuit judge.  It is considered that a discretionary fee of this kind is inappropriate in the context of costs being awarded to a successful claimant under the Bill.  It is envisaged that the ministerial regulations would specify a particular amount as the fee for this item.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the proposed regulations will enable a greater degree of control to be exercised over the other items of costs. A successful claimant for malicious damage compensation will, like every other litigant, continue to be liable for his solicitor's costs on a `solicitor and client' basis, that is for all work performed, expenses paid and disbursements including the solicitor's outlay on counsel's fees made on his behalf.  The successful claimant for compensation who is awarded his costs against the local authority, that is on a `party and party' basis, will stand to be paid a smaller amount in respect of his costs by the local authority if, as is proposed, those costs are to be calculated on the basis of the scales to be prescribed in the proposed regulations than if they were to be calculated on the basis of scales prescribed in rules of court, which is the system obtaining at present.  That clearly indicates the justifiable reasons why local authorities, the ratepayers and the taxpayers should not be asked to pay extraordinary amounts of uncontrolled fees in a situation where the taxpayers and ratepayers are endeavouring to provide what I have described as a communal insurance with the local authority, the agency through which they pay compensation after a court decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean there will be two scales of fees &mdash; one for general civil actions and one for malicious damage claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the computing of fees are concerned, the rules of court will prescribe the fees scales in the same way as has been done for matters other <Col N="912" /> than malicious injury claims.  After the enactment of this legislation the practice will be that a ministerial regulation will be made by the Minister for Justice after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The justifiable reason for this is to provide some protection for the ratepayers and taxpayers in this very costly area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that a person is gaining an advantage from the public purse by getting significant costs is a myth.  The reason a person gets costs is to pay the people acting legally on his behalf.  If there was a free legal aid system applying in this area costs need not be payable.  I want to be sure that the scale of fees applicable in a case like this will be the same as it is normally.  If it is going to be depressed by this section, is it possible that the amount awarded will be too low to pay the actual costs?  If a person gets a decree for compensation he may find that the costs amount to £4,000, but by virtue of this section he is entitled to £2,000 compensation for costs.  This means the person has to make up £2,000 to pay the people acting for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The ministerial regulations provide only for control because of the nature of the action and the involvement of the local authority on a party basis.  It is different from the solicitor and client situation which obtains in the area where court rules are applicable.  I do not think it is envisaged that there will be any depressing of costs, rather a controlling of costs.  That is desirable because public money is involved.  We have a responsibility for the expenditure of public money.  In any legislation it is difficult to be totally protective of the interests of the person making the claim and to be totally protective of the people who are paying the piper.  In this case that is the taxpayers and the ratepayers.  In this instance they are paying through the local authority and there will be considerable expense involved in the investigation, processing and administrative work necessary to get the case to court in the first instance.  There are sound reasons for inserting this provision in the Bill while, <Col N="913" /> at the same time, not wishing it to be any more than a protection of the interests of the people who have to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is logical and I concur with the Minister has said.  However, I have one query on the matter. Are there any circumstances where the costs awarded to the applicant will be less than the actual costs he will have to pay? In such a situation who will pay the difference?</P>

      <P>Under this section a local authority is empowered to settle any claim brought against it by way of an application for compensation at any time before the application is determined by the court.  I am a member of a local authority and for many years I have thought that the whole matter of local authority expenditure has been dealt with in an extraordinary manner and without adequate analysis.  However, it has gone to the other extreme now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister expect local <Col N="915" /> authorities to properly assess the grounds on which they should settle a claim?  If, for example, there was to be some kind of a rider which would make sure, ensure and underline the highest standards of responsibility with public moneys it might be more difficult for people to, shall we say, indulge in a largesse approach in terms of settling claims.  The natural tendency on the part of anybody engaged in any kind of litigation is to settle.  The idea of not going into court if one can settle is particularly attractive when one is settling with everybody else's money, as are the local authorities.  I would worry about easy settlements.  Of course then, conversely, people will say that local authorities are a soft touch, we will get them to settle.  What in-built standards of responsibility and accountability apply? Is the Comptroller and Auditor General, or anybody else looking at the books, empowered to say: &ldquo;sorry, in my view that claim should not have been settled&rdquo; with wilful ease?  Are there any ways in which people can understand that they must be very careful about the manner in which settlements are made?  Otherwise we get into a whole new area whereby public money is dealt with in a very lenient and easy fashion.  I would ask the Minister not to indulge in the temptation in which we all indulge now and again of saying something like: I have every confidence in the officials of local authorities around the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am being honest and I know that a person like the Deputy, with such a social conscience, did not intentionally omit the fact that this Bill provides that new dimension in which people now can settle without having to go into the court, as they had to do formerly.  Furthermore, in settling, they have the opportunity of being paid in the year of settlement rather than in the following year, as obtains at present.  The very question about which the Deputy was so concerned earlier can be further removed by the fact that settlements now can be obtained outside of court, often-times on a personal basis between the person who has suffered the damage and the local authority staff or official involved, consequently incurring no cost at all except perhaps that of travelling to a particular point to negotiate the settlement. These three very justifiable comments and reasons, as outlined by me, must secure in the Deputy's mind that the section in question is soundly based and will be good law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I never disputed, nor did anybody else, the fact that the section was soundly based.  I welcome the early resolution of such claims; all of us are at one on that.  For example, one local authority might decide to settle too easily, might decide to keep free of the legal clutter.  The kinds of things I had at the back of my mind were the possibility of surcharge in the event of somebody simply wilfully driving a coach-and-four through things and a local authority taking the line &mdash; pay them, it is not our money.  The human factor does enter into it.  I know that the overwhelming majority of local authorities would not dream of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is accountability built in because the scrutiny of the local government auditors is involved here. Also in the area of financial matters there are honourable members of different political persuasions on these local authorities, as the Deputy knows, who have the right to engage themselves in an examination of the finances of that local authority when preparing and dealing with estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to subsection (1), the Minister may remember that we talked about the right of the ratepayer to object to participate in the hearing.  Is there a case being made whereby that right is made a nonsense of if the claim can be settled at any time prior to the application determined by the court?  For example would the inclusion, after the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; of a phrase something like: &ldquo;after one month after the application is lodged&rdquo; help?  Does the Minister know what I mean?  We have agreed that the public have a rightful interest.  We have disagreed on how widely that should be advertised.  If that interest is to be legitimised, or the option taken up, should not there be some limit, some period within which that process of participation could be undertaken?  In other words, if a claim is lodged today and tomorrow it is settled, the public interest, the right of hearing, the right of objection, the right of participation cannot really be validated or taken up.  Would the inclusion of such a clause help?  It would not detract from the local authority actually being able to settle but it would delay such a settlement by a matter of a few weeks, in some cases, sufficient to entitle people to consider the action under discussion and be enabled to make an observation thereon if they so wish.  Also in that context such a provision would be helpful because, if a claim <Col N="919" /> can be settled very quickly &mdash; I am sure few of them can be but there could be situations in which some could &mdash; it is just possible that it might encourage acts of destruction by a party, perhaps to his own or other property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, it is a totally different point.</P>
      <P>The essence of the question I am endeavouring to put to the Minister here is the need to ensure that there is not a too rapid settlement of claims &mdash; which is an echo of what we were saying &mdash; but more importantly that public participation or involvement could be taken up by some minimum delay period, in other words that settlement of a claim would not take place within two, three or four weeks, so that a person could say: yes, I want to make an observation and there it is.  It would not inflict injury on any side and would give everybody a chance to make a comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are provisions to meet the Deputy's concern.  A settlement cannot be made until an application is made to the court and that application can be made to the court during any time up to three years.  In that situation the ratepayer under section 17 (4) has a right of appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a totally new section. In essence it is highly acceptable but I would suggest that a subsection might be added on the following lines: Where a court states a case in accordance with the section the costs of same to be borne <Col N="920" /> by the local authority.  The reason for this proposal is that a case can only be stated on some novel point of law.  It is then decided by the Supreme Court and the decision is available for the benefit of the public at large.  The decision is in effect like an Act of Parliament.  Should a person whose goods have been damaged and who brings an action find himself in the Supreme Court where he loses, he is caught for an enormous amount of costs. It seems wholly unfair that the costs involved should be borne by a body such as a local authority representing the common interest which is, of course, the beneficiary in the case outlined, that is, where a finding would be at Supreme Court level.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this proposal would lead to exploitation or abuse because when a case is stated the court decides. An applicant may apply to have a case stated but it is the court decides.  There would be no temptation for a litigant to say he wants to go to the Supreme Court just because the costs would come out of the public purse.  A case stated will be referred on a point of law.  It would be a specific case, a litmus test as it were.  It seems to me when the public in general benefit then the public in general should pay the cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would find it very difficult to concede this.  What the Deputy suggests would mean that the taxpayer or the ratepayer would be required to engage in the payment of costs.  A demand would be made on the public purse, a demand which I believe could not fairly be levied on the public.  The situation is different from that of an appeal.  I will have another look at it if that will satisfy the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities believe this section will have the effect of penalising them unjustly.  Would the Minister amend the section to ensure that the measure of recoupment should include the costs incurred by local authorities in defending claims under the malicious injuries code?  The cost involved can be phenomenal and must obviously be taken out of the local authority budget.  That means ructions will be kicked up by councillors from all parties, the Minister's included, at the implicit cut-back to make up the shortfall.  If that is the case, then what I forecast earlier on at some personal risk of being misinterpreted as implying that local authority finance officers were a lot of Shylocks, namely, that we are on the road to easy settlements where costs are not involved, would be borne out again.  The section says that where the costs to a local authority of compensation under this Act exceeds the produce of a rate of 20 pence in the £ in any financial year the amount of the excess shall be refunded by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>That is fine but I am concerned about the fact that the only actual benefit or finance coming back to the local authority will be that of the sum involved in the award itself.  I wonder would the Minister clarify whether or not the costs would be awarded.  I do not think they would be. If they are not involved, does he not agree there would then be a severe financial penalty put on a local authority despite the fact it had been given an award?  The object of my proposal is to have included in the charge the costs incurred.  At the moment these costs are not allowable and therefore are not included in a separate rate made for malicious injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, in relation to the claim for the Majestic Hotel in Waterford the council finances had to bear £30,000 costs in fighting the claim alone in the Circuit <Col N="925" /> and High Courts.  The council, by appealing the case, which resulted in the State being saved £422,000, increased their own costs by £15,000.  They won in the higher court.  For 1981 their rates will need a maximum rate of 20p for decrees plus approxiately £40,000 or 13p for their own costs arising from malicious injuries claims.  If the proposal whereby costs are included is not acceptable I believe we will have a situation where there will be a strong disincentive to vigorously pursue large claims.  It could also be argued, on the other hand, that the local authority might pile it on in relation to costs.  This could be got over by the appropriate court officer determining the council's costs as well as the applicant's.  I believe all it would mean is the application of the section we talked about earlier in relation to adjudicating on costs.</P>
    <P>This is a case of a county council who did a wonderful job in the public interest above and beyond the call of duty.  They did not have to appeal.  They did and they won the case.  They saved nearly £500,000 of public money.  What was their thanks? They are now down nearly £45,000, despite having saved the public purse an enormous sum of money.  It is not an academic, financial or fiscal matter, it is more serious than that.  It means that £45,000 is not now available for the very worthy causes which County Waterford would undoubtedly utilise it for or County Roscommon, County Longford or Dublin city would use it for.  We should look seriously at this because otherwise we are asking officers of county councils and local authorities to act above and beyond the call of duty if they are to take action in the public interest and find themselves legally penalised for that even if they win the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, even if it had not been ruled out of order, would not be acceptable.  The amendment seeks to include a local authority's legal costs in contesting claims in the reckoning of the cost to a local authority of compensation for malicious injuries referred to in section 19(1) of the Bill.  What it boils down to is a proposal that the Exchequer should take over a greater share of the <Col N="926" /> financial burden of the malicious injuries compensation system.  Section 19 of the Bill proposes to put on a statutory basis the present non-statutory arrangements whereby if, in any financial year, the cost of compensation to a local authority exceeds the produce of a rate of 20p in the pound, the excess is recouped to the local authority from the Exchequer.  The cost to a local authority of compensation for malicious injuries referred to in section 19, while including the amounts of compensation and costs awarded to successful claimants, does <i>not</i> include a local authority's own legal costs in contesting claims.  Consequently, a local authority's own costs would not be taken into account when calculating the amount of the excess over the produce of a rate of 20p in the pound mentioned in section 19(1).</P>
      <P>The Government have clearly indicated their proposals for Exchequer aid to local authorities in this area.  These proposals are reasonable, and it is to be noted also that, under section 19(2) of the Bill, it will be open to a Minister for Finance at any time, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, to make an order reducing the rate in the pound from 20p to whatever amount might be considered appropriate at the time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Apart from the fact that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled the amendment out of order, it would not be acceptable.  I have given the reasons for this.  The fact that the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, can vary downwards or upwards &mdash; downwards is the feature which would be attractive to local authorities and I am sure to the Deputy &mdash; means there is an adequate opportunity in the future if it is considered necessary that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not got at the moment a parallel right?  Could he not, at the present time, simply by giving <Col N="927" /> the local authority more money or making a specific allocation to cope with the cost, get over this?  Deputy Deasy and Deputy Eddie Collins from the Waterford area are worried &mdash; I am also worried that in the normal course of events there is very little incentive for local authorities to fight claims rigorously and justly.  Now we are asking them to bear their own costs as well.  It is not adequate that there is some hope in the future that the Minister might vary downwards the entitlement. I have a letter from the secretary of the Waterford County Council telling me of the bill for £45,000 in the situation where the public purse benefited to the tune of £500,000.  The Minister now says to them: &ldquo;You pay this yourself&rdquo;.  I do not believe that is in the public interest. We should look after local authorities in a situation like this.  The Minister should at least tell them they will get some portion of the costs.  We should be able to tell them that if they are taking a legal case we do not expect them to bear all the legal costs, particularly when they are acting in the public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In general I agree with this section but I have one reservation. The section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> (1)  Where property which was unlawfully taken and in respect of which compensation has been paid under this Act by a local authority is recovered, the local authority shall become and be the owners of the property and shall be entitled to dispose of it in such manner as they think fit.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, in respect of such property, compensation has been paid by two or more local authorities in proportions ordered by the court under section 11 (3), those local authorities shall become and be joint owners of the property in the like proportions and shall be entitled to dispose of it in such manner as they may agree.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should include some provision whereby the first offer should be made to the applicant provided he is prepared to return the compensation award.  A particular item may be of very great value for many reasons to one owner and the value of it by way of compensation does not meet the case at all.  The article in question may only be of practical use to the particular applicant, it may be a family heirloom or an article of sentimental value. I urge the Minister to introduce an amendment along the lines suggested and ensure that the local authority are not entitled to dispose of the property in such manner as they might think fit, unless there is a first refusal by the owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a specific <Col N="929" /> provision in legislation, as the Deputy is suggesting, we would exclude the other options the local authorities would wish to have open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the property belonged to somebody that person might have particular use for it.  I agree with the Minister that in many cases the local authority would see fit to ask a person whose property had been recovered if he would be interested in having it back. But, in fairness, that is not mandatory. All local authorities can act from time to time in a strange and idiosyncratic way and they might decide that the best interests would be served by something quite different.  If it is clear from the record of this debate that what is meant is that local authorities should approach the owner first and give him a chance of refusal, the point is probably met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect that that would be the line taken by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case. However, I should hope that local authorities will take cognisance of the Minister's words, though I would prefer that what is intended would be written into the Bill because in this way there would be no problem.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 22.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there a cut-off point in this Bill?  Subsection (1) of this section provides that proceedings shall not be commenced after the expiration of three years from the date on which the cause of action accrued.  The Minister may say that there are always cut-off points and limitations.  I simply wish to make the case that in the context of this Bill there could be circumstances in <Col N="930" /> which, for one reason or another &mdash; perhaps due to legal delays or to the subsequent discovery of damage to property &mdash; there could be a delay of the kind referred to.  Should it matter very much, in the case of a just claim, that there would be a delay of, say, three years and one month?  That would be a fairly extreme example, but I do not understand the thinking behind the concept that provides that a period of two years and nine months is all right in terms of claims for damages while a delay of a period of three years and one month precludes one from claiming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasoning behind that is that from the point of view of the local authorities, it would be likely to be very difficult for them on many occasions to engage, after a fairly lengthy period, in examination and in recollection of facts which might be relevant for the purpose of a subsequent court hearing.  For that reason this provision encourages the claimant to submit his claim as soon as possible.  If the claim is not made within a reasonable time, it may be difficult for both sides, particularly for witnesses, to recollect accurately what occurred.  In Northern Ireland a claim must be made within a period of four months though there is provision for an extension of up to 12 months.  That curtails the situation much more than what is envisaged here. Contrary to the Deputy's personal view that we copy almost everything that happens in other jurisdictions, we did not follow the line taken in Northern Ireland in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister recalls vividly something I said.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 23 and 24 agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="931" /> SECTION 25.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 25 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned by the provisions of this section which give the Minister the power in effect to play ducks and drakes with the compensations that can be awarded.</P>
      <P>A safeguard proposed in section 26 seems inadequate in the face of the power proposed here.  I can envisage the power in section 25 being used only for the purpose of excluding even more claims by way of increasing the £100 limit.</P>
      <P>I do not expect that in some way &mdash; for instance, by way of benign benevolence or generosity &mdash; the Minister will decide suddenly to drop that limit and to broaden the whole scope of the legislation so as to include more claims, though one never knows what change might be made prior to a general election.  It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the only objective of the section is to increase that £100 figure though I hope I am found to be wrong in this.  The object in question may only be of any practical use so far as an applicant is concerned or it may be something which, as in this case, tends to disenfranchise him of the right to a claim.  The £100 will be taken as the limit.  I suspect that there will be pressure at certain times to increase the figure, for instance, in times of &ldquo;economic stringency&rdquo;.  I put the words in inverted commas because I have yet to come across such times.  In a number of Bills, including this one so far, I have argued very strongly that the Minister should have the power to vary monetary limits in line with inflation, but my arguments were lost and the Minister argued that the matter was so important that it should be brought before the House on the occasion of an increase in limits.  In other words, it was a matter of fundamental national importance that £1, worth 100p at any particular date, is not of the same value at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>On that ocasion we were dealing with the Courts Bill.  We are dealing <Col N="932" /> here with malicious injuries.  There are two different matters involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is the same but the Minister is using it to suit himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not differentiating between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that the variation of a financial limit in the context of our discussion on that other occasion was seen to be a matter of limiting jurisdiction, but the Minister referred to the importance of such matters being of such magnitude that they had to come before Parliament in respect of any change in the amounts fixed.  Here, however, the Minister slips in a dummy at the tailend of a Bill and this dummy gives him the power to play ducks and drakes with claims at any time he so wishes.  There is no time limit in this case, so that the Minister may act whenever and as often as he considers proper to do so.  That could be twice a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be proper to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; here, like the word &ldquo;precautions&rdquo; to which we referred earlier, is very subjective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected the Minister to realise that the words &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and so on are quite similar. Here we have a case in which for the first time there is slipped in quietly a provision which means that if the claims situation is becoming too hot and too heavy, the limit can be jacked-up, thereby cutting off claims at the bottom.  Earlier we were talking about people who suffered damages to the extent of less than £100 not having a chance, and the Minister agreed graciously to consider the situation.  Will he deny now that the only likely use of section 25 will be to increase the £100 limit to some figure not specified and not thought of yet but which undoubtedly <Col N="933" /> will be dictated by economic and budgetary matters and which will be changed whenever and as often as the Minister considers proper?  In principle this is a bad section because it gives a Minister unfettered and unlimited power not just to vary a limit, which is a kind of academic concept, but to deprive people of the right to claim under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  First, the Minister shot that down.  If it was wrong then, it should be wrong here on the Minister's own argument.  What I said at the time is very clear, that it should not be necessary to come back here to update on account of inflation.  I would not argue with that concept <i>per se</i>.  I would not argue with that, but that is not what is being said.  If that were the case the Minister would have included reference to either the consumer price index of average industrial earnings or some other criterion. There would be some parameters to the power sought.  The Minister has not done that.  He says here &ldquo;whenever and so often&rdquo; as he thinks proper without any reference to any aspect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the section on two grounds, first on the grounds that it is rather a repetition of the earlier ground that there should be any cut-off point, because that is what this is designed to do.  In the particular context of this section the fact that the Minister can at a stroke without reference to the House or anybody else in effect reduce very significantly the number of people entitled to claim compensation under the Malicious Injuries Act whenever and as often as he wants to do so involves a power that in my view needs some debate.  There are times when I wish Ministers would act with a certain precipitancy but in this case the only likely effect is that the £100 limit, which is fundamentally obnoxious to me, will be updated very regularly and perhaps more than updated, and we will find it is £1,000 or £2,000.</P>
      <P>The idea of malicious injuries, to use the Minister's own words, as a form of common insurance &mdash; a very good term &mdash; for damage inflicted on members of the community no longer applies.  It does not apply even now because the damage and the members of the community are qualified; it is not all members of the community, only certain members who suffer loss above a certain limit.  Here you propose to vary that limit whenever and as often as you like without reference to anything, not even a glance at the consumer price index or at this House, or even a Ministerial order.  The Minister alone has the power.  That is wrong fundamentally and I oppose it.  Any limit is wrong but one could argue about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the power given to the Minister in section 25 I do not consider the safeguards in section <Col N="936" /> 26 adequate.  Anybody who takes the time and trouble to look at the record will see a fundamental conflict in the attitude of the Minister of State and his Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, in relation to this principle between what he said and what has been said in reply to Dail questions tabled by myself and others and what has been said on the Courts Bill and on this Bill.  The argument was that an unfettered power to increase or decrease monetary limits was one which it was the right of the Dail to debate and rightly the property of a separate Act. That was the answer given to me when I wished to introduce certain modifications in the Courts Bill.  But that argument is now thrown out the window and buried in pursuit of the unlimited and unfettered right to vary limits as often as the Minister sees fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now dealing with section 26 which concerns the laying of orders and regulations before the House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that laying such an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas is not an adequate safeguard.  Section 26 and the former section impinge on each other from that point of view.  Those sections, in effect, depending on the Minister and the Government of the day, could completely negative the advantages &mdash; there are advantages in this legislation - and completely set them at naught.  The limit could be varied to any figure and the order that goes before the House is not a matter on which there is any debate and which could be reasonably pursued despite the fact that the Minister and his senior colleague and other Ministers of the Government on this issue of monetary limits in legislation told us in the House that such issues were appropriate only to legislation and full debate and were not to be dealt with in this manner. Yet, we see here that they are to be dealt with in this manner.  The order and the regulation we are talking about are inadequate from that point of view.  I believe that the final page of the Bill virtually undermines completely the careful <Col N="937" /> draftsmanship, intensive scrutiny and careful analysis that I am sure have gone into the other sections of the Bill.  We have talked at length on various aspects of the Bill; the draftsmen have dealt with them in detail and the Minister has been good enough to scrutinise the Bill carefully and here, at the end, we pull out the plug and say: &ldquo;Just in case anybody has any illusions, we remind you that the Minister can change any of this any time he likes without reference to you&rdquo;.  As far as I am concerned that makes a joke of the whole thing.</P>

      <Col N="938" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister first of all for the close attention which he gave to contributions from this side of the House from Deputy Enright, Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself.  I assure him that anything said was said with a spirit of constructive progress at heart. The Bill itself is long overdue and in many respects is a good Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do, however, have concerns which I am not going to deal with in detail about a number of aspects in the Bill.  I say sincerely, because it does sum up some of the problems which we see relating to recent legislation in this House, that I am deeply disturbed not by just the cut-off point in section 5 but by the right the Minister is seeking and taking, uniquely, to my way of thinking, in section 25 whereby that cut-off point can be varied. I have always held that one of the hallmarks of a civilisation is the manner in which it provides access to justice for all people.  Sections 5 and 25 do that concept an injustice.  They do not provide justice for all.  They provide justice for many, but they deliberately exclude some categories of people.  Those categories, unfortunately, are likely to be people about whom it could be said they in a particular way need our supportive interest and the opportunity for the access which we talked about.  In Irish society we see day in and day out instances where it is quite clear that the legal and judical system is not available to many people. It may be available theoretically in some cases but not in fact because it costs money or because it is not geographically properly located as in the context, for example, of the free legal aid scheme.  In other words, without going into it in detail, there are many aspects in the judicial and legal system which we could point to as indicative of a system which helps those primarily in the upper socio-economic categories.  They are as entitled to justice as anybody and I do not wish to be construed as implying anything else, but at the other end of the scale throughout <Col N="939" /> Irish society over the years there has been a tendency to deprive these other categories, relatively speaking, of such access although often they are the people who are the objects of the attentions of the legal system in their role as defendants.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this scheme here is a major incursion in that respect, but it is a significant continuation of that thinking.  For example, we see enshrined in legislation on this 2 April 1981 the theory once again that if you are a person on a certain rung of the ladder who has suffered loss, your loss, your status, your rights, your access are decreed to be inferior, by definition, to those of people on a different rung of the ladder who have other values and who are based in some other part of the socio-economic spectrum. I do not believe that that is the intent of this section but it is the effect of it.  We may argue that the reason for this cut-off point is to eliminate a clutter of small and frivolous claims and I accept the integrity of that argument to some extent &mdash; although not the point itself &mdash; if it could be said that, therefore, some element of discretion was going to be introduced whereby in some circumstances at least a claim could be entertained from a person who was clearly in need of the money.  If that discretionary power was there it would make some sense of the whole purpose.  It would mean that those for whom in all honesty a loss of £30 or £40 was not great would not be cluttering up the courts with such claims. However, there are those for whom such claims up to £100 are very significant and important but they have no right whatever to be heard or to appeal, and that is a hallmark of this Bill which is reflected in sections 5, 10(2) and 25.  Those three sections in themselves, contained as they are in this Bill, do a disservice to the idea of equality of access to justice for all people.  In a section 10 case we find that the notion of justice contained in this Bill is based on the idea of property.</P>

That, unfortunately, is the character of the Bill which is concerned about preserving property rights, ensuring access to justice and rapid compensation for people at one end of the spectrum but cuts off completely people at the other end of the spectrum. These misgivings that we have are valid and real and I believe will be borne out. I would like to think that at an early opportunity, if we get it, we will do something about reversing the tone of the Bill from that point of view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated on Second Stage that I intended to have this section amended. As the section stands, only a chief psychiatrist or clinical director could discharge a detained patient.  Unamended, this provision would erode the clinical responsibility of consultant psychiatrists. Accordingly I am now proposing that the section be amended to allow consultant psychiatrists to discharge detained patients.  As a result the Bill will be consistent, as the decision to detain a patient <Col N="941" /> is also made by a consultant psychiatrist. This change is in keeping with the general philosophy of the Bill and also corresponds to the pattern of clinical responsibility obtaining in general medicine. Amendment No. 24 is a drafting consequence of amendment No. 23.</P>

At first reading of subsection (1) and (2) one would think that this information would be available to any person who wanted to get it, but the number is limited by subsection (3) which states:</P>
      <P>An application under this section shall be granted if the health board or the medical officer, as the case may be, is satisfied that the application is made in good faith in the interest of the person in respect of whom it is made and that it would be in accord with that person's interest to grant it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If the applicant were a near relative the information should be given as of right but such provision does not appear in the section as drafted.  It simply confers on the medical officer the right to give or refuse information and there is thus very little safeguard for the patients. The whole object of the section is to provide that relatives and others should be able to ascertain the whereabouts of a near relative.</P>
      <P>Subsections (1) and (2) state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person may apply to a health board for information as to whether a particular person is detained in a special or district psychiatric centre in the functional area of the health board <Col N="944" /> and, if he is so detained, as to the name and address of the centre and the name of the medical officer in charge of it.</P>
    <P>Any person may apply to the medical officer in charge of a district, special or registered psychiatric centre for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  information as to whether a particular person is detained in the centre,</P>
    <P>(b)  a copy of the reception order under which a particular person is detained,</P>
    <P>(c)  the name of the applicant for the order or for a recommendation for the reception of a particular person,</P>
    <P>(d)  the name of any registered medical practitioner who made a recommendation or signed a certificate in relation to that person.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) takes the teeth out of the section by saying that this information may only be granted if the health board or the medical officer, as the case may be, is satisfied that the application was made in good faith in the interest of the person in respect of whom it was made and that it would be in accord with that person's interest to grant it.  I cannot see how it would be against a person's interest to grant information to a limited category of people.  I think there is an appeal to the President of the Circuit Court and that is some safeguard, but a person should not be put to the trouble of appealing to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It could happen that a near relative had been out of this country for a number of years but returned home because he heard through the grapevine that a relative was confined in one of these institutions. As of right that near relative should be entitled to find out if that person is in that institution.  The patient would not be there unless there was strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he was mentally ill.</P>
    <P>I do not like the section as drafted because although superficially it looks to be conferring protection and giving rights, it is not.  The Minister amended subsection (3) by saying that the application should be in writing, but he did not amend subsection (4) saying the refusal also should be in writing.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  If an appeal is brought to the <Col N="945" /> Circuit Court against the refusal, it would facilitate matters if the refusal were also put in writing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of confidentiality and who should have a right to that information at a particular time arises here.  It is reasonable to assume that between the health board and the medical officer in charge the patient would be given due consideration and anyone seeking information would be given it if their request is bona fide.  It is difficult to define particular people in this context because circumstances may change very significantly in relation to a particular patient.  Therefore, it is reasonable to leave this to the medical officer and the health board.</P>
      <P>Under section 24(4) the applicant for a reception order is informed and knows where the patient is.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the written application.  Section 33(4) says that where the application is refused the health board or medical officer shall so inform the applicant.  I will consider the question of having that information in writing.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It follows from the Minister's amendment.  I feel very strongly about the information of a person's whereabouts being made available.  If we read through this Bill we see notice is taken and consideration is given to relatives in many sections.  They are the people who are entitled to apply for recommendation orders.  As I said, near relatives might be out of this country for many years and might only come home on a visit, and it is not unreasonable that a limited category of near relatives &mdash; sisters, brothers, parents or children &mdash; should be entitled to be told if their relative is being detained in a particular institution.  I cannot see any real breach of confidentiality there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a patient is being detained, he is not a voluntary patient.  He needs care, is not able to look after himself and most likely, is not able to communicate with his relatives. The patient probably would not know the addresses of the relatives who have been abroad and the near relative <Col N="946" /> should know or have the right to know whether the patient is in an institution.  I do not think the argument about confidentiality stands up.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 34, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>34.&mdash;(1)  The medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre shall, upon the making of a reception order under which a person is to be detained in the centre, give that person a copy of the order and a copy of the recommendation for his reception and, upon the making of any extension order, he shall give that person a copy of the order.</P>
      <P>(2)  The medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre shall, upon the making of a reception order under which a person is to be detained in the centre, give that person a statement in writing of his rights and entitlements under this Act.</P>
      <P>(3)  The medical officer in charge of a special, district or registered psychiatric centre from which a detained person is discharged shall, upon request made within twelve months after his discharge, give that person a copy of the reception order under which he was detained and of any extension order and a copy of the recommendation for his reception.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as drafted, is to be deleted and replaced by a new section designed to provide comprehensive and uniform safeguards for the rights of all detained patients.  First, this amendment is designed to ensure that all detained patients are provided with copies of the statutory documentation relating to their detention and also with a statement of their legal rights and entitlements under the Act.  It is desirable that these should <Col N="947" /> be given to the patient when the reception order is made and the section specifies accordingly.  Secondly, we are now retaining the provision of the existing legislation which allows discharged patients to obtain statutory documentation relating to their detention on request within a period of six months after discharge. This period is now to be extended to one year after discharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Strange to say I have certain doubts as to whether the section as originally drafted or the new section is more beneficial to the patient.  The short section 34, as originally drafted, says:</P>
      <P>The medical officer in charge of the special, district or registered psychiatric centre in which a person is detained shall, on request, give him a copy of the reception order under which he is detained and a copy of the recommendation for his reception.</P>
      <P>That means he can get a copy of the reception order at any time on demand. However, the Minister is proposing to alter that by the insertion of a new section. Subsection (1) of the new section reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  The medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre shall, upon the making of a reception order under which a person is to be detained in the centre, give that person a copy of the order and a copy of the recommendation for his reception and, upon the making of any extension order, he shall give that person a copy of the order.</P>
      <P>That occurs at the time of the making of the order and that is it.  The new section also states:</P>
      <P>(2)  The medical officer in charge of a psychiatric centre shall, upon the making of a reception order under which a person is to be detained in the centre, give that person a statement in writing of his rights and entitlements under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The medical officer in charge of a special, district or registered psychiatric centre from which a detained person <Col N="948" /> is discharged shall, upon request made within twelve months after his discharge, give that person a copy of the reception order under which he was detained and of any extension order and a copy of the recommendation for his reception.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of that new section are to be enforced literally by the authorities, it will mean that when the reception order is made a copy will be given to the patient.  That will be the end of it.  But what will be the position if the patient lost or destroyed the copy of that order? We should bear in mind that such a person is likely to be very sick at the time of reception.  It is likely that such a person will not be worried about a filing system or where he puts his copy of the order.  It is likely that he would destroy it.  But six months later, when he may be entitled to leave, he would not be entitled to get a copy of the order because of the provisions of the new section.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (2), I should like the Minister to outline what a statement of the patient's rights will contain. Will it consist of extracts from the Act, regulations or a prescribed document? Subsection (3) appears to be in order. Obviously, the new section is less favourable towards the patient than the one it is replacing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the statement of rights can be pursued following the enactment of the Bill.  I intend to see to it that patients are given clear, simple and explicit information in relation to their rights and entitlements under the Act.  I give an undertaking to the Deputy to follow up that aspect administratively subsequently because this is something which may change from time to time with other entitlements.  The other question raised related to the Deputy's interpretation of the new section.  It is his view that under the section a patient need only be given one copy and if that patient wanted another one later within the 12 months he, or she, technically, might not be entitled to it.  I would not like that situation to exist.  We will have a look at the new section from that point of view <Col N="949" /> and if an amendment is required I will introduce one on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section has been criticised on the grounds that as it stands it implies that letters addressed to people other than those specified may be opened.

It also states that the medical officer in charge shall cause to be provided the necessary facilities for writing, delivery or posting.  I know what the Minister is at and I am in favour of all letters reasonably written being posted, but I do not think it is necessary to go so far as to say that letters written by a person whose illness takes the form of letter-writing should be posted.  It is going a bit far to impose a statutory obligation on the medical officer in charge to post all those letters.  In any event who will pay for the posting of them?  Will there be free postage?

There should be a safeguard giving discretion to the medical officer.  In my view such letters will not be posted.  The Minister is including a provision which will not be obeyed.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The term &ldquo;panel&rdquo; is used.  It is stated that a psychiatric review board shall be appointed for each health board area consisting of a lawyer; an authorised medical practitioner and a lay person. The Minister shall appoint the chairman. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>In the event of any member of the review board being unable to act or being debarred under subsection (7) from acting for a particular sitting the chairman shall replace him by an appropriate person from a panel of person to be appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>That is the only reference we have to a panel.  We are not told how the panel is to be established, but subsection (7) states:</P>
      <P>In relation to the review of any particular case a member of a review board shall not be a relative of the patient, within a category described in section 14 (a), have a professional relationship with him or be a member of the staff of the centre in which the patient is detained.</P>
      <P>This was discussed the other day in relation to another matter and the Minister said he would look into it.  I want to know if a member of the health board will be eligible for membership of that panel.  My opinion is that he should not and that an employee of the health board should not be eligible, not because I have any special objection to them but because this is a review body and if boards are to be effective the members should have fresh clear minds to do the job.</P>

      <P>The amendment arises because it was necessary to amend terms such as &ldquo;is properly detained&rdquo; and &ldquo;propriety of continued detention&rdquo; in sections 39 and 40.  These amendments are necessary to remove any doubt that might arise as to the precise meaning of the term &ldquo;is properly detained&rdquo; and propriety of continued detention&rdquo;.  These terms could be interpreted as being concerned solely with the legal correctness of the detention process.  The intention is, of course, that the review boards should be concerned with the necessity for and suitability of the continued detention of the patient. The section has been amended to clarify this point, i.e. the review board will either decide that a person should not be discharged, or direct that he be discharged. Similarly, the reference to &ldquo;propriety of continued detention&rdquo; at line 39 is superfluous and can be deleted without a need for substitution.</P>

    <P>Some submission reviewed in relation to the Bill expressed concern that there would be no longer a requirement to report all deaths in psychiatric centres to a coroner.  I did not consider, in this day and age, with a more open approach to the treatment of psychiatric illness, that it would be necessary to continue to do <Col N="959" /> so.  The view expressed, however, was so strong that I felt it desirable to go some way to meet it, particularly in the context of the fact that all major injuries are required to be reported to the Minister and the chief executive officer.  It is logical that a similar requirement should be imposed in respect of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We had a discussion indirectly on this section yesterday which arose out of the inclusion of this section in the provisions of section 8, which provides for criminal prosecutions.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  I want to express myself as clearly as I possibly can in regard to this matter.  I am in favour of this section.  It is a necessary section.  It is right than an injury other than a minor injury to a person undergoing treatment in one of these hospitals should be reported to the Minister.  It is also right that any assault on any such person should be reported to the Minister.  I also think it right, although this is very vague, that a report on any other matter of serious importance to the welfare of such persons should be reported to the Minister. I am in favour of all that.  It is necessary and I am sure it was included in previous legislation and previous enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section imposes that duty on the medical officer.  I do not care whether he is a medical officer or the chief executive of the health board, I object to the fact that failure to do that is being made a criminal offence which could be tried in a court of summary jurisdiction and which will attract a penalty of £500.  It is really making a criminal offence out of something which is not criminal.  Unless the medical officer who does not report these things is part of a conspiracy to assault a patient or abuse a patient and then suppresses it &mdash; of course, if he does that he is subject to the criminal law anyway &mdash; but if he innocently makes a decision, if he did not hear about it or if he comes to a conclusion that it is a minor matter or that it was not a matter of serious importance, he may not be carrying out his duties properly.  But in my <Col N="960" /> opinion he is not guilty of a criminal offence and he should not be brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister, if it is reported to him and he has cause to believe that the matter should have been reported to him, should hold an inquiry or send down his designated medical officer or his authorised medical practitioner to look into the matter and, if necessary, demote or sack the person in charge.  But to make this, as it stands, a criminal offence would be just the same as prosecuting a medical practitioner who was guilty of an error of judgment in treating a patient, or prosecuting a civil servant for failing to do something that the conditions of his employment said that he should do.  I am against this principle and I do not think that these offences, or indeed one other offence under section 8, should be included as criminal offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to give consideration to the points raised though I am somewhat reluctant because of the serious nature of the detention and the need to be quite sure that there will be administrative arrangements which will automatically come into operation without any question once such an injury or any such assault occurs.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>
        <Col N="961" /> I can see the point but at the same time it seems to be putting a barrier on proceedings being brought by a patient.  It is quite vague.  It says that no civil proceedings shall be instituted in respect of an act purported to have been done in pursuance of the Act save by leave of the High Court and such leave shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the person against whom the proceedings are to be brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.  I am doubtful as to whether that would stand up.  It means that before a person can bring civil proceedings for matters done under this Act he will have to have a preliminary trial in the High Court.  In effect, he will have to go to the High Court by way of preliminary application for permission to institute proceedings and the High Court cannot grant permission for the bringing of these proceedings unless it is satisfied that the person against whom the proceedings are to be brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.  That is something that will have to be tried in the action.  I honestly belive that this is going too far.  It is a very technical provision and it is something that needs to be looked into and teased out at some length.  I would have preferred if it was drafted &ldquo;and leave shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against the person against whom it is proposed to bring the proceedings&rdquo;.  That would be reasonable, but under this section a person with a perfectly legitimate cause of action, and a good cause of action, could be prevented from bringing proceedings. I do not want to encourage vexatious proceedings and I do not want to encourage proceedings which have only a nuisance value.  I am against all that.  But we should be careful not to debar people who have a reasonable cause of action from going ahead.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has defined the situation fairly well himself.  It is intended to avoid trivial actions which, in circumstances where people are of unstable or unsound mind or there is such a <Col N="962" /> degree of disorder, could arise fairly readily.  The measure has been there since 1945 without causing any great difficulty and providing, at the same time, protection for the psychiatrists and the relatives involved and the other people concerned.  So I would be reluctant to alter that.  Certainly I will consider the points the Deputy has raised.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Perhaps the question of a person being a patient in a hospital could be got over by making him a ward of court so that proceedings could not then be brought without the approval of the registrar of wards of court.  What I do not like here is that it foresees an action.  Section 46 (1) seems to visualise a valid action but to prescribe an escape clause on the grounds that the person against whom it is proposed to bring the action did not act in bad faith and did not act without reasonable care.  That could work an injustice. If something has stood there since 1945, now is the time to have a look at it. I would like the assurance of the Minister that he will look into this.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are actively promoting the 20-acre site in its ownership at Cappoquin for a suitable industrial project.  Negotiations are at an advanced stage with an overseas company which has expressed an interest in locating a project in Cappoquin.  The IDA are also having discussions with a number of other companies who are interested in Cappoquin as a location for industrial projects.</P>
      <P>No recent application has been made to the IDA for grant assistance towards the cost of modernising the closed bacon factory at Cappoquin.  A number of years ago the IDA refused grant assistance for this purpose because the modernisation proposed would not bring the factory to export licence standard.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the IDA are giving consideration to the provision of a 10,000 sq.ft. advance factory in Cappoquin later this year.</P>

If the matter is finalised it is proposed to establish a food processing plant which will give employment to about 30 people.  Another overseas company are negotiating in a joint venture involving food processing.  Later this month a third food processing company is visiting Ireland and the IDA will draw their attention specifically to the excellent work force available in Cappoquin in their endeavours to promote adequate industry in that area.

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the inference in the question that efforts were not made to rescue the company referred to.  On the contrary, strenuous efforts were made, as the Deputy should be aware, over a lengthy period by the IDA and other interests concerned to have the company taken over as a going concern.</P>
      <P>Negotiations to this end with a major Irish company had, by May 1979, almost been completed.  This arrangement would have involved a considerable amount of State assistance in various forms.  Unfortunately, a number of developments caused the would-be purchasers to review their position and led to their withdrawing from the project.  Further efforts by the IDA and the receiver who had been appointed in February 1979 to have the company taken over as a going concern also proved unsuccessful.  In those circumstances the receiver disposed of the machinery and equipment.</P>
      <P>I understand that interests which recently purchased the factory premises are at present negotiating with the IDA in respect of the establishment of a project in the vacated premises.</P>

Surely this factory should be reopened while the equipment and trained personnel are still available.  Can the Minister give us any hope that the factory will be reopened?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters were gone into and it was decided that it would not be viable to go ahead with the factory at that time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I Propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the rules to which the Deputy refers were prepared and published by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, that body, being a voluntary one, which only performs an advisory role in electrical matters, does not have powers of enforcement.  I share the concern which obviously prompted the Deputy's question in this matter as to the need for an effective mechanism to ensure that members of the public are not put at risk by wiring installations which do not comply with adequate safety requirements.  My Department have had discussions with the Department of the Environment about this matter.  My view is that the best way to deal with the problem is by checks carried out in the course of the inspection process undertaken for the <Col N="979" /> purposes of the Housing Acts, following the incorporation of the provisions of the ETCI electrical installation rules in the building regulations.</P>
    <P>As to the certificates referred to by the Deputy, these are blank forms of certificate which are intended for completion by electrical contractors in respect of electrical installation work carried out or tested by them.  I understand that blank forms for this purpose may be obtained from a number of sources including the ETCI and, indeed, alternative forms of certificate could be, and I believe are, used.  However, the availability in itself of forms of certificate is not a problem; it is the quality of the work actually carried out which really matters in so far as the user of premises is concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand from the ETCI, with whom my Department have regular contact, that their rules for electrical installations are available at all times from the council and that from time to time they publish notifications in the daily newspapers to this effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the Minister that it is the standard of work that is important and not the availability of certificates, from what the Minister says there appears to be a loophole which allows certificates to be completed, the result of which could be substandard work.  If that loophole exists would the Minister accept that there is a need to plug it as quickly as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept what the Deputy is saying.  Both the Department of the Environment and the ESB have an obligation in this matter.  We are endeavouring to have steps taken to ensure that that loophole is blocked.  I understand that the Department of the Environment are at present examining the position with a view to having these rules included in house inspections in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism whether he is aware that the operation of stand-still orders in relation to drink prices has resulted in considerable injustices; and whether he will introduce new price controls which will remove anomalies and control overcharging effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the operation of stand-still orders in relation to drink prices has resulted in considerable injustices.  The price of alcoholic drink for on-premises consumption in licensed premises is controlled by the Maximum Prices (Intoxicating Liquor) Order.  This Order fixes the maximum prices of stout, ale, lager, whiskey, gin and vodka at the levels being charged between 19 and 24 June, 1978 and in addition, provides for all approved price increases since that time.</P>
      <P>The High Court and the Supreme Court have upheld the constitutionality of the Order.  In its unanimous ruling in May, 1980, the Supreme Court referred to the fact that the Minister and his advisers had acted equitably and without discrimination in devising this system of price control for drink.</P>
      <P>At the present time, there are no plans to alter the existing system of price control on alcoholic drink.  However, all systems of price control are subject to continuing review to ensure that they are in a form best suited to the prevailing economic circumstances.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="981" /> stand back and look at the problem for a moment?  Would he accept that there must be an element of unfairness when houses down the country &mdash; I know a number of them in west Cork &mdash; which at present charge 66 pence for a pint of Guinness or Murphys are prosecuted for so doing while one is charged 74 pence in the Dáil bar here, or 94 pence in a hotel in Dublin, five shillings a pint dearer? Does the Minister see any element of injustice in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always the practice that hotels were allowed to charge higher prices because of the circumstances in which they operate &mdash; with a greater number of staff available, greater capital investment &mdash; and matters of that kind were taken into consideration in allowing them to impose increased charges.</P>

Even if the owner spends money bringing his premises up to the level of the others in the area, he is penalised for all time because of the fact that in 1978 he was charging lower than the other premises in the area?</P>

Would the Minister not accept that a fairer system would dictate that the houses in a particular area would not be allowed charge beyond a certain level and that one or two premises <Col N="982" /> would not be forced, by law, to keep their prices forever below those charged in that area?

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1979, Irish manufacturers of drugs and medicines are subject to the same price controls as manufacturers of other products.  However, by far the greater proportion of drugs and medicines sold in this country is imported and no control can be exercised on the manufacturers' prices for products manufactured outside the State.  Importers and wholesalers of drugs and medicines are <Col N="983" /> exempt from the scope of the order but changes in prices and cash margins of importers are monitored by the National Prices Commission.  As part of this monitoring arrangement the commission arrange for periodic examinations of the profit margins of importers and wholesalers of drugs and medicines by their consultancy unit.  Such an examination is in hands at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware &mdash; I am sure he is &mdash; that the cost of drugs at the moment is very, very high?  In fact, because of the lack of control, prices are left in the hands of people who have no obligation whatever to ensure we get value for money.  Is the Minister aware that because of that imported drugs are being prescribed when we have here people actually manufacturing the drugs at a much lower price?  We are talking here about companies operating under established trade names.  Is the Minister aware that medical people believe a vast amount of money is being spent unnecessarily in the area of drugs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The importation of fully built-up motor vehicles, is governed by the provisions of the Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968. The Act made statutory provision for special arrangements, agreed in 1967 between the motor vehicle manufacturers, their Irish assemblers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The objective of these arrangements was to ensure continuation of employment of assembly workers on a long-term basis. The scheme as modified on our entry to the EEC provides for the importation by assemblers of fully built-up vehicles subject to the maintenance of a level of <Col N="988" /> employment either on assembly or comparable operations.</P>
      <P>Assembly firms which do not maintain the required level of employment &mdash; in most cases that of 1965 &mdash; lose their entitlement to import, without restriction, fully built-up vehicles.  This does not preclude the Minister from granting limited facilities for importation where such an arrangement would assist the maintenance of employment.  It is not proposed to make any changes in the provisions of the scheme, but it will of course be terminated by the end of 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should make it clear that, <Col N="990" /> while the Garda have an important role to play in the prevention and control of drug abuse, the misuse of drugs is primarily a social problem.</P>
      <P>I recently met a deputation of parents from the Limerick area and had a full discussion with them on all aspects of drug abuse in the mid-west region.  I share the concern expressed by the parents about this problem.  I was pleased to be able to inform them of discussions I have had with the Garda Commissioner on this subject and of the action he has taken to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>On 1 December last two specially trained members of the Garda Síochána were appointed on a full-time basis to investigate drug abuse in the Limerick division.  Since their appointment these members have been developing sources of information, investigating complaints and closely monitoring the drug scene in the area.  They operate in close liaison with other members in their own division and in the neighbouring divisions of Clare and Tipperary who have also had special training in drugs investigation.  I should mention that drugs investigation is included as part of the standard induction training of every member of the Force and all members of the Force are regarded as preventive officers in this respect.  Since the new two-man unit was established on 1 December last, twenty-one cases of unlawful possession of drugs have been detected in the Limerick area. While the Divisional Officer in Limerick is satisfied that the problem in his area is not any greater than in other large urban areas, the matter is being kept under constant review and will continue to receive special attention from the Garda.</P>

      <P>We had representations about the provision of a Garda station in this area and the matter was examined. The Garda authorities state that a Garda sub-station in this area is not necessary as the existing Garda station in Ballyfermot is sufficient for the needs of the area.  This is the Garda viewpoint on it.  They are satisfied that the coverage they are giving in the Ballyfermot area right now would not be improved in any way&mdash;in fact it might be disimproved&mdash;by having to man a sub-station a short distance away.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the reorganisation of a number of District Court districts are being considered with a view to providing for a more equitable distribution of work among neighbouring districts with disparate case-loads.  Districts Nos. 8 and 9, in which the areas referred to in the question are situated, are among the districts involved.</P>
      <P>In the case of districts Nos. 8 and 9 what is proposed is that Tullamore be transferred from district No. 9 to district No. 8 so that the justice in district No. 9 may have time to provide much needed extra sittings at Mullingar and Longford. In order that the justice in district No. 8 may be in a position to take the sittings at Tullamore it is necessary, however, that he discontinue sitting at a number of the smaller, less-busy venues in his district. Banagher, Kilcormac and Woodford have been suggested as venues at which sittings could be discontinued without causing undue inconvenience locally. The numbers of cases dealt with at these venues are relatively small and there are alternative venues in close proximity to each to which the business could be transferred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities.  I accept that at many court venues the court accommodation is less than satisfactory and that many venues lack certain desirable facilities such as waiting rooms and consultation rooms. In a number of cases within the past year particular local authorities have improved the quality of the accommodation provided for some District Courts by obtaining the use of fairly satisfactory premises such as community halls on a rental basis.  The reinstatement of Tralee courthouse is expected to be completed by mid-summer of this year and that of Waterford courthouse by early 1982.  Several local authorities are considering quite extensive repairs and improvements to a number of courthouses and others are dealing with less extensive works on an ongoing basis.  Moreover, as I mentioned in my reply to the debate on the Second Stage of the Courts Bill, 1980, I have a set of proposals relating to court accommodation which I am putting to the Government and which, if approved, should pave the way for the upgrading of <Col N="995" /> court accommodation generally throughout the country to an acceptable level.</P>
      <P>In Dublin two new jury court suites will shortly be available in the Four Courts, one for High Court business, including family law, and the other for the joint use of the High and Circuit Courts.  The Four Courts Hotel site, which has been acquired by the Office of Public Works, will be developed as an office block to accommodate the various court offices at present housed in the Four Courts building, thus freeing further areas there for development as additional courtrooms and ancillary accommodation.  Planning for the office block project is at an advanced stage and I understand that it may be possible to invite tenders for the construction phase before the end of this year.  It is generally agreed that the accommodation available to the Children's Court is not fully satisfactory. My Department continue to explore with the Office of Public Works the possibility of obtaining more appropriate accommodation for the court and a number of options are being considered at present.  Meanwhile the Children's Court premises at Dublin Castle have been extensively redecorated and some improvements were effected in the waiting room facilities there.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been completed for the rental of alternative accommodation to replace the completely inadequate and unsuitable courthouse in Rathfarnham. Some adaptation work is required to fit the new accommodation for court use and it is hoped to put this in hands very shortly and that the new accommodation may be available for use when the District Court sittings resume after the August recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister name those courts about which he is particularly dissatisfied in terms of standards and which he says are inadequate?  Secondly, how does he anticipate that the local authorities will undertake the carrying out of the mandatory responsibilities referred to in view of the fact that this year they will have less finance in real terms than was the case this time last year <Col N="996" /> by virtue of the Government ceiling of 12 per cent on local authority expenditure? Thirdly, with specific reference to the rental arrangements he referred to in relation to the Children's Court, when where these arrangements put in hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the question, I do not have a list of courts that are in need of repair or of replacement but I shall endeavour to get such a list and to send it to the Deputy. Regarding the involvement of county councils the Deputy should know that within the past 12 months various county councils have been taking action in respect of courthouse accommodation. For instance, Clare and Galway County Councils have arranged to rent accommodation to replace unsatisfactory court accommodation at three of their centres &mdash; Ennistymon, Mountbellew and Athenry. Kilkenny County Council are making arrangements to rent alternative premises for District Court sittings at Ballyragget.  Wicklow County Council are making similar arrangements while Galway County Council are restructuring existing courthouses, particularly Galway courthouse where they hope to provide a new court office and a new floor over one of the court rooms.  Dublin County Council have plans for major works at Kilmainham courthouse and they spell out what is involved.  We have found suitable temporary accommodation in the vicinity but the county council have not been able to negotiate satisfactory terms for renting the premises.  In the event of that falling through, we would have to seek other accommodation. The Deputy is aware that during debate here on the Courts Bill I said I have a set of proposals relating to court accommodation and which I am putting to the Government.  If the Government approve of these proposals, they will make way for me for the upgrading of court accommodation generally throughout the country to an acceptable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea of when the rental rearrangements in respect of a children's court took place? Regarding the second part of the Minister's <Col N="997" /> reply, will this whole question of a new set of proposals not hinge ultimately on whether the Government are prepared to allocate adequate finance for this purpose?  Am I to take it that the Minister's proposals are essentially about internal restructuring or do they propose the allocation of adequate resources for the purpose of dispensing with court rooms which, by common consent, are not acceptable in this day and age?</P>

      <P>I have dealt with the general question of family courts in reply to a number of Dáil questions in the past and I covered what seems to me to be the three main aspects, namely, the improvement of court accommodation, the introduction of less formal procedures including the possibility of having, for instance, advisers or assessors and changes in the jurisdiction of the courts to deal with family law matters.  I would refer the Deputy in particular to my replies to questions on 25 June 1980 and on 13 December 1977.</P>
      <P>In addition, I dealt whith the question of family courts in some detail in reply to the debate on the Second Stage of the Courts Bill, 1980 in the House and indicated what the position was in relation to court accommodation, particularly in the light of the changes to be introduced by that Bill in regard to jurisdiction in family law matters.  In this connection, I would remind the Deputy that in 1978 two courtrooms with ancillary accommodation for the hearing of such cases were provided in a newly-constructed building at Ormond Quay in Dublin.  I went on to deal with the more general question of the establishment of special family law courts and the fundamental issue of the suitability of adversary type trials for the hearing of such matters, and I stated that these questions are being considered by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and by the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  On the application, of any person, which shall be made in such form and containing such particulars as the Minister may direct, the Minister, after advertising in the public media inviting public objections and then after consultation with persons who in his opinion are representative of all employers in the bakery trade and with persons who in his opinion are representatives of all workers in that trade, may, if he is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so, issue to such person a licence to carry on, in a bakery to which this Act applies, in the period of night, any process of manufacture which is prohibited by subsection (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main reason for the amendment is to include a requirement that applications for licences should be advertised and open to public objection.  This is important especially in the light of the fact that the principal Act of 1936 has proved unenforceable for many reasons not the least being that very often the places of such baking have not been known, whereas people living around the night bakeries and people engaged elsewhere in the bakery industry would have a right to object to a licence being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People would have a right to object if living in the vicinity of a place where night work was to be carried out because it is not hard to see that this could undermine <Col N="1019" /> the peace and tranquillity of their neighbourhood at night.  But much more important is the right of people employed elsewhere in the bakery industry to object.  An example will illustrate what I mean.  Suppose bakery A applies for a licence under this Bill.  Management and union at the bakery, who will be consulted if this subsection is not amended, are agreeable because it suits both parties. Take a bakery 20 miles away.  Neither workers nor management are consulted. Yet, by granting a night licence to bakery A bakery B could find itself facing unfair competition and in an extreme case could be forced out of business as has already been the case of some bakeries, notably Kennedys which was forced out by unfair competition from bakeries working illegally at night.</P>
    <P>Another possibility is that it will have the effect of forcing workers to do night work at bakery B although neither they nor the management want it.  If I were a worker at bakery B or the spouse of such worker I would be very upset that the normal pattern of my family life, the normal enjoyment of the company of my spouse and family at night could be taken away because I did not know the licence was being granted elsewhere.  I urge the Minister to consider this point.  The workers have a right to know and be heard on the matter.  They have the right to object before a decision to grant or refuse a licence is made.  That is very important. It may well be that the only effect of it would be to alert themselves to seek a night licence but in any case there are such interests involved.  There are people with a clear interest in what happens in individual bakeries and the only reasonably sure way of alerting them, seeking their views, objections and so on, or of informing them is by advertising in the public media and inviting their comments or objections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House is aware that before a license is issued my Department will consult with the ICTU and the FUE.  As well as that consultations will be held with the management of the bakeries concerned <Col N="1020" /> and with the representatives of the employees.  It is my view that this represents a thorough consultative programme and I cannot see why we would have to resort to placing advertisements in the media.  This would be at considerable cost when the matter can be taken care of in the same straightforward manner as we normally do in cases like this.  Therefore, I hope the Deputy will accept that I, the Government and the Department are satisfied that we will have consultations with all the people concerned and Congress will be informed.  Therefore, I see no reason for this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in saying that this will cost a lot of money is hardly credible.  There are many precedents for such an arrangement and the cost should fairly fall on the applicant just as it does on publicans seeking to renew their licenses and persons seeking planning permission or alterations to planning permission. It is not a credible reason for not accepting the amendment.  There is a very strong case for alerting the public to any such application, not least because of the domino effect of granting one licence.  I am afraid of this and I want to do everything possible to prevent a proliferation of unnecessary night baking.  The reason for that is something that has not been alluded to too much in the Second Stage debate or at all here today, the adverse social and health implications of prolonged night work.  The danger is that if one licence is granted it will prompt another application for a licence and will have a domino or multiplier effect. Potentially a lot of people in the bakery industry who for years and years had enjoyed or certainly got used to certain hours of work, usually starting early in the morning until midday, are going to be dragged unwittingly and unknowingly on to night work because they are not alerted.  I argue strongly that they are entitled to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We went into this in much greater detail, very properly, during the passage of the Safety in Industry Act and in the preparation of that Act I had very prolonged discussions with the Association of Industrial Medical Officers and the <Col N="1021" /> Faculty of Occupational Medicine at UCD and with the Health and Welfare Section in Brussels.  I also consulted such documents as were available from the ILO in Geneva.  It is an accepted fact that prolonged night work causes severe social disorientation and is a root cause of many health problems.  For that reason we have to be very careful not to be taking several steps or even one step backwards in facilitating more night work than is absolutely necessary.  For that reason this amendment should be accepted. Bakeries B, C and D have a right to know if bakery A are seeking a licence and they have a right to state their case because it is going to affect them.  While I accept that the Minister should consult with the employers and trade unions, there is a division within the bakery union.  The division, however, leaves the bakers within Dublin, who are most adversely affected by this, in a minority.  They are and always have been opposed to night work and I feel that they should have a right to know about this.  Congress may say that the bakers' union have voted to accept night work but the No. 1 Branch in Dublin have not.  If I were a baker in Dublin I would resist like hell going on night work if I could at all avoid it.</P>
    <P>I want to stress again the health factor. Regarding night work, the original list of amendments which I submitted was lost somewhere in the House but included in that list was an amendment which sought to curtail the number of weeks in any year that any worker could be required to work.  In drafting a rushed second version of this I omitted to table that amendment and I do not know whether it would be possible to take it on Committee Stage.  I did that because in the United Kingdom there is a 26-week limit on the number of weeks that can be worked in any one year.  I ask the Minister, if I cannot do this procedurally, if he would consider such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

This legislation has been made necessary by the failure to enforce the 1936 Act and we must not allow ourselves to enact further legislation which will not be enforced.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is threefold: firstly, to abolish the actions for criminal conversation and enticement and harbouring of a spouse, secondly, to abolish the action for breach of promise of marriage and to provide for the regulation of various questions in relation to property, including engagement rings, of persons whose agreements to marry have been terminated, and thirdly, to provide that a consent for the purposes of section 3 (1)  or section 9 (2) of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that it is given <Col N="1026" /> by a spouse who is under the age of majority.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice has stated on a number of occasions in this House, it has been for some time the Government's intention to introduce legislation to change the law in regard to the action for criminal conversation.  The question that remained to be decided was whether that action and the action for enticement of a spouse should be simply abolished or whether other kinds of action should be created in their place as suggested by the Law Reform Commission in their <i>Working Paper No. 5 - 1978 &ldquo;The Law relating to Criminal Conversation and the Enticement and Harbouring of a Spouse&rdquo;</i> and recommended in their recent <i>Report No. 1 1980 &mdash; Family Law</i>.  The Government, having considered the matter carefully, came to the conclusion that it would be preferable, on balance, to abolish the actions for criminal conversation and enticement without replacement.  Section 1 of the Bill contains the provisions necessary to give effect to that decision.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that the action for harbouring of a spouse should be abolished without replacement and section 1 also gives effect to that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government have not accepted the commission's recommendations in regard to actions to replace criminal conversation and enticement of a spouse in no way minimises the very important contribution that the commission have made to the debate on this subject.  Their Working Paper No. 5, containing as it does a full statement of the present law and detailed arguments on both sides of the question whether those actions should be replaced by other forms of action, represented a most valuable aid to consideration of the whole question.</P>
    <P>I think I should take this opportunity to set the record straight in regard to the Government's decision.  Various published comments about the Bill have stated that the Government had dropped their proposals for extending the law on criminal conversation and certain Opposition Members of the Oireachtas were quoted as saying that the present Bill <Col N="1027" /> represents a reversal of a previous Government approach.  There were earlier newspaper reports that the Government had decided to introduce a Bill which would give a right of action for adultery. These reports were denied at the time and were totally without foundation.  The Bill represents the first and only set of proposals on the subject adopted or put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>On 22 November 1979 and 27 March 1980 the Minister for Justice indicated in the Dáil that, while he was aware of the arguments surrounding the abolition of the action of criminal conversation&mdash;as opposed to its replacement by another form of action which would not discriminate between the sexes&mdash;he did not propose to make proposals to the Government on the basis of the working paper published by the Law Reform Commission in the matter but proposed to wait until he had their final recommendations.</P>
    <P>An Opposition Private Member's Bill on the subject was discussed in the Dáil on 4 March 1980 and, again, the Minister made it clear that he was not weighing the arguments one way or the other but opposed the Bill on the basis that Government legislation would be introduced after the final recommendations of the commission had been considered.  The final recommendations were subsequently received and examined.  The Bill now published, in so far as it deals with the area in question, represents the Government's considered response to them.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill for the abolition of the action for breach of promise of marriage and for the regulation of various questions in relation to the property of persons whose agreements to marry have been terminated are contained in sections 2 to 9.  They follow generally the suggestions of the Law Reform Commission contained in their <i>Working Paper No. 4&mdash;1978: The Law Relating to Breach of Promise of Marriage,</i> and recommended in their Report No. 1 to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that an agreement to marry entered into either before or after the passing of the Act will have no legal effect as a contract and that no <Col N="1028" /> action for breach of any such agreement may be brought irrespective of the law applicable to the agreement.  Actions commenced before the Act is passed are not, however, affected.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 2, the Bill departs in one respect from the commission's recommendation. The commission proposed that the action for breach of promise should be abolished only in relation to agreements entered into after the passing of the Act.  Having regard to the fact that an action could be begun up to six years after the actual breach of an agreement, which itself might be quite some time after the Bill becomes law&mdash;for it could be a long engagement&mdash;it would have been possible under the commission's proposal for an action for breach of promise of marriage to be instituted long after the Act become law.  The Government took the view that, once the basic decision to abolish the action was taken, it should apply to all agreements to marry including those made before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes provision in relation to wedding presents to engaged couples from third parties.  The section provides that it will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the gift was made subject to the condition that it will be returned on request if the marriage for any reason does not take place. This would appear to be the present law on the subject.  The section also provides that it will be presumed, again in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the gift was made to both parties as joint owners.  This presumption will apply not only in relation to terminated engagements but also where the marriage does take place.  The Law Reform Commission in making this proposal had in mind the difficulties which could occur in deciding which party the donor intended to benefit.  In regard to what could be a particularly valuable wedding gift it will settle the question of ownership for the purpose of any dispute that might arise later in regard to matrimonial property.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is concerned with gifts of property, including the engagement ring, between engaged couples.  The section caters for two possibilities, firstly the case <Col N="1029" /> where a marriage does not take place for a reason other than the death of the donor and, secondly, the case where the marriage does not take place because of the donor's death.  In the first case it will be presumed that the gift was given on the condition that it would be returned, on request, if the marriage does not take place.  In the second case it will be presumed that the gift was given unconditionally. In both cases the presumption will be subject to contrary evidence of the donor's intention.  In framing their recommendation in this form the Law Reform Commission believed that the law should remove any consideration of responsibility for the termination of the engagement from the determination of whether these gifts are returnable.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the property of engaged couples and provides that where an agreement to marry is terminated the same rules of law as apply to the rights of spouses in relation to property in which either or both has or have a beneficial interest will apply in the case of engaged couples in relation to any property in which either or both of the parties had a beneficial interest while the agreement was in force.  The effect of this will be to apply to engaged couples the common law rules evolved by the courts in regard to contributions to the acquisition of property by married couples.  The section also provides, in subsection (2), for the application of section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, relating to the determination of questions between husband and wife as to property, to disputes between parties to an agreement to marry in relation to property in which either or both had a beneficial interest while the agreement was in force.  The advantage of section 12 is that it enables questions as to property to be brought in a summary manner before the Circuit Court or the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 6 and 7 provide for the making of orders by the court where one party to an agreement to marry that has been terminated has received a substantial benefit other than a wedding gift, because wedding gifts are dealt with in section 4, from a third person, or where a party to an agreement to marry, or another person <Col N="1030" /> on behalf of that party, has incurred expenditure of a substantial nature in the expectation that the marriage would take place.  An example of the former would be where a close relative of one of the parties to an agreement to marry has, while the agreement was still in force, expended a substantial amount of money on the improvement of the prospective matrimonial home of the parties.  In the case of the latter situation we are talking about money having been spent as a result of the agreement to marry without any benefit accruing.  Expenditure involved in travelling from a foreign country either by a party to the agreement or a parent of one of the parties in the expectation that the marriage would take place is an example of the type of expenditure section 7 is intended to cover.  In the case of an application under either section the court may make such order as appears to it to be just and equitable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the jurisdiction of the courts in relation to applications under sections 6 and 7.  The jurisdictional limits in the section are the same as those proposed for contract and tort for the District and Circuit Courts in the Courts Bill, 1980, at present before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for a limitation period of three years in respect of proceedings that may arise under sections 3 to 7 where an agreement to marry for whatever reason has been terminated. The period will begin to run from the termination of the agreement to marry.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the third matter dealt with in the Bill.  Section 10 provides that a consent given for the purpose of section 3 (1) or section 9 (2) of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, whether it was given before or after the passing of this Act, will not be regarded as being invalid by reason only that it is or was given by a person who has not attained the age of majority.  The context is as follows.  Section 3 (1) of the 1976 Act provides that a conveyance of any interest in the family home without the consent of the other spouse will be void except in certain circumstances. One consequence, of course, is that lending institutions when dealing with applications for house purceeding <Col N="1031" /> chase loans from a spouse need the consent of the other spouse to the conveyance of the house as security for the loan. Where the other spouse is under the age of 21 years, the present age of majority, some lending institutions have refused to accept the consent of such a spouse as effective.  This has led to proceedings being taken in the High Court with a view to obtaining the court's authority to give the required consent on behalf of the spouse.  The effect of section 10 will be to obviate the necessity for such proceedings.</P>
    <P>As it happens, in a case which came to hearing since the Bill was circulated, the High Court has decided that a consent of an under age spouse is not a sufficient consent for the purposes of section 3 of the 1976 Act.  As I hope that this Bill will secure a very speedy approval from the Oireachtas, I assume that the question of an appeal need not be considered.  In the absence of an appeal, it may be inappropriate now for section 10 to speak of removing doubt and I may propose a drafting amendment to exclude that reference.</P>
    <P>Besides the immediate problem which has given rise to section 10 &mdash; the consent of a minor spouse in relation to the conveyance of a house &mdash; a similar problem could arise, if it has not already arisen, in relation to the consent of a minor spouse under section 9 (2) of the 1976 Act to the disposal in certain circumstances by the other spouse of the household chattels.  Section 10 will cover that situation also.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to advert to the fact that the Law Reform Commission's <i>Report No. 1 &mdash; 1980: Family Law</i> contains recommendations in the very important area of matrimonial property.  These and the remaining recommendations in the report other than those being dealt with in this Bill are being considered separately.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill.  However, it seems a pity that is was not brought in sooner.  It is a comparatively short Bill, though its technical implications are of some significance, and it seems to us that there was no real reason why previous efforts by us were not accepted in regard to criminal conversation, enticement and harbouring.  Unfortunately, there seems to have been a belief on the part of this Government and other Governments, without distinction of party, that the only legislation that will ever be passed by this House will come from the Government side.  This is an unnecessarily rigid way to approach the whole question of legislation and tends only to reinforce people in the belief that basically the House is only a rubber stamp for Government decisions, and nothing else.</P>
      <P>The first point I should like to make on the contents of the Bill is in relation to the abolition of actions for criminal conversation, enticement and harbouring. There is a certain sense in which it is almost an embarrassment for us to be legislating on this topic today.  One would have thought that commonsense and good taste alone would have allowed this cause of action to have lapsed many years ago and that it would not have been necessary to bring in any legislation to remove it.  By bringing it in at this stage we are doing two things.  First of all, we are putting the situation to rights, and in an embarrassed fashion we are drawing attention to the state of our legislation, our common law in particular, and to the fact that this state of affairs has remained undisturbed up to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect one of the main reasons which has finally prompted the Government to bring in this Bill, apart from the consistent pressure from the Opposition benches, has been the sad evidence of the fact that a number of Irish husbands in the distant and not too distant past have not felt constrained by requirements of commonsense or decency or good taste and have sought their rights at law under this cause of action.  I do not propose to refer to any individual cases, for obvious reasons.  But Deputies on all sides will be aware of the incalculable amount of damage <Col N="1033" /> to individuals, to people's feelings and to the institution of family life that has been caused not just by the bringing of these actions but by their widespread publicity.</P>
    <P>As a person who has had some connection with the newspaper industry, may I say how disappointed I have been at the editorial approach taken by some newspapers in relation to these cases. They have made what was already a difficult and unpleasant situation a thousand times worse by focussing public attention on an unfortunate two or three or four people and, of course, any children, for the purpose of selling newspapers.  I am the first to admit that newspaper people are in the business for the purpose of selling newspapers, but there are limits beyond which I felt good taste would not allow them to go, but in many cases involving this cause of action newspapers went beyond those limits.  Therefore, one beneficial effect of passing this Bill will be to ensure at least that cheap appeals for circulation by newspapers will no longer be possible, at least in this area.</P>
    <P>The second main consequence of changing the law in this regard, ultimately far more important that the one I have mentioned, is that it is a further erosion of the long-standing right of married men to treat their wives more as chattels than human beings.  That right is still not entirely gone, however.  The Minister of State will be aware that this is an argument I advanced during the debate on the Rape Bill, on the crime, which I believe it to be, of marital rape.  I believe marital rape is another expression of the kind of attitude we are disposing of in this Bill, the attitude that a man's wife is essentially his personal property and that the law will not interfere unduly when he treats her in a certain way because of the relationship which the law presumes to exist between them.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas in relation to this topic which have not been dealt with in the Bill.  Though I was glad to hear the Minister say, in relation to the report of the Law Reform Commission on family law, that further action is promised, I should have liked to have seen <Col N="1034" /> some more evidence of a sense of urgency about this.  One of the intriguing aspects of this is the degree to which debates and arguments and crimes and offences relating to marriage very rarely concern the personal relationship between the individuals and much more the contractual relationship between them &mdash; the law of marriage very rapidly turns into a subdivision of the law of property.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has studied the institution of marriage over the centuries will see that it is linked with the laws of property and succession.  This is a matter for legal scientists and historians, but it should also be a matter for politicians because there are ways at present in which the strong relationship between the law of marriage and the law of property has resulted, and will continue to result for quite some time, in substantial hardship to innocent persons, notably illegitimate children.  Unfortunately, this is an area in which we see little willingness to move on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down that engagements to marry are not enforceable in law.  This is a more genuine anachronism than the action for criminal conversation, enticement and harbouring.  I read the newspapers fairly assiduously and I cannot remember when I last read a report of an action for breach of promise to marry.  It is hardly necessary even to include it, but by including it in the Bill we tidy up the situation.  It is intriguing how fashions change over the years.  The breach of promise to marry action was at one stage so common that it was celebrated by Gilbert and Sullivan in &ldquo;Trial by Jury&rdquo;.  At the turn of the century, especially in this country, fortunes were made in the legal profession on actions like this, on actions for criminal conversation and last, but not least, on actions connected with the electoral law.  Eighty years later, there is hardly an action for criminal conversation, there is never an action for breach of promise to marry and actions connected with the electoral laws have disappeared. Their place has been taken by running-down cases.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Act in section 6 for application to the court in case of a substantial benefit to a party to a broken <Col N="1035" /> engagement.  This is a commonsense provision in that at least there should be some court of appeal in cases in which actions have been taken, commitments made and gifts exchanged of a substantial kind on the basis of a genuine promise. One would have thought, in equity at any rate, there could have been some application to the court, notwithstanding the introduction of such a section but I welcome its introduction if only because it will at least clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>I also note that under section 10 there is a paragraph relating to consent by a minor spouse to disposal of a family home.  The Family Home Protection Act was a very forward looking legislation in its time.  It has afforded many people, especially women, a measure of protection which heretofore they would not have dreamed of and which, I think, is still not available to women in many other countries.  One of the problems is that it has become a kind of minefield for lawyers engaged in property transactions. They have taken to concocting all sorts of problems which may or may not exist and which they want to see solved at somebody else's expense before they will consent to the conveyance of various pieces of property.  I know lawyers are mainly conscientious people concerned to protect their clients' interests, but I sometimes wonder whether they are not making mountains out of molehills in connection with the Family Home Protection Act and whether what was basically a good Act cannot still operate in a less tortuous way than at present.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a small overdue step in the process of achieving some kind of equality between men and women in marriage. We do not really believe that this kind of equality can be achieved in the fullest sense untill all sorts of other economic and social distinctions have been dealt with and until men and women, in marriage and outside it, have the kind of economic freedom to match the social and legal freedom which they are slowly acquiring.  In a sense legal freedom can be conferred on them by this House and by the courts, although it is an easier matter to confer equality on somebody in <Col N="1036" /> law than to ensure that they actually enjoy that equality in fact.  In so far as our responsibility lies in this House, we are taking a good step in abolishing the action for criminal conversation, for enticement and for harbouring.  It may mark a small but significant step towards the time when we become a more mature society and one which is able to regard all its citizens without distinction in matters of sex as equal human beings before the law.  It is important that this should be done and it is important that it should be done visibly.  We may wilt slightly under the embarrassment.  We are, in one sense, in the position of a Japanese soldier who has been discovered on an island still fighting World War II in 1975 or 1976.  This war is not over by any means. Real equality is still a long way away.  We welcome this small step and look forward to much greater steps in the economic and social areas.</P>

      <P>This Bill covers many important points.  As Deputy Horgan said, it is a pity no Bill, except one sponsored by the Government, can pass in the House.  As the Minister said, this Bill follows a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill to repeal the tort of criminal conversation. There is no reason why the Government could not have accepted the Fine Gael Bill some time ago.  It is worth repeating what Deputy Horgan said: that no Bill, no matter how meritorious, can pass unless it is initiated by the Government. This adds weight to the argument that Parliament is irrelevant.  No measure of the Opposition, no matter how effective or constructive, will be accepted because all wisdom must be seen to flow from Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill which are long overdue.  There are also aspects which need clarification.  For instance, it is a fact of contemporary Irish life that more and more couples do not marry but live together.  Many factors encourage that, but it is a situation which is not covered by this Bill.  I should like the Minister, in his reply, to clarify the case of couples living together as common law husband and wife, with or without children. How does this Bill affect them?  It <Col N="1037" /> may also be an argument against the Bill. There is a school of thought which argues that this Bill will tend to increase the incidence of unmarried couples living together.  It will tend to legalise adultery. I do not agree with that point of view, but some people hold it.</P>
    <P>I agreed with Deputy Horgan when he commented on the media coverage of criminal conversation actions.  The press deserve to be severely criticised for trading in human misery.  It is not so long since we had the most recent case, in the last year or so, where intimate details of the relationship of the people involved were paraded, day after day, across public newspapers and much more important things were ignored.  It is a very necessary part of our democracy to have a free and unbridled press, but surely there should be some taste and some standard applied. However, that is not important compared to the fact that a law exists which tolerates and allows such litigation.  We cannot but be happy that, at long last, the tort of criminal conversation and the tort of enticing and harbouring a spouse are to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>More needs to be said about this Bill than that.  The Government's reason for opposing the Opposition Bill was that they wanted to wait for the full report of the Law Reform Commission.  Having done that, they then proceeded in this Bill to ignore some of the recommendations. For instance, the commission recommended retaining some sort of tort applying equally between the sexes.  The Minister was absolutely right in rejecting that recommendation and he deserves to be congratulated for that.  We criticised the Government for being mean and mealy-mouthed about accepting constructive Opposition legislation, which they have consistently refused to do throughout this Dáil &mdash; every single Bill has been voted down by the Government &mdash; but we also praise when praise is due and the Minister deserves to be praised for rejecting some of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, as did the original Fine Gael Bill.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's speech, I am a little worried that this Bill might give rise to more occasions for <Col N="1038" /> litigation which might be avoided.  This is in relation to the whole question of gifts between engaged couples or gifts to them by third parties and so on.  There are aspects of what the Minister has said which are not absolutely clear to me and which I am not totally happy with.  But, in the main, the provisions of the Bill are not just late but long overdue.</P>
    <P>Apart from dealing as section I does, with abolishing actions for criminal conversation and inducement and harbouring of spouses, the Bill proposes to eliminate the possibility of actions for breach of promise following broken engagements. Again the Minister exceeds the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission by making the legislation retrospective except in cases where the action has already been commenced.  I am normally opposed to retrospective legislation but in the circumstances there is a certain merit in what the Minister has done here.  It is only right that broken engagements should not be causes for actions in court.  As is clear from other parts of the Bill, provisions are made in relation to gifts having been exchanged between engaged couples.  It is not beyond the realm of imagination &mdash; indeed, it has happened many times in the past &mdash; that a person might deliberately become engaged to another person solely to solicit expensive gifts or property. I imagine the provisions of the Bill will reduce the incidence of such engagements.</P>
    <P>But the provisions are not clear or comprehensive enough.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with gifts to engaged couples by other persons, gifts between engaged couples and property of engaged couples. Section 6 provides for an application to the court in a case where there is substantial benefit to a party of a broken engagement.  Section 7 deals with applications to the court in the case of substantial expenditure incurred by or on behalf of a party to a broken engagement. But there is the question of the couple who are not married, who for one reason or another cannot marry but who have entered into a relationship which lasted for some time and eventually broke down.  What is the position in relation to <Col N="1039" /> the property which accumulated between them during the term of that relationship? This is something that needs to be looked at.  If we do not make provision for it we are saying that engaged couples have a recognised status in law which these other couples, who are frequently married in all but name, do not have.  I agree that provision should be made for engaged couples but we must take a step further along the road in the case of couples who have lived together.  I do not mean a type of relationship lasting for a very short time, but cases lasting many years.  Surely some arrangement should be made when a relationship of this duration breaks down after some time and after the accumulation of a certain amount of property and so forth?  In view of the constitutional ban on divorce.  I do not know if it is possible to make provision in law on this aspect, but I suspect that it is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;among our society but we must admit that for one reason or another, there is that category of people, comprising a significant number.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.  Perhaps those who are shadowing this legislation would table amendments to cover this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak briefly on section 10 &mdash; a very minor part of the Bill, but of great importance to many young people. This is the section which covers the situation <Col N="1040" /> which often arises when young people seek to purchase homes in advance of or after marriage.  This becomes impossible when one is not of the age of majority. It is impossible for them to buy their home jointly.  Section 10 is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that no consent given by a spouse, whether before or after the passing of this Act, for the purposes of section 3 (1) of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 (which provides that a conveyance by one spouse of an interest in the family home without the written consent of the other spouse shall be void) or of section 9 (2) of that Act (which restricts the right of a spouse to dispose of household chattels without the consent of the other spouse) is or was invalid by reason only that it is or was given by a spouse who has not or had not attained the age of majority.</P>
    <P>(2) Subsection (1) shall apply to a consent given for the aforesaid purposes before the passing of this Act by a guardian or a court on behalf of a spouse who had not attained the age of majority as if the consent had been given by the spouse.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that this section may have to be amended because of the recent court judgment, which I think is under appeal.  However, the need for such appeal may be obviated by the passing of this Bill.  Unless I am mistaken, section 10 allows only for a situation where a minor spouse could agree to the disposal of a family home and so forth but does not specifically say that a minor spouse could be, for instance, a party to a contract to purchase or sell a house. Certainly, it is not clear that such a person can be party to the contract to purchase a house, which is one of the problems I come up against frequently in my constituency. It is important that clear provision be made that couples who have made the effort to get the money together to purchase a house are not inhibited in this way.  I have known cases where the younger spouses have to wait until they are 21, which could mean a year, a year-and-a-half, or even longer. I know <Col N="1041" /> of one case where a girl of 19 had to wait until she was 21, but the price of houses increased greatly in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>The alternative is for the house to be purchased solely in the name of the older partner.  This runs counter to the whole tone and underlying principle of much of the legislation dealing with family matters which has been enacted in the past decade.  This legislation tends to encourage &mdash; and rightly and emphatically so &mdash; a joint and equal partnership in marriage.  I hope that section 10, or the Bill as a whole, will cover the point of allowing that, where one of the partners is over the age of majority, the other partner would be permitted to enter into a contract to purchase the family home.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I very much welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for ignoring certain of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  I want again to rap the Minister on the knuckles for being ungenerous last year in not accepting the Fine Gael Bill on criminal conversation and, for that reason, leaving the situation unclarified for too long.  I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the adjournment.  When I sought permission to raise it this morning the Minister indicated that he would be glad to have the opportunity to make a statement in the House on the matter. Although he did not use these words, he more or less implied, in the words of somebody accused, that he had an answer to all the charges brought against him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for my wanting to raise this matter on the adjournment is the intense alarm and anxiety created by newspaper reports &mdash; but not entirely by newspaper reports I hasten to add &mdash; in the past few days about the instructions believed to have been given by the Department's personnel to that small group of people who will be administering the oral Irish examination to students in the schools, starting from next Monday.</P>
      <P>In particular, there was a report in the <i>Evening Press</i> of yesterday which, although I understand it was erroneous in a number of respects, carried the burden of some of the complaints made to me.  In relation to the <i>Evening Press</i> report, all I will say at this point is that I believe two aspects of it are not necessarily accurate.  The first is the aspect which indicates that the examiners have been told they may not start with easy questions and build up to harder ones. I belive that is inaccurate.  The second is the implication in the report that, by starting on poetry questions, the examiners are somehow making things harder for the pupils than heretofore.  I belive that has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main burden of what I want to discuss has been raised with me by teachers, not newspapers.  The teachers concerned who have been at meetings with Department of Education personnel are under the distinct and unambiguous impression that they are being asked to mark the oral Irish examination this year more severely than has been the case in <Col N="1043" /> the past.  The reason they are under this impression is twofold.  First of all, at at least one of the meetings about which I was told, tapes of oral interviews were played and the examiners were invited to mark the tapes.  In virtually all cases they were told that their marking was too light and would have to be harder.  In the case of the most fluent tape played, one on which the student appeared to be almost indistinguishable from a native speaker, and a tape to which the majority of the examiners present gave an A, they were told that a more appropriate marking would have been a C.  In relation to a number of other tapes played on which the student was obviously weak to some degree, the majority of the examiners would have given the student a bare pass and they were told that effectively that student should have been failed.</P>
    <P>That is the evidence of their own eyes and ears as to what happened at these meetings.  At at least one of those meetings the examiners were told there had been pressure &mdash;&ldquo;brú&rdquo; was the word used &mdash; from the universities, not from the Minister ironically enough, to increase the standard of oral Irish and of Irish generally in the leaving certificate and this was the reason why they were being told, advised, asked &mdash; I do not know what the appropriate terminology is &mdash; to be somewhat stricter in their marking than they have been hitherto.  I would be very glad to hear the Minister on this point.  It would be entirely inappropriate for the universities to bring pressure on the leaving certificate examiners and students in relation to Irish or anything else.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate is supposed to be what its name implies, a leaving certificate. It is not in essence, although it has tended to become, a form of entrance examination for the universities.  Basically what is happening in this area is that universities are getting their matriculation on the cheap.  They do not have to run matriculation examinations by and large because they are using the results of the leaving certificate.  This is distorting not just the leaving certificate examination but also the whole curriculum of <Col N="1044" /> the second level school leading up to the leaving certificate.  The leaving certificate is supposed to be an examination for children who are leaving school.  The majority of children who are leaving school with the leaving certificate will not be going into the universities, and that is why it is inappropriate that universities should be bringing pressure, if they are bringing pressure, in relation to Irish.</P>
    <P>What is particularly upsetting for the teachers and examiners concerned &mdash; and you can take it for granted that if it is upsetting for them it must be doubly and trebly upsetting for the students concerned &mdash; is that ten days before the examination they got the first indication of a possible change in the marking system or in the approach to marking this vital examination.  It is normal in the Department of Education to discuss things with the schools, to discuss changes in particular with the schools, and to let schools know well in advance what kind of examination scene they will be facing into at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The schools are now under the impression that something is being done to them without consultation of any kind.  The teachers who contacted me to express their concern about it have not been consulted. They do not know whether their school principals have been consulted.  If consultation has taken place, there must have been a massive breakdown in communications somewhere along the line. They are beginning to wonder whether this is not the Minister's attempt to implement, if that is the right word, certain key sections of the White Paper on Education without having made the necessary investment in the schools to enable them to do the job he wants them to do.</P>
    <P>In the section on Irish in the White Paper there is this sentence: it is obvious, therefore, that the examinations themselves must place greater stress on listening, comprehension and speaking.  Who could argue with that?  We are all in favour of that.  If the Minister is to start applying the pressure from this end, from the examination end, without giving the schools the necessary resources, facilities, teachers, and so on, to bring the standard up to whatever he regards as <Col N="1045" /> being more appropriate than the present standard, he is going about it the wrong way.</P>
    <P>Many teachers felt when the White Paper came out that it was a criticism of their professional standards in relation to Irish.  They felt there was an implied criticism in it in relation to Irish and that the implication was that they were not doing a good enough job in teaching Irish in the schools, that the standards were not high enough and that in some obscure way they and the schools in which they worked were to blame for the fact that Irish is not more widely used in general as a medium of communication.  Many teachers reacted angrily, some more soberly, but they all tend to think that the schools over the years have at least played their part in the necessary job of preserving and developing the Irish language at all levels and that it is unfair to attempt to make the schools the scapegoat for decisions that are made every day all over the country by different groups as to whether or not they will speak the Irish language in their daily course of business.  If the teachers' fears about these instructions which they believe were issued from the Department are correct they fear that the Government are looking for better Irish on the cheap, by putting on the examination screws and by relying on intense competitiveness at second level and at the end of second level to ensure that the standard will build up without the Department having to make any investment in the personnel and so on necessary to secure the required improvement.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this has happened on the eve of the oral examinations and I appeal to the Minister to reassure not just the pupils but their teachers.  There is a need to re-establish a kind of trust between the Department and the teaching profession and a belief by the teachers that the Department will not thrust them willy-nilly into a situation for which they and their students are not prepared.  If the Minister can provide this reassurance and rebuild this trust, this is the place for him to do it and I am glad that the House has given him an opportunity to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to reply to the allegations about the change in procedure and the variation of the standard to be required in the oral Irish test at the leaving certificate examination, 1981.  The facts are in flat contradiction to the allegations made which were given wide publicity.  I had my office issue a statement to the daily papers last evening and no paper I saw carried the statement.  The standard and procedures in this year's oral Irish test will be the same as in previous years.  No instruction to the contrary was given.  The marking scheme to be applied in the test is set out in a document supplied to each examiner and it has been unchanged for many years.  About 30 examiners' conferences are held throughout the country in order to explain the procedure and marking. These conferences are conducted by the inspectors, some 30 in number who monitor the marking during the test.  The inspectors have their own preparatory conferences and the same arrangements were followed this year as in every other year.</P>
      <P>This year, in addition, a number of tapes of sample oral Irish tests were played at the examiners conference in the interests of standardisation.  These tapes were chosen from a range of recorded tests made by the inspectors and they covered different levels of competence in oral Irish.  The marks to be given in those sample tests as decided upon by the inspectors in advance were explained to the examiners.  These tapes covered only the conversation part of the test, and candidates, particularly weaker candidates, generally score better on the other parts, on poetry and prose taken from the prescribed text.  The procedures this year are the same as in previous years.  It was stressed this year as in any other year that all examiners must follow the same procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of starting with the poetry is to give a candidate a chance to settle down.  The candidates are asked to read or recite about ten lines from one of five poems of their choice.  Deputy Horgan recognised this procedure and that there were erroneous statements published <Col N="1047" /> about this.  The examiner first exchanges the usual minor courtesies with a candidate for instance in order to determine the candidate's name and so on.  On first coming to the school the examiner introduces himself to the class as a whole.  The examiner then proceeds to examine the pupils individually in the presence of a teacher or the school manager.  After the initial preliminaries the candidate is asked to recite poetry, then to read a short passage from the prescribed text and to answer questions on it.  The examiner then proceeds to discuss everyday topics with the candidate, choosing the topics which are best calculated to give the candidate the opportunity to display his ability to speak Irish.  This procedure will again be followed this year and I cannot understand how any misunderstanding could have arisen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said that he was depending not entirely on newspaper reports.  I will make him an offer.  If teachers misunderstood the tape session I will make available to them another tape session over the weekend if they get in touch with me directly or through Deputy Horgan. We in the Department cannot understand how they could have misunderstood what was perfectly clear, unchanged procedure.</P>

      <P>In relation to that, at the conference some of the teachers thought that the Department were marking too easily and they were asking for a stronger standard.  Some thought that the Department were marking too severely and wanted a lighter standard.  With reference to the tape of the native speaker who was from the Gaeltacht, the inspectors gave this person full marks but many of the teachers stated that they would not give full marks to that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to have to say that I regard the reporting in this instance as a serious lapse from the standard traditionally <Col N="1048" /> expected from newspapers here.  Young people in the schools have enough to contend with in relation to the normal and inescapable pressures of examinations without being needlessly and unfeelingly exposed to upset by unfounded and disturbing statements of this kind.  I am not concerned with the source of the information.  From whatever source it came it should have been throughly checked out with my Department before publication.  I repeat the assurance given in my statement to the newspapers which was prepared in immediate reply to the scare headlines but which did not get a mention in today's morning paper.  There will be no change in procedure in 1981 as compared with previous years and the standard of the test will be precisely the same as in previous years.  Deputy Horgan asked for reassurance for pupils and teachers and I am giving that reassurance here.  The Deputy also spoke of rebuilding trust with the teachers.  I reject the &ldquo;re&rdquo; part of that word because I do not believe the teachers have lost any confidence in the Department.  Finally, I have seen to it that a statement incorporating the facts as I have given them to the House has been issued this afternoon to the managers of all the schools.</P>
    <P>I should like if Deputy Horgan would let me know which teachers are still not sure of the procedure or are still of the opinion that there has been some kind of change, whether major or minor.  Officers and inspectors of my Department are available to disabuse them of this idea and to equip them to apply the test as it is intended &mdash; a humane test for the leaving certificate Irish examination.</P>

      <P>The reason for the delay in payment was the difficulty in associating the medical certificates with the claim.  The person concerned did not quote his RSI number on the front of his medical certificates but did quote it on the reverse side.  This led to some delay in matching the certificates to the relevant claim documents. He claimed disability benefit from 24 January 1981 and was paid from 28 January, fourth day of incapacity at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due has been paid to 20 February 1981, after which date he resumed work.</P>

He was paid a total of £706.84 for the period of his claim representing payment for 15 weeks and three days at the rate of £45.60 per week.  In the circumstances he was paid the full amount of disability benefit to which he was entitled in respect of the period in question and no further <Col N="1003" /> payment is due to him.  He was not entitled to payment of pay-related benefit as the weekly rate of flat-rate disability benefit in payment exceeded his average weekly earnings in the tax year relevant to this claim.</P>

      <P>Periodic assessments made showed that the level of wearing of seat belts rose from 15 per cent-20 per cent before the regulations were made to about 50 per cent in 1979.  An examination of samples of accidents in 1979 showed that 60 per cent of drivers involved and 50 per cent of front seat passengers were wearing belts.  In the year ended 30 September 1980 there were 8,634 prosecutions for non-wearing of belts.  While a precise assessment cannot be made of the current level of compliance, it is assumed from available information that compliance at 50 per cent or over has been maintained.  Further monitoring of the subject will be carried out as occasion presents itself.  In the meantime, steps to encourage all drivers and front seat passengers to wear belts are being continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will indicate in respect of each Garda station in the Dublin area: the amount of money that has been spent on maintenance, upkeep and general repair, indicating the proposals, if any, to bring about improvements; and when such proposals are to take effect; whether he is aware of Garda dissatisfaction with the conditions in which they have to live and work; the number of men there; if he will make a statement in respect of each station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question by him on 27 November 1980 in which I stated the general position in relation to the improvement and maintenance works carried out to all Garda stations in the country.  The position in so far as the 44 stations in Dublin city and county are concerned is in essence no different.  In some cases premises are held by the State under leases the terms of which place an obligation on the lessor to maintain at least part of the structure.  In addition, superintendents in charge of districts have authority to deal directly with local Offices of Public Works staff in order to have a wide variety of improvement and maintenance works carried out without any reference to their own headquarters or to my Department.  Works of this nature arising from proposals for improvement are continually being dealt with and completed.</P>
      <P>Because of the situation I have outlined, the information sought about the amount of money spent on each station and about the proposals affecting each station is not available and could not be complied, if indeed it could be compiled at all, without the expenditure of an unwarranted amount of public time and money.  I can however state that the total amounts spent by the State on the maintenance, upkeep and general repair of the Dublin stations in the years 1978, 1979 and 1980 were as follows: 1978, £339,000; 1979, £431,000; 1980, £538,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my reply to the <Col N="1012" /> Deputy last November, some stations are old and reaching the end of their useful lives and, while maintenance work is continually being carried out, there will always be items which require attention. Although I am aware that there is some justifiable Garda dissatisfaction with conditions in certain places, I am nevertheless satisfied that there has been a significant improvement over the years in the standard of accommodation provided for the Garda.</P>
    <P>A statement showing the Garda strength at each Dublin city and county station follows:</P>
    <P>The total Garda strength at each of these stations on 28 February, 1981 is:</P>
