    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has any plans to assist the circus in Ireland by way of tax concessions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am prepared to examine the matter, it would be very difficult, given the very serious state of the country's finances at the present time, to alter the taxation system in order to provide special tax concessions for circuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a case to be met as the circus is assisted by way of tax concessions in Britain and other European countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information available on the extent of assistance to circuses in other European countries by means of tax concessions.  As a general proposition I think aid is better given to bodies of this sort by means of grants which are transparent as to their <Col N="3" /> amount and purpose, whereas concessions can often apply in a random and unforeseen sense and not necessarily achieve the results they were designed to achieve.  I recognise that the Irish circus industry faces problems at present.  I know the Deputy has been concerned about the problem for a number of years. I am happy to see what can be done but I am not optimistic at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be willing to recommend to the Arts Council that a grant be given to the circus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the relevant Minister to make a recommendation to the Arts Council, which comes under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The making of recommendations to the Arts Council by Ministers, given that they are an independent body who jealously and correctly defend their independence, could be misconstrued.  Perhaps the most appropriate method would be for the Deputy and others who are interested in the subject to approach the Arts Council where I am sure they will receive a sympathetic hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will prepare a development plan within a reasonable time for the whole of the national park in Killarney, County Kerry including the acquired portion of the Kenmare estate; if he will employ additional staff in the park pending the preparation of such a plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter in view of the importance of this national park to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State of the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Minister of State of the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State of the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice in national parks throughout the world to draw up a management plan. The Commissioners of Public Works are preparing such a plan for the Killarney National Park, including the Kenmare estate portion of the park.  It is expected that the plan will be completed in two to three years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> The plan will serve to identify the resources of the park, together with the means by which those resources should be preserved.  It will also cover the interpretative and recreational facilities to be provided for visitors.  I take it that this accords with what the Deputy envisages as a development plan.  I might add that the preparation of the management plan will include consultation with interested parties.</P>
    <P>The question of employing additional staff does not at present arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance when Cladnagerragh pier, Kilcar, County Donegal will be repaired; and the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 485 on 20 October, the Commissioners of Public Works expect to commence work on this scheme late in 1982.  Works could not begin earlier owing to prior marine engineering commitments in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that existing facilities at Cladnageeragh pier could be classified as dangerous would the Minister consider giving priority to these works in County Donegal?  The area in question is so bad that it should be attended to as a matter of priority because the timber structures are extremely dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The pier at Cladnagerragh consists of two parts, an inner masonry section maintained by Donegal County Council and an outer open-work section maintained by the Commissioners for Public Works.  The outer open-work timber section was built under the provisions of the Marine Act, 1902. There are heavy engineering commitments being processed in County Donegal.  For that reason it would be very difficult to give a time and date for the commencement of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What time factor is involved in the completion of the works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a reply at this stage.  In March 1980 the work was estimated to cost £70,000.  On 26 August 1980 the Department of Fisheries and Forestry sanctioned a 75 per cent State grant of £52,500.  Donegal County Council had previously undertaken to contribute 25 per cent of the final cost of the works and to maintain them when completed.  Under these circumstances and due to the fact that we have a long list of public works in progress in Donegal, it is not possible to say when this work will start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has any plans for harbour improvements at Roonagh, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The design of proposed improvement works at Roonagh comprising a new pier, stormwall, approach road, causeway and ancillary works is in hands and is expected to be completed in 1982.  Pending completion of the design work it is not possible to say, at this stage, when the proposed improvement works at Roonagh will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that considerable development has taken place on the island and that Mayo County Council have now provided a transit shed at Roonagh, would the Minister ensure that work will be commenced as quickly as possible at Roonagh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1969 the drawings and specifications for the proposed works at Roonagh Point were forwarded to Mayo County Council for approval. Council engineers met the commissioners' engineers on a number of occasions to discuss these and other proposals for improvements at Roonagh Point.  The county council did not approve of the plan submitted in 1969 and pressed for a large scale development to provide sheltered anchorage.  Such a scheme could not be considered because it was outside the mandate received by the Commissioners for Public Works and it would <Col N="6" /> have proved very expensive to implement. Therefore, all delays are not due to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate when work is likely to start there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1980 the Department of Finance were advised that an alternative scheme was estimated to cost £350,000 and in January 1981 they sanctioned the proposal.  The task of preparing drawings and specifications was put in hand and these are expected to be available early in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that, despite the fact of progress having been made up to January 1981, it appears that the Minister cannot give any indication when the works are likely to commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the design work must be finished before we can proceed to the next stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything in the Minister's file to indicate when these plans will be finalised and the work started?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparation of the designs is being carried out with all possible speed but I would remind the Deputy that the design work was put in hand only in January 1981 and that normally this part of a project of this kind takes more than a year to complete.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if any proposals are before his Department for the necessary dredging of Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, in view of the ever-increasing number of fishing boats using the port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Fisheries and Forestry have asked the Commissioners of Public Works for an engineering report and estimate on a number of improvement works, inculding dredging, at Kilmore Quay.  The commissioners expect to be in a position to <Col N="7" /> provide the report and estimate of cost early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate when this request was received in his Department and also whether by &ldquo;early next year&rdquo;, he means early in the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme of improvement for Kilmore Quay was completed by the Commissioners of Public Works in 1981, following the carrying out in 1978 of a boring survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give details of the contract for the installation of closed circuit television in Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be in the best interests of this House to place on public record details of the security works being carried out at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say at the outset that I am disappointed with the reply.  Can the Minister explain how, for example, he would regard the cost of the contract, the date on which it was placed and the name of the contractor?  Also, were the materials used of Irish manufacture and what was to be the finishing date?  Surely these matters are not ones that should be withheld from the House under any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The installation of a closed-circuit television system is part of a general scheme of security works at Leinster House and that scheme was approved by the Leinster House authorities. Owing to the nature of the work it would be undesirable to give details for the public record and in any event it is a long-standing practice not to divulge details of tender.  The work is due to be completed in a few weeks' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the <Col N="8" /> date given originally to the contractor for the completion of the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information in my brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the date on the contract for the completion of the work has been exceeded by more than two months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister covering for one of his colleagues who has perhaps a greater interest in this project than has the Minister of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, then, the Minister would answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the questions asked by the Deputy was whether I was covering for anyone.  I assure him that I am not covering for anybody, colleague or otherwise.  It has been the practice not to divulge matters of security. We are talking here of a high-security business and, consequently, I am not prepared to give the details required by the Deputy.  However, the information available to me is that the work will be finished in a few weeks' time.  I do not have details of the date on which it was to start or of the date on which it was to finish, that is, if there ever were such dates referred to in the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual for the Minister of State responsible for public works not to have such information on his file.  Can the Minister give the House a categorical assurance that the blueprint of the House and the plans for this work did not go outside the jurisdiction of the House either while the contract was being prepared or since?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my question.  I asked for an assurance from the Minister, not for a reply in terms of how far his knowledge would allow him to reply.</P>

The commissioners are statutorily restricted to the maintenance of scheduled works on the execution of minor improvements which can be regarded properly as being capable of being maintained.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that a priority list for a national arterial drainage programme, which was drawn up in 1945, could now be somewhat out of date and that modern sophisticated machinery for drainage and the western drainage package could have made that list an improper list?  Would he not agree that on a modern cost-benefit analysis of the Barrow Valley it would be shown quite clearly that the vast amount of good land that would be opened up would prove that the Barrow merits a much higher priority than it was originally given?  Does he not feel he could use his influence in his present sphere and his own knowledge of the area to enable the Barrow to get a higher priority?  I am sure the Minister is aware that substantial EEC grants are available for this work if this is done now.</P>

Work on the design of Nos. 15, 16 and 17 is being carried out and the Barrow will be ninth next on the list after that.  The No. 23 on the list may be a little deceptive.  I appreciate what the Deputy says about the area of the Barrow where I live and I am as anxious as anyone about this.  Governments over the years, irrespective of what side of the House they were from, adhered to that list.  They had their own reasons.  Various Governments, including the one in which the Deputy was a Minister, adhered strictly to the list prepared. That is the position at the moment.  It may be revised and if it is I <Col N="16" /> will be anxious to push the Barrow but it is fair to say that this list has been adhered to.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister of State was not even prepared to hazard a guess when this is likely to happen and that it is only ninth in order of preference now, it appears that we will not see the Barrow done in our lifetime. Does the Minister not feel that, because of energy costs and the drainage of the boglands involved, it makes it imperative that this work be done now, to enable the bogland to be opened up and thus utilise our natural energy resources to the fullest extent?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that a list that was drawn up with limited knowledge in 1945 could be changed now?  Successive Governments have adhered to the Constitution but that is likely to be changed.  Will the Minister not agree that we could change the position the River Barrow occupies on the arterial drainage programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in the Dáil on 22 July last, I intend to extend to all sectors of the economy the legal immunities under the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, which currently <Col N="26" /> apply to trade unions catering for private sector membership.  Amending legislation to bring about this change should be introduced in the current Dáil session.  I will then consult with trade union, employer and other interests on possible wider initiatives which might be undertaken to bring about an improvement in our industrial relations practices so as to reduce the incidence of work stoppages.</P>
    <P>A Bill dealing with safety standards on offshore installations is being prepared.</P>
    <P>I consider it appropriate that legislation to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, should also encompass the Employment Equality Act, 1977, as these Acts are construed as one Act.  I said here on 22 July last that a review of the operation of these two Acts was necessary. That review has commenced.  Following it, any necessary amending legislation will be introduced without delay.</P>
    <P>The operation in practice of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977 is also being assessed so that any problems or shortcomings can now be identified and rectified by way of amending legislation.  In the meantime, I intend to introduce, in this Dáil session, an order prohibiting the employment of children under 15 years of age during the school term.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, my Department are at present carrying out a review of the operation of the Act to determine if, after four years of operation, it should now be amended in any respect so as more fully to achieve the objectives initially set for this piece of protective legislation.</P>
    <P>Legislation will be required to give effect to the provisions of the EEC directive relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employers within the framework of the redundancy code.  This directive provides for the setting up of a fund which would pay arrears of wages and related entitlements to workers in the event of their employers' insolvency.  The directive must be implemented by October, 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with points (i) and (vii) I ask the Minister to give the House <Col N="27" /> more information in connection with the amendment to the Industrial Relations Act, 1906 because under clause 6 of the national understanding, as there is an agreement, you must extend the protection of law to all people, those in the public service and all others.  Since then the Minister has received the report of the Commission on Industrial Relations which contains many excellent recommendations including the restructuring of the Labour Court.  I am surprised that the Minister has said in answer to my question that first he is going to introduce a Bill in the House that will extend the protection of the law to the public service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time why not have another Bill to include the whole lot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the 1980 national understanding the commitment was given that the Act be extended to cover the public service.  For that reason alone it would be necessary to carry out the amendment to the Act.  I am sure the Deputy recalls that the ICTU withdrew from the Commission on Industrial Relations simply because this Act was not extended.  Therefore, I think it would be preferable, in order to get their co-operation and their consideration of the Commission on Industrial Relations' findings, that we would bring in this amendment and therefore clear the way for those discussions.  I hope the Deputy will agree with the way I intend to move in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the ICTU withdrew from the commission, but the Minister is aware that each individual union was requested then to make an individual submission.  I want to put on the record of the House that the unions made their individual submissions which were excellent, but we could not use that excuse for not bringing in a new Industrial Relations Bill in view of the fact that 60 per cent of strikes that take place in <Col N="28" /> this country are unofficial.  For the three months ending 31 October we had the highest number of man-days lost due to industrial disputes.  The second question I would like to put to the Minister is on point (vii), protection of workers in cases of insolvency of employers.  I am thinking, as the Minister must have been when he spoke in the House on 22 July, the date of the budget, of a situation that arises as in the case of the Ross Company where workers cannot get severance pay. Under existing legislation on redundancy if an employer is insolvent the Department of Labour have a fund to pay redundancy payments.  However, the question that has arisen now is, if an employer is insolvent and it is now the position that severance money is paid, is the Minister going to do something about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first part of the question I think the Deputy will agree with me that without the co-operation of the ICTU on the discussion of the commission's document real progress cannot be made.  Secondly, I believe I am proceeding in the proper way to take away the obstacle which prevents these discussions taking place.  I will do that as soon as possible, probably in this session as early as I can so that real discussions with the ICTU can take place.  I am aware of the excellent submissions made by the various trade unions.  They were excellent submissions but the ICTU are the people who will negotiate and usually they negotiate on behalf of all the unions in the congress.  In order to bring about legislation which would have the broadest measure of agreement it would be necessary to see that the congress were party to any discussions on further legislation.</P>
      <P>On the other part of the question, implementation of the EEC Directive must take place by 22 October 1983, and I intend to have that directive implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that adults, either labourers or tradesmen, who are employed on AnCO projects do not have their insurance cards stamped and that as a result may not qualify for unemployment benefit subsequently; and if he will arrange to stop this practice of classifying qualified adults as trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The AnCO projects to which the Deputy refers are training projects organised under AnCo's Community Youth Training Programme.  AnCO use this programme to provide training for young unemployed youths and unemployed craftsmen and skilled labourers. At the same time the training activities engaged in facilitate the provision of a social or community amenity which would not have been undertaken unless subsidised by a body such as AnCO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployed craftsmen and skilled labourers are invited to participate in the projects as trainees.  Their time with AnCO is designed so that they expand <Col N="32" /> their skills through training or update their skills as appropriate under the supervision of AnCO's training instructor staff.</P>
    <P>Each trainee whether adult or young person is paid the appropriate trainee allowance which is exempt from income tax.  They are not in employment with AnCO and during training they are encouraged and assisted to seek permanent employment.  As trainees participating in an AnCO training programme are not employed under a contract of service with AnCO such persons cannot be regarded as being in fully insurable employment according to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>However, provision has been made in the above-mentioned Act to insure AnCO trainees for occupational injuries benefit while with AnCO.  Trainees on AnCO courses also receive a credit for each week of attendance under the Social Welfare (Contributions) (Amendment) Regulations, 1968.  These credits maintain an insured person's rights under the Acts and are reckoned for the second contribution condition for disability and unemployment benefits etc., but are not reckonable for the first contribution condition which requires 26 to 156 contributions actually paid.</P>
    <P>My Department have been pursuing with the Department of Social Welfare whether anything further can be done to improve the insurance position of AnCO trainees.  This matter involves all AnCO trainees and not just those involved in community youth training projects and any move to introduce an employment-type contract to cover training activities could have implications for AnCO's task in providing unemployed persons with training to prepare them for suitable employment.</P>

      <P>When we were debating this amendment last week we were concentrating on personnel.  Over the week-end I discussed this matter with a person involved in the operation of the fire brigade and I am worried that we will not have the necessary personnel to implement fully the working of this Bill. I was not happy with the Minister's reply because it seemed that vacancies would be filled by the transfer of personnel from other sections.  Has there been a change of heart about the recruitment of the necessary personnel to implement this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this matter two or <Col N="94" /> three times last week and said the Government's guidelines of 21 July last were explicitly framed to show that we would not allow an increase in the overall level of staff employed in the public service during the next financial year.  There is room in each fire brigade authority for a re-arrangement so that the fire service will have adequate staff to function properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be awkward but I am anxious that there will be sufficient personnel to carry out inspections of the many public places where people congregate.  I am led to believe that at present a number of fire brigades under the control of the local authorities or corporations do not have the necessary personnel to ensure that this Bill will operate effectively.  I am not happy with the present arrangement because it will not work if personnel are moved from one section to another.  It may work for a few months but in the long-term it will not work.  We should have personnel who would be solely responsible for this area and who would ensure that the provisions of this Bill are properly carried out.  A minority of owners and managers may be haphazard in carrying out the regulations and if anything happens they try to throw the blame on somebody else and that is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last discussed this amendment there was a considerable debate on paragraph (d), which reads:</P>
      <P>carry out an investigation into any fire or any operation of an emergency nature to which section 25 relates and make a report thereon to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We were talking about holding a public inquiry into the Bundoran fire tragedy and I do not want to go into this matter in great detail today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote from volume 330, columns 2427 and 2428 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 18 November <Col N="95" /> when the Minister referring to the inquiry said:</P>
    <P>We do not rule it out.  At that stage we decided that we should leave a further option open which is the amendment to the Bill we are now discussing and that is the setting up of a fire council.  I understand a similar council set up an inquiry into the Woolworths fire some years ago in Manchester.  Its findings were accepted by all concerned as being fair and helpful.  The Government have not yet decided, because they cannot until the council is established, whether they will have a public inquiry under the 1921 Act, given the fact that the urgency appears to have gone from it, or whether they will use the council.</P>
    <P>With regard to the inquiry into the Woolworths fire in Manchester, I am sure the Minister did not intend to mislead the House but I should like him to comment on the fact that the British council did not investigate the Woolworths fire, only the implications of that fire.  That council did not hear evidence as such.  The Greater Manchester Fire Service conducted a detailed investigation of the fire and at their request the fire research station carried out a number of small and large scale tests.  Later the Secretary of State for the Home Office asked the Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council for England, Wales and Scotland to investigate and consider all implications of the fire in the context of the Fire Precautions Act, 1971.  That related in particular to the planning legislative sub-committee which duly reported on it.</P>
    <P>Is that what the Minister has in mind in relation to Bundoran?  Is that the type of inquiry he envisages under paragraph (d)?  Exactly what is the Minister's view on this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not at this stage the Government's intention to rule out a public inquiry or an inquiry such as that outlined by Deputy Burke into the Bundoran fire.  The question of whether somebody was at fault or not in the criminal <Col N="96" /> sense has been disposed of by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Therefore, what we are trying to establish now is whether any lessons can be learned for the future from this fire.  The question is whether the best way to do that is by a public inquiry such as that which is in progress at present in relation to the Stardust tragedy or whether it should be done, after the Bill is passed, by the fire council which it is proposed to establish.</P>
      <P>The introduction to the report dealing with the Woolworths fire stated that the report dealt with the circumstances of the fire, the legislative implications and the lessons to be learned together with a summary of conclusions and recommendations. The question as to whether somebody was guilty of negligence or some other crime in regard to Bundoran has been disposed of by the Garda inquiry in that the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided that there is no basis for taking a case against anybody.  The Government, when they come to consider this matter, will decide whether to hold a full-scale public inquiry, as in the case of the Stardust tragedy, or establish, as was done in the case of the Woolworths fire, the legislative implications, the circumstances in which the fire took place and any lessons to be learned for the future.  That choice has not been made yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided that there was not negligence. He has decided not to proceed with any criminal prosecution and that could have more to do with the defects in available legislation.  It would be interesting to hear the comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions if the provisions of the Bill before us were in force. There are sections in the Bill which put responsibility on owners of property to keep their premises in a safe condition. The decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions that there were no grounds for criminal prosecution is not the same as saying that there was not negligence. Many questions must be answered and the longer the Minister delays his decision on the type of inquiry he intends <Col N="97" /> holding the more questions will arise.  I should like now to refer to the interview on the &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; radio programme on Sunday.  The replies given to questions on that programme caused me great concern. The interviewer said:</P>
      <P>As long ago as last July the Junior Minister at the Department of the Environment, Fergus O'Brien, said in the Dáil that the Government were considering this.  Now three months later you are still considering it.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied as follows to that question:</P>
      <P>I think he made clear at the time, the reason we were not considering it was because the option of the fire council was not open to us and it still is not open to us because the legislation has not gone through the Dáil, and until that happens we will not make up our minds.</P>
      <P>The interviewer went on:</P>
      <P>Well, if that option is not open to you, why not hold a public inquiry; why does there seem to be a reluctance on the part of your Department to hold a public inquiry?</P>
      <P>In response to that question the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I think that would be better addressed to the previous holder of the office...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous holder of the office set down in the Dáil the terms of reference of a tribunal of inquiry into the Bundoran disaster on 7 May last.  The terms were put before the Dáil but the Dáil was dissolved two weeks later and the matter was not discussed in the House.  However, the Minister must remember that the terms of reference were outlined on the Order Paper.  The fact that the legislation has not been passed does not mean that the Minister cannot make a statement to the effect that when it becomes law an inquiry will be set up.  Later in the <Col N="98" /> course of last Sunday's interview the interviewer asked:</P>
    <P>So, we have two reports now, one done by Donegal County Council and one by the gardaí.  Was there none done by the fire advisers to the Department of the Environment?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Not to my knowledge; that does not mean there is not a report there which I may not have seen.  It may have been done immediately after the fire in August 1980 but I have not seen it.  I understand there is only the report done by the Donegal County Council and the one done by the gardaí for different purposes.</P>
    <P>That is not correct.  I accept that the Minister said, &ldquo;not to my knowledge&rdquo; but was the Minister serious when he said he had been considering this for a number of months, that he had examined the matter which was debated for almost three-and-a-half hours last Wednesday? Is the Minister serious when he says that he is not aware of a report from his fire advisers in the Department?  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, in the course of a reply to me in October, said there was a report from the fire adviser.  It is worrying to think that in a matter of such importance the Minister responsible is not aware of what reports or documentation are available in his Department even after months of consideration, a three-and-a-half hour debate last week and two replies to questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all impressed by Deputy Raphael Burke's concern with the urgency and need to have an inquiry held into the Bundoran fire.  This fire took place in August 1980.  He says now that he placed a motion with terms of reference before the House on the Order Paper on 7 May last &mdash; that is nine months later.  In that time apparently he did not see any urgency about having an inquiry into the Bundoran fire.  Yet, as he says himself, we had three-and-a-half long <Col N="99" /> hours of debate about this matter the last day.  He has put down numerous questions in the House, but when he was in a position to do something about it he did nothing.  His excuse the last day for doing so was that, only after the Director of Public Prosecutions had, on the basis of the Garda report, taken a decision that there was no criminal liability involved and no prosecutions following, had he decided to hold a public inquiry.  That sounds reasonable enough because I think there has been one inquiry only, under the 1921 Act, that was in 1943, and then the Whiddy disaster in 1979.  Therefore, reasonably enough, he decided that he would not go ahead with an inquiry in that time.  The reason he gives is that the Garda inquiry was proceeding.  Although he did not specifically say so, the implication was that the Government would wait until they saw that and then go ahead with an inquiry.  But the same considerations did not apply to the Stardust inquiry because the Government decided, without having seen any report from the Garda, without the Director of Public Prosecutions giving his decision on that report, that they would go ahead within a matter of days with a public inquiry.  If they could do that in a matter of three or four days in regard to the Stardust inquiry why then did it take eight or nine months to reach the same conclusion with regard to the Bundoran fire when it would appear that the same set of circumstances applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure what Deputy Raphael Burke is trying to prove here.  We had three-and-a-half hours of debate on this the last day.  He has raised it here again today.  I am not quite sure where he stands in this regard.  I said quite plainly in the radio interview the other day to which he referred that I had not seen that report, and that is correct.  I had not seen that report, but that does not in any way invalidate the stance I am adopting here on behalf of the Government.  The Government will not come to a decision on what form of inquiry will be held and Deputy Fergus O'Brien, who was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment up to a week ago, and I <Col N="100" /> have repeated publicly and in this House on a number of occasions that there will be an inquiry held into the Bundoran fire. But what form that inquiry will take has not yet been decided by the Government. I am not going to give a commitment during this debate as to what form that decision will take until this Bill is through and the option considered of having an inquiry somewhat on the lines of the one held by the United Kingdom Fire Council into the Woolworths fire, or whether to have a full public inquiry as is proceeding in the case of the Stardust disaster.  There is no question of my giving any undertaking or guarantee in that regard.  I might suggest also that it appears to be irrelevant to the section we are debating, but that is a matter for a ruling by the Chair. I shall repeat in this regard that Deputy Raphael Burke was Minister for the Environment in August 1980&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Raphael Burke was not Minister for the Environment in August 1980 when a fire took place in Bundoran.  He was Minister for the Environment in October, two months after the fire took place.  He did not put on the Order Paper a motion, with terms of reference to have an inquiry into the Bundoran fire, until 7 May 1981, which was nine months after the fire took place and seven months after he had assumed office.  His Government considered it for nine months evidently, if we are to believe what he said here the last day, because they were awaiting the Garda report and the Director of Public Prosecutions to come to a decision about the matter.  They then put the motion on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude, but just make the point that even though the motion was put on the Order Paper it was not moved.  We all know that placing a motion on the Order Paper does not mean that it has to be discussed, and it was not at that time.  Even though it was on the Order Paper it was not moved when the Dáil was dissolved on 21 May last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">

      <P>I wanted some clarification, resulting from the debate in the Official Report of Wednesday last, in regard to the type of inquiry held into the Woolworths incident in Manchester and also as a result of the statements made by the Minister on this question in his radio interview of Sunday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to why an inquiry was not held the Minister is perfectly aware of the stance taken by the Government at the time &mdash; that because the papers had been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his decision no inquiry was proceeded with.  However as soon as the Director of Public Prosecutions took his decision not to proceed with any criminal prosecution the Government and I at the time announced immediately that we were going to hold a public inquiry.  Two days after the Dáil resumed following the Easter recess the terms of reference on that tribunal were on the Order Paper of the House.  Many of the Members of the Minister's party, who in the Opposition contributed to Question Time and to debates in the House on that issue at the time, were loud in their calls for an inquiry into this tragedy.  It would be in the public interest at this stage if the Minister would as a result of the passage of this Bill, outline even a time scale as to when he will take a decision on the form of inquiry.  Assuming we finish Committee Stage today we will then have the Report and Final Stages and it will go to the Seanad.  Assuming it is passed by <Col N="102" /> the Seanad before Christmas, when will the Minister take a decision on it?  Or are we to be placed in the same situation as we have been from July last, when the then Minister of State said that the matter was being considered?  Are we to be left in that position &mdash; of consideration, without a decision?</P>
    <P>Subsection (i) of the new section we are discussing says:</P>
    <P>16.  &mdash;(1)  The Minister may by order establish a body which shall be known as the Fire Services Council (in this section referred to as the Council) to perform such services for or on behalf of the Minister or fire authorities as he may specify from time to time.</P>
    <P>It does not say that he will; it says that he may.  The delay involved in the process of setting up a fire council, its back-up personnel and facilities can be considerable. Leaving aside all the other functions that they have, assisting in the operation of guidelines, codes of practice, research in relation to fire safety matters and so on, the Minister is giving them this function as well.  Surely the Minister can see that a new Fire Services Council cannot go in on the first day and start investigating a tragedy of this significance which, because of various leaks to the media of some of the documentation, there is considerable public concern about.  During the time that the Minister's party were in Opposition and were asking questions about it that concern was recognised and acted upon.  The Minister is obviously going to stall on the type of inquiry but will he tell us when we can expect this inquiry to take place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit to being a little concerned about the generality and vagueness of the amended section here.  The original section, as drafted, specified that the Minister might appoint a fire services training council that would be concerned solely with training purposes.  But it has apparently been decided to scrap that section and bring in an entire new section relating to a Fire Services Council with no particular task or functions specified.  It is left completely <Col N="103" /> vague and the Minister may designate its services to it from time to time. I would have thought it more desirable that the tasks and functions of this council should be more specific.  I am not sure whether this would be a council that might perhaps conduct inquiries and could call witnesses to determine causes of fire or matters of that nature, or whether the members of the council would themselves be investigators, technical people, who would examine technical data, the scenes of fires and so on and report to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In reply to the debate on the last day, the Minister accepted the possibility of a situation where two independent sets of investigators would be carrying out parallel investigations.  An investigation could be carried out by the Garda or the local authority and a parallel investigation carried out at the suit of the Fire Services Council.  That seems rather strange.  I fail to see the logic of the Minister envisaging such a possibility arising.  I would have thought that one competent body ought to be there for this purpose and that one investigation with the appropriate technical officers and the appropriate people should have that job to do.  The idea of having two separate authorities, whether they are police, local authority or central authority, going around a site carrying out parallel investigations seems an appalling waste of effort, energy and expense.  It seems that the thing has not really been thought through fully.  We should be clearer about what is intended.  Setting up a fire council will, no doubt, involve considerable expenditure of public moneys; there will have to be civil servants to staff it and technical people and so on.  It seems completely unnecessary if it is going to be purely reflective of a system that is already there for the same purpose.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that to some extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke's attitude when he was Minister would appear to have been very reasonable in all this were it not for the fact that he completely changed feet when he came to dealing <Col N="104" /> with the Stardust inquiry and adopted a totally different attitude from that which he adopted in relation to the Bundoran fire.  Either of the attitudes would have been quite justifiable.  In relation to the Stardust he went in without waiting for the Director of Public Prosecutions to report, whereas in relation to Bundoran he waited for the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions and then decided to have an inquiry.  I am mystified as to why he did not adopt the same attitude to both inquiries but changed from one approach to the other.  It was reasonable for him to say he would wait until he saw whether the Director of Public Prosecutions was going to institute proceedings before making up his mind.  If he had done this again when the Stardust disaster took place it would have been reasonable. But he did something totally different, evidently feeling that the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions and his recommendations were important in the case of Bundoran but completely ignoring the fact that they might have some bearing on the Stardust inquiry and going ahead without the report in this case.  I cannot see why he did not adopt the same strategy in both cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to when the council will be set up, it will be set up immediately this Bill is passed.  Whether it will be this week, next week or before Christmas, I do not know, but immediately the Bill is passed I will set about establishing the council.  The point was made that this is a brand new council which will have a lot of other functions.  But the point is that they need not conduct the inquiry themselves; they could appoint a qualified consultant to do the job for them.  Without in any way trying to influence the council, I think that might be the way they will deal with it.  Deputy Taylor made the point that two separate inquiries could be going on at the same time.  That is probably correct.  But the two inquiries would be made from different points of view. The Garda would look at it from a criminal point of view whereas the fire council would look at it from the point of view of what went wrong in regard to fire hazards and make recommendations to ensure that in other circumstances there would <Col N="105" /> not be a fire of that nature.  Although I am not sure, I think that while the investigation was going on into the Stardust disaster, there was probably a Garda investigation at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time the Minister replies he complicates the situation even further.  We are now told that the Fire Services Council will probably be very busy at an early stage and will probably use a qualified consultant to carry out this investigation.  What type of investigation is it to be?  What type of consultant will be used?  Will he have the power to call witnesses?  Are witnesses going to be brought before a qualified consultant?  What sort of legal status will the inquiry have?  What credibility will it have if we continue in this hazy way with the Minister, every time he gets up, giving another little bit of information on it, so that we are now at the ludicrous stage where the investigation is to be carried out by a qualified consultant on behalf of a body that he has not set up yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the section as it is here would permit a consultant to carry out the investigation. As the section stands it is the Fire Services Council who would have the power to carry out the investigation.  I do not know that the section would enable them to depute that power to a consultant or anybody else.  The point that one has to be clear about here is whether this investigation is to be something in the nature of a tribunal with adjudicators hearing evidence from other people, or will the council consist of the technical people who go along and carry out the investigation on the spot.  The section does not make clear if this is to be something in the nature of a judicial inquiry.  It may have been drafted in rather a hurry, in replacement of the previous section, the decision being taken to expand it.  Is it a question of an inquiry situation or of technical people making their own inquiries on the spot?  In any event, I would like to emphasise that whatever reports are prepared on these matters by the technical officers, they should be <Col N="106" /> made available to the public, particularly those who have been involved in the fire.</P>
      <P>There has been a tradition in the past that the results of reports from technical officers have not been made available to the public.  If we are setting up a further body at least the benefit of their technical reports should be made available to people who may have been injured or have lost relatives or property in a fire.  I do not know how this council will tie in with the local fire authorities where investigations are concerned.  Will the local authorities no longer have any function in carrying out inquiries into fires which have occurred within their functional areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities will, of course, have a function.  Subsection (d) of amendment No. 12 reads: that the Council shall, at the request of the Minister:</P>
      <P>carry out an investigation into any fire or any operation of an emergency nature to which section 25 relates and make a report thereon to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The local authorities will be responsible for the report no matter who carries out the investigation.  If they feel their own council competent to carry out such investigation they can allow them to do so.  If not, they will hire as a consultant somebody who is competent to do it.  In the end, the local authorities must be the people who submit the report, with recommendations, to the Minister.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Taylor's point, it is my intention that if as Minister I refer to the council anything which needs investigation such report shall be made public. When there is a public inquiry, everyone can hear the evidence as it unfolds. Whereas this type of inquiry might not be public in that sense, the Minister would have a responsibility to publish the findings of the council and the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the hearing of the inquiry be public as it is carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think probably not. However, I can envisage certain circumstances <Col N="107" /> where the Minister might accede to a request at the time to have a public inquiry, without going into a full sworn inquiry.  The normal machine for a full public inquiry would be the one used in relation to the Stardust fire.  A report of an inquiry into a fire, to establish the cause and how a repetition can be avoided and any other special circumstances, should be made public, even though the inquiry might not have been held in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the calling of witnesses, if we leave the Bundoran fire and talk generally in relation to section 25, this section reads:</P>
      <P>A fire authority may carry out or assist in any operations of an emergency nature, whether or not a risk of fire is involved, and a fire authority may accordingly make such provision for the rescue or safeguarding of persons and protection of property as it considers necessary for the purposes of that function.</P>
      <P>Take any incident of an emergency nature and the fire council, as here envisaged, carries out an investigation.  Surely it would be in the public interest and essential in calming public fears and disquiet that the inquiry would be public, that members of the public and the press would be present when evidence was being given, rather than a report of a behind closed doors inquiry then being made public.  Would the Minister not accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  If one wants a public inquiry of a nature where one must <i>subpoena</i> witnesses one has a public sworn inquiry under the 1921 Act. The inquiry envisaged here is different, not an attempt to apportion the blame, or establish negligence, but to establish the facts of what happened in relation to a particular fire and to make recommendations to the Minister as a result of having established those facts.  The report would lay before the Minister the facts of <Col N="108" /> what happened and how such an occurrence could be avoided in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in any incident, a Garda report is available &mdash; as there is in the incident involved here &mdash; where the owner or manager of the place of public resort is questioned as to the condition of exits or material used in that property, surely it would be necessary to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses and have evidence given under oath if one is to get to the root of the tragedy and know exactly what happened.  The fire council would then be enabled to make recommendations as to how to prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the future.  If this inquiry is to be carried out in the casual manner which the Minister is suggesting, where witnesses would give evidence at this inquiry without having a legal responsibility as in a sworn inquiry, surely the whole purpose of the inquiry would be lost?  Surely, the findings of the inquiry will be relatively worthless in the public eye?</P>

      <P>I have one final brief point to make.  Does the Minister envisage that this council would have any function in the testing of materials from the point of view of their fire safety? Would this council set up a system under which people who wanted to use different types of building materials could go to a facility set up by the council for that purpose?  As I understand it for most of these materials there is no such facility here at present.  Many products have to be sent to England or elsewhere for testing and certification from the fire protection point of view.  This involves quite a considerable additional expense.  Is it envisaged that the Council will have any function in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The council would not be responsible for the actual testing.  This council would be pretty widely based.  It is envisaged that it would be composed of people like architects, fire officers, <Col N="109" /> local authority representatives, whether county managers or public representatives, people from my own Department and from the IIRS, a wide range, and they would identify materials of the nature spoken of by Deputy Taylor. While it is unlikely that they would in every case have all the technical assistance available, and it would not be practical to hire all that assistance to deal with one product on one occasion, they would get the material examined by the IIRS, or send it to England or wherever the best possible advice would be available as to the safety of using these materials. They would then make recommendations to the Minister saying that the building regulations should contain clauses saying that materials X, Y and Z should not be included in places where the public are congregated, and advice of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied about the carrying out of an investigation into a fire or other emergency.  I regarded the Bundoran fire as an emergency but there is doubt as to how this kind of occurrence would be dealt with.  Witnesses cannot be called as they can under the 1921 Act.  It is necessary in cases of this kind that evidence should be given under oath.  The new procedure will be much the same as an oral hearing under the Planning Act. A person may attend if he wishes but he is not under an obligation to do so.</P>
      <P>Another matter which worries me is that the council may decide to pass the buck by hiring consultant architects and paying them large fees.  Will the fire council have the necessary personnel within their own organisation to carry out investigations?  Even with such personnel, their investigations will be of a limited nature.  If they are carried on behind closed doors the public may think that something is being hidden.  Major inquiries should be carried out under the 1921 Act.</P>
      <P>When the Garda carry out an investigation, will the fire council be able to see their reports or will the Garda hold on to that information?  They may nor may not; it is an interesting point.  I am not satisfied that the council will be in a position to conduct a proper investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be necessary at the very least to put in a provision to give the council, their technical officers or anybody conducting an investigation for them the power to go on land or enter premises for the purpose of carrying out their investigation and to take specimens of material they might require?  I do not see that any such power is given here.  That kind of power in the investigation of crime would under the general law be vested in the Garda.  The ludicrous situation could arise that an investigator from the council would arrive to investigate a fire on a premises and be told by the owner that he did not have permission to go in or to take specimens. Would this power not be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past 40 years the 1921 Act has been used only twice.  It is so formal, slow moving and expensive to use powers under this Act that governments decided not to do so in spite of some major disasters during that time.  If it is decided to <i>subpoena</i> witnesses then it is necessary to use that Act.  If an investigation were being held by this council and a person refused to appear and that refusal was incorporated into the report to the Minister, he could then decide to hold a public inquiry under the 1921 Act. The council will be there in order to avoid having to use continually an Act which nobody wished to use in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Taylor's point, the local authorities have the power to investigate premises and one of the people whom the council would ask to contribute to their investigation would be the local fire officer who could relate what he found.  If this council had been in existence at the time of the Stardust and Bundoran fires I would imagine that the council would have investigated the fires on the instructions of the Minister.  They would then have submitted those reports very expeditiously to him.  At the same time the Garda, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, would have been making their own inquiries to ascertain whether criminal blame could be attached to anyone. The Minister, having received the <Col N="111" /> two reports, would decide whether that was a sufficient investigation into the causes and let the DPP continue his proceedings. If he were not satisfied he would institute a public inquiry under the 1921 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us into a complex situation.  A person may or may not attend the inquiry.  He will not be on oath and the Minister may then have to refer the matter to an investigation under the 1921 Act.  We are talking about a situation in which the inquiry might be nearly through, perhaps in its last day or so, and it could be derailed, if I may use the term, and the whole matter might have to go before a new tribunal.</P>
      <P>When a Bill leaves the House politicians are often blamed for the wording of it.  Legal people are always anxious to pick holes in it and consequently we have seen Acts coming back for amendment following court actions.  Under this Bill a person may give hazy evidence.  It would be a different matter if the person called was on oath and if the inquiry was a major investigation.  I am not happy about this paragraph.  At the end of the inquiry a situation could arise when the Minister would have no option but to refer the matter to an inquiry under the 1921 Act. We know what a major investigation is. The tribunal would be in a position to call witnesses and, if necessary, to <i>sub-poena</i> them.  What we are seeking here is that the Bill would provide the machinery for detailed investigations of what had happened.</P>
      <P>I would point out that I am not trying to throw cold water on this, but I am afraid that the legal people will have a queer go at it when it leaves the House and then all the loopholes will be shown up.  The Bill, as far as I am concerned, does not provide the machinery for a major investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening with interest to the discussion on the composition of the proposed Fire Services Council and their possible ability to carry out investigations following fires or other disasters.  This is a very serious matter.  I <Col N="112" /> can follow the Minister's line of thinking on the need for a council to carry out investigations, but I have reservations about it.  Fires can be very emotive issues. Following disasters there is usually a lot of publicity, the media ask questions and this causes a certain amount of public disquiet.  Consequently, it is most important that the issues raised will be dealt with to the satisfaction of the public at large so that public fears will be allayed. It is important that post-disaster investigations would be adequate to discover any possible defects so that recurrences could be prevented.</P>
      <P>Local authorities in whose areas fires occur have great responsibility.  They want to show that there was no neglect on their part, that they had carried out their duties.  They want to set the Minister's mind at rest on these matters and the Minister, having overall responsibility, wants to show that there were no shortcomings in the services.  The Minister can go for a public sworn inquiry.  It is important for the Minister that the proposed Fire Services Council would be set up but I suggest that because of the size of the membership of the proposed council they would be unwieldy, cumbersome, slow and they would not be able to carry out the work expected of them in good time.  The Minister could have a report quickly from the local authority. He could have a prompt report from the chief fire engineer in the Department and ultimately a Garda report.  He could then decide whether a public sworn inquiry should be held.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Fire Services Council would be able to provide him with information he would not already have from the sources I have mentioned. As well, the media would not be admitted to the deliberations of the council and, therefore, there might be suspicion in the public mind which would not be satisfied. The Minister would not be able to allay public fears which would have been created. I do not think it would.  I have grave reservations about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of the materials in the premises is usually highlighted to see whether they were defective in any way, to see if they should not have been used <Col N="113" /> in the first instance, and to see if they should not be used in other premises of public resort.  I do not think that with this body we would have the type of investigation which would allay public fears and give the Minister sufficient information to help him to prevent a recurrence in the future, which is the ultimate aim.  For that reason I have great reservations about the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to have that type of public sworn inquiry we do not need this section.  The law already allows us to have such an inquiry.  Why was that machinery not used in the Noyek fire in 1972 when eight lives were lost, in the Sancta Maria Hotel, Galway, fire in 1964 when three lives were lost, in the Hotel Pierre, Dun Laoghaire, when two lives were lost, or in the Regent Hotel, Dublin, fire when another two lives were lost?  Who investigated those fires?  There was no sworn public inquiry?  There was no fire council to investigate them.  I presume the Garda investigated the fires independently and established whether or not someone was to blame for them, and whether or not someone was chargeable under the criminal law.  Nobody looked at those fires and said: &ldquo;Such and such happened in those cases and, to prevent a recurrence in the future, we recommend to the Minister that he should do so and so.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Minister and the Government of the day from having a public sworn inquiry under the 1921 Act.  This council is different.  It does not pretend to be judicial or quasi-judicial. Much of the evidence before it will be assessable by forensic experts only.  It will be vitally important in establishing the actual cause of the fire and in making recommenations to the Minister to ensure that there will not be a recurrence. This provision will not annul the 1921 Act.  It will still be available to the Minister and the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would envisage that the Fire Services Council would operate within 24 hours of a fire tragedy on the instructions of the Minister if he felt that was warranted.  He would ask them to set about investigating the cause of the fire immediately.  It <Col N="114" /> would be much more expeditious than any public inquiry, the terms of reference of which have to be agreed and brought before the Dáil.  Deputy Burke said that, within six days, he had the terms of reference of the Stardust Inquiry before the Dáil.  That inquiry did not get under way until over a month later.  The report of an investigation undertaken by the council would be in the Minister's hands within a month.  It was over a month before the Stardust Inquiry opened.  I believe that on the opening day it adjourned immediately and resumed to take evidence much later on.  That delay would not occur under the council.  The 1921 Act will not disappear.  It will still be on the Statute Book.  This is an additional method of investigating expeditiously any fire tragedy which may occur in the future.  It does not seek to replace the 1921 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is another method of investigation.  I see the need for another method of investigation in addition to the procedure under the 1921 Act.  We are arguing that in section 16 (1) (d) of the amendment the Minister does not go into enough detail as to his intentions and as to how he envisages it operating.  I would ask the Minister to accept that there is legitimate concern on this side of the House.  We see the need for another layer of investigation between the local investigation by the local fire authority and the sworn public inquiry.  We do not want to delay this debate any further.  We have been dealing with this amendment for over two hours.  I would ask the Minister between now and Report Stage to accept our legitimate concern and look at the way the amendment was drafted.  It is not sufficient. It does not cover the points adequately. I do not believe it will work.  It is not spelled out properly.  There are too many unanswered questions.  We could go on for hours about it, but that would not be in anybody's interest.  We want to have this Fire Services Bill passed to make available the additional manpower and the additional finances to improve our fire services generally.  That is in the interest of the general public.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Fahey the Minister indicated that in carrying out the investigation the Fire Services Council would not be acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity.  It would seem to me that, having conducted their investigations, the council would not issue any findings.  It is of the essence of any inquiry that having considered the representations made, and having conducted their investigations, a finding and a determination would then be made. That is either judicial or quasi-judicial.  I am not quite clear how that aspect of it would work.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that within hours of the event taking place the Fire Services Council would be on the job.  I presume that could only be done by using the technical staff of the local authority.

      <P>Between now and Report Stage I will look at Deputy Burke's point and see if there is anything we can do to facilitate him.  On the point made by Deputy Taylor, perhaps I exaggerated a little when I said that within hours of something happening they will be on the job.  The council will be on the spot and investigating far more speedily than is the case in a normal public sworn inquiry.  The council would be more extensive and more broadly based than an inquiry by a local authority.  An expert on the staff of the council might chair an inquiry.  If the fire was in a chemical plant they might want somebody with expertise in that field to sit in on the inquiry.  Their report would be findings because they would be making recommendations. They would be saying to the Minister: &ldquo;This happened because of A, B, and C. We recommend that, to prevent this recurring in the future, you should do a certain number of things.&rdquo;  In that way there would be findings.  It would not be engaged in trying to apportion blame. <Col N="116" /> That would be a matter for the Garda who would be conducting a separate inquiry to see if prosecutions would be brought under the criminal law.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (4), line 41, after &ldquo;premises&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to any person having control over any premises&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important that people or groups who occasionally use premises, but who are not the owners or occupiers, should be able to obtain a fire safety service.  I am thinking of youth or community groups who might use a hall one night a week. While they may not be owners or occupiers they may feel that they needed services on some matters, for example, the numbers to be allowed on the premises, arrangements for seating and so on.  This amendment provides that the person in control, perhaps a youth leader, would be able to call on fire safety advice from a fire authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section of the Bill as it lays down regulations and obligations with regard to fire safety on those who are specified in the section.  It is a worth-while section and, when taken together with section 5 <Col N="117" /> which specifies the penalties involved for breaches of this legislation, it can only improve the operation of safety for the general public in the protection and use of premises such as clubs etc.</P>

      <P>It allows certain people to seek advice who would not normally have it available to them.  In many other sections of the Bill it is laid down that the fire service shall give advice to the owners of premises.  This applies to another group of people who will be using the hall but who will have no direct interest in it because they are not owners, they have only rented it for one night.  I hope it will increase awareness &mdash; that is why the example of a youth leader is chosen &mdash; among young people of the necessity to ensure safety against fire.</P>

However, it is not now proposed to exclude any type of substance, though premises such as magazines, stores or registered premises under the Explosives Act, 1875 and storage licensed under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 will continue to be excluded from the safety provisions of this Bill.  The effect of these <Col N="119" /> amendments is as follows: in section 19 it means that any flammable explosive or potentially explosive substance used, stored or deposited within a building can have the effect of making it a potentially dangerous building upon which a fire safety notice can be served.  In section 20 it means that a fire safety notice can specify the arrangements to be made for the safe use or storage of any flammable, explosive or potentially explosive substance. It also means that a fire safety notice can now be served under subsection 5 in respect of any land on which any flammable, explosive or potentially explosive substance is used, stored or deposited adjacent to buildings in such a manner as to present a serious danger to life.</P>

Local authorities already receive notice of applications for the purpose of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, but not under the other Acts concerned.

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Fire authorities may by agreement provide, notwithstanding anything in subsection (1), for the vesting of sole charge and control of all operations for extinguishing a fire in any person who is for the time being in charge of a fire brigade at a fire and for the transfer of such charge and control from one person to another.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section which concern the control of operations at a fire have been the subject of suggestions from fire service interests and particularly the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Federated Workers Union of Ireland which represents the firemen.  It has been pointed out to me that certain problems may arise relating to control when a whole time brigade attends a fire in an area of a part-time brigade.  For example, whole time brigades with specialised equipment may be reluctant to hand over control operations to the part-time personnel who may have little or no experience in the use of such equipment. One suggestion made was that such problems would be resolved by agreements between fire authorities.  I feel, having carefully considered the matter, that agreement procedures would indeed provide the best and most flexible solution. Hence this amendment, which allows fire authorities to make agreements providing for vesting and transfer of sole charge of a fire in a manner other than that provided in subsection (1).</P>

    <P>Prior to the dissolution of the Dáil, the Labour Party put down an amendment suggesting the addition of a requirement regarding the provision of fire hydrants in subsection (3) of section 10.  That section deals with the fire fighting duties of fire authorities.  Since the provision of water supplies, fire hydrants and so forth is a function of the sanitary authority, the amendment would not have been appropriate there.  Instead it is now proposed to amend section 29, which deals with water supplies, so as to make it clear that the sanitary authority are responsible for the provision of fire hydrants at such places as are required by the fire authority.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a fire authority represents to a sanitary authority that reasonable provision has not been made for a supply of water for fire-fighting purposes, the sanitary authority shall consult with the fire authority as to the measures required and shall take such measures as may be agreed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment also arises from representations received from fire service staff interests and concerns the relationship between the sanitary authority and the fire authority in respect of water supplies for fire fighting.  In the same way as section 13 gives the fire authority formal rights to give advice in planning matters, I feel that it is also correct that the fire authority should have formal rights to consultation in respect of water supplies. <Col N="127" /> This amendment proposes such consultation where a fire authority consider that the water supply for fire fighting is inadequate and also provides for the taking of agreed measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion on this section of the Bill a number of Deputies raised specific points in relation to the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The 1972 Fóir Teoranta Act spells out clearly the criteria under which industrial concerns would qualify for financial <Col N="128" /> assistance.  The board of Fóir Teoranta interpret those criteria as flexibly as possible and arrive at their own decision. The Act introduced in 1972 deliberately &mdash; and rightly, in my view &mdash; bestowed complete independence on the board so that an independent and objective assessment of the needs of firms in financial difficulties could be carried out free from any outside interference and pressure.  It is vitally important that the objectivity and independence of Fóir Teoranta be preserved.  It is not open to the Minister, therefore, to interfere in any way with Fóir Teoranta's examination of any particular case.  That position has remained unchanged since 1972 and has been honoured by all Ministers for Finance, as the previous Minister for Finance will readily concede.  My colleague, Deputy B. Desmond, dealt at some length with the position in relation to the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I understand that Fóir Teoranta were approached by the company for the first time only quite recently. An outline package involving a considerable amount of money has been put to Fóir Teoranta and discussions are proceeding on this with the Clondalkin group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is right.  The issue of Clondalkin Paper Mills was raised by some of my colleagues.  Thanks to their efforts, at least a meeting was obtained with the Minister for Industry and Energy while we were in discussion in the House.  I am taken aback by the terminology used by the Minister of State when he stands behind the independence of Fóir Teoranta.  We all readily accept how important it is that Fóir Teoranta's independence be preserved.  However, it is extremely unusual for the Minister of State a member of, as I described before, a once proud Labour Party, to come into the House and stand behind what he maintains is the independence of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State goes on to express his hopes about the package.  I sincerely hope that Clondalkin Paper Mills is preserved.  It is important to preserve the number of jobs there and the <Col N="129" /> indigenous type of industry there.  This is the type of factory and these are the type of jobs the survival of which we need to ensure.  I am sure that my colleagues will have a lot more to say about this.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister of State should come here and say that he and his colleagues can do nothing on behalf of Clondalkin or anything else. There is much they can do if the will is there.  In my experience Fóir Teoranta have been admirable but then, of course, I never expected them to do the impossible. As a Minister and as a Deputy in Opposition, it has been my experience that the people in Fóir Teoranta did as much as possible in any difficult situation. I remember reading some comments made by my colleagues when the 1975 Bill was going through this House, when the borrowing power of the company was being extended.  At that time Deputy Colley pointed out the necessity for greater co-operation and co-ordination between Fóir Teoranta and the other State agencies and during our time in Government such co-operation was developed and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Whatever Minister is holding the portfolio for the time being has a duty to ensure that all State agencies do their utmost to endeavour to save jobs.  I am surprised the Minister of State should come here and defend the stand of his leader.  Until efforts were made by my colleagues when the Bill was being discussed in this House the Minister for Industry and Energy was most reluctant to meet the workers.  However, thanks to the comments of Deputy Harney and Deputy Walsh, he met them eventually. In fact, the Minister of State was speaking on section 2 while the meeting was in progress.</P>
    <P>In his reply on Second Stage, Deputy B. Desmond, Minister of State, said he was particularly concerned there was no trade union representative on the board of Fóir Teoranta.  I suggested to him at the time that if he wished to adopt our amendment on Committee Stage he was quite welcome to do so and would have my co-operation.  I offer the Minister present that facility.  It means a slight amendment of one section of the original <Col N="130" /> Act of 1972 which established Fóir Teoranta but it would be a very simple amendment.  Even at this late stage if the Minister present wishes to move such an amendment I will facilitate him.</P>
    <P>In his reply on Second Stage, and so far on Committee Stage, Deputy Desmond did not answer a question I raised when the Bill was put before the House. I asked him if he was aware of the contents of a letter from the ESB to Fóir Teoranta and other State bodies informing them that in future in the event of a receiver being appointed to a company by any of those agencies the ESB wanted it made clear that if money was due to them they would have to be paid or an undertaking would have to be given by the receiver that the amount due would be paid before power would be reconnected. It was strange that a State agency under the aegis of the Minister for Industry and Energy, the leader of the Labour Party, should issue such a toughly-worded letter so soon after his advent to office.  It was a hardline letter written by the ESB, but Deputy Desmond did not refer to it or reply to my question. Obviously he was too embarrassed.  He knows full well that the letter was probably issued without the Minister's consent. However, the Minister for Industry and Energy has a responsibility to this House and, above all, to the people in industry.  I have no doubt the Minister will say this has been the practice of the ESB in the past.  That may have been the case at a time when the ESB were not asked to facilitate people whose jobs were put in jeopardy, but prior to this I never saw such a toughly-worded letter from them.  A copy of the letter in question was sent to the Department of Industry and Energy.  I wish to know if that letter has been withdrawn or if the language has been modified?  Will we have a situation that where a company is in difficulty and where a receiver is appointed the first hurdle that must be overcome is meeting the ESB charges?  I accept completely that the ESB have a role to play and that they must fight for their own survival as an economic enterprise. But if that hardline approach is pursued by them, and if this is allowed <Col N="131" /> by the Government, it will be more difficult in future to save jobs.</P>
    <P>I am sure some of my colleagues present have comments to make on Clondalkin. I omitted to mention Deputy Lenihan when I spoke of the other Deputies who were involved in this matter.  He was involved with Deputy Harney and Deputy Walsh in meeting the workers concerned and because of their efforts here during discussion of the Bill they were able to force the Minister for Industry and Energy to meet the workers.  I hope that as a result of their efforts a package will be put together.  I do not think it was necessary for the Minister of State to come here to apologise for the independence for Fóir Teoranta.  We are telling the Government they have responsibility for governing and it is their duty and responsibility also to save jobs in Clondalkin.  We are asking them to do that.  We are doing everything we can to help them, but if they do not we will continue to remind them of how they neglected their obligations.  The Minister for Industry and Energy had to be hunted and run to ground before he would agree to meet the workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Committee Stage of this Bill.  As Deputy Fitzgerald indicated, one of the concerns we have regarding the operations of Fóir Teoranta will be highlighted by the manner in which they deal with the problem relating to the closure or continuation of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I have asked the Minister for Industry and Energy, the Minister of State and Deputy B. Desmond to give a commitment that Fóir Teoranta and all the Government agencies will do everything possible to save this industry.  To date I have not received a commitment on this.  The package the Minister referred to last week is totally inadequate for the survival of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  One of the problems, which arises in other cases also, is that when industries like this are in difficulties they are pushed around from one Government agency to another.  When this industry approached the Government they were referred to <Col N="132" /> the IDA and told it was the Government agency which could help them.  I know the IDA have a rescue section.  There may be some conflict between this and the one operated by Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>Last week Deputy B. Desmond criticised the management of Clondalkin for not going to Fóir Teoranta, despite the fact that Deputy Kelly had referred them to the IDA.  The rescue package put forward by the IDA on 21 October, if accepted, will do nothing more than delay the closure for another six or eight months.  If Clondalkin accept this package they will get £1½ million after they spend a further £2 million.  If they close in 1983 they will be £500,000 worse off in cash terms without any further trading losses.  The Minister should bear in mind the contribution this mill is making to the State.  If it is looked at in purely economic terms it makes great sense to continue it. The workforce are contributing, between PAYE, PRSI and the new hydrocarbon tax, £2 million to the State.  If the workers, 470 in all, are to go on unemployment benefit they would get about £2 million from the State.  In terms of the balance of payments we would be about £26 million worse off if the mill closes.</P>
      <P>Today I asked the Minister for Social Welfare how many people were unemployed in the Clondalkin area.  The answer was 872 people.  If we add a further 470, that would be a very big unemployment rate in a new growing town in County Dublin.  I do not ask the Minister, the IDA or Fóir Teoranta to back a lame duck &mdash; an industry which will eventually have to close.  The survey referred to by Deputy B. Desmond last week by independent consultants indicated that in the long-term the paper mill will be viable. There are problems as a result of energy costs.  The recent ESB charges did not help.  In other countries groups such as the Clondalkin Paper Mills are subsidised by Governments.  Given that this is the last manufacturer of fine paper in Ireland and that we are an island country, this is a strategic industry and one we should not let go of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised this issue on the Adjournment Deputy O'Malley said that when the chipboard factory in Scarriff <Col N="133" /> was about to close our party invested heavily from State funds to make sure it continued in operation.  At times like this there are many agencies involved and it is hard for a company to deal with the Government when there are many Ministers involved.  The IDA are responsible to one Minister and Fóir Teoranta to another.  One can fall between two stools and this seems to be what is happening to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The Minister should give a commitment that a viable package will be found to make sure jobs are not lost.  In war time where would we get our supply of paper if this industry goes?</P>
    <P>I realise that it is a short time in which to find a package.  However, the Government were aware of the difficulties.  The leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Walsh and I met the workers last week.  They were very concerned that in two weeks' time they will be out of a job. I ask the Minister to give the necessary funds to the liquidator to allow him to continue the operation in Clondalkin until such time as a package is found.  It may take some months to do this but I should not like if in two weeks' time it is a <i>fait accomplait</i> and too late to do anything. It will soon be 6 December and too late to talk about packages.  There will be no jobs for the unfortunate workers.  Perhaps the Minister will give a commitment on that.</P>
    <P>We are in a difficult situation and in a recession and many people, particularly young people, are looking for jobs. Would the Government consider subsidising the energy bill of plants such as the Clondalkin Paper Mills, given the rising costs of energy to industry?  If this is not done it will be impossible for industry to compete with outside firms whose energy costs are subsidised.  Would the Minister consider entering into negotiations with ESB and others to make sure users of energy are subsidised and do not suffer competitively as a result of high energy costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to points raised by Deputy Fitzgerald there is co-operation and co-ordination between all State agencies.  Fóir Teoranta are a member <Col N="134" /> of a committee which is under the aegis of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Trade union membership of the board is not relevent to this section but the Minister will keep the composition of the board under review. He does not propose at this stage to increase the size of the board and is satisfied it is adequate to carry out its duties.  The suggestion that there should be union representation on the board will be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>The actions of the ESB are a matter for the board and for the Minister for Industry and Energy.  I would be reluctant to comment on them.  I am concerned about Clondalkin Paper Mills and hope that a rescue package will be arrived at.  I hope Fóir Teoranta will be able to do whatever is required to save the jobs there.  However, as I said, in the light of the discussions and investigations being carried on by Fóir Teoranta, it would be wrong for any Minister to bring pressure to bear on them.  They are an independent body and it is generally agreed that they have done an excellent job and helped to save many industries.  A discussion on the paper mill is important and trying to save jobs in a situation such as this is dear to our hearts.  However, we cannot at this time bring pressure to bear on Fóir Teoranta to do or not to do any specific thing.</P>
      <P>I hope and I have been assured that every effort will be made to reach some kind of arrangement for the saving of the jobs in Clondalkin.  I am not in a position to say that Fóir Teoranta will intervene but they are very well aware of the circumstances, and discussions at present are going on with them.  I feel that Fóir Teoranta have done everything possible to save the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome the opportunity of speaking on Committee Stage of this Fóir Teoranta Bill.  I am pleased to hear from the Minister that discussions and negotiations are continuing regarding Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I remind the Minister of State and the House that recently on the announcement regarding the proposed closure of Clondalkin Paper Mills a meeting was <Col N="135" /> arranged immediately between the management of Clondalkin Paper Mills and the Minister of State at the Department of Energy, Deputy E. Collins.  Following that meeting an announcement was made by the Minister of State that a programme was being worked out to ensure the continued operation of the paper mills and to save the jobs of the 480 employees. That was quite a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>As a representative for the area and a former industrial worker I am somewhat disappointed that no real progress has been made.  We have heard a great deal about meetings and so on, but it is what happens at meetings and what progress is being made that matter.  I spoke on this matter when it was raised on the Adjournment of the House recently and on that occasion I stated &mdash; this applies to all Governments &mdash; that from time to time we hear announcements about the setting-up of new industries which will employ 50, 100, 200 people.  In Clondalkin we have an established industry, a national industry, which has proved its worth down the years.  At present 480 workers are employed in this paper mill. Admittedly in the early thirties the industry had some problems but it reopened in 1936 and has continued to operate with reasonable success ever since.  Surely in a situation like this it must be possible for the Government to work out some kind of package to ensure the continued operation of this mill.  It is the only fine paper mill left in the country and paper for the Order Paper and all other documents used in this House is manufactured in Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Surely none of us Members of this House would like to see paper having to be imported for use here.  On that basis alone it is worth while to ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills will not close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clondalkin is a new town with a projected population of 125,000 and I am quite certain that when consideration was given to planning and redevelopment there, much thought was given to employment in this mill.  If Clondalkin Paper Mills are to close what will the position be for this new town?  On this <Col N="136" /> basis I make a special appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, represents a constituency which has many industries and from time to time they have had many problems.  I ask him here tonight to bring our views expressed here to the Minister for Energy, who is the leader of his party, to ensure that an acceptable package will be worked out which in turn will ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills will not close.</P>
    <P>Some time ago an industry or a number of industries in Co. Leitrim were facing a problem.  The then Government kept these industries in being by offering special help and indemnifying the liquidator. According to the announcement, Clondalkin Paper Mills are due to close some time in December in the event of the Government not having worked out an acceptable package with the management of the company.  Surely it must be possible for the Government to work out and agree on conditions similar to those applied to the industries in Leitrim to ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills will continue in operation until some package is worked out.  The industry will need some restructuring.  I am satisfied that it is not beyond the capacity of the Minister of State, his leader, the management of Clondalkin Paper Mills and Fóir Teoranta to work out some package which will ensure the continuation of that industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta are the body who are given the responsibility of coming to the assistance of ailing industries, and certainly the paper plant in Clondalkin comes into this category. I understand that negotiations are still proceeding between the Minister for Energy, Deputy O'Leary, Fóir Teoranta, the company and the unions to try to find a way out of this impasse and to ensure that production will continue at Clondalkin. I add my expectations to those of earlier speakers that a way will be found to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's problems have arisen largely because of the high cost of energy in this country compared with the energy costs of our competitors in Europe and <Col N="137" /> North America.  This is a very critical matter which affects many industries in this country and the whole industrial basis here.  We must so pitch our energy prices &mdash; for oil, hydro-carbons and electricity &mdash; that we do not price our industrial products out of the market.  It is probably an over-simplification, although there is a lot of truth in it, to say that every increase in the price of energy, whether it be basic costs or by way of additional tax, VAT or any other, translates into loss of jobs.  That equation applies, therefore we should have a care before we increase the cost of that item essential to industry.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the way in which the firm have handled the situation.  They were rather precipitate in putting the company into liquidation and in the way they did so.  No urgency was upon them from creditors that required them to put the company into liquidation.  It was not a case of a creditors' liquidation.  The company themselves went into liquidation voluntarily.  One cannot help but take up the suggestion that that was done to put undue pressure on the unions and on the Government agencies involved. Quite rightfully one expects a substantial contribution from public funds to keep an industry like that going.  I would be the first to support that but at the same time it is not unreasonable to expect that the firm should also offer and come up with an input for the restructuring that is required.  The initial offer made to them by Fóir Teoranta represented a substantial amount of money which would have enabled the company to re-equip with the most modern machinery available. That would have affected a substantial reduction in their energy bill.  That was turned down out of hand and negotiations continued but, in the meantime, management put the company into liquidation thereby increasing the pressure on an already difficult situation.</P>
    <P>It would not be too much to expect that the company would match the input of State funds but I have not seen a suggestion that they are prepared to put in any substantial new funding for the purpose of re-equipping or restructuring the company or putting in the new <Col N="138" /> machinery which is so essential to make it viable.  We have all heard the talk during the course of debates on other legislation of windfall profits and I should like to state that Clondalkin Paper Mills has been the happy recipient of a windfall product at its other premises at Saggart in County Dublin.  As a result of a rezoning application on their premises at Saggart, formerly the Swift Brook premises, rezoning took place and one estimate is that it has increased the value of the land holding there by about £1½ million.  That windfall injection of capital from that source, or some of it, might appropriately be directed towards matching the State input that would go into the re-equipping of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The rest of the firm is very viable and doing quite well.  Negotiations are still at a delicate stage and ongoing and I urge the Minister for Industry and Energy and the State agencies involved to make &mdash; I am sure they will &mdash; every possible effort to ensure that the maximum concessions are made and that the maximum amount of money that can be spared is put into this venture.  I urge Fóir Teoranta to that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very pleased with the reply of the Minister of State or the remarks of Deputy Taylor.  On several occasions Deputy Walsh and I have tried to raise this matter in the House. When I tried to raise the matter with the Minister for Industry and Energy as a Private Notice Question I was turned down, the Minister saying he did not have any function in the matter.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Desmond, was asked to explain the Government's position he attacked the management of Clondalkin and said they were at fault. We have now been told by the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, that Fóir Teoranta is an independent body and that the Government cannot put any pressure on them to save jobs.  Sadly, this brings home the fact that the Clondalkin group are being pushed around with nobody caring.  I do not think the Government are committed to saving this plant.  They are prepared to let it go.  That is sad because it is the last fine paper mill in the country.  It appear that Members on <Col N="139" /> the Government side of the House do not give a hoot to whether the plant stays open or not.  Deputy Taylor said the company were quick to bring in a liquidator but he must be aware, as I am, that the company early this year made us all aware of the difficulties they were facing. The unions involved were aware of the threatened closure and they asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he would meet them to discuss the closure. That was some time in September and on 6 October they received a letter from Deputy O'Leary, the Leader of the Labour Party who is committed to employment, trade unions and all the rest, to the effect that he was sorry he could not see them because he would be in America.  I appreciate that Deputy O'Leary had to go to America but surely somebody else from the Government side could have met the workers.  Somebody who is committed to the idea of a national development corporation should have met the workers.</P>
      <P>On 7 October the company received a letter from the Minister for Finance to the effect that he could not give them any money from the employment guarantee fund because it would not be appropriate. The company have tried by every means possible to get funds.  They have approached all appropriate Departments and every Government agency to get funds but without success.  They also approached several members of the Government. Deputy Eddie Collins after his meeting with the Clondalkin group announced that he hoped it would be saved and before that Deputy Kelly had met representatives of the company. Those meetings were followed by a meeting with Deputy Michael O'Leary and later Ministers of State, Deputies Desmond and Bermingham, made statements on the matter.  It is sad to think that in two weeks' time 470 people in Clondalkin will be facing unemployment because the Government will not tell us what is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor is aware that the offer put up by the IDA was not sufficient, that the company would get £1½ million if they spent £2 million on restructuring and <Col N="140" /> finding new capital.  If the company accepted that offer they would be £500,000 worse off in strict financial terms without taking into consideration any further trading losses.  Given the sort of trading pattern they have experienced in the past 12 months where they have been running at a loss of £200,000 per month, surely the company should not be asked to jeopardise the remaining concerns in the group.  It must be remembered that aside from the 450 people in the paper mills a further 1,250 jobs are at stake if Clondalkin do not get out of the paper industry and continue in the present financial climate.  If that happens 12 months from now we will be coming to the House raising the position of the other industries in the group.  Deputy Taylor is aware of that and also that this is the reason why Clondalkin Paper Mills are faced with no alternative but to announce the closure because they are not getting aid from any Government agency.  If they do not proceed with the closure the jobs in the other plants in that group of companies &mdash; 11 companies in all &mdash; will be in serious trouble.  The group are very committed to creating employment in the area.  They have given employment when there was no other employment available.  I grew up in Newcastle which is close to Clondalkin and I am aware of the contribution which the paper mills, and the other companies in the group, made to the employment situation in that part of Country Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Clondalkin group of companies have served the State well.  During the last war when we did not have any fine paper, Clondalkin Paper Mills manufactured paper out of straw.  What will happen if we have another war?  The Minister of State should give us some idea of what the Government are doing to save the jobs.  It is not good enough for elected representatives to be told that Fóir Teoranta are an independent body and pressure cannot be put on them.  That is not good enough when within two weeks 470 people will lose their jobs.  If that happens the way of life will be changed in the area.  If this industry goes, Clondalkin will be reduced to a ghost town because the whole character of the area <Col N="141" /> has been built around the paper mills which has been in operation for almost 200 years.</P>
    <P>I support the request made by Deputy Walsh that the liquidator be given the necessary funds by the Government to keep the industry in operation until a rescue package is worked out.  Deputy Walsh reminded the Minister of State that Fianna Fáil gave the liquidator of the McCartin group of companies sufficient funds to allow operations to continue in the various companies to safeguard the jobs until a rescue package was found. The Government should give a similar commitment in respect of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I have not received any reply to that request but was told by various Ministers that it was not their responsibility or that the matter is not urgent enough to be raised in the House.  Last week I tried daily to raise the matter by way of a Private Notice Question but was ruled out of order.  I am told that the Minister for Industry and Energy does not have responsibility for it or that it is not urgent enough, but if 470 people are due to lose their jobs in two weeks' time I deem that urgent.  Unfortunately, the Government do not care and Deputy Taylor does not seem to care either.</P>

      <P>I should make it quite clear to Deputy Harney, as I have made it clear on the occasions on which I have already spoken on this subject on the House, that I am no less concerned about preserving the jobs at Clondalkin than Deputy Harney, Deputy Walsh or any other Member.  It is something about which we are all very much concerned in this House.  That is the reason the House brought Fóir Teoranta into being and the reason their funding is being substantially increased under the provisions of this Bill.  I wish that Clondalkin Paper Mills were the only company that would require the assistance of Fóir Teoranta in the foreseeable future and that therefore we could apply all of the £70 million being voted towards the affairs of Clondalkin.  But, as we know only too well, we are faced with a serious situation in industrial development in <Col N="142" /> that there are dozens of firms on the way down that are liable to have to close unless they receive substantial State fundings.  Presumably that is why Fóir Teoranta and the other State agencies have to balance the distribution of the very meagre and limited funds available to us in these times of recession.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Harney's favourable reference to the National Development Corporation.  I look forward to seeing her voting for that project when it is being brought into being shortly.  It is regrettable that her party did not take steps to bring such a corporation into being during their term of office.  Had such a corporation existed no doubt at this time it could have been put to good use in saving the affairs of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  But it has been left to this Government to bring it into being, unfortunately not in sufficient time to help Clondalkin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>There will be nobody left to help if we do not do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to their securing many worthwhile jobs in industry and it will be substantially funded as part of the joint programme of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To hear Deputy Harney talk one would have thought that Fóir Teoranta had made no substantial offer, even at the initial stages, to Clondalkin Paper Mills. That is not so; they had an offer on the table straightaway of £1,500,000.  To make the point that it requires a further input on the part of Clondalkin to leave them £500,000 worse off after a period of six months or whatever is to my mind a specious argument.  They may be down £500,000 but they will have a new factory re-equipped with £1,500,000 of State money and £500,000 of their own.  To say that they are worse off at the end of that situation is entirely unacceptable.  To make the company viable requires new plant and equipment that will reduce their costings, energy input and, when one has £2 million of new equipment going in, it must make a substantial difference. That is not to say &mdash; nor has it <Col N="143" /> been said and I know it to be the contrary &mdash; that £500,000 was the end of the matter. My information is that the talks and negotiations are continuing.  I would think that some better or different financial arrangements will be made between the company and Fóir Teoranta.  I have the expectation, and sincerely hope, that these jobs will be saved, that the company can be put on such a viable footing that in the fullness of time it will increase employment there by the opening up of the pulp plant which was closed down some time ago.</P>
    <P>We should not say too much here in case we might in any way prejudice the negotiations still continuing.  I have already urged the Tánaiste and Fóir Teoranta to do everything possible to ensure that that employment continues and I do so again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In case Deputy Taylor did not know, I am well aware that £1,500,000 was offered by the IDA to this company.  Some of that money was owed already be way of grant for other work the company had carried out in the recent past.  In the last two years this company re-organised and re-equipped themselves to the tune of £2 million.  Within six months of having done so those £2 million had been eaten up by increased energy costs.  Unless the company can bring about some risk-sharing by the Government, some subsidisation of their heavy energy costs occasioned by the nature of their industry, there is no way the company can continue to operate in the present financial situation.  Already this year the company is losing to the tune of £200,000 monthly in trading losses because of their high energy costs.  Their counterparts throughout Europe and North America, as Deputy Mervyn Taylor so rightly said, are in an advantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> them because their Governments subsidise their energy bills and are involved also in risk-sharing in this type of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the proposal for a National Development Corporation.  I welcome the idea, but if it is not established soon there will be nothing left to <Col N="144" /> save, bearing in mind the rate at which firms are about to close down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had four years to bring it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with very little help from the Government.  Surely this is the type of industry in which the National Development Corporation should be involved, a strategic industry, one which any country should be reluctant to let go and particularly an island country such as ours which does not have its own supply of fine paper.</P>
      <P>I recognise there is very little time left in which to draw up the package required.  Because of that I have asked that the liquidator be given funds to allow him to continue the operation at Clondalkin. Whether or not Deputy Mervyn Taylor likes it, saying that the talks are on-going, that the situation is serious, that it does not help raising the matter, nevertheless, if we as public representatives sit back &mdash; and I am not here trying to be party political; I am trying to help in every way I can to save the jobs of these workers who are very worried and concerned on account of their age and the specialised nature of the industry in which they are involved &mdash; these workers will not be able to find alternative employment.  There is no point in telling us that the talks are on-going, that the situation is serious, that is it is with Fóir Teoranta and we should not say anything about it in this House, because in two weeks' time it will be too late to stand up here and talk about it; by then it will be something of the past.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State tell me that the Government will give funds to the liquidator to allow this plant continue in operation until a rescue package is found?  Secondly, would he tell me if he, as a member of the Labour Party in Government, would be committed to the idea of the State becoming involved in risk-sharing in this type of strategic industry? That is the only way in which Clondalkin Paper Mills can continue in operation: if the State involves itself in the risk-sharing and reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Mervyn Taylor <Col N="145" /> says, time and time again this company have made it clear &mdash; and as late as last week in a press release following their meeting with the Tánaiste &mdash; that they were committed to restructuring the company, that they were committed to doing everything possible to save the jobs. Therefore I do not want to hear Deputy Taylor or the Minister of State, Deputy B. Desmond, criticise the management for bringing in a liquidator and announcing a closure.  They had no alternative. Why should they have been standing over the excuses of the Government.  If this factory closes it will have been nobody's fault but that of the present Government, who have been so negligent over a long number of months.  There have been the examples of the Tánaiste sending a letter back saying that he would be away in America and could not meet the workers, he was sorry; the Minister for Finance sending them a letter to the effect that they could not get money from the Employment Guarantee Fund, that it was not appropriate.  Surely if it is not appropriate to saving 470 jobs in Clondalkin Paper Mills, then in heaven's name for what is it appropriate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally and my party understand the problem in Clondalkin and negotiations are going on with Fóir Teoranta, who also understand the problem.  I can assure the House that everything possible will be done to maintain these jobs.  I do not believe that any of the Deputies opposite expect me to commit Fóir Teoranta to any course of action at this time while negotiations are proceeding.  It is not as simple as that.  Negotiations are proceeding with Fóir Teoranta concerning the continuation of the Clondalkin Paper Mills industry.  I do not know how any reasonable person could expect me to indicate the end of those negotiations while they are still in progress.  It is not reasonable to ask that.  Despite what Deputy Harney said, I think it is being made a political football, which is a pity, because we should be very careful in what we say.  Whatever may be said here might do some harm to the negotiations proceeding. <Col N="146" /> I would ask people to accept that negotiations with Fóir Teoranta are continuing.</P>
      <P>It is agreed on all sides of the House that Fóir Teoranta, whose borrowing capacity to industry we are extending under the provisions of this Bill, carry out a very useful function.  Under the legislation setting up Fóir Teoranta we cannot spell out specific things for them to do.  They are an independent board. What we are doing here in this Bill is giving them more borrowing power and more lending power and more power to the Minister for Finance to make extra money available.  I can assure everyone here that Fóir Teoranta and the Tánaiste and the Government understand the seriousness of the situation in Clondalkin and that everything possible will be done to keep this industry going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  But are there meaningful negotiations taking place?  We have heard a great deal about negotiations. Deputy Taylor has said that they may be at a delicate stage.  I appreciate that also. As a representative for that constituency I am well acquainted with the workings of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  But it is important for the House to remember that since the announcement of the closure of Clondalkin Paper Mills quite a number of meetings have taken place and very little progress has been made.  Time is running out.  There is no use in saying negotiations are at a delicate stage or that it is being made into a political football. The employment of 480 workers is not a political football.  There were a fair number of political footballs kicked about before the general election and all the talk about some of them has dried up since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a representative of this constituency, and as a former industrial worker, I speak with genuine concern for the 480 employees.  That number could be considerably increased unless something is done.  It is very easy to criticise the management of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  But Clondalkin Paper Mills have stood the test over the years and have proved that the paper industry can be successful. <Col N="147" /> There were problems for this paper mill in 1936 when it was reopened.  But it has been a very successful business venture ever since and the number of employees has increased over the years.  If this is a political football there is not much point in having a debate in this House.  Will the Minister assure us that meaningful discussions are taking place?  When the first announcement was made a meeting took place between the management of Clondalkin Paper Mills and the Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins.  It was announced that evening that he was hopeful that as a result of the negotiations satisfactory arrangements could be worked out.  But since then quite a number of meetings have taken place and no proper announcement has been made in this House, in the newspapers, to the management of the paper mills or to the workers, that real progress was being made.  Time is running out and there is little point in saying that discussions are at a delicate stage unless the discussions mean something.  I again ask the Minister to assure us that there are meaningful discussions taking place and that something will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the tone of the Minister's reply accusing us of being party-political.  I said we were not being party-political.  But, of course, we are being political.  We want a political decision from the Government.  Are they committed to the State getting involved in this paper industry and are they committed, forgetting about Fóir Teoranta for the moment, to giving the liquidator the necessary funds.  These are political decisions which must be made by the members of the Government.  There is no point in the Minister of State telling me that Fóir Teoranta are an independent body.  We are not talking about some private firm somewhere in Ireland.  Fóir Teoranta are funded by the taxpayers. They are an agency of the Government and therefore the Government are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Government's commitment to saving the jobs in Clondalkin? Are they committed to State involvement <Col N="148" /> in this industry and are they committed to funding the liquidator?  It is all very well to talk about national development corporations and so on.  It is a bit like the school entry age, stopping children of four years going to school for a couple of years and then setting up pre-school groups.  There is no point in doing something when it is too late.  There is no point in Deputy Taylor telling me that we will have a National Development Corporation in six months or eight months or a year.  If Clondalkin Paper Mills closes down there is no point in the 470 workers being told that we will have a National Development Corporation.  That will be no good to them.  It is political.  I want a political decision.  I want to know exactly what the Government are doing.  I am a young Deputy, I am a new Deputy, and I was very sad to have to make my maiden speech on this issue.  I would have preferred to have been able to talk on a brighter note because there is enough doom and gloom in Leinster House, as anybody one brings in to listen from the Gallery will tell one.  We want to get some commitment from the Government as to what they intend to do to save jobs.</P>
    <P>Last week, when the workers came in here to meet the Tánaiste, he would not meet them; he was not available and could not be found.  They met Deputy Haughey and it was not long then before the Tánaiste could be found.  He suddenly was available and met these people. What did he tell them?  Did he commit himself to anything or did he just tell them that meaningful negotiations were going on and that everything would be done?  All these gestures sound very well. It is very easy to fob people off.  But that is not good enough with only two weeks to go to the closure of this industry and the loss of 470 jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister will excuse me for being a bit party-political here but I have to say that we had the Minister of State, Deputy B. Desmond, accusing the management of announcing the closure behind closed doors and saying that his Government did not know and that nobody knew Clondalkin Paper Mills was about to close, despite the fact that ever since the new Government came into office at the <Col N="149" /> end of June the management of this company were continually knocking on the door of every Government Minister with responsibility to try to find some funds, to get some commitment, some way of saving the paper mills.  The Tánaiste refused; the Minister, Deputy Kelly, refused; the Department of Finance refused.  They had no alternative when they got the IDA offer on 21 October. They made the Government well aware of the imminent closure.  The company had no alternative but to announce the closure.  So for Deputy Desmond to try to escape via the back door by accusing the management of doing something wrong is not good enough.  The management of Clondalkin Paper Mills have behaved very responsibly.</P>
    <P>I regret the tone of Deputy Taylor's remarks as well.  As an elected Member for our constituency he must have been well aware of the difficulties facing Clondalkin Paper Mills.  In fact, during the general election campaign the Taoiseach paid a visit to Clondalkin Paper Mills and was delighted to talk to the workers and canvass for his Fine Gael candidate.  I wonder did he tell them when he visited the plant in May and June that he was going to have it closed down at the end of December?  Did he tell them that there would be negotiations, that they could not put pressure on Fóir Teoranta because it is an independent board?  I do not think so.  On the contrary, he was delighted to go in and meet the workers. I want him now to come in and commit himself to helping the workers when they need his help and his Government's commitment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by the Deputies opposite to commit some of the funds of Fóir Teoranta to one specific industry.  I cannot do that.  It would be wrong, because Fóir Teoranta were set up as an independent body with their own board. That fact is recognised here tonight by all <Col N="151" /> sides of this House.  We are tonight increasing their borrowing power, spending power and the power of the Minister for Finance to give them more funds, but I cannot commit their funds to any specific industry.  That is admitted right across the House.  Fóir Teoranta have helped a great number of industries, at some of whose negotiations I was present. They have done a good job and should be given the opportunity of finishing their negotiations.  We will probably not be disappointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by some of the comments, this debate is beginning to lose touch with reality.  A casual person coming into the House might get the impression that it was the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach, or the Government in some way, who had stepped into Clondalkin Paper Mills and were actively setting about closing them down and putting people out of their jobs.  The reverse is true.  The company have triggered off this situation and it is the Government &mdash; and let it be remembered that it is public funds and taxpayers' money that we are talking about &mdash; who are making the endeavour to save those jobs.  I want those jobs saved.  Nobody in this House differs in that respect.  I do not mind how the jobs are saved, whether by a subsidy on energy, State participation, or any other means.  I urge the Minister to make his representations accordingly to Fóir Teoranta to ensure that whatever means are necessary to save these jobs will be used and that the industry will continue, which is what we all want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, we must remember that it is a negotiation which is taking place and not a unilateral declaration.  It would not be acceptable that the company would say that they need £6 million, £10 million, £15 million.  The fact that negotiations are going on implies, of <Col N="153" /> necessity, that there are two parties and two sides involved.  On the one hand we have the company, which are, let us face it, a public company in private ownership. They are not a public authority or anything of that nature.  They have shareholders, dividends and so forth.  They are seeking to obtain the maximum funding from public funds towards assisting their company.  More power to them.  It is a director's job to do the best he can for the company.  On the other hand, Fóir Teoranta and the other State agencies have to negotiate their side of it to ensure that whatever taxpayer's money is being put into the firm will not sink, but will be used to make the company viable, thus ensuring that the jobs will continue.  It is no good putting, say, £3 million into the Clondalkin Paper Mills, to find, at the end of the day, that millions of the taxpayers' money has been lost and jobs as well.  The jobs must be saved and Fóir Teoranta are obliged to ensure that the money is well spent in re-equipping the company and ensuring that it will become viable.  That is what negotiations are about and we all hope that these negotiations, which are still going on, will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has indicated that under section 2 of this legislation it is not possible for him to commit Fóir Teoranta to any specific amount in respect of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Would the House, therefore, accept that there is not much point in pursuing that proposition at any greater length?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We would certainly accept that.  I am sure we would all be at one in urging the Minister to make his representations to Fóir Teoranta to ensure that every possible effort is made to safeguard these jobs.  We have to accept that he cannot nominate a particular sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly agreeable to accepting what the Minister says in normal circumstances but I am at a loss here.  I am committed, as Deputy Taylor is, to saving the jobs and the industry.  I <Col N="154" /> am committed to the State involving itself in this industry and to its subsidising energy, and, until a package is found to the liquidator being given resources to enable the industry to continue in operation. I do not know what the Government are committed to.  What input are they making into these negotiations? Have the Government decided what they are going to do or are they sitting back and letting someone else decide for them?  Deputy Taylor does not seem to have much faith in the management or the workers at Clondalkin.  They would not take £3 million or any amount of State funds and spend it casually.  The workers are committed to saving their jobs and the management are committed to saving the industry.  Were it not for this fact the operation would have closed long ago and the management would not now be negotiating.  These people have suffered enough from accusations by Government Ministers that they are closing down too soon and that they are not telling them what is being done.  All of us are at a loss to know the exact Government commitment in relation to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I have not yet succeeded in finding out this information. Perhaps the Minister of State would tell us what input the Government are making, what their commitment is and what they are looking for.</P>

This has been done in the case of other industries but the Minister has not referred to it. He said that meaningful negotiations were going on but we have not heard of any progress.  We have not been given an assurance that the mills will continue to operate until a package is worked out.  In the event of this not being possible we will be in a different situation.  Staff at Clondalkin Paper Mills have an average length of service of 25 or 30 years and some have been there for 40 years.  Are we going to lose this valuable industry? Surely it is not too much to ask the Minister <Col N="155" /> to give the assurances I have requested.</P>

      <P>I have spelled out this situation in detail.  We are dealing with section 2 of the Bill and I am being asked to commit some of the funds being made available to Fóir Teoranta to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I appreciate the concern expressed about this company but I am not in a position to say how these funds will be distributed.  The funds are being made available to Fóir Teoranta to assist industries which are ailing but I cannot commit these funds specifically to any industry.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister cannot give us a firm commitment on this matter.  I am not familiar with all the details of the Clondalkin case but I regret the attitude of the Minister that any discussion of the matter here might hinder the prospect of a solution to the problem.  I take this with a grain of salt because under the previous Coalition I was lectured by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, when I raised the matter of the possible closure of the International Piano Company at Shannon, that discussion of the matter here would damage the prospects of reaching some settlement.  A solution was not found and the company, the only one of its type here, closed down.  The skills and the potential of that industry were totally lost.  At a later stage I was told that the matter was likely to come before the courts and further discussion was prohibited on the grounds that it was <i>sub judice.</i> The result was that over £1 million was lost in that industry. This was one of the major scandals of the previous Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope that a solution will be found to the Clondalkin problem but we <Col N="156" /> are suspicious of the Government because of the difficulty of getting some action in the matter.  We would not be so concerned were it not that such confusion arose as to who was responsible and the difficulty of arranging meetings.  It is because of the lack of action by the Government that we are raising this issue now.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 2, I am worried about the limit of £70 million.  We are in a difficult economic situation where it may be necessary for Fóir Teoranta to become far more involved in financial rescue than they have been in the past. Many more companies may need financial assistance.  The amount provided here may not be sufficient and may not allow the agency to become more deeply involved in saving companies.  Too many jobs have been lost in small companies and greater efforts must be made by Fóir Teoranta in this area.  Small companies cannot exert the necessary pressure and do not receive much publicity and often close leaving seven or eight people out of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introductory speech that he had recently received the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies relating to Fóir Teoranta.  He said that the Committee raised a number of issues in the report and that these were the subject of continuing examination by both Fóir and his Department.  He also said that discussions on these issues had taken place and would be continued.  I would expect that as a result of these discussions it may be necessary to extend the operations of Fóir Teoranta into other sectors.  Some companies are getting into difficulties because of the international recession and difficult trading conditions and they may need more money.  Further funds may be needed if there is to be a broadening of the scope of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place and are continuing and I believe it will be recommended that the activities of Fóir Teoranta be expanded to involve other sectors of industry.  That would be desirable but I do not regard the provision being made in this Bill as sufficient to <Col N="157" /> meet the demands likely to be made on Fóir Teoranta in the future.</P>
    <P>We all know that there was an increase of 50 per cent in the number of applications for assistance in 1980.  That increase was a reflection of the international economic recession which had forced some companies to cut down and others to close down.  I am sure there was a further increase in applications in 1981 and that we can expect a significant increase next year.  Unemployment figures are increasing rapidly and very little effort is being made by the Government to deal with the situation which will reach crisis figures later.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am genuinely anxious and concerned that this provision will not be nearly sufficient if we are to get Fóir Teoranta involved in other sectors, particularly in the area of small companies, whose difficulties do not hit the headlines in the same way as big international firms.  These small companies are equally important in the provision of new employment and are therefore of tremendous economic value.  I understand that 35 applications have to be refused by Fóir Teoranta in 1980, many more than in 1979.  Applications approved in 1980 were three times the 1979 level.</P>
    <P>It is very important when discussing a Bill of this type to look at the whole question of job preservation.  I agree totally with the campaign for job creation but we should now embark on a broad programme of job preservation which can be as effective and less expensive than the creation of new employment opportunities.  I would point to the savings to be made through job preservation, such as social welfare outgoings and redundancy payments.  These savings will give a picture of the effect on the economy generally of job preservation. We must consider also the effect on other related companies of the closure of even one company.  That must be taken into account, particularly in the Clondalkin company.  A complete close down there would have wide-ranging effects on other companies.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we now need a strong job preservation campaign.  This should be highlighted equally with the <Col N="158" /> job creation project.  We agree there is an international economic recession which is affecting us badly.  We need new jobs, we need new jobs to be brought in, but it is equally necessary to preserve the jobs we have and to avoid closures.  I have heard arguments on numerous occasions for the need to have a more efficient fire brigade operation, a better early warning system.  This calls for close co-ordination between all the agencies involved with Fóir Teoranta, the IDA, the ICC, SFADCo and others.  That co-ordination is necessary if we are to preserve existing jobs.  However, it is difficult to achieve this co-ordination between the various State agencies when we do not seem to be able to co-ordinate the activities of the various Ministers.  We would need a crash course in the House to keep us informed on which Minister is doing what among all the Ministers we have.  We have Ministers daily exorting State agencies to co-ordinate their activities, we have them lecturing daily on the need for such co-ordination, but I suggest they should co-ordinate their own activities, practice what they preach.  We then would not have the embarrassing situation we got at the early stages of the Clondalkin difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I do not think it goes far enough.  Further legislation will have to be introduced in this area.  If the Minister is serious about extending the scope of the activities of Fóir Teoranta he will have to increase the amount of money available for that.</P>

      <P>Should a further Bill be required to extend the borrowing limits of Fóir Teoranta it can be done quickly, but the limit of £70 million provided for in this Bill should be sufficient for a number of years.  The Deputy's point about broadening the scope of Fóir Teoranta activities will be borne in mind, though the Joint Committee recommended that there should not be a change in that respect.  In regard to Deputy Daly's point on job preservation, I agree with him, and Fóir Teoranta are engaged in that field.  Indeed, the Government are aware of their success in that respect.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, and having regard to the episode of the Clondalkin Paper Mills, it appears to me that too many Government agencies and Ministers are involved with companies undergoing difficulties. The company to which I referred have been involved with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Finance. This causes a great amount of confusion and inconvenience.</P>
      <P>People are confused about which Government agency are responsible.  Fóir Teoranta were established to help ailing industries and to help firms experiencing difficulties.  It would be better for everybody if all the Government rescue agencies were co-ordinated under one Government Department.  Groups like Clondalkin Paper Mills seldom have to deal with Government Departments, Minister and politicians.  It can be very confusing, time-consuming and awkward for them to have to deal with so many bureaucratic arms.  Would the Minister agree that a better service would be provided for the industries gladly helped by Fóir Teoranta if all the rescue sections and funds were co-ordinated, perhaps by the establishment of a National Development Corporation to which Deputy Taylor referred?</P>

It would be more beneficial for industries in trouble if they had to deal exclusively with Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Clondalkin issue.  It is regrettable that, while we are allocating substantial sums of public moneys to Fóir Teoranta, the Government seem to have no input into how those funds are used.</P>

      <P>This is a typical example of great confusion and of where the Government seem to have no responsibility and no real input.  That is regrettable.  We hear speeches from the Taoiseach and from Ministers about employment and about the fact that they are trying to bring in more industries.  Earlier in the year the Minister for Industry and Energy could not meet the Clondalkin workers because he was going to America to try to get more industries to increase employment. It would have been better if we could have saved those 470 jobs.  It takes many trips to America and a good deal of the taxpayer's money to provide 470 jobs, and to provide an industry as well-established and functioning as well as the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Fóir Teoranta should have sole and exclusive responsibility for helping firms in difficulty.  The Minister should make them aware of what his Government would like to see them doing.  It is not good enough to allocate funds to such a body without giving them some indication of what the Government would like to see done with those funds. It is very hard to find money for various projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government toi ensure that the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy are fully protected in the discussions on the 30th May Mandate on the EEC Budget and to take whatever steps are necessary from national and EEC resources to halt the decline in farmers' incomes and to restore confidence in the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Government have, and obviously had to, put down an amendment <Col N="163" /> to this motion and I shall be interested to hear what efforts they are making, have made or intend to make over the next number of weeks, especially at the Summit Meeting at the weekend in regard to this important question.  I shall have more to say in relation to their request that we endorse the steps being taken by them to improve farmers' incomes and reduce the downward trend. The measures we are being asked to support have escaped my notice.</P>
    <P>I want to mention briefly the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy.  There are three points, a single market, community preference and financial solidarity which, in anybody's language and especially in EEC terms, means that the Community will fund and pay for all common measures. I also want to mention the objectives under the Treaty of Rome of the common agricultural policy.  Article 39 states the objectives which are:</P>
    <P>(a)  to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour; (b) thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture; (c) to stabilise markets; (d) to assure the availability of supplies and (e)  to ensure that supplies reach consumers ar reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of Article 9 states:</P>
    <P>In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods for its application, account shall be taken of: (a) the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions; (b) the need to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees; (c)  the fact that in the Member States agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> That applies more to Ireland than to any other country in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Far from any curtailment of existing supports or in any way undermining the existing supports and the basic objectives of the common agricultural policy, we can see from what I have read in relation to the principles and objectives that we have not come too far on this road.  They should be expanded to reach the objectives as laid down in the Treaty.  The Commission have reported on the mandate of 30 May 1980.  They deal with the operation and funding of Community policies and a number of far-reaching reforms have been suggested.  The Commission states that there can be no development of Community activities as long as the Community budget remains artificially limited by the current ceiling on its resources.  If they did something about that we might make some progress.  The CAP and more specifically the contribution by the UK to the Community budget has been singled out for special mention in that report.  The main common agricultural policy proposals are aimed at reducing the rate of increase in agricultural spending so that it will grow less rapidly than the budget by adopting a number of actions.  The Commission also proposes to solve the UK budget problem by granting payments to the UK for a limited period to be financed through the budget.  However&mdash;and this is the important bit&mdash;should this be impracticable either by delay in increasing the Community's own resources by lifting the 1 per cent VAT ceiling or by current trends in budgetary expenditure, then the suggestion would be to consider financing these refunds to the UK through abatements of the amounts paid to other member states from the FEOGA Guarantee Fund, the level of such abatements to be moderated for Ireland, Italy and Greece.</P>
    <P>One has to be very careful about how one approaches that idea in the Commission's proposal.  We can clearly say it is perhaps the most dangerous single element of the report.  If it were to come about, no exemption for Ireland would be sufficient compensation for the dangers to the CAP which such a precedent would cause.  It would be a clear breach <Col N="165" /> of the basic principle of financial solidarity. It must be opposed in whatever way is necessary to ensure that such a suggestion does not become part of the EEC or the CAP policies.</P>
    <P>The Commission also goes on to say in the terms of the mandate that the three inter-related principles on which the common agricultural policy is based remain essential.  It is neither possible nor desirable to jettison the mechanism of the common agricultural policy but on the other hand, adjustments are both possible and necessary.  We must be very careful that the so-called adjustments they are suggesting are not in any way undermining the principles.  Another serious aspect of the report is that the Commission have, accordingly, come to the conclusion that farm income considerations, important though they may be, cannot be the sole point of reference for fixing guaranteed prices and it is neither economically sensible nor financially possible to give producers a full guarantee for products in structural surplus.  In relation to the adjustments they are considering and the fact that they are not in any way interfering with the fundamental principles, I think one contradicts the other.  The proposal under discussion in the EEC at present is in breach of the principle of financial solidarity.  Any proposal to transfer in whole or in part the financing of the common agricultural policy from the Community to member states would be a retrograde step and could easily lead to the collapse of a basic Community policy, which would be unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>We must approach it in that way.  I do not intend in any way to be destructive but I should like to hear what either the Minister or the Minister of State has to say in relation to how this matter has been handled since June of this year because it is very difficult for those of us who are not involved in the day-to-day negotiations to know what progress may have been made on what I consider to be very important suggestions from the Commission.  We must be clear what exactly is being done.  It is my duty on behalf of this party to assure the Government that they have our full support in <Col N="166" /> regard to the steps they are taking, provided that we know what those steps are.</P>
    <P>A very important statement was made by Commissioner O'Kennedy to the European Parliament on 17 November. The view he expressed would seem to be in conflict with some of the suggestions that have emanated from the Commission. However, I hope the Commissioner is right.  Part of his suggestion was that the Commission reject firmly the notion that an artificial ceiling can be placed on CAP expenditure and he posed the question of how the principles of the CAP policy could be respected, as the European Council have directed, within an arbitrary budgetary ceiling.  We must support that call from the Commissioner who, presumably, was speaking to the Parliament on behalf of the Commission. The only way to overcome this major financial problem of the EEC in terms of their budget is by facing the reality of an increase in the 1 per cent VAT rate.  This must be done immediately, because if we continue on the road we have been travelling in the past couple of years whereby various interests have been attacking expenditure on the CAP, and with some success in so far as some member states and a number of the Commissioners are concerned, that is a dangerous situation for a Community as a whole.  We must remember that Europe hangs together on what is its only developed policy, that is, the CAP.  Therefore, this policy should be adequately financed.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to suggest that the CAP can be cut, thereby enabling some funds to be used for the development of other policies whether these be social, regional or any other.  We should not be asked to solve the British budgetary problems by way of contributions from other member states, particularly by way of the CAP or by way of a return of justifiable FEOGA receipts under the CAP.  It is important, too, to note the percentage cost of the CAP in terms of the over-all budget.  In 1979 the figure was 74 per cent.  In 1981 it was 64 per cent and in 1982 it is expected to be about 61 per cent.  This is taking everything into account that can in any way be related to agriculture, but in reality the cost of the CAP budget is <Col N="167" /> less than 50 per cent of total expenditure. The CAP represents only 0.4 per cent of EEC gross domestic product.  These are the figures that we who are concerned particularly about the CAP must put forward. We must ensure that the other member states realise fully what is happening and what some member states are trying to bring about.  What they are trying to do cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.  I take this opportunity of urging the Taoiseach who will be representing us at the Heads of State meeting this week to make these points crystal clear to the other member states. I am confident that he will have support in this regard from many other member states.  I urge the Minister and his representatives to ensure at the Agricultural Council that the fundamental principles of the CAP are not affected in any way. The Irish Government cannot accept the approach as outlined in that part of the Commission's proposals which are being discussed now at the Council.  Instead, we must seek ways and means of ensuring that more and not less money is made available from the EEC through the CAP or through special measures to which I shall refer shortly.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the second part of the motion in which we urge the Government to take whatever steps are necessary in terms of national and EEC resources to halt the decline in farm incomes and to restore confidence to the agricultural sector.  The word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; in this context is of paramount importance.  If there is no confidence in the future of agriculture within the terms of the CAP we shall not have the great development for which we have the potential within our agricultural industry. One might ask why we need additional measures here at home and supplementary measures in the EEC in addition to normal price fixing.  The first factor is one for which there is not too much sympathy in Europe.  This is our level of inflation. Consistently the level of our market prices is much lower than the levels which apply in the other member states.  There is the question, too, of the level of our production compared with the situation <Col N="168" /> in the other member states and in addition there is the factor of our distance from the main markets and the fact that 70 to 80 per cent of our produce must be exported.  All of these factors are very relevant and in addition there is the question of the importance of Irish agriculture to over-all economy.  During my time in office I found that factor to have significant results with other member states, none of which is in the same position.</P>
    <P>Regarding inflation, the problem is that, even leaving this factor aside for the moment, we should be in a position to have presented to the EEC by now a series of measures for consideration by them.  I am not referring to some of the measures that were announced by me as Minister and which have not been concluded by the present Minister.  I am talking about measures additional to those and which should be put forward for special consideration between now and the price-fixing date.  Calls are being made by various organisations for the Taoiseach to embark on a tour of European capitals.</P>
    <P>All the heads of state will be together this week.  Will the Irish be putting the case for special treatment to offset the proposals which are being discussed in this mandate?  That is the time to start presenting those proposals and to make the position quite clear to the heads of Government that we need over and above what will result from the price fixing in the months ahead.  It is important that the Taoiseach make this quite clear at the meeting of the heads of state.</P>
    <P>When we concluded the price fixing for 1981 last April we had a special package of measures in addition to the 14 per cent increase, and we also had a commitment from the Council to present a further package of measures before 15 July, which were concluded since then, perhaps not on the lines which were intended last March.  There is another element which leaves the door open for the Minister and the Government, a wording which was prepared on the night of the fixing of the prices early last April by the President of the Commission, Mr. Thorn, to enable us to accept what was being offered that night.  He said that the commission had undertaken to study other <Col N="169" /> methods of assisting in social and other problems resulting from a fall in incomes in the agricultural sector, which is of particular importance to the Irish economy. They are not my words.  They are the words of the President of the Commission written out by him and accepted by me in addition to others which we added ourselves.</P>
    <P>What action has been taken on those since last April?  If no action has been taken, now is the time to present this case once again with substantial proposals for special consideration by the Commission. Those words of the President of the Commission were accepted by the Commission and by the Council.  The Minister must look for ways of giving special assistance to Ireland because of distance of markets and market prices generally.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways to do this. We had already put some of those suggestions forward.  The Minister can say we did not make much progress on them. I am the first to accept that we did not make as much progress as we would have liked.  Some of them were agreed but others which can have a substantial impact on the incomes of farmers were presented this time last year to the EEC Commission by me.</P>
    <P>An example is an extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme, which will cost a lot of money but is a way to use the existing mechanisms within the EEC to assist the farming income situation here. The whole country would be designated as a disadvantaged area.  Consideration should also be given, because of the distance we are from the main markets, to a transport subsidy.  We should also look for exemptions of the various levies, the co-responsibility levy, particularly, on milk production.</P>
    <P>I am rather amused to find that the Commission still come forward with a proposal for a super levy on milk which was defeated successfully on two occasions by us in 1980 and 1981.  It was virtually wiped out altogether this year, but they have come back with it.  I do not believe there is any possibility of acceptance of a super levy within the Community. An Irish Government can never accept that.  There is also the suggestion <Col N="170" /> which we put forward which is now part of the Commission proposals about farm incomes generally, that is, that in certain circumstances direct income supplements should be considered.</P>
    <P>There are numerous ways in which the Minister and the Government should assist the farming community at EEC level.  Inflation is one of our biggest problems. The Government in the July budget increased the inflation rate by 5 per cent by the measures introduced then.  The proposals they are considering at the moment for presentation in the January budget will add a further 5 to 8 per cent to the rate of inflation.  The Minister is now smiling.  Does he not agree with the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <P>It is the same as we said last week.  There is too much disagreement on the Government side about what it is.  Whatever the figure is it is taking hundreds of millions of pounds from farmers' incomes.  An increase of 1 per cent in the rate of inflation takes £15 million out of farming incomes.  If we give the Government 5 per cent in July and 5 per cent in January that is £150 million, but no statement has been made by the Minister or any other Minister, notwithstanding the fact that many of them are running around the country talking about new measures that will be introduced for Irish agriculture about which we have not heard yet from the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister last Thursday night said he was not prepared to talk about particular proposals on a television programme I had the honour to be on with him.  The following day a Minister of State, who was not connected in any way with the Department of Agriculture, came forward and announced the scheme.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister know what is happening?  Is he being told what is the Government's view on agricultural support measures?  I want to <Col N="171" /> refer to additional resources to overcome the serious financial difficulties of a number of farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture is on record as saying we knew of this problem and we did not take any action.  We not only took action, we got the 5 per cent interest subsidy from the EEC and we gave a commitment for the 5 per cent national scheme for interest subsidies for the other categories.  It has not been introduced yet by the present Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister of State sitting beside him on the day the budget was introduced said he wanted this introduced the first week in September or earlier if possible.  He said he had completed discussions and negotiations with the Banks and he hoped to announce it the first week in September or earlier if possible.  That has not been announced yet.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Minister of State have criticised us for not taking steps in this regard.  The Deputy sitting beside me, Deputy Smith, who was Minister of State, had already met the banking and financial institutions regarding this particular question.  I am sure those who subsequently continued those discussions had all the information from those meetings. They were able to find some documents on other matters which they thought helped their case but they conveniently did not allow us the credit for having set the scene for something we hoped would have been introduced last June or July at the latest.  We are now at the end of November but nothing has come forward on that particular measure.</P>
      <P>Another item mentioned in May was the calf heifer scheme which is fundamental to a very serious problem in the agricultural sector at present, that is, the drop in stock numbers, particularly in the breeding herd.  It is now the end of November but that scheme has not been introduced.  A full year has been lost.  We negotiated regarding expenditure for the pre-movement test as part of the EEC package but that has not been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can see what the Government were about in the summer months and until the autumn.  They had made up their <Col N="172" /> minds that, contrary to what they had been saying in the election campaign, they would not give any support to the agricultural sector.  After the meeting in October of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance with the farming organisations, they said quite clearly they did not have any money, that they would have to respect the policy of the Government to reduce inflation and protect the common agricultural policy before they would provide any additional resources for the agricultural community.  That confirmed what the Minister said in September when he said the Government would not be in a position to compensate farmers for the drop in income.</P>
    <P>This is what has led to anger in the farming community.  They knew that very serious matters had to be dealt with in Europe regarding the EEC mandate and the CAP.  They knew that actions taken by the Government in July had increased inflation and reduced their incomes. They heard the statement of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government after the meeting with the farming organisations which said, in effect, &ldquo;Sorry, we know you have a problem but we can do nothing about it&rdquo;.  That caused tremendous anger in the farming community and led them to a protest on which no farmer was anxious to embark.  However, they had no alternative when they considered the statements of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that we realise the difficulties of Irish farmers.  It is vital that we give them the confidence they need to overcome these dreadful difficulties. They have to be reassured that there is a Minister and a Government willing to help them in the difficult times they have to face, not just a Government who are increasing the rate of inflation for farmers without any compensation from here or Brussels and thus reducing their incomes.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister on numerous occasions refer to the extra £70 million he and his Government have put into agriculture since they took office.  We have had one Supplementary Estimate in July and there is another Supplementary Estimate pending in the next few days.  I will give an example of what was contained in the first Supplementary Estimate <Col N="173" /> of £35 million.  This Government had absolutely nothing to do with that.  It was to pay for a winter fodder scheme, for aid for the seed potato industry which the Minister does not particularly like, it covers subsidies on milk and dairy produce amounting to £11 million, as well as a programme of special measures covering the AI subsidy, winter schemes and so on.  It also covered the discontinuance of the levy on bovine disease eradication. This Government did not introduce any of those measures.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question last week, the Minister for Finance gave details of the cuts in expenditure the Government have proposed in various Departments.  In respect of agriculture the saving amounts to £7.96 million.  The main heads under which this saving will be made are staff cuts, intervention expenses and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I do not know what all of this means because we still have not been told how it will operate, with the exception of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  In the budget in July the Minister told us he was making available an additional £8 million for agriculture &mdash;a sum of £6 million to finance the national 5 per cent interest subsidy, which has not been introduced as yet, and £2,500,000 for the increase in sheep headage payments.</P>
    <P>What the Minister did not tell the Dáil, and what is now becoming apparent, is that the restrictions they imposed on the limit of headage grants a person may receive, and the calculation that combines sheep and cattle headage payments, comprises part of the £8 million being saved in the Department of Agriculture. The fact is that in July the Government, in an attempt to show that they were trying to help agriculture and the farming community, gave £8,500,000, but at the same time they had obviously decided that they would cut back expenditure in respect of staff costs, intervention expenses and the disadvantaged areas scheme to the tune of £8 million.  In view of the serious problems existing in Irish agriculture today, does the Minister really expect us to accept that £500,000 is of any help to the farming community? It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> I urge the Minister to be more realistic in his approach to this serious problem. When he took office there was a halt in the decline of farming incomes.  We had created the atmosphere for a 5 per cent to 7 per cent real increase in incomes this year, but the July budget and subsequent measures taken by the Government have totally reversed the situation.  The Minister must act now in the introduction of new measures, not just another announcement of steps we had taken to help farmers, and he must also prepare a solid case for the European Community. This should be presented by the Taoiseach to the meeting of heads of state this week to ensure that Ireland gets the special treatment it deserves at the price fixing in the weeks and months ahead.  If the Minister and the Government accept that they must do this, the farming community will respond.  They will regain the confidence they need to increase output and productivity, and particularly increase the livestock numbers.  If we do not succeed in doing that in the very near future, agriculture will continue downhill on the slippery slope.  It is the duty of the Minister and the responsibility of the Government to ensure that actions they take will not effect the long-term interests of farmers.  All the statements we have heard from the Minister and the Government have not been of any help.  Were it not for the pressure exerted on the Minister by this side of the House in the last few months to set about doing his job, probably he would not have bothered to introduce any measure or take any steps in the EEC.  So far we still have to see evidence of action through national and budgetary measures or a special case being made to the EEC for special treatment because of the serious state of agriculture and its importance to the economy.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to accept this motion.  In the first part it gives them full support in relation to the protection of the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy.  There is no way the Government can accept any dilution of these fundamental principals.  I urge the Minister and the Government to take whatever steps are necessary now so that <Col N="175" /> the farmers' income situation is reversed and confidence is restored to the agricultural sector.</P>

The implication in this motion is that the Government are not ensuring the things in relation to EEC policy which Deputy MacSharry recommends to us and that the Government have not been taking the steps necessary at national level to deal with the situation.  I listened to the Deputy and in view of the approach he has taken, particularly in relation to the EEC mandate discussion, and that we are in a week when the European Council meeting takes place, I withdraw my amendment.  I want to make the point, underlined by the Deputy, that we want to show very clearly to our partners in the European Community that our opinion is in line and united on the fact that there are some proposals which have been put forward by the European Community which we cannot and will not accept.  In the interests of showing that unanimity of view I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make that point because it is two days before this meeting takes place.  The Deputy may think it gratuitous on my part but I welcome the opportunity this evening and tomorrow evening to debate this issue because the matters to be discussed at the European Council meeting are so important that it is appropriate that this House has a chance to make its views known clearly not only to the people here but to our Community partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government <Col N="176" /> are taking a very vigorous line in relation to defending fundamental principles of the CAP.  Those principles were one of the main reasons why we joined the EEC in the first place.  They are principles which suit our position well as an agricultural exporting country and a country which for many years suffered from the fact that it was tied to a cheap food market. We do not want to see those principles diluted in any way.  That was the main issue pursued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself and one which will be pursued by the Taoiseach at the European Council meeting at the end of this week.</P>
    <P>A discussion on the May 30 mandate started basically from a consideration of the UK budget contribution, a problem as perceived in the UK of the level of its net contribution to the Community budget.  In 1979 and 1980 the discussion which began then afforded an opportunity for some member states to begin another campaign and talk about restraining growth in Community expenditure on the common agricultural policy.  In May last year a settlement was arrived at to deal with the UK contributions problem for 1980-81.  It was decided that the problem would be resolved in the context of the 1982 budget by bringing about certain structural changes in the Community budget.  At that time there was much talk about the need to avoid the recurrence or emergence of unacceptable situations for member states.  It is important that we appreciate that because we are concerned to ensure that we do not approach what would seem to be an unacceptable situation for one member state by creating an unacceptable situation for another member state, in this case Ireland.  The basis of the argument has changed since the mandate document was written last year. There has been a substantial change as far as the UK net budgetary contribution is concerned.  There has also been a substantial change in relation to the proportion of the Community budget spent on the agricultural section.  The changes have not been brought about by any fundamental change in the way the CAP is operating but by tighter management of <Col N="177" /> the CAP policy and the kind of measures which can continue to be operated and give satisfactory results not only in terms of the way the policy operates and the benefits we could get from it but also in terms of restraining growth in total spending, if that is seen to be a legitimate objective.</P>
    <P>The central point is that we must not look at this in an upside down way.  We must approach the problem of Community expenditure in a justifiable way from a budgetary point of view.  Given the fact that the European Community budget is so small relative to the total gross domestic product of the Community, it is the Government's contention that we must first of all make sure we get the various common policies right, in particular the CAP, and then expenditure must be what is necessary in order to ensure the policies can work.  The idea to which we are most vigorously opposed is the one that there is any case for saying that there should be an independent limitation on the amount of money spent on the CAP.  We do not accept that there is any case for saying that the growth in agricultural expenditure in the Community should be limited or that the total amount of spending on agriculture should not exceed a given proportion of the Community budget. We do not believe that is the proper way of going about it.  We must get the policy right in terms of the Community's own need and the budgetary consequences must be the ones that flow from that policy.  That is the line we have consistently defended and will be defending at the EEC meeting this week.</P>
    <P>In relation to individual product sectors, the proposals before us are ones which do not commend themselves to us. In the case of the cereal sector there is a proposal that prices should be aligned with those of the USA.  I have made the point that perhaps this principle is one that is being applied very selectively.  We would like to see Community milk prices aligned with those of the US which at the moment happen to be 15 per cent above ours in the Community.  We would even like to see Community beef prices aligned with those of Japan which at the moment are over 20 per cent above those in the <Col N="178" /> Community.  The Community as a community of ten member states is entitled to run its own agricultural policy autonomously without undue regard for the interests of countries outside that community. I am afraid that these proposals give excessive weight to the interests of countries outside the Community.  We must run our agricultural policy to suit our own conditions within the Community and we must then decide how that fits in with the trading requirements of other countries, but we must get our own policies right for our own needs.  Therefore, I reject the proposal that we should in any way decide to align our prices with what happen to be price levels in any other producing area of the world.</P>
    <P>As far as the dairy sector is concerned, the proposals are equally restrictive in the way they have been put.  For example, it is proposed that we would continue to have co-responsibility as we know it today and in addition to that a super levy would apply to increase in milk production over a certain rate of increase per annum.  Furthermore, there is a proposal that there should be a special levy on intensive milk production.  I reject the idea of a super levy.  It is inappropriate to the needs of this country.  Our milk yields are at about 75 per cent of the Community average and about 60 per cent of the average achieved in the best milk-producing areas of the Community. We still have a great deal of progress to make in terms of milk production; therefore we must resist any policy which would have the effect of putting a brake on our ability to expand our milk production. That is why a super levy is unaccepeable as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the intensive levy proposal is a different kind of proposal to which we should give very strong consideration. The essential intention of that proposal is to act against or reduce the incentive for producing milk from cheap imported cereal substitutes, products not manufactured within the Community which are used in very intensive operations to produce milk in a limited number of areas in the Community.  That is not the kind of agriculture that the EEC wish to defend, nor do we wish to defend it.  It <Col N="179" /> is the kind of activity which boosts milk production artificially in some areas of the Community to the detriment of areas where milk production is essential to the economy.  In this respect our dairy sector taken all together represents something like the equivalent of 8 per cent of our GNP.  In no other country of the Community does it exceed the equivalent of about 1.5 per cent of GNP.  Therefore, the impact of those proposals would be much greater for us than for any other area of the Community.  We are very conscious of that and we are determined to resist proposals that would put limitations on us in this or any other sector.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in a general way that we should in the Community set production targets or objectives of one kind or another.  In my view this amounts to the same kind of thinking as would produce quotas on a national basis. Again, this is the kind of procedure that we could not accept because it is opposed fundamentally to the interests of countries where gains have still to be made in agricultural productivity and where, above all, we need to increase the total value of our agricultural production for the sake of our farming population and those people who would be employed in an expanding food processing industry. The idea of providing for compensatory payments to the UK from FEOGA expenditure or of abating FEOGA expenditure in various member states is totally repugnant to our approach to the CAP whether this is done directly at our expense or not.  If we once allow the principle to be established, God knows where it will end.  It goes back to what I said a few moments ago, that we must get our own agricultural policy right and we must agree at Community level that we will finance that policy as it requires and as the needs of the Community dictate.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that have taken place so far, on every occasion in the mandate proposals and in the draft conclusions being prepared for the European Council when reference was made to the kind of development or policy in the agricultural sector that we could accept, immediately it was qualified by a reference to budgetary <Col N="180" /> constraints, whereas when references were made to the kinds of policies which we do not accept as being appropriate for the Community no reference whatsoever was made in any shape or form to the budgetary implications.  That particularly is the case in relation to imports of a number of products from third countries on concessionary terms. For example, the sugar, beef and dairy sectors all cost the Community money and the Commission themselves have estimated that in 1982 the total cost of these imports will come to somewhere in the region of £1,600 million EUA.  That cost to the Community has been artifically self-inflicted.  I cannot accept in any discussion on Budgetary problems in the Community that we should leave that considerable cost out of the reckoning. For that reason I object to the way the draft conclusions have been written so far and I will not accept that any valid procedure can ignore the considerable cost to the community represented by those imports.</P>
    <P>Another point of importance to us which is not treated adequately&mdash;indeed it is not treated at all&mdash;in the Commission's mandate document or in the more detailed document in relation to agriculture published on 23 October, is the fact that as far as support of market arrangements in the Community is concerned, the Community bears 100 per cent of the cost.  That is not entirely true, but on the whole the Community bears the cost, whereas in relation to the structural elements of the agricultural policy, such as the farm modernisation scheme, western drainage or the western package, the Community bears only a portion of the cost.  I have been concerned to make the point that this discriminates against countries like Ireland in that it puts the greatest financial burden on the countries which have the greatest need of further structural development.  I intend to pursue that point not only in the context of this mandate discussion but also in the context of future discussions on the farm prices package next year and other related matters.  These matters would not have been discussed in the Council of Agriculture Ministers in the Community <Col N="181" /> had we on our side not insisted that that be done.  For some time is appeared to me that there was an effort. conscious or unconscious, on the part of the Council Presidency, the Commission and some of the member states to keep discussions of the agricultural topics out of the agricultural council and to concentrate it in other areas where the importance of the details would not be underlined to the same extent.  I made it my business to insist that we have a proper discussion of these matters in the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  We discussed the matter thoroughly and had two examinations of the Commission's ideas.</P>
    <P>On this part of the motion I come to the conclusion that the Government are intensely aware of the implications for this country of the proposals that have been made in the context of this mandate discussion, and it is our concern to ensure that the views of this country are fully taken into account and that no changes are made in Community Policies that will have an adverse impact on us.</P>
    <P>We should all do our bit to bring it to public notice and to the attention of our partner States in the European Community that the argument that the common agricultural policy has prevented the emergence of other policies is a fallacy. I remember a number of years ago when difficult discussions were going on in the community about the development of regional policy we had a great deal more leeway in terms of total available Community owned resources than we have today and we did not manage to arrive at the kind of regional policy that satisfied every member state.  Nobody can pretend that that state of affairs arose because agriculture was taking too much of the budget.  In those years agriculture amounted to a greater proportion of total Community spending than it does at present and the fact that we did not manage to arrive at an acceptable policy all round was not related to the level of agricultural expenditure but related to completely different problems.</P>
    <P>There are three parts of the equation being discussed at the moment.  We have the problem of the United Kingdom <Col N="182" /> budget contribution; we have the discussion about the level of spending on the common agricultural policy; and we have the discussion as to the total level of the community's own resources.  I do not accept that if one of these have to give, it should necessarily be the agricultural policy.  I do not accept, nor do the Government, the suggestion that the Community's own resources should continue indefinitely to be limited to the present 1 per cent VAT level.  We will ensure this point is properly taken up during the European Council discussions next week.</P>
    <P>In this motion we are called upon to take whatever steps are necessary to halt the decline in farmers' incomes and to restore confidence in the agricultural sector. I want to say what the situation is, and how agriculture got into this problem. In 1977 farm incomes grew by 39 per cent.  Since 1978 we have seen a decline in farm incomes.  We now have a situation where, according to the most recent forecast available to me, we will see a further decline in farm incomes this year &mdash; the third year running in which there has been a real decline in farm family incomes, before taking account of interest payments.  That happened during a period which saw the imposition on the agricultural sector of a number of new levies &mdash; the infamous 2 per cent levy and the disease eradication levy.  It is ironic that the Opposition should be putting forward complaints about what has or has not been happening in relation to farm incomes this year, while in previous years under their mismanagement we have seen that kind of decline in farm incomes.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to have implemented the kind of policies that will make a real difference to the farming community, policies we can operate at national and European levels.  I would like to remind the House of the measures we have taken since last July.  We increased total payments under the sheep headage scheme.  We provided finance for the EEC interest subsidy scheme, which is now in operation.  We reduced the rate of VAT in contractors charges from 10 per cent to 3 per cent.  We increased the flat rate payback for unregistered farmers in relation to VAT from 1 per cent to 1½per <Col N="183" /> cent, in other words an amount which offsets the extra VAT falling on farmers through the increase in the VAT which we had to bring in in the July budget.  We have already taken a number of measures that will affect farm incomes this year and that will ensure at least that the decline in farm incomes this year is not as much as it would have been had we not taken action in the July budget.</P>
    <P>To pretend in April this year that there was a real prospect there would be an increase in real farm incomes and that what we have done in the meantime is to reverse that situation, is nonsensical. That is not borne out by any of the facts nor has it been borne out by anything that has happened in the meantime.  The situation is the reverse.  We have brought into operation a number of measures which will help partly to offset the decline in farm incomes which would have happened had we not taken any action.</P>
    <P>There are three things which have most affected farm incomes.  It is common knowledge that the present difficulties in relation to farm incomes arise from a high level of inflation over a period of years, because farm prices have not increased as rapidly as the prices of farm inputs, and we have had a fall in net farm output. We are aiming to bring forward measures that will counter these developments and that will give our farming community some hope of getting out of the price costs squeeze to which they have been subjected.</P>
    <P>An immediate measure we are bringing into operation from 1 December is the 5 per cent national interest subsidy, to which I referred on previous occasions, on interest outstanding on loans in respect of eligible investments.  This will be broadly on the same terms as the EEC interest subsidy and the maximum amount of loan to which the scheme will apply will be £50,000 per farm.  As from 1 December we will have in operation a scheme of national interest subsidy parallel to the EEC interest subsidy which will put non-development farmers operating under the farm modernisation scheme on the same footing as regards their interest repayments as those development <Col N="184" /> farmers who already benefited from the EEC scheme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other measures in preparation.  Deputy MacSharry referred to a number of measures which he announced last May but which by the time he left office he had not got clear with the European Community authorities in Brussels.  These are the aid to this year's second time silage-makers, aid for one ton of fertiliser per farm and the calf-heifer subsidy which Deputy MacSharry announced it was his intention to operate and which we have modified. Those schemes were not cleared.  I am happy to say that since I took office I have been negotiating those three schemes with the Community authorities and we have made very little progress in that respect.  I hope before very long that I will be able to announce final clearance of those schemes by the Commission.  In this way we will have underlined again this Government's commitment to the kind of measures we need to turn around our very serious agricultural situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry proposed that at the European Council meeting this week we should come forward with a series of proposals for special measures to assist this country.  I do not disagree with the notion that we do need special measures to assist this country, particularly from European Community sources but I should like the Deputy to reflect on the wisdom of going into the kind of discussion we are going to have at the end of this week.  It will be a difficult discussion and we will be defending our own basic interests in relation to the CAP.  Can the Deputy imagine what the situation would be if we went into that discussion with a new shopping list of measures and said not only must they not operate the type of proposals before them but they must now go along and have extra special measures?  The point is that we must first win the argument that will take place at the end of the week and then we will come along at the due time and when the tactics ensure that it is the right thing to do and request not only the price increase we want to see at European level but also further special measures we need to see taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> The Deputy has mentioned some of the special measures he had in mind and which he knows were turned down. There are other special measures we can examine and will put forward when we clear the discussion that has to take place at the end of the week.  I have just reviewed the items raised in the Deputy's motion and I should like to conclude by saying that the argument that will take place at the end of the week is such an important one that I believe it is opportune for the House to be able to show now that we are unanimous in the approach we are adopting to that discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion tabled by Deputy MacSharry.  My main purpose in speaking is to bring home to the Minister how vital a task he has as Ireland's Minister for Agriculture at EEC level and at home.  I got the feeling from the remarks of the Minister that he is still much more a European than he is an Irishman.  He devoted more than 20 minutes of his contribution to the common agricultural policy and what is happening in Europe and he has shown a remarkable reluctance to use his influence as a politician when he goes abroad rather than being a member of a commission that is hide-bound by certain codes of behaviour.  However, the desperate plight and despair of Irish farming does not seem to have percolated to certain levels of Coalition thinking.  We must act now to help to restore confidence in Irish farming.  I agree that the corner-stone of Irish farming is the common agricultural policy and on that depends the whole future of farming here.  If one wanted one good reason more than any other why we encouraged people to join the EEC it would be for the good of agriculture and for Ireland's good also. Since our entry to the EEC we have proved to be good Europeans.  We are committed to the ideals of the founder fathers of the Community and we have been good Irishmen too.  There should not be a conflict of interest between being a good Irishman and a good European. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that as a Deputy for Kildare he does not <Col N="186" /> have any difficulty in being a good Kildare representative, I hope, and a good Member of the House.  He should not be deterred in any way in pressing Kildare's case at Cabinet level and I am sure it will not prevent him from pressing Ireland's case very forcefully at European level.</P>
      <P>When a Minister goes to Europe he is our guardian of the common agricultural policy and he is expected to respond to the pressures that are greater than ever on the policy.  It is under constant attack from many sides.  The only two member states that are 100 per cent behind the CAP are Ireland and France and that is generally admitted.  During my stay in Europe I belonged to the European Progressive Democrats which was made up of Ireland, France and a Danish member and that group fully supported the CAP. However, I see a distinct conflict of interests in other bodies, particularly in socialist groupings.  Some gave it lukewarm support and even now Germany feels that she has been carrying the can for too long.  It is important that the Minister emphasise the need for give and take in any community and that big industrial countries got benefits elsewhere.  Our only hope of getting a trick in this game is to get something for agriculture.  We do not hear any talk of a milk lake or of butter mountains.  That problem appears to have disappeared but there is still talk of levies, including a co-responsibility levy.  I am glad that the Minister has said he will resist this.  We are not responsible for any increase in milk production.  Our milk output has decreased in the last year from £542,000,000 to £539,000,000 in value.  I have heard it said that output has decreased by 1 per cent and that Denmark is the only other country in a similar position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no responsibility for the factory type of farming that exists in Rotterdam and other places and has resulted in milk lakes, if they are there.  Those responsible should pay.  It is important that people realise how Irish farming responded to EEC conditions and demands.  From 1970 to 1979 we increased the value of our milk output by almost seven times.  That is a fantastic achievement.  It may include some inflation <Col N="187" /> but it shows above anything else productivity and an effort by our dairy industry.  Had any other industry achieved such targets those responsible would have been declared men of the year or men of the decade but we seem to take it for granted that farming can expand to that extent.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should be conscious of the shift of the balance of influence within the EEC from the North Atlantic to the Mediterranean countries. Since the advent of Greece into the Community and the impending adhesion of Spain and Portugal, Europe will be much more emphatic about the needs of the Mediterranean countries.  The voice of Italy will have stronger backing and there will be talk of special measures for olive oil, fruit and vegetables.  Those countries will be looking for a bigger slice of the cake.  It is vital that Ireland's problem be solved now and that the future of Irish agriculture be placed on a sound basis before southern European pressures help to dilute the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The question of quotas and levies has been raised.  Quotas are fine for highly developed countries.  Some other member states have had a 20 year start on us in the EEC and centuries of a start on us as far as the shaping of national destiny is concerned.  At the time of our entry we were a developing country and we are still.  Even today our milk yields are only three-quarters of the EEC average. Admittedly, we have the best climate for growing grass.  We have the mildest climate within the Community and even now at the end of November I am sure the majority of our dairy herd is still out at night.  Farmers in other countries could not do that.  When Ireland's future as far as the fishing industry is concerned was being discussed we got a commitment under The Hague Agreement that as a developing country Ireland would be allowed to double its catch up to 1980 and after that there would be annual increments to enable it to keep pace and catch up.  The same case could be made for developing an infant agricultural industry here.  We should be allowed firstly to reach our national potential <Col N="188" /> before any restrictions are placed on us. There should not be any talk as far as we are concerned of levies or quotas until we have reached our national potential.</P>
    <P>For instance, since our entry into the EEC, we have drained 500,000 acres of land.  There will be much more to be done under the western package although I would despair for our constituency in view of the answer I received today with regard to the Barrow valley.  Even so, huge tracts of arable land will become available but what will we do with them if we are saddled with quotas or levies? We must be able to see ahead in agriculture. We must ensure that these areas of new land that become available to us will be in full production.  We must have a market in the EEC for our produce at a guaranteed price.  We do not want to hear any talk of slumps or gluts.  That is what the restoration of confidence in the EEC is all about.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to most people than in an EEC context we will have a very small effect, anything we produce will not disrupt the policies or guidelines laid down. As Deputy MacSharry said, it is important that the Minister hold out for a special place for Ireland's expanding agricultural programme, that he holds out for special aid for Ireland, that he does not lack the confidence we would like farmers to have when he goes abroad.  He should state his case, put his cards on the table and look for aid for Ireland that is badly needed now.</P>
    <P>The question of agricultural prices will become absolutely vital this year.  I know the Minister is conscious of that.  Every year it comes under attack, every year before the budget agriculture appears to be the thorny problem.  There will be the cheap food element.  The people whose whole economy has been based on having cheap food for their industrial workers will be very vocal.  They are fortunate in that they do seem to draw their greatest support from urban areas.  They are somewhat like the Labour Party here &mdash; they feel they can confine their support to certain areas &mdash; although recent results might not confirm that.  I have found that the socialists and Labour supporters abroad are very much anti-farmer, that <Col N="189" /> their anti-CAP attitude is very thinly veiled, that they like to be selective about their membership of the EEC, that they like to pick what suits them and reject what does not fit in with their party's philosophy.</P>
    <P>We all admit that when Irish people go abroad, whether at ministerial level, Commissioner level or as members of the European parliament, we should use every title of influence we have on an united front to get the very best possible agricultural deal and reject any dilution of CAP.  I accept what the Minister said this evening about his attitude to CAP &mdash; he has had experience abroad &mdash; and I would hope that the results of his endeavours will bear out our high opinion of him as a campaigner abroad.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest features of which we must be conscious in this country, and possibly one of the saddest features that has emerged from politics in the seventies, has been the growing rift between rural and urban communities.  It is noticeable enough in Europe; it is noticeable enough here.  Possibly the attitude of farmers to paying tax, or any tax at all, some time ago sparked this off.  Probably various statements at Government and union level fanned the flame and were not of any great help.  We all have a duty to heal this rift.  We must show a united front as far as this island is concerned. We should remember that what is good for agriculture is good for Ireland also and that the spin-off benefits downstream of a prospering agricultural industry will find their way into every home in Ireland.</P>
    <P>About a year ago I read a very fine speech delivered by the British Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Peter Walker, in Brussels, that highlighted the importance of agriculture in an EEC context.  It was somewhat surprising to read, bearing in mind the source from which it emanated. He laid great stress on the relative cheapness of food, continuity of supply and the security of knowing that we were self-sufficient from a food point of view in an emergency.  That fact could best be appreciated by a generation like mine who grew up during the Second World War in Europe.  It is important to remember that farmers have virtues also, that <Col N="190" /> they have responded to national urgings, that they have played their part in the economy and in a European context as well.  When the Minister looks for better prices for our produce at EEC level he can be assured he will have our undiluted support here.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of farm incomes.  It is obvious that measures are needed at national and EEC level to solve these problems.  The situation is very bad.  Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, the Minister was not available this night week when hundreds of farmers gathered for a convention in the Hotel Keadeen in Newbridge.  He was lambasted there from all sides.  I do not know whether he is aware of the attitudes but he was subjected to frightful criticism.  I got the distinct impression that they were not entirely enamoured of Deputy MacSharry as a Minister.  If they were both vets and if farmers were sending for one or other of them the Minister would be left in his bed.  That is the impression I got.  But it is obvious to everybody that never, since the mid-sixties, has there been such an air of despondency in all areas of farming.  If one were to pinpoint the biggest problem &mdash; and funnily that over which we should have most control &mdash; it is that of inflation. Present inflation was quoted that evening as 22.2 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They are suffering from three years worth of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from 18 per cent when we left.  That is very obvious.  It is easy to remember the 22.2 per cent.  If one was a poker player one would probably open with a hand like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inputs into agriculture since 1978 have been abysmal.  Only today I saw a poster being prepared for the &ldquo;tractorcade&rdquo; that will be staged in Dublin on Friday.  I saw some figures that to me were unbelievable. When one balances that with a 60 per cent drop in farm incomes in the last three years &mdash; and we must claim a certain amount of the responsibility for that; we are not denying it; I suppose the good Lord cannot deny either that he sent bad weather for two of those years &mdash; it <Col N="191" /> throws up some picture.  Before the last election I met representatives of the Irish Farmers Association.  They dismissed all the goodies that Deputy MacSharry had brought from abroad, the series of packages he had brought.  Their biggest worry at that point was inflation.  They asked what we could promise them.  I replied that if everything went well and we did not experience any great difficulties we might be able to reduce inflation to approximately 12 per cent in three years. I think I was being reasonably honest.  As it is we import 6 per cent of our inflation and if we could reduce domestic inflation 6 per cent more we would be doing reasonably well.  But current inflation cannot be counter-balanced by an annual increase in prices.  It is something we must tackle at home.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil cannot be blamed for all the inflation.  When we left office the rate of inflation stood at 18 per cent.  In the short time they have been in office the Coalition measures involving direct taxation have been responsible for an additional 5 per cent.  It is generally agreed that in their few short months in office they have increased inflation by 5 per cent by direct taxation measures at home. That is why there is no confidence in agriculture.  That is why the farmers who gathered together this night week &mdash; we were not allowed speak to them; we had to sit there and listen &mdash; feel that they were conned, that the Minister came as a man of great experience, talked nicely to them, made promises to them and then let them down.  The sad part was that we had to sit there and listen &mdash; we were told we were merely observers &mdash; and neither Deputy Durkan nor I had an opportunity of defending the Minister much as we would have liked.</P>
    <P>Possibly that is why members of Macra na Feirme are setting out from Wexford. These young farmers are very worried about their future.  When they get to Athlone, as some of them will, on the western side of the Shannon, they will look back and say that they had every need to worry.  One of the first things they will be remembered for is the impending closure of the Tuam factory.  That was a very <Col N="192" /> cynical exercise for any Minister for Agriculture to engage in in 1981.</P>

      <P>I have allowed Deputy Gene Fitzgerald to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 6 on today's Order Paper. The Deputy has 20 minutes, and the Minister has 10 minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  I raise it because of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply given earlier today by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make is that the Minister arrived in this House today badly briefed.  The question was in regard to the placing of a contract to improve the security arrangements within the House.  The Minister said he could not give me the information I wanted because it had to do with security.  Being a security matter, especially one like this, it should have been handled with absolute competence and efficiency from the beginning. I have no hesitation in saying that if I were still over there the present Government would not be asking the question I am asking tonight.  I want the Government to give certain assurances to the House because they are responsible for placing this contract and it is an indictment of the Government's handling of the matter that this question is being raised here tonight.  Today I asked for a categoric assurance that the blueprint of the House and the plans for this work did not at any stage go outside the jurisdiction of the House while the contract was being prepared or since.  I am entitled to seek now that categoric assurance from the Minister.  Can the Minister tell me that the plans and blueprint for this installation in the House did not go to the headquarters of the UK company that took over the company awarded the contract? Can the Minister also assure the House that the Belfast office of this UK company did not at any stage have those <Col N="193" /> plans or blueprint?  In the interests of security I want the Minister to give those categoric assurances.</P>
    <P>I also want to know if, in these plans, there was a commencement date and a completion date, and if so how much time has expired since that completion date was reached.  I suggest that approximately six weeks has elapsed since that completion date was reached and I suggest that a few more weeks will elapse before the contract is completed.  A more simply way to ask the question would be to ask when will the work be finished and why was it not finished in time.</P>
    <P>Were any materials specified in the plans and blueprint?  I am sure the Minister is aware that some of the materials needed can be made by companies here. Was any consideration given to the possibility of using materials of Irish manufacture or did all the materials come from this UK company that I have referred to?</P>
    <P>If we were in Government there would be no need for anybody on this side of the House to raise such a question.  I submit that the handling of this whole exercise has been incompetent and inefficient indicating a lack of knowledge of basic security in Dáil Éireann.  If the powers that be cannot handle a contract of this nature in a proper fashion, how can we expect them to govern the affairs of this country?  I accept that the Minister of State is honest, sincere and hard working. It is most unfair to allow him into this House with the type of brief that he obviously had today.  The question I put down was very specific and very broad. I asked for details of the contract.  The Minister said he could not give me those details because of the security matters concerned.  I have already said how absurd it is that a security matter should have been handled in the inefficient way that it was.</P>
    <P>The question was very broad, asking for details of the contract for the installation of closed circuit television in Leinster House.  There are many angles to that question and the Minister chose to hide behind the security angle.  There were angles that had no reference whatsoever to security &mdash; cost, contractor, duration, completion date, materials, Irish content <Col N="194" /> and so on.  I asked the Minister the date originally given to the contractor for the completion of the work and the Minister replied that he did not have that information. I sympathise with him in his predicament in not being supplied with even basic information of that nature.  It is not good enough for any Minister to come into this House and hide behind security. Even if he were entitled to do that, surely the supplementary questions I asked had no relevance to security matters.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to drag this out but I want a reply from the Minister &mdash; I understand he has ten minutes to reply.  I want a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer.  Did the plans and the blueprint for this contract go at any stage to the head office of the UK company that took over the company awarded the contract?  Secondly, did the plans at any stage go to the Belfast office of that UK company?  I want a categorical assurance that in both cases they did not. They are extremely important questions to which I want an answer.  Why was no consideration given to the use, where feasible, of Irish materials?  Some materials could not have been got in Ireland, but some Irish materials could have been used.</P>
    <P>On what date did work commence and what was the original completion date according to the plans and specifications? What has been the reason for the delay, particularly in recent weeks?  I estimate that the work is already five to six weeks behind time.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle and every Member of this House shares my concern about how this grave matter of security appears to have been handled.  The Minister of State in the next few minutes will have an opportunity of allaying my fears and reassuring the House that all is well and that all was handled properly.  Can the Minister of State categorically deny that the plans went out of the jurisdiction?  Can he explain why the original completion date has passed and tell the House when the work will be finished and why Irish materials were not used?  I am serving a very useful purpose in raising these questions.  If the Minister of State cannot reassure the House on these matters, I will leave the House tonight with questions unanswered and a <Col N="195" /> grave question mark in regard to the competency and efficiency with which this whole project was handled.  If it has been mishandled, look at the risk the Members of this House are running.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had been more specific in requesting the dates they could have been given to him.  The contract was signed on 11 August and it was then a matter for the contractor to set his own starting date.  This is a wellknown procedure in all contracts.  A reasonable time must be given to the contractor to being work.  Work having started, there were some delays in the delivery of materials and the closing date was not met.  It was hoped that work would be completed before the resumption of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Most of the material could not be produced here.  The Commissioners of Public Works always recommend that as far as possible Irish material be used.  We are precluded from insisting on that.  In this contract worth £165,000, about £15,000 was expended on Irish material and this was the maximum possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication seems to be that there was something shady in the placing of this contract.  We approached five Irish firms which we felt were capable of doing the job.  No outside firms were approached. I have given the registered Irish number of this firm and if the Deputy wishes to communicate with me I will give him a <Col N="199" /> list of the directors.  This firm was cleared by our security authorities and the Garda.  They are a reputable firm and are doing a good job.  It should not be suggested that because they are three or four weeks behind time we should fire them out.  Is that the suggestion being made by the Opposition?  They are making much ado about nothing.  I stand over the <Col N="200" /> actions of the Commissioners of Public Works in this matter and I refute allegations that anything improper occurred.</P>

        <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The pier at Rathmullan is generally adequate to cater for fishing boats landing at the port.  Congestion is being experienced at the pier at present because it is being <Col N="35" /> used by a number of fishing vessels from other Irish ports which are supplying mackerel to foreign freezer trawlers that lie at anchor in Lough Swilly.  As the mackerel move southwards, as is normal, this activity is expected to transfer to Killybegs where adequate facilities are available.</P>
      <P>The extension of the pier at Rathmullan would be a very costly operation and, as the current congestion is of a seasonal nature, it is felt that the expenditure involved would not be justified.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a claim to old age non-contributory pension made by the husband of the person concerned.  This claim was referred to the local pension committee for decision on 23 November with a recommendation that pension at the maximum rate, plus an adult dependant allowance, be awarded from 16 July 1981.  A pension book is being issued on a provisional basis, pending the pension committee's decision.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the local pension committee recently awarded old age pension at a higher rate than that recommended by the social welfare officer who investigated a claim for an increase made by the pensioner.

The case will now be referred to an appeals officer for determination and the particulars furnished by the Deputy will be placed before him together with any additional information the pensioner may wish to give.</P>

As, according to the records of my Department, he had less than the minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year he was advised that he was not entitled to benefit.  Following inquiries it was established that he had in <Col N="61" /> fact sufficient contributions to qualify for payment.  The amount of the benefit due for the full period of his incapacity was issued on 20 November 1981 after refund to the health board of the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him.</P>

The delay in payment in her case was due to the fact that there was no record in my Department of the receipt of covering medical evidence of her incapacity after 14 July.

      <P>The person concerned attained pension age on 3 September 1979 and was awarded an old age non-contributory pension from 7 September 1979 pending investigation of his entitlement to a contributory old age pension. He was not entitled to a contributory old age pension solely on the basis of his Irish insurance record but as he had been employed in Great Britain it was established that the aggregation of his British and Irish insurance records would qualify him for pro-rata British and Irish pension under EEC regulations.  Due to industrial action by members of the staff of the British Department of Health and Social Security details of the rate of British pension payable were only recently notified to my Department.  Arising out of the <Col N="62" /> award of British retirement pension the old age non-contributory pension at present payable to him is due for revision and his pension book has been recalled for this purpose.  On receipt of the pension book the amount due for refund to my Department out of the arrears of British pension will be calculated and the balance will be paid to him.  The old age non-contributory pension will also be revised and a fresh pension book at the revised rate will be issued to him as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The rate of non-contributory pension payable is higher than the rate of Irish contributory pension which would ordinarily be payable and in the circumstances he will continue to receive the non-contributory pension.</P>

The information available indicates that since 1 January 1981 a total of 103 persons have died in Northern Ireland as a result of violence.  Of this number seven persons have died in incidents involving plastic bullets and ten persons died while on hunger strike.</P>
