    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the provision in the Bill which relates to refugees. The provision which gets rid of the 15-year residence clause is to be welcomed. I know it has not been brought in specifically to deal with Irish people who have returned from abroad but to give a proper chance of qualifying for a pension to those who come from other parts of the world.  The Minister referred to the Vietnamese refugees specifically.  Those living in the State who do not have means should be entitled to a pension.  I should now like to refer to the EEC pensions which come within the ambit of the Bill. I appeal to the Minister to establish a better line of communication between his Department and the Department of Health and Social Security at Newcastle-on-Tyne because those waiting <Col N="1272" /> to have their EEC pension entitlement processed often have to wait for longer than six months.  If there was a simple procedure the matter could be dealt with within a matter of weeks.  A definite line should be established whether it is a personal one or a telephonic one &mdash; obviously, the latter would be most difficult because it is almost impossible to make telephone contact with the Department from any place in Ireland.  If that link was established those claims could be processed within a reasonable time.  The delay means that the people concerned are losing out heavily due to inflation.</P>
      <P>I have had cases of people seeking EEC pensions having to wait between nine months and one year although there was no complication.  There was a break-down in communication between the two Departments.  Some consideration should be given in this legislation to the position of Irish people who return from abroad, particularly those who return from America, and whose means are limited.  As far as I am aware there is no consideration for Irish people of pension age who return from the US, Australia or other countries.  There should be some reciprocal arrangements, such as those obtaining between this country and other member states of the EEC to facilitate such people who have worked hard all their lives, who probably left this country at an early age but who at present are entitled to no benefit whatever on their return here.  They lose out when it comes to the fringe benefits such as free electricity, free television licence, free fuel or any other such benefit.  There are considerably more people in that category returning from America than there are from say, France, the Netherlands or Germany.  It is quite a large problem.  In my constitutency alone I would estimate that there are several hundred people who would be affected, people who have returned from the USA or Australia.  The provisions of the Social Welfare Bill should be broadened in order to include people who return from the countries I have mentioned or indeed from some other country not within the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> I should like the Minister to bear in mind the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome increases in social welfare payments.  On these benches we have always been anxious to ensure that social welfare be seen as a genuine transfer of resources from the well-off to those whom our society and economic system have condemned to an economic twilight zone.  However, the first thing that has to be said in relation to this is that the system simply does not operate in this way.  There is, of course, a transfer of resources but it is a transfer of resources from the slightly better off to the worse off; the best off are left largely untouched.</P>
      <P>It is not so long ago since on a trip down the country I was talking to a gentleman who supports the Minister's party whom I met by chance in a pub.  It was just after the budget, so I asked him to comment on what he thought the budget had done and what he thought of its provisions.  He said he would not say anything about the budget, but then in a couple of minutes' time he started to talk about the budget and he had many criticisms of it.  His first criticism &mdash; and this might surprise the Minister &mdash; was that it gave too much to the idle.  Those were his words, not mine.  The Minister will know that there is on the back benches of his party and among the ranks of his party a somewhat similar sentiment.  It is not a worthy sentiment, it is not one with which I agree, but in so far as it has any foundation at all, it springs from the perception by people, in the middle income brackets especially, that it is their income that is being reduced to pay the social welfare benefits and not the income of the rich and powerful in our society.  In that at least they are not wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point we must consider when we come to consider increases in social welfare is the rate of inflation.  We must consider in particular the rate of inflation in food prices because it is now a patently obvious fact that increases in food prices hit hardest of all those people on low incomes, because in many cases they spend at least 40 per cent of their income on the basic necessities of life. <Col N="1274" /> The increase in the price of the basic necessities of life for these people has, if anything, been accelerated by the process of scaling down and taking out the food subsidies introduced by the last Government. We all have our little bit to say about food subsidies and the Government have made clear their commitment to abolishing them if they could get away with it politically.  The fact is that there are still some of them there and, as they have been reduced, the burden on the social welfare recipient has increased. This must be taken into account when assessing the effect of any increase given in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one major confidence trick in relation to the social welfare increases, that is, in relation to the percentage figures bandied about by the Minister and people on the Fianna Fáil benches &mdash; 20 per cent for short term recipients, 25 per cent for long term recipients.  But has anybody looked at the figure for children? Has anybody looked at the figure for dependent children of recipients whether short or long term?  If one looks at the figure for the increases for the children, child dependants of social welfare recipients, one will see that those increases are nowhere near the 20 per cent and 25 per cent much booted about by the Minister.</P>
    <P>God help us, this is supposed to be a country in which we cherish all the children of the nation equally, at least to some degree.  It is also a country in which there is an unmistakable correlation between family size and poverty and between family size and low income.  But the surest possible way of transferring resources to low income families, whether or not in the social welfare bracket, is to increase payments made to children.  The percentage increases in the payments for child dependants of social welfare recipients is less than half the lowest figure mentioned in the many speeches from the Government side, 9 per cent.  Nobody, not even the most optimistic Government speaker, pretends that inflation will be as low as 9 per cent this year.  At present it has all the signs of being double that figure, or close to double it.  For the sake of argument, <Col N="1275" /> even at 15 per cent it means that the position of child dependants of social welfare recipients will be substantially disadvantaged during the coming year.  The Minister knows it and I know it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not true.  The children's allowance is up 30 per cent.  They get this also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have stung the Minister into some kind of response. But the House will note the fact that he is trying to divert the argument to children's allowances and away from the key issue of the payment for child dependants of social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the two must be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are between 100,000 and 200,000 children who are the children of families dependent on social welfare.  These children and their parents cannot escape the effects of what I have been talking about.  In fact, in relation to what the Minister has been saying, I am sure he will not disagree with me that the increase in the child allowances &mdash; if he wants to take them into account with the increase for child dependants of social welfare recipients &mdash; becomes payable from July only.  Therefore at the very least there would be a valley period during which child dependants of social welfare recipients will be substantially disadvantaged. It is one thing to say that they are disadvantaged, but there is disadvantage and disadvantage.  The disadvantages suffered by children and families at this stage in their lives cannot be <Col N="1276" /> readily made up later in life.  They start at a low place in the queue and as their life goes on they, if anything, fall further and further back in the queue.  The expense of providing remedial, social, educational, occupational and employment opportunities to try to equalise to any degree the opportunity enjoyed by these families and by the children of these families goes up in geometric progression as they get older.  It is far more sensible to put in whatever money one has right at the beginning.  This is patently not happening in this case.</P>
      <P>There is another distinction that I would like to bring to the Minister's attention and to ask him if he really can stand over it on any grounds other than the grounds that resources are short. That is the classification of some people as short-term recipients and other as long-term recipients.  Unemployment assistance is regarded, as far as I know, as a short-term benefit.  Therefore it goes up by 20 per cent as opposed to some of the other benefits which go up by 25 per cent.  That is fair enough if one accepts the theory of the matter and the theory of the matter is that unemployment assistance, for somebody who has not got an adequate contribution record, is a payment which is designed to sustain a person and his or her family until such time as that person has found gainful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know what happens to many people who go on unemployment assistance. I am not talking about school leavers or people who are temporarily out of employment.  I am talking about people who are made redundant, possibly at the age of 45 or 50, who exhaust their pay-related benefit, who exhaust their unemployment benefit and who go on assistance. They will be on assistance for the rest of their lives until they come to the pension age.  It is not unusual in this day and age that people should be on assistance for years and years, for longer than many people may be on some of the long-term benefits which are to be put up by 25 per cent.  If the Minister were to be generous he would have to accept that at least somebody who has been on assistance for three years could be counted as <Col N="1277" /> a long-term recipient and might be given some kind of help by virtue of increasing his allowance by 25 per cent.  I suspect that the hard core of long-term unemployed who have gone off unemployment benefit and on to unemployment assistance will slowly grow over the years and form a larger and larger part of the total number on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The question of not supplying certain increases in social welfare to people who are in receipt of certain kinds of disability payments should be looked at again.  It is certainly true that people on certain disability payments need increases.  But there seems to have been an arbitrary distinction made by the Minister in terms of disability pension and disability benefit which certainly does not make sense to the disabled people themselves.  I would appeal to the Minister to look at this again and to do all that he can to equalise the benefits being paid to the various disabled people in this year of the disabled.</P>
    <P>Finally I would urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to do anything else that can be done to step up the payment of outstanding social welfare payments from his Department.  It is a sad reflection on us as a society, the caring society that I believe some Government Ministers are prone to describe is ours, that social welfare recipients or would-be recipients have to come before elected representatives of this House and the elected representatives have to hold up the business of the House for hours on end during Question Time on individual cases in an attempt to get for them what this or any other society would regard as their rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make three points in relation to this Bill.  I want to protest very strongly about the current administrative system in operation in the Department following the change-over to the pay-related social insurance integrated computer system.  I have been a life-long insured person and when I went out of social insurance I became a voluntary contributor and then I continued to pay the PRSI on the change-over in the system to that much more effective way of collecting contributions, including <Col N="1278" /> health contributions.  I have studied the system in considerable detail over the years and had many a discussion with the former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, who was responsible from 1973-77 for the administration of the system. Frankly, I am appalled that with the body of expertise available to us at computer level, from the Revenue Commissioners right across to the Department of Social Welfare, and with the tremendous sophistication of equipment available to us here and literally the millions of pounds of public and taxpayers' money which we have spent to introduce this system and to have it working, that we now have a system where some thousands of constituents of individual Deputies cannot get their normal statutory entitlements. Only last week I had a case where a young woman had put in, for six successive weeks, certificates of disability from her own doctor in an effort to get payment and it was only when I put down a Dáil question for written reply yesterday that I got the response that all payments had been made up to 7 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is simply not good enough whether it is in the private sector, the public sector or the State-sponsored bodies sector.  It is inexcusable that anybody should come in here and say that people forget to send in their reference numbers. Any effective system, whether it is a hire purchase company or a commercial bank or the ESB &mdash; and there are thousands of subscribers paying their ESB accounts &mdash; can trace, within a matter of seconds, their credits and debits and benefits due. Those of us in this House who hold credit cards &mdash; and a number of Members do &mdash; can ring up and, in a matter of three seconds, find out the balance in an account.  There is no excuse in this day and age, with modern sophisticated computer technology available, for these delays to occur at ordinary branch office level, including the branch in George's Street, Dún Laoghaire, in my constituency. There is no reason why people should not be in a position to walk into a local employment exchange, simply give their number and, just like buying an airline ticket in Aer Lingus, have read <Col N="1279" /> back immediately the whole record of their social insurance, their last claim and the last input into the computer terminal.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very strong on public relations.  I do not know how strong he is on administration.  I always go for the administator because it is the results that matter, not the image.

There is no point in saying to an unemployed worker that he is entitled under the Social Welfare Acts to £58.30p. per week because of his basic social insurance if the unfortunate man is required by his employer and by the Department in relation to a disability benefit claim, say, to go and get his blasted birth certificate.

      <P>I am raising this because the Minister will tell me that that is a matter for the Eastern Health Board. I do not care who is responsible.  All I know is that Dublin people are queueing day after day outside in the public street. I have raised this matter over a period of three solid years.  Women with prams are queueing out in the public street, in rain, cold and sleet, every single week, hanging around for hours on end, and it takes two or three hours to get their own birth certificates.  In the name of God, we are not a nation of such population complexity, of such diversity, that we cannot regularise a thing like that.  A fairly junior principal officer in the Greater Birmingham Council area, which has a population of 3.3 million, could and would sort it out while being paid half the money by Margaret Thatcher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am finished on that note.  I want to make a point to the Minister about what I regard as a very serious flaw in the Social Welfare Bill.  I have four children, two of them still eligible for children's allowances.  I get £13,000 a year as a Dáil Deputy.  The Minister is giving the likes of me more children's allowances from 1 July.  I think he is giving us an increase of 30 per cent on the children's allowances.  Whether you have £50,000 or £500 a year you get children's allowances.  At the same time the unfortunate unemployed worker down in Arklow being laid off by NET, supposing he is married with three children and his wife does not work, would have a basic unemployment benefit of £58 a week and a supplement of pay-related of, say, £15 a week, and he is going to get an increase of a lousy &mdash; to be crude, unparliamentary or otherwise &mdash; 9 per cent on the portion for his three dependent children in pay-related unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the point that the Minister as the newly-appointed acolyte of Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, who does what he is told, must surely have within his Department some basic family income data which would suggest clearly that about the most miserable way, in terms of the allocation of scarce resources, of allocating money relative to children is to give a universal increase of 30 per cent from 1 July right across the board and to give 9 per cent to the unemployed, to the unfortunate father or mother who is out sick on long-term or short-term disability and is claiming a dependent child allowance, or to the deserted wife.  I find that incomprehensible as social expenditure priority. That serious anomaly is contained within the Social Welfare Bill.  Why? Because the Taoiseach wants to go the country in mid-year and he wants to stand up on the goggle-box looking bland and manicured, look the nation straight in the <Col N="1282" /> eye and say, &ldquo;I am giving every child in this country 30 per cent in children's allowances from next month&rdquo;, assuming that the election will be around 27 May or the middle of June.  It is cosmetic budgetary designed to milk the greatest kudos from the greatest number of people without real relevance to the priorities of social welfare.  That is why I think there is a serious deficiency in this Bill which is politically popular but does not cater for the purposes of social welfare for the deprived, disabled, unemployed, sick and aged.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if I have come in and expressed myself forcibly this morning it is because I would like to see in the Department once again somebody who would be entirely his own man.  Deputy Cluskey was his own man when he was in that Department.  He may have been unpopular with some sections of the staff but he was his own man and when some other Government Ministers came down from their Departments, notably Finance, and started prowling around the Department deciding what they would wish to see in terms of social priority, they were given desperately short shrift in Store Street because he was his own man in his Department.  It is great to see a Minister, no matter who, being his own boss in his Department and not bending to every whim of electoral pressure from, in particular, the presidential-style Taoiseach whom we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>I say that as a matter of regret because everybody has a feeling of goodwill towards the new Minister in his initial work in the Department, but when one gets a Bill like this and sees the break-down in the system of administration one becomes very irate.  The response which one gets at times from some politicians is that.  &ldquo;We appreciate fully that you pay 4.75 per cent of your salary into the social insurance fund, but do not cause any hassle, do not raise any row if, having got this money into the social insurance fund&mdash;-which is your money&mdash;you have the greatest difficulty in time of need in extricating the money to maintain your wife and family.&rdquo;  This is a social attitude which is totally unacceptable to any responsible public representative.  I urge <Col N="1283" /> the Minister to take a fresh look at the section of the Bill relating to the provision for children and to report at length in his reply on the breakdown of the administrative system which has occurred and which, hopefully, will be put right in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I also urge the House to take cognisance of the true cost of unemployment. It is not just a question of paying £3,000 a year in unemployment benefit to somebody who is out of work.  In real economic terms it is about twice that amount, because an unemployed person does not have to pay PRSI, a medical card has to be provided, his differential rent has to be reduced, supplementary welfare payments have to be made in certain instances and, on top of all that, one has to add the economic cost with loss of production and loss of profits for the concerns where the unemployed person comes from.  The true economic cost to the State in relation to a person who is unemployed is probably in the region of about £7,000 or £8,000 minimum per annum.  If you multiply that by the extra 20,000 or 30,000 people who became unemployed since the Minister took office, the true cost is quite staggering.  If one takes a conventional figure of £6,000 a year, £3,000 for benefits, £500 for pay-related social insurance and all the other additional costs, for every 5,000 unemployed people the extra cost to those who are employed is in the region of £35 million a year.</P>
    <P>A question was asked in the House of Commons last October about unemployment. The Minister concerned said that the cost to the State in cash terms alone for one unemployed person in the UK was over £6,000 per annum.  Today that would be about £6,500 or £7,000.  The true economic cost of unemployment, as reflected in the Social Welfare Bill, is very often hidden and should be stressed with greater concern.  Earlier the Minister rightly said, that Deputies tend to come into the House, make their points and then disappear.  We are all busy people. I have a deputation at 11.30 so I cannot remain to hear the Minister's speech.  I am sorry I cannot be here for <Col N="1284" /> his reply and no discourtesy is intended. Nevertheless, I ask the Minister to take cognisance of these points in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Like most Deputies.  I hold public &ldquo;clinics&rdquo; in my constituency on a fairly regular basis. Two-thirds of the questions raised by my constituents relate to social welfare problems. It is an extremely poor reflection on the efficiency of the Department. Most of the questions raised relate to delays in payments or to ineligibility for benefits or assistance.  It is most unfortunate that these people have to come to me at all, because the system is long established and there should be no difficulty in interpreting people's entitlements and sorting out their problems.</P>
      <P>I had a case recently where a person applied for occupational injury benefit in relation to an accident which happened in the middle of January.  Up to the first week in March he had not received any money.  That is a disgraceful situation and a reflection on the Minister.  He should take more interest in his Department and ensure that entitlements are paid on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the representations I make on behalf of people leads me to the conclusion that far greater powers should be given to local offices.  There is a need for a radical structural change in the administration of the Department of Social Welfare.  We have well qualified civil servants in charge of the various social welfare offices throughout the country.  They should know the system because they participate in its operation down through the years before they are promoted.  Entitlements, conditions and regulations are set down in black and white and it should not be beyond the wit of a social welfare branch manager to come to a decision in respect of 80 per cent of cases.  I accept that about 20 per cent of cases may need to be referred to Dublin, but 80 per cent of cases which are now referred from local offices to Dublin for decision could more easily and speedily be dealt with at local level.  It would make the system much simpler and much more efficient.  Yet, because of the <Col N="1285" /> manic attitude of the Department and civil servants in Dublin, they simply refuse to relinquish their little bit of power and transfer it to local level.  It is endemic through the whole civil service. Nobody wants to relinquish power at civil service level because he or she thinks their jobs are in danger.  They want their power, their desk and chair with a carpet underneath it.  Nothing leaves the office because it is their little cabbage patch. People who are not getting their entitlements are suffering.  That is a disgraceful situation.  I am calling for a radical review of the functions and structures of the Department, and of the structure of the branches throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter which arises quite frequently is the question of entitlement to EEC benefits.  That has been raised in the Bill and the Minister has removed the 15 year residential condition. That is good and necessary because of our membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which I think has been corrected in the budget is where people in receipt of British retirement pensions are not eligible for free telephone rental. That is something which should be rectified as it is an anomaly in the Act.  In relation to people who are eligible for entitlements under British social welfare regulations, there should be far speedier consultation between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health and Social Security in Newcastle-on-Tyne.  When I have occasion to make an inquiry on behalf of somebody who may be entitled to extra benefit within EEC regulations as a result of his or her insurance record in Britain, the stock reply I receive is that contact is being made with the authorities in Newcastle-on-Tyne, that this will take some time and that I will be contacted again when a reply is received from them. There should be no need for this big time factor.  Such delays could be eliminated by way of fairly close liaison between our Department and the Department of Health and Social Security in <Col N="1286" /> Newcastle-on-Tyne.  The whole process could be completed by way of telex.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigations in such cases must be carried out on the English side.  We can telex them very rapidly but very often delays are caused by applicants having moved many times from one building site to another, for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be appropriate that a liaison officer be resident in the Department here in order to ensure that the plain people of Ireland are paid the benefits to which they are entitled within EEC regulations?  There should be a system of determining quickly the British records in these cases but that is not happening with the result that there are long delays.  This is extremely unsatisfactory. When I make an inquiry on behalf of an applicant to the Department here. I receive a first reply within a week but very often three months elapse before I get the final reply.  An applicant might well be dead and buried within that time. This is a disgraceful state of affairs.  People should be paid the benefits to which they are entitled without there being this tremendous civil service input to what should be a fairly quick and efficient decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is chaos this year in the area of the payment of social welfare benefits. The Minister tells us that the reason for these delays is the installation of a computer in the Department.  As I pointed out during Question Time yesterday, the highest levels of unemployment and of illness are registered during the winter months.  Consequently, this is the time when the highest number of applications for benefit are received, but the whole system has been upset by a decision to <Col N="1287" /> instal a computer in the middle of winter. This is equivalent to a hotelier deciding to refurbish his hotel at the height of the summer season.</P>

I am convinced that the number of complaints with which he would have to deal in regard to the Department of Social Welfare alone would be sufficient to keep him very busy apart altogether from having to deal with matters relating to other Departments.  This appointment is long overdue.  I hope there will not be much further delay in this regard so that there will be an appointed person who will be in a position to rectify the many malpractices of administration in the State.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the position regarding married women who apply for unemployment benefit.  We know that after a confinement many married women now wish to return to work.  This is becoming an increasing practice in Ireland and it has been the practice in other European countries for some time.  Usually a married woman applying for benefit fulfils the conditions of having someone &mdash; perhaps her mother or a sister &mdash; to care for the baby of being registered with the National Manpower Service and <Col N="1289" /> of being available for work.  However, I am bewildered by the inconsistency of the initial refusal by whatever branch is concerned to grant the unemployment benefit applied for as a result of the woman not being able to find work and the decisions on appeal.  I estimate that of these people who approach me in regard to this benefit, 50 per cent are found subsequently to be entitled to unemployment benefit while the other 50 per cent are found not to be so entitled.</P>
    <P>There is no rationale in the decisions handed down.  Take two women in exactly the same circumstances and the chances are that A will get unemployment benefit and B will be refused either at branch level or on appeal.  Why that happens has never been satisfactorily explained to me.  That is one of the new mysteries.  The two women may be the best of friends, may be working in the same place in practically similar circumstances and one is allowed benefit and the other is not.  It is beyond my comprehension why that should be the position.</P>

      <P>Bloody cheek.  The maternity allowance, which again arises I imagine more from EEC regulations and from the national understanding than from any political will of the present Government, is an improvement which is necessary. I hope it will help many young married women with children who want to go back to work.  For 14 weeks they will be entitled to maternity allowance. I hope the system will be improved so as to regularise interpretation of the social welfare code as it refers to them in their applications for unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which is not in the Bill is the State pension scheme to which the present Government referred early in their term of office and which has now apparently been sunk, like many other objectives in the manifesto.  A State pension scheme is a sound social security concept. I am very sorry to see that the lack of commitment to improvement in the social welfare code under this Government <Col N="1291" /> is so evident that any move towards a comprehensive State pension scheme seems to have been forgotten and submerged. The Government are so divided in themselves that their thoughts are on things other than helping recipients of social welfare.</P>
    <P>May I finally make an appeal regarding occupational injury benefit?  The time it takes to examine a case indicates that there is need to have an automatic payment of a weekly sum perhaps equivalent to the occupational injury benefit so that the person suffering from such an injury would be automatically paid pending a decision on his claim.  That is necessary. I am thinking of a specific case about which the Minister's civil servants spoke to me on the telephone in a very apologetic tone.  The position certainly requires to be rectified.  It is obvious that the whole administration structure in the Department is such as to demand that local offices be given far more power and that the bureaucracy we are experiencing in the operation of the system is extremely unfortunate and unnecessary. I hope it will be changed.  It certainly will not be changed under that Minister: he does not even have respect for Members of the House.</P>

      <P>I think it is true that rural representatives have a much greater problem in relation to social welfare inquiries than in the case of Dublin representatives in making representations for payments.  There is nothing more annoying than to have some frustrated applicant tell you that he has not received his social welfare allowance.  In his presence, in an effort to relieve the frustration and to do your job as a public representative, you take up the phone and ring 786444.  I was referred to Newcastle-on-Tyne eight times a day to try to get that number.  The other day I spent about an hour and a half trying to ring that number and I might as well be trying to call the local cemetery&mdash;I got the same reply. Having heard so much about the installation of telephones I cannot understand why the lines in the Department of Social <Col N="1292" /> Welfare are so inadequate.

      <P>Then the situation is an indication of the negligence there is in that office, if 40 lines are available and so many people are trying to telephone without success.  People do not ring from anywhere in Munster just for fun.  It is an expensive operation.  When you find that so many people have already got the lines engaged, there must be something wrong.  The matter has been raised on several occasions, including Question Time here, and I have never heard a satisfactory answer from any Minister about what is happening.  If some irregularities occurred in any industry and the manager was telephoned on a couple of occasions and questioned about it.  I am sure he would ascertain what was causing the problem.  If there is reason for the present situation, we should know it.</P>
      <P>I wonder why these matters could not be dealt with in the local offices.  People down the country feel completely lost when the public representative tells them that it is not possible to make contact with the Department of Social Welfare. Some of them do not believe you.  I would feel much the same myself.  I would be doubtful in the same situation if the number had been tried at all.  People in the country believe that a Deputy can at least get through to the Department.  I suggest that the Minister should go to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and look for another 40 lines or find another way of securing efficiency.  I do not know why claims cannot be dealt with in the local offices.  The Minister is not very long in his present position and I shall not be critical.  I think he will do his best but I hope that some day he will be able to tell us that he has rectified the problem we have been complaining about for a couple of years.</P>
      <P>More than anything else I am worried about the case where an appeal is concerned and what is known as a board of referees comes down the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the difficulties in the Bill, which is a very narrow Bill as far as I am concerned. There is no point in speaking on it if I am not allowed to criticise what is causing the frustration of public representatives at the whole system.  I could quote the amount of money involved and paid, the proposed new agreements and the new and old rates, but that would be silly.</P>
      <P>When people make an initial application for social benefits, their application is assessed and a certain amount of money is granted for their keep or assistance. I have come across amounts of £12, and £11 in some cases, which is unreasonable. The prescribed resident's allowance is not administered as it should be. If it were not so rigidly administered, many people now in institutions would be looked after in homes.  Many would be prepared to look after their own if they got a reasonable level of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped to see the pension age lowered to 65.  The Minister and the Government speak about social conscience, but the present Government does not appear to have a social conscience because they left the ceiling at 70 years. The Coalition Government, in four seats brought the age down to 66 and <Col N="1294" /> the present Government have made no attempt to better that.</P>
    <P>What I really came in to speak about was the telephone number which was always engaged.  The public representatives down the country should have the means to make inquiries and gain information. This does not apply so much in the Dublin area, where people can walk across to the offices.  Unfortunate people down the country are often left for five or six weeks without benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a few points raised in the Bill in relation to increased payments.  These increased payments are very welcome, and not alone welcome but very necessary.  They barely keep up with present inflation. The Minister departed from the custom, when there were difficulties in an inflationary period, of two instalments of payments being brought in, in October and April or May.  Over the last year we could have had three instalments because increases in basics were so vast that many people on welfare&mdash;whether old age pension, disability benefit, unemployment assistance, maternity benefit or what-ever&mdash;were certainly finding it very difficult to make ends meet&mdash;that is, when they could receive payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a valid case for re-examination of the whole social welfare system of payments and administration.  Over the last three years, this Department have obviously given many people many difficulties, not the least of whom is the Minister.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not been able to handle this Department.  I hoped that when the present Minister attained his position, we had a young man who would understand the problems of the under-privileged and disadvantaged. Not alone that, that he would be able to attack the problems of late payments, of examinations of pay and all the other difficulties which these unfortunate people must go through before they receive payment.  The Minister has failed miserably to deal with the situation.  The problem is great not only since Christmas or in the last three or four months when we were told that a new computer system was being put into <Col N="1295" /> the Department, but it is ongoing and increasing all the time.  In other words, the Minister is not operating his Department. He should make a resolution to get in there and do the job or resign from the Department of Social Welfare and let somebody else in who is able to tackle it. That is a serious thing to say about any Minister but it is very necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien mentioned that the people in Dublin could go to an office. While I do not deal with people in the Dublin area, from what I have heard over the last couple of weeks they are in dire trouble in that they have to queue for long hours and perhaps at the end of it not even get an answer to their problem. If that happened down the country.  I would create a hell of a row in this House. As it is, there are many problems around the country, a few of which I shall mention in the course of my contribution on this Bill.  I agree with Deputy O'Brien that old age pensioners need special consideration. In the last couple of budgets no attempt has been made to reduce the qualifying age.  I ask the Minister a direct question.  Is he happy, or is it his feeling that a person should not get an old age pension until he or she is 66 years of age? I know that his party always felt that a person should not get an old age pension until he or she was 70, because in all the years they were in office they never reduced the age below that.  We have reduced the age to 66 and it seems to have come to a standstill.  It will not be further reduced until another party take office.  The Minister is a caring man but I thought he might have brought some sanity to the qualifying age for an old age pension.  We should aim at granting old age pensions at 60 years of age, not 66, and I was disappointed this Bill did not reduce the age.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to the amount an applicant for a non-contributory old age pension can have and still qualify for full pension.  The amount has been £6 since 1974-75 and it is high time the Minister looked seriously at this, taking into consideration inflation and the devaluation of money.  The means allowed to an applicant for a <Col N="1296" /> non-contributory pension should be at least £20 a week.  Even at this stage I would ask the Minister to write this into the Bill.  It would not cost very much but it would give a great deal of comfort to many old people in their last years.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit payments are causing a lot of problems.  I want to know why the Department are not answering letters. At Question Time last week I gave an instance of one of my constituents who wrote 11 letters to the Department since October 1980 and did not receive any acknowledgement or reply.  If the Minister wants evidence that this is happening I can give it to him daily.  Many people do not want to come to politicians for help because they are able to handle their own affairs, but the Department are ignoring people who are prepared to take up their cases.  Why are they not answering letters from ordinary citizens?  I do not know if the Minister wants to answer now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Disability benefits should be index-linked and paid by two or three increases over the year, not just one increase at the end of the year.  The people who qualify for the disability benefit are at another disadvantage.  When they qualify they cannot get payment.  On many occasions the Minister gave explanations about the telephone situation in his Department.  As late as last week he told me they are awaiting installation of a new telephone system.  He mentioned 40 lines into the Department, but how many people are at the other end of those lines?  One day I had four people in my office holding on to four lines, which were ringing.  One was answered after 30 minutes. Last week I rang for 90 minutes and nobody answered.  The Department's officers in the country, whether they are unemployment exchange officers, social welfare officers or supplementary welfare officers, are not prepared to ring the Department because they say it is a joke.</P>

We are debating a Bill to bring in improvements which will benefit a certain section of the community, but if we cannot give them what they are entitled to now, we must <Col N="1298" /> refer to this.  I do not think that is unreasonable. I am sure the Minister would like us to tell him the problems that exist so that he might be able to deal with them.  This could strengthen his hand when raising these matters in his Department. From that point of view, it would be a good thing if we were given a little latitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Married women's benefits are causing a great many problems.  Most girls who get married stay at work.  When they have a baby they must take time off from work for six to 12 months, particularly after the first child because it takes them quite a while to readjust.  When they get back into the mainstream of employment they often find it difficult to get jobs.  They then apply for unemployment benefit.  Most of them have years of stamps and they find it very difficult to get unemployment benefit payments.</P>
      <P>I am aware of girls who have been refused unemployment benefit and who, on appeal, were asked to furnish certain evidence. They were required to show that there was a person available to look after their children and to furnish letters from people from whom they had sought employment.  Even the production of this type of evidence was not sufficient for many of them to succeed in their appeal. Last week I met some people who had gone through this procedure and had put down their names with the National Manpower Service as being prepared to take up any type of employment, but in spite of this their application for unemployment benefit was refused.  This is unreasonable and would appear to be a ploy to cut down social welfare expenditure.  I hope the Minister will agree that such benefit should be paid to those who legitimately seek employment.  I am not in favour of anyone receiving benefit who is not genuinely seeking work or in a position to take up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are long delays in making decisions regarding payment of unemployment <Col N="1299" /> benefit.  People are put on unemployment assistance in the meantime.  It is not right that a person whose card has been stamped for several years should have to wait a long time for a decision regarding payment of these benefits.</P>
    <P>The pension books of old age pensioners should be available to them as soon as they become due.  Last year many unfortunate old age pensioners found that their books were not available at the local post office and they were completely confused, not knowing where to go or what to do.  This is another sign of the deterioration in the operation of this Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister should consider increasing the living alone allowance payable to old age pensioners.  The pension is of great benefit to people who live with their families and enables them to live a good life, but individuals or couples need more.  Costs have increased dramatically and it is very difficult for such people to make ends meet.  In my view we should differentiate fairly substantially in favour of those living alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are no longer prepared to accept long delays in the payment of disability benefits and there is no point in the Minister saying that such delays are caused because people do not use correct reference numbers.  I can furnish details of people who have used the correct numbers but yet received only intermittent payments.  The problem is caused by gross inefficiency in the Department and <Col N="1300" /> this must be accepted by the Minister. All hell would break loose if any Member of this House did not receive his cheque at the end of the month.  Why cannot the same organisation be available to these unfortunate people?</P>

      <P>There are many changes in this Bill and there will be many problems when it becomes law.  The Minister should have full responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare alone. There are many excellent points in this Bill and it will be worthwhile, but the Minister should give it his careful and full attention.  I am not being personal about the Minister's capabilities.  It would need the full attention of any Minister.  The Department of Social Welfare is a huge Department, as was illustrated in exchanges across the House when the Minister said he was dealing with about 900,000 people.  The changes in this bill will be very important to people contributing through the PRSI system and to <Col N="1303" /> people receiving benefits.  I am confident that if the Minister had responsibility only for the Department of Social Welfare he would be capable of ensuring that the Department would be modernised and improved to meet the needs of society. The Government should have a rethink on this.  As far as I am aware the Minister of State.  Deputy Hussey, is responsible mainly for the health aspect of the Department but I would like the Minister to say who is actually responsible for this Bill and for the total working of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I am in constant touch with the Minister's Department and when this Bill becomes law I am sure I will have to ring even more constantly.  Mainly, I get a very courteous reception from the Department but there are times when, due to stresses and strains, people have not a lot of time to discuss problems and it is very difficult to track down a file.  If I ring in relation to any benefit I can be left on the phone waiting for 20 minutes to half an hour.  A lot of the time I am ringing long distance from an ordinary phone.  Admittedly I am paid a relatively good salary, but those who ring the Department would need a pocketful of silver because of the delays on the other end and the danger of being cut off.  The Minister will need to devote a great deal more time to the implementation of the Bill to ensure that those entitled to benefits under it get them.  The Minister will have to devote more time to the Department of Social Welfare.  I am concerned about the fact that you also have responsibility for the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>This matter should be given serious consideration.  I have already raised these problems with the <Col N="1304" /> Department.  I do not want to have to table questions in the House about these problems but they are occurring so often that it will be necessary.  The problems arise so often that it will be necessary to give a Minister sole responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare.  Once the provisions of the Bill are implemented further changes will be necessary and recipients will face further delays.  That is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should avail of the opportunity to change the provision in relation to the qualifying age for old age pensions.  We can become complacent about this matter and adopt the attitude that everybody is all right.  The qualifying age should have been reduced by one year.  That change is desirable and necessary.  The agricultural community would have benefited because there would have been more transfers of property from father to son.  It would also have helped those who do not have sufficient stamps to qualify for a contributory pension, or those who have been out of work for a long time and were depending on health board benefits and supplementary allowances.  In spite of the fact that we have been told we are going through a recession, the qualifying age should have been reduced.  Such a move would have been a courageous one by the Minister and it would have been welcomed by many people.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on deciding to pay old-age pensions from the date of the lodging of documents of title and the deed of transfer in the adjudication office.  That was a worthwhile move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It is common sense that was not recognised before.  When the deeds are lodged in the adjudication office they are sent back and forth to <Col N="1305" /> other officers.  As a result delays in the payment of pensions of up to 18 months occur.  Many people who had signed over their property and did not receive their pensions suffered hardship.  The decision of the Minister was one of the positive moves he made.  I have been in constant communication with the Minister in relation to disability benefits.  As I told the Minister previously, it is my view that a person who goes before a medical referee should be entitled to have his or her own doctor present and, if necessary, be legally represented at such examinations. It is with regret that I must tell the House that some social welfare beneficiaries are not treated with proper courtesy when they go before those medical referees. One lady who was late for an appointment through no fault of her own &mdash; the hired car she was travelling in was late &mdash; had to wait for four or five hours after which she was insulted by the medical referee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill should contain guidelines and regulations in relation to this and they should be strictly adhered to.  We are discussing the increases in PRSI which people will have to pay and the payments people are receiving.  People have to attend before a medical referee or an appeals court and, if there are no standards in this Bill establishing their rights, the Bill is a failure.  It should contain such regulations.  If not, there is a fundamental weakness in it.</P>
      <P>People go to their own doctors and are told they are sick and unfit for work. Then they go before another doctor who tells them they are fit to work.  They are caught between two different medical viewpoints.  Their rights should be set out in a Bill of this nature.  A proper code will have to be drawn up and this Bill is an appropriate vehicle for it.  This Bill is increasing people's right to disability benefit. They should be able to say: &ldquo;Under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1981, these are our rights.&rdquo;  They should be treated with the dignity to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>I have felt strongly for a long time that many of these people are not being treated properly, especially when they go before medical referees.  The Bill should be followed by a ministerial order showing people what their rights are, and also their obligations.  There should be similar guidelines for the medical referees.  This is desirable and necessary.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point seriously. I am very unhappy about what is happening at present.  I have tabled a number of questions to the Minister on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to discuss the situation in which an employee of a firm discovers that his card was not stamped and therefore his pay-related social insurance payments are not being made.  This Bill does not tighten up that current unhappy situation. On a regular basis I see firms running into arrears with these contributions. The employee who has his PRSI <Col N="1307" /> deducted weekly from his wages should have some peace of mind.  He should be happy in the knowledge that his contributions are going to the Department. There is no such safety measure in this Bill.  I appreciate the problems of firms who find it difficult to pay the different contributions which they are obliged to pay by law.</P>

      <P>The Minister's Department should take serious cognisance of the point I have made.  If that problem is not dealt with, we are turning a blind eye to an existing problem and making an existing situation worse.  I hope the Minister will consider some admendment to the Bill on Committee Stage.  Some type of liaison is necessary between the Department of Social Welfare and the employers to ensure the provision of a smoother method of payment.  Many of the problems experienced by the Department <Col N="1308" /> arise from this weakness in the legislation. I will not labour that point further.</P>
      <P>The increases in old age pensions, disability and unemployment benefit, maternity allowances, invalidity pensions and unemployment assistance are very welcome.  Despite the fact that some people are saying the increases are fantastic and that many people will be better off, especially the old age pensioners, the hard fact is that their standard of living is continuing to deteriorate.  This Bill goes some way to help them but not sufficiently because the cost of living here is higher than in Britain.  Therefore, the Minister and his higher officials will have to take a serious look at the whole social welfare set-up because the delays are scandalous and are causing serious concern. Even the national newspapers have taken this matter up and they are to be congratulated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite have gone to great lengths to stress the administration difficulties and have thus sought to cloud the real point in the Bill which is to give increases of 25 per cent to old age pensioners and others and to give 20 per cent increases to other groups.  The Bill gives increases in children's allowances which are very welcome.  It is no harm to contrast our situation with that in the UK.  We welcome the extension of the free telephone scheme to our citizens who are in receipt of UK pensions here. This is a big step forward and there had been a lot of lobbying for it in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to bring the real issues back to the House.  Perhaps it suits the media at present to cloud the issue with the clamour <Col N="1309" /> about administrative delays and so on.  Therefore it is important to have this put on record.</P>

I am wondering how he will be received in his constituency by social welfare recipients when he shouts as loudly at church gates as he has here today welcoming the social welfare allowance increases.  Perhaps I should not blame the Deputy who has taken his cue from the fanfares in the dying days of January when it was hoped the social welfare increases would carry the day and the budget.  However, social welfare beneficiaries are not much better off than they were 12 months ago.  Of course they have not got these promised increases yet.  Some of them will not be paid for another month, some for five weeks and some in July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows about the increases in the prices of bread, sugar, butter, tea, all in the daily shopping lists of social welfare recipients, and I am sure he is capable of comparing them with the effects of the percentage increases in these allowances and of concluding that social welfare recipients are worse off than they were this time last year.  I have referred to these as &ldquo;promised increases&rdquo; because many people are disillusioned by promises and are wondering if these increases will be paid in April at all.  Today many of them are without what they were entitled to a week, a fortnight and in many cases a month ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> When we left office in 1977 these people were on a much higher standard of living.  At that time we undertook to bring the old age pension qualifying age down to 65 years.  I understood this was accepted across the political divide but despite the fact that Fianna Fáil have brought in four budgets in the meantime, they have not made the slightest effort to lower the qualifying age for old age pensions. I ask the Minister to make arrangements to reduce the qualifying age to 65 as has been undertaken by the National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the benefits paid in 1977 when we left office and compare them with the prices of commodities purchased by pensioners in that year.  Let us also make a comparison with the percentage increase in allowances and the percentage increase in the cost of basic requirements of day-to-day living.  The Minister would have less to boast about if he considered this matter.  As far as I remember, the price of a loaf of bread in 1977 was 20p but now it is 44p.  I do not have to go back to 1977 to draw attention to massive price increases.  In the past 12 months we have had four increases in the price of coal, yet the Minister boasts of an increase in the free fuel allowance from £2 to £3 an increase long overdue.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in this House on the free fuel allowance but despite all of that and the fact that the Minister was told of the difficulties experienced by people who are entitled to this allowance, he has made very little alteration in the scheme.  In his speech yesterday he said he had removed certain anomalies and minor discrepancies which came to light during the passage of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act and which are now being put right.  There is a major anomaly with regard to the free fuel scheme and it affects my constituency. It must also affect the constituencies of many of the Minister's colleagues and I am surprised the Minister has not taken steps to remove it.  There is the situation that a person entitled to the free fuel allowance who lives on one side of the street near the city boundary gets the appropriate voucher when she draws her pension but her neighbour on the opposite <Col N="1311" /> side of the street is not entitled to the voucher simply because she is living in the county.  I have come across cases of people living next door to each other and on the same side of the street, where one person is entitled to the allowance and the other is not.  I know of cases where people who live well into the county area are in receipt of the free fuel allowance but others living much nearer the city boundary are not receiving it.  I understand the reason for this is the post office at which one is drawing a pension.  In all honesty the Minister must accept that an anomaly exists here.  I have drawn attention to this matter as have other speakers in this House.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister to allow the free fuel scheme to apply throughout the country, not just for one area.  I think 17 areas were involved when the scheme was introduced in the 1940s. I suppose the reason then was that turf and other fuels were readily available in country areas.  It was probably a good scheme in its day but it is not good enough in 1981 to rely on the bones of a scheme introduced in the 1940s.  This matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister and his predecessor.  I hope this will be the last time I shall have to mention it here.  The Minister should introduce a Bill allowing the scheme to apply throughout the country.  It is just as difficult, perhaps even more difficult, for a person to heat a house in a rural area as it is to heat a house in a built-up area. We need a uniform scheme for the entire country.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take steps to ensure that people know what they are entitled to by way of social welfare benefits.  I know there has been a certain amount of publicity about this matter but it is extremely difficult to get the information through to people.  The Minister should ensure always that information is given by social workers, local committees and through press advertising.  It appears that the letter is the Minister's main channel of conveying information regarding social welfare benefits.  It should be his aim to improve on the methods of conveying <Col N="1312" /> information so that every citizen who is entitled to social welfare benefits at least knows about them.  I accept that is as far as the Minister can go until the application is made to his Department. But the Minister can ensure that when applications are made to the Department they are processed far more quickly than they are today.  There are considerable delays in the payment of social welfare benefits and in processing applications. The waiting period could be shortened.</P>
    <P>I do not know the number of inspectors the Department now employ but we were told a few years ago that the number would be increased and that there would be a great saving following inspections. We understood the Minister knew of the abuses in the social welfare area.  Most Deputies in the House are aware of them. There is a high percentage of abuses in my area and in County Dublin and I am sure it is the same all over the country. There is an increase in the number of travelling people who trade on the roadside. Many of those people are not only trading illegally and making handsome profits without paying rates or taxes but they are also receiving benefits from the Department of Social Welfare from two and even three locations.  A greater effort must be made to track down those people and cut out this abuse.  This is not an easy thing to prevent because many of those people do not have a name.  They sign their forms as Mr. X although many of them can write their names and addresses as well as the Minister or I can.  It is more difficult to track down two people called Mr. X than to track down two people called Mr. Murphy.  Those people sign Mr. X at many locations on the same day.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago a person building a house for himself told me there was one day in the week when the staff were not available.  He knew the reason and when I pointed out to him that this was quite wrong and he should do something about it he warned me not to do anything about it because if I did his house would not be built, that he could not get labour.</P>

There are some junior Ministers who have been appointed to trivial jobs which any messenger boy could look after.  We have this Minister looking after two important Departments.  He may be looking after one, although not as well as we would like, but there is one Department he is certainly not looking after.

Something should be done about it.  I know I am appealing to a man who refused to do anything about it when he was in charge of that Department.  Appeals were made in the House to the former Taoiseach to split the portfolios of Social Welfare and Health.  This Government are supposed to be a socially, caring Government.  I fail to see that and I am sure many others do as well.  If they were a caring Government those entitled to a cheque last Thursday or Friday would have received it.  Those entitled to a cheque last Thursday of Friday month would have received it.  Those entitled to a cheque on the first Thursday or Friday of January would have received it.  They have not yet done so.</P>

Perhaps they should be; perhaps it is their own fault that they are not.  Probably they saw no great need for it but I am damned sure they see a need for it now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking around, not for the purpose the Minister thinks, that somebody would come in after me &mdash; I was hoping there was not somebody there to come in after me; I was hoping that the Minister would get in and that we would hear some straight talk from him.  Indeed we thought we heard that straight talk from him in November last, when he told us that all this was behind him, and us, that things were then straightened out in the Department.  I think he even issued a document to that effect, to give us that impression anyway. It is fair proof that the Minister does not know what is happening in his Department. Again it is fair evidence in support of my plea to his political boss, the Taoiseach, to appoint a person with full responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare, so that the Minister would not have to run from one Department to another.  We have here again something that probably will receive more publicity today and tomorrow.  I am speaking of the increases &mdash; a carrot being held out to people who are in dire need to make some attempt to reinstate their standard of living to the level it was at even eight, ten or 12 months ago.  If it does so it will be for a very brief period only.  In so far as the Government are concerned we have a budget once a year. I am not sure about this year because we will probably have a second one.  However, as far as the Government are concerned there, is, generally speaking, a budget once a year but as regards these people on social welfare allowances, in the month of January last alone, we had <Col N="1321" /> a budget twice a week.  There were increases in the price of tea, bread, butter and all kinds of fuel, not once but twice in the month of January last.  Yet the Minister boasts that he is giving a 20 per cent and 25 per cent increase to people existing below the poverty line, people who are in dire straits, certainly quite a number of them.  I do not think the Minister realises this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister is not doing much about it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some fair increases in the rates in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some fair price increases on basic food commodities and fuels over the same period. Instead of boasting about increasing the free fuel allowance from £2 to £3, the Minister should compare that increase with the fuel price increases in the last year only &mdash; without going back over past years when the free fuel allowance was totally inadequate &mdash; when he would find that the free fuel allowance today should be no less than £6 a week.  Anybody attempting to keep themselves and their house warm today must surely burn a bag of coal a week.  Will that £3 buy that bag of coal?  If the Minister thinks that that is what he is doing, buying a bag of coal with that £3, then it is a fair while since he bought a bag of coal or did his calculations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister &mdash; and he could do it without another budget &mdash; to increase the fuel allowance.  We were lucky this year that we did not have a harsh winter.  Today's weather could be compared with that of a May day except for the darkness.  But the darkness of the day is nothing to that being suffered by social welfare recipients who have to wait so long for their rightful entitlement. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Minister to consider increasing the free fuel allowance to something worth while. Would he not examine the price of a bag of coal even when the free fuel allowance <Col N="1322" /> first came into operation this winter? Would he examine the price of coal in that week and compare it with the price today, indeed compare his 50 per cent increase &mdash; one about which I suppose one could feel justified in blowing trumpets &mdash; when he would ascertain that it does not go anywhere near meeting the increase in the price of fuels.</P>

      <P>I am examining at present the salmon fishing regime for 1981 and will announce my decision very shortly.  In that connection I am considering the matters raised in the questions together with my concern to ensure the conservation and rational exploitation of our valuable salmon fisheries in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the heavy run on salmon in the 1980 season, particularly in respect of the Slaney river, and is he aware also of the <Col N="1325" /> amount of hardship that the restriction is causing the fishermen of that area?</P>

      <P>In considering the conservation of our salmon stocks the Minister, so far as possible, takes into consideration in the overall national interest the salmon stock position in the inland and coastal waters of the country as a whole. In view of the strong representations received, the Minister is reviewing the effects of by-law No. 606 of 1978.  The salmon fishermen in the Barrow, Suir and Slaney estuaries mentioned in the question would benefit from any relaxation of the by-law referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that problems have been caused recently by low-price imports of mussel products from third countries.  This is a matter for resolution by the Community as a whole and the current review of the common organisation of the market for fishery products, including the provisions governing trade arrangements with third countries, presents an ideal opportunity to make appropriate adjustments to the Community's import regime in order to guarantee that fishery products will not be imported in a manner likely to disturb the balance of the Community market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of imports from third countries continues.  The only permanent solution is to introduce a reference price for mussel products in the proposed EEC regulations on the common organisation of the marketing of fishery products.  The Department are pressing for an extension of the list of products covered by reference prices to all key fishery products which are of commercial significance to Ireland and these include mussels.  That is a continuing process.  I might add that the Minister is in Brussels this week and that this subject is on the agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reductions in the offical EEC withdrawal prices for small round whiting this year.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal prices for each quality grade of the species covered by the Community's price support system are fixed annually by EEC Commission Regulation following discussions on the basis of the Commission's price proposals.  The reduction for low grade whiting which applies throughout the Community must be seen in the context of the generally satisfactory price &ldquo;package&rdquo; finally agreed.  This &ldquo;package&rdquo; was in my view most satisfactory.  Increases in the withdrawal prices for the bulk of fish landed by Irish fishermen ranged from approximately 5 per cent to 28 per cent depending on the quality grade of the fish involved, averaging out at about 15 per cent overall.  These prices will hold throughout 1981 and will come up for review at the end of the year when the matter can be re-examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fishermen are not satisfied with this price package?  They are very concerned that the price for bulk which he talks about has dropped from £8 to £6 a box, which is the equivalent of 6p. a pound.  Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry agreed in Brussels that the fishermen here would get a price of only 6p. in the pound?  Surely he is not satisfied with that?

I quote from the last paragraph of that statement:</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to questions on 19 March 1980, the position is that except in certain well defined cases, such as calls monitored at the request of the subscriber, telephone calls are intercepted by my Department only in compliance with warrants issued by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No individual subscriber's line is observed or monitored for the purpose of checking the quality of service or to meet other needs of my Department. However, in the course of handling manually-operated calls operators are expected to monitor that calls have been connected satisfactorily, particularly in the case of emergency calls, that conversation is in progress and that the duration of calls for charging purposes is correct. Technicians in testing faulty trunk lines may occasionally, as part of the testing procedure, check that conversation is taking place on the trunk circuit concerned and that the quality of it is satisfactory. The instructions prohibit staff from listening-in on such calls.  If any failures to observe these instructions <Col N="1340" /> occurred, they would be regarded in a most serious light.</P>
    <P>Since calls are intercepted by my Department only under warrant issued by the Minister for Justice, the question of conformity with European Court of Human Rights standards does not arise for my Department.</P>

May I ask him a number of specific questions arising out of his reply to the four questions he has chosen to take together?  First, in relation to the warrants issued by the Minister for Justice, have there been any circumstances under which the warrants were not decided upon or signed by the Minister personally?</P>

No complaints from Fine Gael headquarters have, to my knowledge, reached the Department concerning those allegations.  There is not an investigation going on, and there cannot be an investigation until complaints are made.  Then my Department will have the investigation carried out immediately.</P>

      <P>All cable television systems with 100 subscribers or more are required to be licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, which set out the conditions to be complied with including technical conditions.</P>
      <P>So far as reception is concerned, the technical conditions attached to licences are designed to ensure that the television signal picked up at the mast head are not downgraded while being relayed to the service point in customers' homes, that interference is not caused to other apparatus and that the system complies with safety requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> My Department have powers under the regulations to require licensees to make available on request any information relating to the operation of their systems; to inspect the systems and ultimately to suspend or revoke the licence in the event of failure to comply with the terms of the licence.  The manner in which these powers are exercised in regard to any particular system would depend on the circumstances of that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially a Dublin problem.  In cases where someone defaults and is disconnected, there is nothing to stop such a person telling the firm concerned to refuse the wayleave at the house.  When this happens every other house is deprived of the service.  Is the Minister aware that firms are reluctant to cut people off because other users in the neighbourhood will be deprived of the service?  There have been several cases where people who were cut off attempted their own connections and, being of an amateur nature, left people on either side of them with distorted picture and sound.  Is there anything the Minister can do to allow firms have more control and power so that if they disconnect someone other people in the locality will not be deprived of the service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In all cable systems it is possible to disconnect individual subscribers who are in arrears with payments of fees.  This does not affect paying subscribers in normal circumstances.  It is not too difficult for a person who is disconnected to make an irregular connection himself.  Normally the cable runs across his property and the junction box is usually on the wall of the house.  Cable operators devote a lot of resources into tracing and eliminating such irregular action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Prices Commission commissioned a study of the cable television industry in October 1979.  A summary of the report of the consultants was published in the NPC Monthly Report No. 96 of June 1980 under the heading &ldquo;System Damage&rdquo;.  The report stated that the final factor which affects the quality of services received by the consumer results <Col N="1357" /> from damage to the system.  Vandalism, piracy, construction work and ESB outages create the majority of service breakdowns in cable companies.  Piracy is probably the greatest problem the companies have.  By connecting themselves into the system these illegals weaken the signal being relayed.  As a result the quality of reception received by the houses downstream deteriorates drastically.  Furthermore, these connections can, in fact, electrify the system.  Maintenance of the cable television in any locality depends on community co-operation and goodwill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying, but it is awkward to be brief.  It is seldom I seek the indulgence of the Chair.  The Minister is correct in saying that it is dangerous to make an attempt at connection.  Is the Minister aware that it is open to the pirate, if he is cut off, to order the firm to take the whole thing away from his house?  Once that is done the people downstream from there on are deprived of service.</P>

    <Title>Defence Policy: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That Dáil Éireann confirms the principles which have guided the defence policy of the Government and their predecessors.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to restate the principles that have guided and continue to guide the defence policy of this and previous Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I wish to state unequivocally that the Government are not discussing or negotiating any kind of secret agreement on defence with Britain or with any other country or group of countries. As far as this Government are concerned, any major change in Ireland's defence policy would have to be, in accordance with the Constitution, the subject of the fullest public debate, both inside and outside the Dáil.  But this is not an issue at the present time, nor would we lightly give up the very considerable advantages our present defence policy has, not only for ourselves, but, I believe, in a number of respects for our <Col N="1393" /> friends and partners in the Western world.</P>
    <P>The deep attachment of the majority of the people of this country to this policy arises out of our own particular historical experience.  The Government see it as their duty and responsibility to ensure that the policy is clearly and realistically stated, having regard to changing circumstances and the international environment. If at any time some modification in the policy seemed to be required in the overall national interest, then it would be the Government's duty in a matter of such high importance to put the position fully before the people and their representatives prior to any decision being taken.</P>
    <P>Our overriding objective is and has always been to establish firmly and to maintain Irish sovereignty and independence and to preserve the safety of our people.  Article 1 of our Constitution affirms the Irish nation's sovereign right to choose its own form of Government and to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its political, economic and social life in accordance with its own genius and traditions.  That is the basis of our foreign and defence policy; that is the rock on which we stand.  In every policy of Government, in every aspect of our policy, our guiding principle is the national interest, the sovereignty, welfare and security of the people of Ireland and their right to decide their attitudes and courses of action as defined in the widest possible sense.  The provisions of the Constitution, in so far as international relations are concerned, are expanded by Article 29, which states that Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of that Article specifically require that every international agreement, other than those of a technical or administrative character, to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before Dáil Éireann.  That requirement would clearly relate to any pact or treaty on defence.</P>
    <P>In the formulation of defence policy every country has to take some account of the situation, the attitude and the <Col N="1394" /> interests of its closest neighbours.  In our case this is particularly so in regard to Britain.</P>
    <P>We have always recognised Britain's legitimate concern that her western flank should be secure.  As far back as 1921, Eamon de Valera stated quite clearly that we would provide for our own defence, that we would guarantee to repel by force any foreign power, and that we would allow no outside nation to use Ireland as a base for attack on Britain.  That policy clearly enunciated many times by Eamon de Valera is still our policy.  Britain and ourselves are destined to live as neighbours. The two countries have, as Eamon de Valera said, more interests in common than they have with other nations.  There is, in the words of the Joint Communique issued after my meeting with the British Prime Minister last May, a unique relationship between us; and it is in the interest of the people of both countries that we should seek a solution to our outstanding problems in that context.</P>
    <P>I believe there would be general agreement on the proposition that one of the really important contributions that could be made in the circumstances of today to the security of these islands and indeed of Western Europe as a whole would be a lasting peaceful, political solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A peaceful friendly Ireland would be of significant strategic value to Britain and Europe.  The Northern Ireland situation requires a peaceful solution principally on the grounds of ordinary, humanitarian considerations.  The people of the six counties of Northern Ireland are entitled to live in peace and security and in the better economic and social conditions which peace will bring.</P>
    <P>It is also true, however, that in a world in which the threat of war looms and recedes, a solution to the situation in Northern Ireland becomes increasingly urgent.  When a satisfactory political solution is arrived at, we would of course have to review what would be the most appropriate defence arrangements for the island as a whole.  It would be unrealistic and improvident not to do so.  It would also be mandatory that any such arrangements would require the full <Col N="1395" /> authority of the Irish people deciding on them as a specific issue.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Dáil that we are not under any pressure from any quarter to join NATO.  On the issue as to whether or not we would ever contemplate doing so, I believe I can do no better than quote what Seán Lemass said on this question.</P>
    <P>`There is no possibility that this or any other Irish Government would give an undertaking, in any circumstances, which would impede in any degree the fulfillment of the National will to restore the territorial unity of Ireland. (Dáil Official Report, Vol. 193, No. 1, Col. 11, 14 February 1962).</P>
    <P>That is still our position.</P>
    <P>I want to clearly re-affirm, however, that these are matters for the future. They are not at present under discussion. Our pre-occupation at present is with the political and security problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of our neutrality also arises in another context, our membership of the European Community.  Let us be clear about one thing.  This country stands for certain values, enshrined in the Constitution.  Our place is with the Western democracies, and we share common concepts of human rights, freedom under the law, individual liberty and freedom of conscience.  Our economic interests also are tied in with the Western industralised world.  We are, therefore, neither ideologically neutral nor politically indifferent.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are not a member of any military alliance.  The European Community is not a military organisation or alliance.  The Community does not have a common defence policy. Nevertheless, we have always accepted and said publicly as far back as 1970 that a new political entity within the Community could develop out of the process of integration to which we are committed and which was endorsed by our people in a referendum.  As head of the then Fianna Fáil Government, Jack Lynch said in 1969: &ldquo;Being members of that Community, <Col N="1396" /> we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the Communities.  There is no question of neutrality there&rdquo;, (Dáil Debates, 23 July 1969, Vol. 241, No. 8, Col. 1157).</P>
    <P>In the event, therefore, of the European States being organised into a full political union, we would accept the obligations, even if these included defence.  We could not, and would not, wish to opt out of the obligations and aims inherent in the achievement of the ideal of European unity.</P>
    <P>In thinking about our defence policies, we should not resort either to emotionalism or ideology but rather should we calmly and realistically consider every aspect from the point of view of our own fundamental interests.  The security interests of other countries may be best served by membership of military alliances. Ours at present are best served by a policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>We know from past experience that the position of a non-combatant country in time of war is a far from comfortable one.  Our primary obligation, in such a situation, both from our own point of view and that of our friends, given our strategic position in the North Atlantic, would be to protect and defend ourselves and this island.  We do not wish to become a cause of concern or danger to others.</P>
    <P>While it is not profitable to speculate about an unpredictable future, I do not think we should be unduly apprehensive about alleged plans involving attacks on, or seizure of, parts of Ireland in time of war.  We can be certain that in the thinking of a number of the great military powers, there are plans for all contingencies. The military mind apparently seeks to encompass and plan for every possible eventuality, no matter how improbable some of them may be.</P>
    <P>The possible existence of such contingency plans as well as the appalling destructive capacity of modern weapons point clearly the path we should follow. They underline the urgent need on our part by every political and diplomatic means at our disposal to work on the international scene to secure a reduction in armaments and to promote the cause of peace.  It is in our own self-interest that <Col N="1397" /> we do not shirk our responsibilities in seeking to promote world peace and security.</P>
    <P>Our record to date is an honourable one.  We have been at the forefront of those who proposed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and we have always argued forcefully for comprehensive disarmament. In addition, we have consistently taken up responsible positions on world issues designed to reduce tensions and to solve problems which, left as they are, constitute a serious danger to world peace.</P>
    <P>As members of the UN Security Council we are involved in searching for urgent solutions to world conflicts, wherever they may arise.  We have always supported the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations, and an Irish officer at present commands the UNIFIL contingent in the Lebanon.  Our role and contribution in these operations, which is out of all proportion to our size and population, and which is welcomed and appreciated by our friends and partners, might well be compromised if we were to become members of any particular military alliance.</P>
    <P>Our political commitment to Europe and the western democracies, our military commitment to the UN are the principal determinants of the policy that the Irish Government have followed and will continue to follow.</P>
    <P>Defence policies are expensive.  It is a matter for continuing judgment how best we can meet our essential needs within the limits imposed.  As a developing economy the amount of resources we can provide for our defence must necessarily be limited.  What is certain is that in our circumstances there is no scope for military status symbols.  What we need rather is a commonsense, hard-headed, realistic approach to the basic requirements we have to meet.</P>
    <P>I now invite the House and the country to consider the attitude of the principal Opposition party.  Fine Gael, to these issues as revealed by the statements of three of their principal spokesmen.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Deputy Richie Ryan and Deputy John Kelly.  I turn first to Deputy FitzGerald.  He is quoted in <Col N="1398" /><i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 February 1980, as saying:</P>
    <P>There really isn't such a thing as neutrality today: we are part of Western Europe and our interests coincide with theirs.  Our non-membership of NATO can be useful if we use it properly but we have to face situations like this positively and not dodge them.</P>
    <P>Now hear Deputy Richie Ryan, the official party spokesman on foreign affairs. He said on 8 January 1981:</P>
    <P>If pressure is being applied on us by anybody to alter our neutral status we should be told clearly who is doing it so that we can roundly say no.</P>
    <P>Next we have Deputy John Kelly.  He not alone repudiates any policy of neutrality today but he also condemns any such policy which was adopted in the past.  He furthermore, apparently, believes that we should join NATO.  He said on October 7 1978 that the policy of neutrality did not have &ldquo;respectable antecedents&rdquo; and that &ldquo;if the rest or most of the rest of the free western world is already taking part in a defensive alliance, then self-respect, if nothing else, should require us to review our supposed policy of neutrality&rdquo;. <i>(The Irish Times,</i> 20 October 1978).</P>
    <P>If anyone can construct a coherent defence policy out of these three separate and clearly conflicting attitudes I would be greatly interested in seeing it elaborated.</P>
    <P>I think we are all agreed that Ireland's defence policy is a matter of key national importance.  On our side of the House we have a clear and consistent policy adapted to our circumstances and in keeping with our traditions and behind which we are united.  In the main Opposition party diametrically opposing views are explicitly expressed by at least three front bench spokesmen.</P>
    <P>It is this confusion, I think, which causes them to seek refuge in this unprecedented &ldquo;no mention&rdquo; amendment. When before has any parliamentary assembly in the western world been asked to vote on nothing more substantial than whether a particular topic was mentioned or not mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> The Labour party amendment at least has the virtue of being couched in recognisable parliamentary terms.  Because it speaks, however, simply of &ldquo;neutrality in international affairs&rdquo; it cannot for the reasons I have outlined be accepted by the Government.  Political neutrality or non-alignment is incompatible with our membership of the European Community, and with our interests and our ideals, as I have already explained.  Neutrality, in the sense of not trying to reach common political positions with our European partners, is not a course which the Government could adopt nor would it, we believe, recommend itself to any substantial section of the general public. We can and of course do influence those common positions, so that they reflect our views.  And we can, and do, express these views independently if we choose or if we have to.</P>
    <P>We have a clearly defined national policy on defence.  Our position in international affairs is equally clear and leaves no room for ambiguity and doubt.  So, too, is our stand in pursuit of the aspiration of a united Ireland.  This Government will not be deflected from calmly and firmly pursuing the policies which we are convinced are the right policies for our country and for all her people.</P>
    <P>The studies on which the two Governments are embarked pose no threat to anybody.  The subjects of those studies are set out in the communiqué debated in this House on 11 December 1980.  The studies, which must for the present remain confidential if they are to be worth while and productive, do not represent decisions.  They represent a process of exploration by experienced officials of the ground to be covered and when they are completed they will be submitted to the British Prime Minister and myself for whatever political decisions we may be in a position to take.</P>
    <P>A way forward must be found.  There is no section of the population on this island that can benefit from a perpetuation of the present situation.  In our view progress can be made by the two sovereign Governments acting in concert and re-examining all aspects of their relationships. <Col N="1400" /> Let me give this final assurance. No matter what the circumstances nothing will ever be done by this Government that would jeopardise or prejudice the safety of our people, the security of the State, the independence and sovereignty of the nation, or the eventual unity of Ireland in peace and harmony.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann reaffirms the principle of the neutrality of Ireland in international affairs and declares that our foreign and defence policies will continue to be based on this principle&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move the amendment tabled in the name of all Labour Deputies in the House.  In doing so, I wish to say that I consider this debate to be one of the most important we have had, or will have, during the lifetime of this Dáil.  It is concerned with matters of fundamental importance which demand clear statements of position from all of us who contribute to it.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin my remarks by outlining briefly the long tradition of Labour Party commitment to neutrality.  I do so to indicate that what we in this party say during this debate in support of our amendment is not a passing whim and our position does not arise from a set of circumstances particular to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1914, James Connolly, founder of our party, became President of the Irish Neutrality League which was founded &ldquo;for the purpose of defining Ireland's <Col N="1401" /> attitude towards the Anglo-German War as one of neutrality.&rdquo;  He, and the party following his death, sustained that position throughout the First World War.</P>
    <P>Again in 1919, at the International Labour Conference in Berne during which this country gained international recognition as a separate entity for the first time, Cathal O Shannon and Tom Johnson re-echoed Labour's position of neutrality.</P>
    <P>In 1928, at the Second Conference of Labour Parties and Trade Unions from Commonwealth countries, my predecessor, Tom Johnson, stated our position unequivocally for the first time since national independence.  He said then &ldquo;it is not unreasonable to fear that Great Britain may again become involved in wars as to which none of the Dominions has any direct interest or responsibility. In the case of such an event it would seem unquestionable that some, at least, of the other states forming the British commonwealth would desire to be acknowledged as free from responsibility and immune from attack, so far as international law can secure immunity, unless they committed a belligerent act, or so long as they maintained neutrality.&rdquo;  Later in the same year, Johnson again advocated the message of neutrality at the Conference of Inter-Parliamentary Union in Washington.</P>
    <P>Many times during the 1930s and, of course, during the Second World War, Labour leaders reaffirmed their belief in neutrality.  In 1941, for example, the then Chairman of our party, Michael Keyes, said that &ldquo;as a neutral country we have no war aims to declare.  But neutrality itself is an important aim.  It has been the aim of the Labour Party from its inception. We proclaimed it in Dáil Éireann, in party conferences and in election manifestos &mdash; we proclaimed it when others who applaud it today were discussing the conditions under which the country might participate in a European War.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For us in this party, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is clear from what I have said that our commitment to neutrality is deep and abiding and cannot be seen as a pragmatic response to any given set of events or conditions which existed at <Col N="1402" /> given moments in the past or which exist today.</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party's commitment to neutrality began earlier and is deeper than is the case with the other parties in this House, it is nonetheless true that there is a strong national tradition on the subject.  Time does not permit me to deal with the matter comprehensively.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes asserted that the national tradition of neutrality is essentially a pragmatic one, which derived either from our desire to stay out of the Second World War or from our desire to use neutrality as a bargaining ploy to end partition either at that time or subsequently.</P>
    <P>This is not the case.  Since the foundation of the State there has been a commitment in principle to neutrality by successive governments which was expressed with greater or lesser degrees of clarity at different times.</P>
    <P>In 1927, in a debate on the Defence Force Bill in Dáil Éireann, Kevin O'Higgins, a member of the Free State Government, said that neutrality is &ldquo;a consummation devoutly to be wished&rdquo;. He said this in response to questions from Tom Johnson.  It is important to note that this position was set out by the legislature before Mr. de Valera entered the Dáil, indicating that the tradition of this House's commitment to neutrality did not derive from him, although he clearly continued and developed it.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in his first contribution on external affairs in Dáil Éireann in 1927, Mr. de Valera complained that the desire for neutrality had not been made sufficiently explicit.  He wanted it to be made clear that &ldquo;if there were to be another Imperial War ... it is the wish of the Irish people to be neutral in that war&rdquo;. This assertion on his part had nothing to do with partition &mdash; it derived solely from a conviction concerning the principle of neutrality and its value to us as an independent, small nation.</P>
    <P>Later, in 1936, Mr. de Valera again spoke on neutrality, but this time from the perspective of a wider experience. Following the collapse of the League of Nations, in which body he had played a prominent part, he again reaffirmed his <Col N="1403" /> commitment to neutrality.  In Dáil Éireann in that year, he said &ldquo;The small states of Europe have begun to look to their own defence ... we want to be neutral&rdquo;.  That remained the objective of his policy into the future as it had been prior to that date.  It was stated clearly and unequivocally before the issues of neutrality and partition became linked from 1938 onwards.</P>
    <P>The strength of our commitment to neutrality became even more obvious in the immediate post-war period.  The first Inter-Party Government, when faced with the choice, refused to join NATO. Although the reason for their refusal was the British occupation of Northern Ireland, this explanation must be seen as no more than an easy excuse which reflected the anti-partitionist mood of the people at the time.  The fact is that no Irish Government, even if it wished to do so could have brought Ireland into NATO at the time, such was the commitment to neutrality and independence in international affairs felt by the vast majority of the population.</P>
    <P>The fact that this was so can be seen by the tremendous groundswell of popular support for Ireland's role in the United Nations from 1957 onwards.  Our value to the United Nations during the decade following that year was based on our willingness to exercise independent judgments on matters of substantial international importance.  The national pride which was engendered during that period followed directly from the fact that we had, and were seen to have, an independent posture which gave us an international stature far greater than our size or economic prosperity could reasonably warrant.</P>
    <P>During the period 1957 to 1961, in particular, the Irish Government, through Mr. Aiken, exercised outstanding influence in the United Nations simply and solely because they developed policies and positions independently of the two power blocs and based largely on a moral perception of what was required to maintain order and peace in the world. During those years, Ireland was active in pursuit of the great goals of mankind &mdash;<Col N="1404" /> the reduction of cold war tensions, military disengagement in Central Europe, nuclear non-proliferation and Chinese participation in the United Nations itself.</P>
    <P>It is true that this period of &ldquo;independent&rdquo; high-profile action did not last for as long as it should.  It is also true, however, that it had the support of the vast majority of people in this country and that it gave us an international credibility which we would not otherwise have had.  The important point, for this debate, is that it happened and it happened because we chose then, if not since, to base our foreign policy firmly and confidently on our traditional neutrality.</P>
    <P>It is true that at roughly the same time that Ireland's &ldquo;independent&rdquo; policy in the United Nations was drawing to a close, Mr. Lemass was beginning to think in terms of an integrated European foreign and defence policy.  His motivation was primarily economic &mdash; that is to say, he felt that if the price of entry to the EEC with its economic benefits, as he saw it, was a watering-down of neutrality, then so be it.  Nonetheless the fact remains that Mr. Lemass never found it possible to say bluntly that Irish neutrality was negotiable.  Nor did his successor, Deputy Lynch.  They both recognised that the strength of feeling domestically in favour of neutrality was such that it could not be shaken, no matter how great their personal popularity might be.  We have had to wait until today for a head of government who feels that he can throw away our neutrality, as if it were just one more commodity which is expendable on the altar of short-term expediency.</P>
    <P>The tendency to seek ways to slip away from our traditional stance on neutrality which has been evident since the mid-1960's arises, I believe, from a shift in the orientation of foreign policy away from the international arena towards the European Community.  There is clearly no reason why membership of the European Community should affect our foreign policy if we do not wish it to do so, but clearly there is now a tendency to allow ourselves to be drawn into discussion of common foreign and defence policies, <Col N="1405" /> particularly during European summit meetings.</P>
    <P>Recent reports that An Taoiseach, not only sat through a discussion of heads of government on a common European defence policy, but also failed to make a case for the neutralist position, are very disturbing.  I know it is easy for the head of government of a small, relatively powerless, state such as ours to feel important in the company of more powerful leaders as they discuss common defence systems, cruise missiles and so on.  But it is not his business to acquiesce in discussion of these matters when he has no mandate to do so.  Our entry to the European Community imposed no obligations on us to become involved in multilateral defence pacts or to abandon our traditional foreign policy.  The Government made this clear at the time, when it was stated by them that EEC membership imposed no foreign policy obligations on us under the terms of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>When this was raised by the Labour Party in the referendum on our entry into the EEC Fianna Fáil, then in government, brought out a special leaflet on the subject assuring the Irish people that there was no obligation as far as foreign policy or defence policy was concerned. Are we to take that clear, unequivocal statement by the Fianna Fáil Government at that time as being a guide to the clear, unequivocal statement we have heard from the head of a Fianna Fáil Government here today?</P>
    <P>We now find the Taoiseach privately discussing the abandonment of neutrality at European summits.  Who gave him the authority to do so?  What is he saying to Mrs. Thatcher and President Giscard d'Estaing in our name?</P>
    <P>Let me spell out what he seems to be prepared to abandon.  A policy of neutrality in the modern world does not amount simply to an assertion that one wishes to avoid being drawn into war and, therefore, wishes simply to remain independent of the two main power blocs.  It is both of these things, but is more.  In the nuclear age, no country can be passively neutral with credibility.  We cannot stand aside from the world, declaring our neutrality, and hoping that <Col N="1406" /> the nuclear dust will not fall on us when London is hit, nor can we believe that declaring our neutrality will save us from invasion, if someone wishes to invade us. In the event of war, whether our neutrality is respected or not will have little to do with us and everything to do with the strategic requirements of the belligerents.</P>
    <P>The value of neutrality, to us and to the world, lies in preventing war not in escaping from it.  At a time of high tension in the world, at a time of growing instability and the breakdown of détente, there is a need for more independent voices, not less.  As the two power blocs face up to each other with growing fear and distrust what is required of small nations is not that they take sides but that they stand up for humanity between the belligerents.</P>
    <P>When Labour today seek to reaffirm our neutrality, therefore, we are not saying that we should close our eyes to the outside world and withdraw into a neutralist cocoon.  Rather we are saying that we should go out into the international arena with positive proposals for peace, with positive opposition to those who interfere with the rights of sovereign states, and with a commitment to work with other neutral or non-aligned nations in favour of a world order which might offer the prospect of avoiding mass, global destruction.</P>
    <P>Our concept of neutrality policy is one based on active intervention in international affairs from a position of independence and moral strength.  With it we would seek, with other states of similar views, to mediate between the great power blocs in the interest of peace, détente and disarmament.  Our standing in the international political arena, which even today is far greater than our GNP alone would warrant, derives from earlier demonstrations of that independence of mind demonstrated mainly by Mr. de Valera as President of the League of Nations and by Mr. Aiken in the United Nations between 1957-61.</P>
    <P>We can build on that reputation again if we wish to do so in the years ahead, by once again demonstrating that Ireland has an independent foreign and defence <Col N="1407" /> policy, that we decide on each issue as it arises on the basis of a moral perception of the world, and that we are not merely a rubber stamp endorsing the foreign policy of others.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the Government are prepared to consider forming a defence pact with Britain in the course of the current London-Dublin talks.  Certainly suggestions to this effect have not been denied by the Government side, despite repeated questions on the subject. The Minister for Foreign Affairs indeed has indicated that the matter is very much on the agenda.</P>
    <P>I wish to say this to the Government. They must not fall into the trap of trading our neutrality for some imagined settlement of the Northern problem.  Mr. de Valera avoided the trap in 1941 and it would be a profound tragedy and mistake if the Taoiseach fell into it now.</P>
    <P>There are one or two questions which arose in the Taoiseach's speech.  I have mentioned one which I would like to mention again and re-inforce it.  It comes clearly from the Taoiseach's speech that as far as neutrality is concerned it is not a matter of principle in the eyes of the Government, that it can be bargained away if, again in the view of the Government, certain advantages might appear to accrue to the nation.  It is now being implied, if not actually stated, that our membership of the EEC imposes some obligation on us with regard to both foreign policy and defence policy and that at some future date the Government would be prepared to abandon our neutrality within the EEC context.  That is one aspect of it.</P>
    <P>This issue was raised during the referendum and because of the strength of feeling and commitment by the ordinary people of the country to our tradition of neutrality the Fianna Fáil Government at that time issued a special leaflet, without any reservation whatsoever, assuring the Irish people that our entry to the EEC would not in the slightest have any implication as far as our defence or our foreign policy attitudes were concerned.  Nowhere in the Treaty of Rome are either of those two issues mentioned.  If the <Col N="1408" /> Government wish to abandon our neutrality so far as foreign policy is concerned, should they not be obliged to have another referendum regarding our membership of the EEC?</P>
    <P>At the beginning of his speech the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>I wish to state unequivocally that the Government are not discussing or negotiating any kind of secret agreement on defence with Britain or with any other country or group of countries.</P>
    <P>What is the significance of the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; in this context?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach elaborate on the use of this word in this way?  Is he prepared to tell us, without any qualification whatever, if there has been or if there will be discussion at any level &mdash; prime ministerial, ministerial or civil service level &mdash; which would involve an abandonment of our neutral position and/or or a military pact with Great Britain or with any other foreign power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the famous meeting I pointed out here what I believed had taken place on that occasion: that was that so far as the constitutional position of Northern Ireland was concerned, there may have been a reference to it, but no serious discussion of it.  We were told repeatedly from the other side of the House that the meeting was historic.  What was implied was that a major breakthrough had been made on the question of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.  There was no strong denial from Great Britian in this regard. So far as internal security and Border security were concerned I believed that the British Government had been very relieved as a result of the attitude of the Taoiseach, that they found him extremely co-operative.  Before he became Taoiseach he made noises about fly-overs, about military presence and so on but there was no further reference by him to these matters after he became Taoiseach.  The British Government have no wish to upset him, that is, so long as <Col N="1409" /> they do not have to pay a price for his co-operation.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was making party political capital out of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, Mrs. Thatcher was prepared to remain quiet but then she began to realise that there was a cost involved for her.  Anybody with any brains would have realised that the Protestant population in Northern Ireland would have become frightened and, consequently, a golden opportunity was provided for one of the greatest bigots that this century has known, Mr. Paisley, to stir up the Protestant people and frighten them.  It was then that Mrs. Thatcher began to realise that there was a political price to pay and she said quite unequivocally that the talks did not include the constitutional position.  While appearing with me on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on television, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that there was no question of defence being discussed and there was raised again the smokescreen of institutional positions.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot have it both ways.  The area in question is much too dangerous for that.  We are not talking about a vote-catching exercise but about people being killed.  Either everything is on the table for discussion, and that includes the constitutional position of the North as well as our neutrality, or everything is not on the table which would mean that there have been certain exclusions. If there are exclusions, one of them must be the constitutional position, but is our neutrality one of the other exclusions? The people are entitled to know what is included and what is excluded.  In particular, our fellow Irishmen and women in Northern Ireland are entitled to this information.  Otherwise, Mr. Paisley will continue to go on his rampage all over the place, thereby causing more death and destruction.  The Taoiseach has created a time bomb.  Let him diffuse it now without any regard for electoral advantage.  We are prepared to forfeit any such advantage on our part.  Let the Taoiseach do the same.  The issue we are talking about is one of human life.  I do not believe that the constitutional position is under discussion but it suits the <Col N="1410" /> Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil to be somewhat ambiguous in this respect.  We must know what is meant by the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; as used in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>

      <P>The subjects of those studies are set out in the communique debated in this House on 11 December, 1980.  The studies, which must for the present remain confidential....</P>
      <P>Both Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Atkins told the House of Commons what is not included.  If there is no significance in the use of the words &ldquo;secret&rdquo; and &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; as used in the Taoiseach's speech, let him tell us so.  If he believes that the Irish people would be prepared to support his bartering one matter of fundamental importance to us as a nation for something else that is also fundamental, he is mistaken.  While both the question of our neutrality and that of the unity of our country are of extreme importance to us one must not be bartered for the other.  The Taoiseach would be making a very big mistake in considering such a possibility as the higher plane to which to raise the issue of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognising the new needs of our times and in accordance with our traditional policy of neutrality now resolve to establish without doubt the reality of this neutrality and further in order to strengthen the forces of peace resolve to seek membership of the Non-Aligned Nations of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has only himself to blame if he considers himself to be aggrieved as a result of being asked to discuss this issue here.  There seems to be little doubt but that the Taoiseach is not playing fair, that he is not being straight with us.  He has stated unequivocally that the Government are not discussing or negotiating any kind of secret agreement on defence with Great Britain or with any other country or group of countries, but why, then, in reply to a question tabled by Deputy FitzGerald and me on 11 February did the Taoiseach consider it necessary to give us an answer extending to four pages, though leaving us still in doubt as to what exactly he meant?  The result has been the need for the introduction of this motion and the discussion of the question of whether we are negotiating a defence pact with Britain.  As reported at column 1511 of the Official Report for February 11 the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The subject matter of the joint studies commissioned by the British Prime Minister and me at our meeting in Dublin last December includes possible new institutional structures, citizenship rights, security matters, economic co-operation and measures to encourage mutual understanding.</P>
    <P>Why did he give us all that sort of waffle when the simple statement at the beginning of his speech, which I have quoted, was the answer we were looking for?</P>
    <P>This discussion has more than one advantage, certainly for a private Member like myself, given an opportunity of speaking on it.  The Taoiseach made a <Col N="1412" /> fair comment in his criticism of the Opposition &mdash; the Fine Gael, not the Labour Party Opposition.  Nobody could criticise the comments made just now by Deputy Cluskey which were clear-cut and unequivocal in the Labour Party's defence of neutrality.  On the eve of a general election it is only fair that we should get a contribution from the leader of the Opposition to clear up points referred to by the Taoiseach.  It is much too serious an issue to leave to the minor and unimportant Fine Gael amendment, which the Taoiseach is right in ridiculing.</P>
    <P>This discussion and the Minister's speech are in the context of truly terrifying changes in the community of the whole world, in the failure of <i>détente,</i> the possibilities in Poland, Afghanistan, and&mdash; I dislike saying this about a foreign politician &mdash; the election of Mr. Reagan, who is clearly a very aggressive, very militaristic type of gentleman, with General Haig as his secretary.  There is also El Salvador and the recent disclosure in the Mary Holland article about the attitude of the military about a country like ours in the case of an atomic war.  We would simply be expendable.  As far as the Soviet Union would be considered, this is speculation on their part.  It may or may not be true.  These are the references made in the mock battle plans of the Dutch Treaty, in which all our ports and our major population centres would be obliterated.</P>
    <P>Statements were made some years ago that we could be what the military, in their wonderful euphemistic abuse of language, call the pre-empted strike, merely a lesson to the Soviet Union not to go to war and they simply obliterate the Emerald Isle.  That is a military possibility. Another American general said that World War I was fought in Europe, World War II was fought in Europe and, please God, World War III will be fought in Europe.  In the context of that kind of talking and thinking, surely it is highly silly for the Taoiseach to include in his speech the guarantee to repel by force any foreign power and not to allow any outside nation to use Ireland as a base for attack on Britain.  What force?  What force could repel a H-bomb on Dublin, <Col N="1413" /> another on Shannon, another wherever they like to drop it?  It is completely unrealistic to talk like that.  Many may be old enough to remember the Polish cavalry charging bravely into the panzer divisions during the invasion of Poland. It took about 20 minutes to eliminate them.  Some may be old enough to remember the Maginot Line.  A panzer division simply went around this insuperable barrier to invasion.</P>
    <P>It is now 40 years later.  Things have changed, inutterably and terrifyingly so. We cannot continue with this kind of cliché, with empty, meaningless phrases. We must try to think out some alternative for the old idea that we could sit on the touchline.  There are no more touchlines. Nobody will survive, not even the great powers.  It is as bad as that.  However, in the run up to the destruction of the great powers by one another, we must be among the early starters.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious contradiction in the Taoiseach's speech, which perhaps he can answer.  He restates the undertaking that there is no question of our entering into, discussing or negotiating any secret agreement on defence with Britian or with any other country or group of countries, the reason given being the North of Ireland question, the fact that Britain is in occupation of the six north-eastern counties.  Yet on a number of occasions he quoted Deputy Lynch and Deputy Lemass, and he himself has restated, that we are prepared to enter into a defence agreement with the countries of the EEC. the European Communities, of whom one happens to be Britain, who is in control of the six north-eastern counties. It is a specification of the EEC defence pact, of which we would become, apparently, a member, that we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the Communities &mdash; that is, Britain &mdash; and that there is no question of neutrality.  That is a Dáil quotation of Deputy Lynch.  The Taoiseach himself said that in the event of the European states being organised into a full, political union we would accept the obligations, even if these included defence.  With or without the British in occupation in the six counties?  Must they <Col N="1414" /> go first?  Is that a pre-condition to joining a European defence agreement of any kind?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey is, of course, quite right.  I have been asking questions as long as I have been here about defence commitments in the EEC.  I must have asked about 50 questions.  Repeatedly, it has been established by both sides that there are no defence commitments under the Treaty of Rome.  It was on that that we fought the referendum.  It was made clear on a number of occasions recently that we are tending &mdash; and Deputy FitzGerald is equally culpable on this &mdash; to move into the new position of accepting the defence commitment of the EEC. This is not the commitment on which the referendum was fought and, I submit, we have no right to move our people into this sort of development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey raised the secret agreement.  Could I ask interested Deputies to study an article by Ronan Fanning, Department of Irish History, UCD, published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 5 November 1980?  He talked about the foundation of NATO.  I happened to be in a Coalition Government at that time, 1949.  Then we heard much the same as we received from the Taoiseach today and in his answers when he is being unequivocal.  May I say that the statements of Deputy Lenihan Minister for Foreign Affairs, are very difficult to keep up with?  In this connection I mention his statement that &ldquo;Everything is on the table&rdquo; which led many of us to think defence was included, because &ldquo;everything&rdquo; should include defence.  He also said there would be no question of Ireland participating in any form of military alliance with Britain or any group of countries as long as this country is partitioned. At the same time he is making the case that we must form part of a defence commitment in Europe.  How does one resolve that conflict?</P>
    <P>The origins and development of NATO are interesting.  At the time we were asked by the Americans to join NATO.  The classical answer was given by Mr. MacBride &ldquo;Any military alliance, with or without involving military action, jointly with the state that is responsible for the unnatural division of <Col N="1415" /> Ireland ... would be entirely repugnant to the Irish people.&rdquo;  That sounds very good and very impressive in the old tradition of de Valera's rejection on the grounds of partition of our country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey's question introduced an interesting twist which came as a surprise to me, although I had my suspicion at the time.  There was a letter by a State Department official about the negotiations on NATO.  It was said that Ireland would be an important stepping stone in anti-submarine warfare and was to be asked again to join NATO.  Mr. MacBride, it appears, replied that we would be delighted to join NATO provided the United States could get the British to give back the six northern counties.  The United States simply replied &ldquo;It was nice knowing you&rdquo; and that was that.</P>
    <P>It appears secret negotiations were entered into for joining NATO.  The National Security Council of the United States then reconsidered the question of joining NATO and an alternative was put forward of a bilateral US/Irish defence treaty.  This was negotiated by the then Ambassador and Sean MacBride.  President Truman was told that Mr. MacBride had volunteered to make an all-out effort to secure bipartisan support for a bilateral treaty.  The secret negotiations were pursued further and later a direct approach was made.  In 1951 private representations were made to Truman, the Security Council said they did not want to do business with us and they were turned down.  The American National Security Council's attitude to us was updated in the sixties and was not changed, the general attitude being they would sooner annoy the Irish than offend the British.  So much for the Irish-American vote.</P>
    <P>I am giving this information simply to eliminate the Americans as a possible source of a defence agreement.  There still exists the possibility that there may be bartering of the Six Counties, of which we were all so rightly suspicious because of the equivocation and doubts expressed by the Taoiseach.  That could still be going on in much the same way and none of us will know about it until 30 years <Col N="1416" /> later with the publication of the Thatcher Papers.</P>
    <P>I put out the suggestion that our role lies with the non-aligned countries, mostly Third World, ex-colonial, anti-imperialist countries, countries with the same poverty-stricken backgrounds as we have and people with whom it is much more natural that we should be associated. It does not seem to matter much whether we expand our Army, increase our Air Corps, or develop our Navy. There is little or no hope of any serious defence.  Even the Soviets have accepted that and the United States have probably accepted it, too, except they are further away from the Soviets and Europe and they could possibly survive but would be terribly damaged and wounded.</P>
    <P>The logic of this seems to be &mdash; and I am glad the Taoiseach referred to it &mdash; to pursue unrelentlessly peace efforts wherever we can with the non-aligned countries. There is a new group of non-aligned countries &mdash; about 100 of them, a considerable body compared to when it was started by Marshal Tito 20 years ago. They include India and Cuba, although they have been criticised for including the latter.  These are countries which are not completely pro-socialist or pro-capitalist and who are anxious to create a completely new social and economic order in society, defending the right of primary producers to protect their prices as well as working for disarmament. These are all countries with whom we should be very proud to be associated. President Nyerere believes that there should be general disarmament and the resources released should be spent on the economic and social development of the poorer countries.  I do not believe that is Utopian, although it sounds impracticable.</P>
    <P>The prospects are so horrifying and the problem so insuperable that the only thing we can do is to fight tenaciously to retain our independent status.  It must be remembered that France still retains its independence within the EEC.  We have been told both by the Americans and by the Soviets that we are of most value as an independent, neutral, non-committed nation.  What can we offer Europe in <Col N="1417" /> military hardware?  Little or nothing compared to what we can offer by the moral force of our continued assertion of the sanity of peace.  We must attempt to hold the line between the two great powers.</P>
    <P>There is another group of more advanced countries consisting of Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden who are known as the &ldquo;like-minded&rdquo; group.  They are like-minded with the underdeveloped, non-aligned countries. To what extent have we moved across to this group?  Is it a fact that it is proposed to hold a conference of these countries in Ireland?  In spite of the difference in political outlook of many of these countries varying from India to Cuba, they have a wonderful record of agreement on the objective of attempting to pursue the welfare of the underdeveloped countries as well as the major objective of encouraging the great powers on the matter of disarmament.  Obviously we should do everything possible to encourage the reopening of negotiations on the SALT II Agreement and attempt to get some movement at the Madrid peace conference. Where there is any likelihood that our intervention could reduce the exacerbation of differences between the two great powers, we should lose no opportunity of taking action.  A great advance is our position on the Security Council. We must be seen at all times as an independent, neutral, non-committed nation.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in a recent article that a possible defence mechanism would be to establish our neutrality by mining the sea posts and airports and threatening to blow them up in the event of attempted occupation by any other country.  Such an outrageous proposal was seriously put forward by a military strategist, although I understand it would not save us.  New aerodromes could be built quite quickly and battleships could cruise off the west coast.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable conclusion that we must first rid ourselves of the sense of complacency which permeates the Taoiseach's speech that we are being protected in some way by NATO.  That is not true.  There is nothing to stop either of the two great powers using this country <i>pour encourager les autres.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> A small token of the kind of force we can use is well illustrated by our response to the behaviour of the United States in El Salvador.  The Minister must be congratulated on our refusal to give any encouragement to and our condemnation of such behaviour.</P>

      <P>I would be glad if the Taoiseach would leave us in no doubt that he does not take the view that in negotiating for the six north-eastern counties they are or should be in any way a <i>quid pro quo,</i> but takes the view that the unity of our country is something which should be a natural, reasonable progression through changing attitudes to one another, both North and South, and that it cannot be bartered for and should not be bartered as an alternative to joining any defence alliance or agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition was not here when I referred to it, but as this is the eve of a general election I would ask him when replying to attempt to make sense out of the conflicting policies to which Deputy Haughey rightly referred and also whether he has a more constructive pursuit of peace policy than put forward by Deputy Haughey.  Because he is an important person as the leader of the Opposition I would also ask him whether he still believes it is permissible for him to remain a member of the tri-lateral commission which is a group of people who are not pursuing peace.  They are known as Rockefeller's private club, the king makers, the hidden GHQ of the Western world, the most powerful private body of men the world has ever known.  Their pursuit of power is the pursuit of power of the Western aggressively capitalist societies.  It seems to me that the correct people with whom we politicians in a small relatively poor country should be associated &mdash; with our historical <Col N="1419" /> ex-colonial background, our empty anti-imperialist background &mdash; are the non-aligned countries rather than with the great moguls of organisations like the tri-lateral commission, the oil magnates, the bankers and all these other very wealthy members of the US, Western European and Japanese societies.</P>

      <P>I conclude by hoping that we will get from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs clarification on the points raised as to how it will be possible to form a new defence agreement with a number of countries which include Britain and still not be sure whether we have an occupied North of Ireland and I also seek clarification from the Opposition on the very real conflicts of attitudes as expressed by the Taoiseach's speech in regard to the Fine Gael defence policy.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to be drawn into a discussion on the tri-lateral commission of which I am a member and which I know has a reputation among left-wing circles in Europe as being a capitalist plot designed to take over the world and in right-wing quarters in America as being an international communist plot to take over the world.  It is something more modest than that and I find it useful to be a member of it.  I am presenting a report on the Middle East to it at the end of the month.  However, it has nothing to do with this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make the position of my party on neutrality clear.  Fine Gael recognise that Ireland has an interest in the maintenance of an equilibrium between east and west and in the security of the west of which we form a geographical part and whose political system of pluralist democracy we have made our own. But Fine Gael favour military neutrality through non-participation in the existing defence alliances of the west &mdash; NATO and the Western European Union.  We do so for a number of reasons.  First, <Col N="1420" /> because we believe this policy accords with the current sentiments of our people and, secondly, because, as we found in Government, Ireland can play a more useful role in promoting world peace outside these organisations than it would be likely we could do within them.  The Taoiseach's attempt to confuse this issue by selective quotations from Fine Gael speeches is unconvincing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan's statement &mdash; and he will confirm this himself if he has the opportunity to speak &mdash; referred to pressure alleged to have been placed on us to join NATO in relation to the question of military neutrality.  With respect to Deputy John Kelly, his view is a personal one &mdash; the counterpart of that of Deputy Noel Davern who is quoted in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 8 March as saying that he favours Ireland joining NATO immediately. They are both entitled to their personal points of view.</P>
    <P>As a party which supported entry to the European Community we accepted that, in theory at least, this Community could have evolved into a politically integrated federation and that, if this had happened, such a development would have been likely to have entailed defence commitments.  But this has not happened, and there is no sign that it is likely to do so.  In the absence of such a development, sentiment in Ireland in favour of military neutrality has grown.</P>
    <P>In Government as Minister for Foreign Affairs I pursued consistently the policy of non-involvement in military alliances. Moreover, I missed no opportunity of putting forward to our EEC partners, and to the Government of the United States through its Secretary of State, the reasons why Ireland should not participate in NATO or Western European Union, and I believe that our arguments in this respect secured a considerable measure of acceptance.  It is from this clear-cut stance, which I last week reaffirmed unambiguously in Brussels at a Christian Democratic Meeting, that I approach this debate.</P>
    <P>Having made this clear at the outset, I have to say that the wording of this motion. &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann confirms the <Col N="1421" /> principles which have guided the defence policy of the Government and their predecessors&rdquo; is meaningless, for the simple reason that there is no set of principles that has guided this Government and their Fianna Fáil predecessors in relation to defence policy.  I shall show this by quoting from the statements of various leaders of that party at different periods.</P>
    <P>As we are being asked to vote for a meaningless formula, my party will vote against this motion.  If nevertheless it is passed, we shall seek to force from this Government a clarification of their actual policy with regard to a possible defence pact with Britain which they have hitherto denied to this House.  We shall do this by putting them to the test of voting an amendment to the motion which explicitly states that the question of a defence pact was not raised in the discussions that have taken place and that it is &mdash; contrary to what the Northern Ireland Secretary has clearly indicated &mdash; to be the subject of some of the joint studies now under way.</P>
    <P>Our stance on the motion before this House has also been influenced by the fact that the motion put down by the Government is clearly designed to avoid this net issue, first raised in press reports and then confirmed by the Northern Ireland Secretary.  Mr. Atkins has stated that the defence issue can &mdash; in contrast to the constitutional issue of the North-South relationship &mdash; be talked about in the continuing discussions, but that it was too early to say when a decision on a defence pact might be made.  So far along the road does he conceive things as having gone.  It is a question of when, not whether.</P>
    <P>The absurdity of this motion lies in the simple fact that Fianna Fáil have made so many contradictory statements on defence policy over the years that there is not such thing as a defence policy laid down by that party or Government.  This applies both to the question of NATO membership and to the broader question of neutrality.</P>
    <P>In 1951 Mr. de Valera developed the theme of military neutrality <i>vis-à-vis</i> NATO along the following lines.  He was <Col N="1422" /> asked whether a united Ireland might join NATO.  He replied:</P>
    <P>A free Ireland would probably have the same inducement to join as other nations...To join the pact at present would be to accept the present situation as one that should be preserved and maintained.</P>
    <P>What he meant by that is clear from a further quotation from a year later when he said:</P>
    <P>Membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation...implies acceptance by each member of the territorial integrity of each of the several States comprising it.  Now Britan claims as an integral part of her territory six of Ireland's counties.  Ireland can never admit that claim and must refrain from appearing in any way to accept it.</P>
    <P>But a mere ten years later, at the time of our first application for EEC membership, his succesor, Mr. Lemass, was repudiating this de Valera thesis, with his usual blunt forthrightness, questioning whether the de Valera interpretation of the North Atlantic Treaty was &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo;.  I am quoting from the same column of the same debate from which the Taoiseach quoted selectively. Mr. Lemass argued that if Ireland kept on insisting that:</P>
    <P>the North Atlantic Treaty bears the interpretation we have put on it over the years, that it involves an undertaking to do nothing about partition, to abandon our aims with respect to partition, we can well be met with the argument that, in so far as we signed the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Charter of the United Nations, we have already abandoned our position on partition.  That would be manifestly absurd.</P>
    <P>So much for Fianna Fail having a consistent policy on Ireland's position with relation to NATO.  And so much for the attempt by the Taoiseach to use an excerpt from a speech by Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach to suggest that Deputy Lemass was saying that we would never contemplate joining NATO, when in fact <Col N="1423" /> the full quotation from Deputy Lemass, had he included the previous sentence, shows that he was denying that partition was any obstacle to our joining NATO. This is a classic example of selective quotation even in this House.</P>
    <P>What about the basic issue of neutrality itself?  The same total contradiction between Fiann Fáil policies on this more fundamental issue is also evident.  For in 1941 Mr. de Valera in a broadcast said:</P>
    <P>The aim of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people of the present generation is to secure the status of a sovereign independent Irish State... if possible with its neutrality internationally guaranteed like the neutrality of Switzerland.</P>
    <P>But this fundamentalist position was also unceremoniously overturned by Mr. de Valera's successor, Mr. Lemass, who in 1962, in an interview with the Foreign Editor of the <i>New York Times</i> said:</P>
    <P>We recognise that a military commitment will be an inevitable consequence of our joining the Common Market and ultimately we would be prepared to yield even the technical label of neutrality.  We are prepared to go into this integrated Europe without any reservation as to how far this will take us in the field of foreign policy and defence.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass's successor in turn, Deputy Jack Lynch, in July 1969 denied that &ldquo;the word neutrality is relevant in the context of our membership of the EEC&rdquo; which had yet to be consummated at that time.  &ldquo;We applied for membership of the Communities&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;because we believed in their aims and objects and because we believed that it would be in our best interest to do so.  Being members of that community, we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the Communities. There is no question of neutrality there&rdquo;. Dr. Hillery, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, in May 1970 said that &ldquo;when the Community develops and if we are members of a fully developed Community, and if the political unity develops to having <Col N="1424" /> a common defence force, we will be part of it&rdquo;.  These statements by Mr. Lemass, Deputy Lynch, and President Hillery as Minister for Foreign Affairs, are in total opposition to the concept of neutrality, guaranteed internationally like that of Switzerland, which Mr. de Valera espoused.</P>
    <P>So whether one has regard to our policy in relation to NATO, or to our more general attitude on the basic issue of neutrality, there is no set of common principles that have guided the defence policy of the Government and their predecessors. The motion is thus clearly nonsensical in itself, and my party will accordingly oppose it, both on these grounds, and because the motion is a deliberate evasion of the issues currently under debate.</P>
    <P>There is the issue of whether or not the Taoiseach has discussed a possible defence pact with the British Prime Minister. If this did happen, it would seem to have occurred on his initiative, not hers, judging by her very carefully worded denial that she raised the matter with him.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the issue of whether or not defence is to be the subject of some of the joint studies as the Northern Ireland Secretary of State has indicated while at the same time suggesting that it is too early to say when a decision on such a defence pact might be made. Those are two issues we must settle in this debate.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with these evasions I want first to return to a matter I mentioned at the outset &mdash; the positive merits of our present policy of non-participation in a military alliance.  Fine Gael believe that in present world circumstances Ireland has a special role to play as the only member of the EEC which is not a member of NATO, WEU or any other military alliance.  This unique status reflects in part Ireland's history as a former colony and in part the instinctive sympathy of many of its people for the peoples of the Third World, a sympathy that derives more remotely from many individual Irish people's participation in the short-lived British imperial experiment, and in larger part from a widespread missionary experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> From this basis Ireland has, within the general parameters of a military neutrality consonant with a recognition of a common western interest in the problem of maintaining a balance with Soviet power, undertaken actions and espoused policies, in each case by one or other Government and in each case supported by the Opposition, as follows: (i) We initiated the approach to the 1961 nuclear proliferation treaty, and maintained a subsequent concern about this issue.  (2) We maintained a sympathetic attitude to the process of decolonisation.  (3) We actively supported, in a manner that proved influential within European political co-operation, the concept of a settlement in Rhodesia involving the Patriotic Front, rather than the so-called &ldquo;internal settlement&rdquo;.  I know from sources within the British Government how much they valued the support given first by our Government and then by Fianna Fáil on this issue within European political co-operation which enabled successive British foreign secretaries to carry their own Governments on this issue and secure a satisfactory settlement in Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>(4) We supported the UN position on Namibia.  (5) We strenuously opposed apartheid in South Africa.  (6) We opposed the overthrow by a military regime of the Allende Government in Chile and offered hospitality to a number of refugees from this military regime.  (7) We, that is, Government and Opposition, have vigourously opposed US aid to the Junta in El Salvador.  (8) Within the EEC, we joined with countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands in supporting increased aid to the Third World and measures of decolonisation.  (9) We worked within the EEC for increased aid to non-associated countries.  (10) We actively promoted the Euro-Arab dialogue, and on two occasions during that first Irish Presidency, initiated action to prevent a collapse of this dialogue.  (11) On behalf of the Community, we acted to promote a democratic development in post-revolutionary Portugal, despite US pessimism and discouragement by the US Government of these efforts.  We insisted and I went to Portugal on that mission and <Col N="1426" /> subsequently US officials admitted privately that they were wrong and we were right in continuing those efforts and that they did play an important part in the final result &mdash; the emergency of democracy in Portugal.  (12) We supported the Palestinian people's right to self-determination within a Palestinian homeland, in addition to Israel's right to a secure existence within its 1967 frontiers, and helped to lead Northern European opinion on this issue since 1973.</P>
    <P>(13) We played a prominent role in UN peace-keeping efforts for more than 20 years, from the period when the integrity of Congo-Zaire had to be protected against separatist influences encouraged by former colonial powers, to its present efforts to assist the Lebanon to maintain its territorial integrity against dissident internal forces backed by Israel, and against PLO guerillas.</P>
    <P>These policies, taken together, have been successfully pursued through a unique policy of military neutrality operating within a context of concern for the maintenance of a balance of power between East and West, and active involvement in European political co-operation. It has not merely involved no commitment whatever to policies unacceptable to Irish opinion, but has involved active, and in some instances successful, pressure for the adoption by all member countries of the Community of policies reflecting Irish aspirations and those, be it said, of other members with similar views on the issues under discussion.</P>
    <P>I return now to the issue that brought about this debate &mdash; though the Government deliberately excluded it from their motion &mdash; the issue of whether the question of a defence pact has or has not been discussed between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and is or is not to be the subject of some of the joint studies now under way.  I have to say that the evidence has pointed strongly towards the matter having been raised.  Quite apart from press reports, which originated in a <i>Sunday Times</i> article before the Taoiseach's first meeting with the British Prime Minister, an article which was apparently based on information as <Col N="1427" /> to the Taoiseach's intentions, gathered by a journalist of that paper when in Dublin, we have the clear statements of the Northern Ireland Secretary.</P>
    <P>These statements contrast strikingly with the evasiveness of the Taoiseach in reply to every question put to him in this House, with the irrelevant and absurd terms of the motion put down by the Government here today, and with the deliberate obfuscation of the Taoiseach's opening speech in this debate in which he carefully denied what has not been alleged &mdash; because it would, of course, be constitutionally impossible &mdash; that the Government are discussing or negotiating any kind of secret agreement on defence with Britian, but was careful not to say that the question of a defence pact which would, of course, have to be implemented publicly by Dáil Éireann if it were agreed at inter-governmental level had not been discussed.  I note that the Taoiseach was also careful, when referring to the inter-governmental studies, not to deny that those studies, could cover defence matters.  I do not think that, against this evasive background, any objective observer can reasonably come to the conclusion that this matter has not in fact been discussed and, in the light of the British Prime Minister's denial of having raised the subject, he must suspect that, if it was discussed, it was brought up by the Taoiseach himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question this raises, of course, is why the Taoiseach should have pursued this course of action.  What could have motivated him to such a move at a point in time when there is not the slightest sign of movement by Britian on the constitutional issue?  Remember Mr. Atkin's words: &ldquo;The constitutional status of Northern Ireland is not one of the subjects to be covered by the talks.&rdquo;  Raising the defence issue is a ploy which, even those who would be willing to accept a modification of our military neutrality as a price worth paying for Irish unity, must feel should have been kept to the very end of the negotiations as the final move <Col N="1428" /> to win the prize of a united Ireland, if this were ever to be won by such an Anglo-Irish agreement over the heads of the Northern people which, indeed, some may doubt.</P>
      <P>As one with some experience of diplomacy, much of it involving negotiations with the British Government on issues ranging from Sunningdale to unauthorised Border crossings, or the maltreatment of people in custody in Northern Ireland, I find almost inexplicable this behaviour &mdash; even in terms of the assumption that this neutrality issue is one that we would be prepared ultimately to concede for this purpose.  At best this approach appears frivolous; at worst it can be interpreted as an attempt to win acquiescence by the British Government to inflated Irish Government claims for the importance of these negotiations &mdash; inflated claims that might be judged to have some domestic political value within this State as we move towards an election.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland is far too serious an issue to be played with in this way &mdash; to be handled either frivolously, or as a weapon in a domestic political battle for political control within this State.  Either way, I would have to say that, if the defence issue was raised by the Taoiseach in these discussions at this stage, he acted in a manner contrary to the national interest.  All that he has got in return is a visit by the British Prime Minister to Northern Ireland, designed to reassure Unionist opinion, during which she expressed herself about the union of Great Britain with Northern Ireland in these terms: &ldquo;It is fundamental to the Government's thinking.  It is something to which I am deeply and personally committed&rdquo;&mdash; thus giving authoritative endorsement to her Northern Ireland Secretary's flat statement that: &ldquo;The constitutional status of Northern Ireland is not one of the subjects to be covered by the talks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must press the Taoiseach on this particular point.  Is he telling us that the Northern Ireland Secretary of State is lying when he makes this statement, endorsed by his Prime Minister?  Does he still assert that, as distinct from discussing <Col N="1429" /> possible institutional arrangements between what the communiqué describes in British diplomatic language as the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;which is not the correct name of this State, and whose use so far as I can recall we have resisted in past communiqués of this kind &mdash; the constitutional relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic is also down for discussion?</P>
    <P>Is it not the case, as Mr. Atkins has said, and as his Prime Minister has confirmed, that the &ldquo;totality of relationships&rdquo;&mdash; words on which the Taoiseach has placed great stress &mdash; is the totality of relationships between these two states as States, which could go as far, for example, as the creation of some kind of Benelux or Nordic Union between them, though not I trust as far as a federation within which our independence in foreign policy matters would be submerged in a federal council within which we should be a small minority.</P>
    <P>This is, to me at least, the grammatical sense of the communiqué in which the entities whose relationships are to be discussed are first described unambiguously as the existing States, using British terminology, because the phrase &ldquo;totality of relationships&rdquo; in a subsequent paragraph is clearly governed by this earlier definition paragraph.  It is on the basis of this, the obvious, syntactical reading of the communiqué, that discussion of a relationship between one of these two States and part of another can logically be excluded, because the relationships under discussion must be between the totality of these States as well as covering the totality of the relationship between them. Was the British Prime Minister's apparently ready acceptance of this phrase &mdash; suspiciously ready acceptance, I would say &mdash; not explicable precisely because the ordering of the paragraphs required that only the relationships between the totality of each State could be discussed, thus excluding the very subject which our Government, one assumes, wished to have explored &mdash; the North-South relationship?</P>
    <P>Certainly it is hard to come to any <Col N="1430" /> other conclusion when one reads Mr. Atkin's flat assurance that the constitutional relationship cannot be discussed, and his Prime Minister's clear endorsement of this, and contrasts these clear statements with the flabby and evasive language used by the Taoiseach and his Minister for Foreign Affairs in their effort to suggest, rather than to assert, the contrary.</P>
    <P>I have to say that as of now, and until the Taoiseach persuades the British Prime Minister to repudiate her Secretary of State's interpretation, instead of endorsing it, or until details are published jointly by the two Governments of a joint study involving the constitutional issue, I am forced to believe the unambiguous British statements rather than the evasive Irish ones &mdash; and it gives me no pleasure to have to say that in this House.</P>
    <P>To have got into a situation where we appear to be discussing defence arrangements with a British Government which flatly refuses even to talk about the constitutional position of Northern Ireland is certainly to have got the worst of both worlds, and to have shown oneself a remarkably unskilful and dangerously naive negotiator, dealing with people who have vast skills in negotiation, as we know from having pitted ourselves against them on many issues during our term of office, holding our ground despite attempted bullying as on the Strasbourg case, outwitting them in the fisheries negotiations in October 1976 and bringing them to a satisfactory agreement from our point of view at Sunningdale, whatever about the subsequent fate of that agreement for reasons outside our control.</P>
    <P>Beyond that there are other issues also. There is the whole question of the wisdom of this high-profile negotiation with the British Government about an issue which must ultimately be settled amongst Irishmen, with assistance, of course, from Britain, but not by a British diktat &mdash; we have had too many of them throughout eight centuries of our history. It would be one thing to seek to persuade the British Government to reiterate or expand upon its solemn assurance at Sunningdale that it would support a united <Col N="1431" /> Ireland achieved with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland &mdash; a solemn assurance about which successive British Governments have been disturbingly silent ever since.  Alternatively, it would have been worthwhile to have sought to secure from British political leaders a public statement of the private convictions of most of them &mdash; even if the present Prime Minister be an exception in this respect &mdash; that the ultimate solution to this problem must be some new form of agreed constitutional framework for all of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Such a public statement might have induced greater realism among Northern Unionists, many of whom delude themselves still about the extent of Britain's commitment to them.  This could have been done without awakening the kind of atavistic fears that the Reverend Ian Paisley has been enabled, one could almost say encouraged, to arouse, as a result of the huge publicity given to these mysterious discussions between the Irish and British Government.</P>
    <P>We now have the worst of all worlds. We seem to be embroiled in talks which might terminate our constructive role as a country outside any military alliance, without getting in return the slightest sign of movement from the British Government even on the issue of the kind of Ireland they would ultimately like to see, while at the same time arousing deep and dangerous sectarian fears in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If this is Fianna Fáil diplomacy, the sooner the Taoiseach calls a general election and allows the Irish people to put them back in Opposition, the better.  In the meantime a test of whether the Taoiseach discussed this matter with the British Prime Minister, and whether it is included in the studies or has been contemplated for inclusion, will be Fianna Fáil's vote on our amendment which the Taoiseach has attempted to dismiss airily. If they do not support it, all of us and the nation can draw their own conclusions. We shall draw ours and act accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is opportune in a debate such as this to <Col N="1432" /> give some indication of the various roles of our Defence Forces within the policy framework which has been outlined by the Taoiseach in his opening speech. These roles have evolved and have been developed in the context of the neutral military stance which we have observed over the years and maintained even in times of great pressure on us as a nation to modify it.</P>
      <P>The roles which have been assigned to the Defence Forces have had the acceptance of successive Governments and, while the emphasis on the relative importance of the various roles may vary over a period, depending on the exigencies of the times, the basic statement of those roles remains fundamentally intact.  The roles can be broadly expressed as follows:</P>
      <P>To defend the State against external aggression&mdash; this being, of course, the primary role;</P>
      <P>To aid the Civil Power, which means in effect to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, who have the primary responsibility for the maintenance or restoration of the public peace and for internal security;</P>
      <P>To participate in United Nations peace-keeping missions;</P>
      <P>To provide fishery protection for the exclusive sea fisheries of the State;</P>
      <P>To aid Civil Defence; and</P>
      <P>To undertake such other duties as may be assigned from time to time, such as search and rescue and helicopter ambulance service; assistance on occasions of natural disasters, oil pollution at sea; and the provision, where essential, of emergency services to the community.</P>
      <P>Neutrality and non-involvement are not assured or guaranteed by mere assertion alone.  This status depends on its being respected by belligerent nations. That respect and the forbearance implied to it are founded on the basic principles of international law confirmed in the Charter of the United Nations which provides the framework for the relationship between states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During our 25 years of membership of <Col N="1433" /> the United Nations we have sought to ensure in whatever way we can that the purposes and principles of the charter are fully respected.  Our approach over the years has been clear and consistent: we want to see full respect for the independence and territorial integrity of all states as well as for the right of all peoples to determine their own future free from outside interference.  We want also to promote in every way open to us a greater measure of justice and order in international relations.</P>
    <P>There is a superficial view that to maintain a comparatively small army is in practice a waste of valuable resources. That, however, is to ignore the fact that an army, whatever its size or potential, is the outward and practical manifestation of a nation's sovereignty and of its determination to maintain and protect that sovereignty.  The credibility in military terms of a small nation will depend in the times in which we live, on many considerations outside the strictly military arena, not least of which are the will and determination of the nation, come what may, to defend its sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Defence of the State against external aggression implies a determination to resist attempts by any party to a conflict to usurp the State's non-belligerency status in time of war.  It behoves a State such as Ireland, which is not committed to co-belligerency, to take in peace time such defensive measures as will safeguard its security in time of war.</P>
    <P>These measures include the provision of defensive equipment and facilities necessary for training its Defence Forces to meet a military emergency.  Training is, therefore, the paramount task of defence forces in the context of the primary role of the defence of the State.</P>
    <P>Because of the involvement of the Defence Forces in their other subsidiary roles, this primary role of defence against external aggression often tends to be glossed over.  But, it is the fundamental and basic reason for having Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, the primary role of the Defence Forces is the protection of the State against external aggression, the fact is that since 1969 our Defence <Col N="1434" /> Forces at home have been committed very extensively in aiding the civil power in such matters as Border patrols, the protection of vital installations, provision of escorts for consignments of cash in transit and escorting civilian prisoners. The organisation of the forces has been reviewed almost continuously throughout the 1970's with a view to ensuring that a proper structure would be available to discharge these important tasks.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1969 there were no troops stationed permanently in the Border area.  Since then a gradual build-up of the Defence Forces in the area has resulted in some infantry battalions, a motor squadron and supporting elements being permanently located close to the Border, from Letterkenny in the north-west to Dundalk in the east.  In addition, there is a permanent military presence at a number of other Border locations, the number varying with the circumstances of particular times.</P>
    <P>These forces are there solely in aid of the civil power in maintaining security on the Border as a result of the troubled situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Acting in that role military patrols go out into the road network around the Border several times every 24 hours.  The patrols are accompanied by members of the Garda Síochána and are equipped with radio.  They can be diverted quickly to the scene of a Border incident.  In addition, stand-to parties are kept in readiness in each post at all times.  These are available to respond to additional requests for aid by the Garda and can be on their way immediately to the scene of an incident.</P>
    <P>Air Corps helicopters are also stationed in the Border area and carry out aerial surveillance flights in conjunction with the Garda.  In addition, fixed wing reconnaissance aircraft support operations in this area.  I should stress that what is involved here is aid to the Garda Síochána in the discharge of their function of maintaining security.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Defence Forces in United Nations peace-keeping operations represents an important contribution to national policy.  This country sees in the United Nations the means, the <Col N="1435" /> best available means by which peace and the settlement of disputes in accordance with international law can be assured. We are, therefore, wholly supportive of the peace-keeping role of the United Nations and try to contribute to the growth of its authority and effectiveness. As Deputies are aware, the Defence Amendment Act, 1960 authorised the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State with international forces established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations for the performance of duties of a police character.</P>
    <P>In the intervening 20 years or so, the country has built up a tradition of involvement in United Nations peace-keeping, playing a significant part in the effort by the international community to maintain some measure of peace and stability and prevent major wars.  Our firm commitment to peace-keeping has been based, among other things, on the belief that the co-operation of the conflicting sides is essential to a satisfactory outcome of any mission undertaken.  This co-operation has been available in most of the mission areas and has contributed largely to the measure of success achieved in these areas.  Unfortunately, such co-operation has not been so readily apparent in the recent past and this has led to problems for the United Nations personnel, including those of Irish contingents. This has not dampened in any way the Government's commitment to peace-keeping, nor has it lessened the availability of Defence Forces personnel to serve on a volunteer basis as members of United Nations peace-keeping forces. The country's strength in maintaining this tradition has lain in the fact that Ireland has no ambition to involve herself directly in conflict anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Our service with the United Nations has been distinguished and of a very high standard and is positive proof of the regard in which we are held by the United Nations.  I should like to mention the high rank attained by some of our officers. During the Congo peace-keeping mission Lieutenant-General Seán MacKeown <Col N="1436" /> was Force Commander in the Congo; more recently, there was Major-General Quinn who became Force Commander in Cyprus and an Irishman recently took up appointment as Force Commander of UNIFIL in the Lebanon, Major-General Callaghan.  It is a tribute to the nation and to the standard of our personnel, officers and men, that these appointments have been offered to our country.</P>
    <P>The defence arrangements made after the Emergency period included provision for a small Naval Service to patrol the territorial waters of the State and to cover the principal harbours.  Fishery protection was also included in the duties of the service.  The continuation of the Naval Service's role as an essential arm of the Defence Forces has been confirmed in subsequent reviews of the organisation of the forces.</P>
    <P>In recent times an unprecedented expansion in the fleet and manpower of the Naval Service has been necessary.  An exclusive fishery limit of 200 miles was declared by this country in concert with other EEC States with effect from 1 January 1977.  This increased the sea area to be patrolled from 15,000 square miles to 132,000 square miles and it became a matter of priority to obtain vessels capable of patrolling the enlarged areas.  To this end three all-weather fishery protection vessels were constructed and launched during the past four years.  In addition, it was considered that vessels of a new design would be necessary if the service was to have a reasonably adequate capability to patrol the 200-mile area.  Arrangements have been put in hand for the design and construction of two such patrol vessels.  These vessels will be equipped with helicopter platforms and hangars and all the necessary equipment to facilitate the operation of helicopters. They will be ordered this year and it is hoped to have them operational by the end of 1984.  The EEC have agreed to contribute towards the financial outlay involved in the measures for fishery protection in the short-and medium-terms and discussions will be held with the Commission over the next two years in relation to requirements and financing in the longer term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> The Naval Service has also a major function in the measures to combat oil pollution and Deputies will be aware of the significant part the service played in dealing with the tanker <i>Christos Bitas</i> in 1978 when it was seriously damaged off the Welsh coast and threatened extensive pollution off the Wexford coastline.</P>
    <P>Associated with the developments in the fishery protection area have been the deliberations of the third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference, which is now drawing to a close.  These deliberations have centred on likely industrial, mining and other resource exploration and exploitation in the sea areas around coastal states and the establishment of codes of international behaviour in relation to this modern progress.  The outcome of the Conference is expected to have important implications for the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>In addition to its primary defence tasks as part of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps has been allotted subsidiary tasks which include search and rescue operations, a helicopter ambulance service, aid to the civil power and surveillance of fishery activities by aerial patrol of the exclusive fishery area.  While many of these tasks are, of necessity, of a non-defence character they are, nevertheless, of great benefit to the State, and, as such, are likely to continue to be discharged by the corps.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Directorate of Reserve Forces in recent times with responsibility for expanding the First Line Reserve and An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil is an important development in so far as the Defence Forces are concerned. It is clear that the Permanent Defence Force would require an effective First Line Reserve in order to give it even a modest capacity for expansion as quickly as possible if required in aid of the civil power or after the declaration of an emergency. The re-introduction of a reserve commitment for those enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force should provide a regular inflow to the First Line Reserve and consideration is being given to obtaining additional personnel from other sources.</P>
    <P>As regards the FCA, the separate <Col N="1438" /> development of the permanent defence force and An Fórsa which was decided upon in the recent reorganisation of the Defence Forces is being approached in a manner designed to make the best possible use of An Fórsa and of the detailed knowledge which members have of their own localities.</P>
    <P>National defence implies not only Defence Forces but also general protection for the population as a whole.  This is where Civil Defence comes in.  Civilian populations are increasingly affected in war situations and it behoves the state to take measures to mitigate the effects of these situations in so far as resources permit.  In this country these measures are taken mainly through the Civil Defence organisation.  This is a voluntary organisation set up in local authority areas with financial assistance from my Department and with the aid also of the regional Civil Defence officers &mdash; military officers who have been seconded to the Civil Defence organisation to assist in ensuring that the organisation is kept at a good level of readiness.</P>
    <P>In peace-time the organisation, training and administrative experience of Civil Defence volunteers are available to deal with emergency situations.</P>
    <P>The foregoing short review gives some indication of the current roles of the Defence Forces and how these are discharged operationally.  It will be appreciated that progress in most fields of activity is governed by the resources available and the Defence Forces are no exception.</P>
    <P>The heavy costs of equipment and services for the Defence Forces in recent years are related broadly to the change in the tasks of the forces necessitating the provision of new units in additional locations and the need to keep abreast of equipment changes with a view to ensuring a reasonable capability.  As an example of the growth in expenditure on defence, deputies may wish to know that in the financial year 1969-70 the expenditure on defensive equipment in the Defence Vote was £367,000.  In the financial year 1980 the provision was £11,600,000.</P>
    <P>This Government have provided and will continue to provide the resources <Col N="1439" /> necessary to secure the most modern equipment for the Defence Forces consistent with our obligations to other sectors of the community, often at very considerable cost by standards prior to 1977.  We have supported the production of armoured personnel carriers by native industry, we have provided modern armoured tracked vehicles for the first time in 30 years.</P>
    <P>We have provided anti-tank missiles as good as other armies who have at their disposal much larger financial resources. The ammunition stocks, which were seriously depleted, are being replenished at a cost of several million pounds per annum.  We have provided two new helicopters of modern design, turbo-prop aircraft, jet aircraft and expect soon to have a large troop-carrying helicopter.</P>
    <P>Other sophisticated equipment, involving advanced technology is also being acquired to ensure that personnel are kept abreast of modern developments in these areas.  In addition a programme for the provision of new accommodation and the renovation of existing premises has been stepped up considerably over the past few years.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, this country adheres to the principles enshrined in the United Nations charter. The preamble to the charter, which was signed in 1945, states that the peoples of the United Nations are determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained.  For these ends the charter obliges this country to practice tolerance and live together in peace with other nations as good neighbours, to maintain international peace and security, to ensure that armed force shall not be used save in the common interests, and to employ international machinery for the settlement of disputes. These are principles which must be observed by any state which believes in the concepts of international peace and security.  They form sound guidelines for <Col N="1440" /> a country such as Ireland which is deeply committed to the United Nations and to what that organisation stands for.</P>
    <P>What I have said is in essence a brief outline of the roles of our Defence Forces against the background of the principles as explained by the Taoiseach which guide defence policy.  The Dáil is being asked to confirm those principles, they form the basis from which the roles flow and are derived and will continue as the underlying support for those roles which the Defence Forces have in the past discharged with such a high sense of purpose and spirit of dedication.  I have no doubt that they will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is an interesting one and in some respects a sad one. I will return to some of the revelations the Minister for Defence has just made in his interesting if not costly contribution. The Labour Party have put down an amendment to the motion attempting to get the House to reaffirm its commitment to neutrality as a fundamental principle of post-independence and post-colonial policy in this State.  We have done so not on an opportunistic basis but in line with a fairly comprehensive resolution that was passed at our most recent party conference in Cork last autumn.  I would like to put on the record of the House the extent of that resolution by reading out the full text of it.  Our party conference passed unanimously the following resolution:</P>
      <P>Conference reaffirms Labour's traditional stance on this issue of national policy and resolves that:</P>
      <P>the Labour Party is committed to a neutral role for Ireland not alone in the sense of refusal to join any military bloc but in terms of an active political philosophy;</P>
      <P>neutrality must be a fundamental and positive principle of Irish national and international policy; neutrality should be affirmed permanently by amendment of the national Constitution:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the pragmatic basis of Irish neutrality should be strengthened by a firm acceptance of a non-aligned position in world politics; <Col N="1441" /> national policy between the European Community should ensure that the process of political co-operation does not compromise a neutral Irish position on such matters as armaments, relations with the Third World and dealings with South Africa;</P>
    <P>consideration should be urgently given to joining the non-aligned group of nations which is playing such an important part in the evolution of world programmes of development;</P>
    <P>active neutrality should imply a total commitment to peace, détente and disarmament, together with the programme of involvement in world affairs in which policy is determined independently in accordance with national needs and on the merits of the individual case;</P>
    <P>the Labour Party will work together to bring about public awareness of all the issues which arise in the evolution and implementation of a positive policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I can say without hesitation &mdash; this debate today is testimony to it &mdash; that we have certainly achieved the last objective in that resolution because in this House and outside it we have made neutrality an issue in a way nobody a year ago would have thought it was possible to do.</P>
    <P>I want to reaffirm what the leader of the Labour Party has already stated, which is that for this party and, we believe, for a significant percentage of the Irish population neutrality is not some form of pragmatic indifference or blindness to our position in the world. On the contrary, it is a very fundamentally held belief born out of an awareness and an understanding of the struggle over many centuries for Irish independence and for Irish freedom.  One of the acid tests of a country's independence and freedom is for that country to be able to be independent of and have a different view from that of more powerful and stronger neighbours.  Successive Irish Governments, led by different Taoisigh and Presidents of National Executives since 1921 to the present day, when they have demonstrated that degree of independence have won the unanimous support of all sections of the population here. <Col N="1442" /> Everybody in the House will testify to the unanimous support the late Mr. de Valera received during the course of the Second World War when he resisted pressure not just from the Government of the United Kingdom but also from the United States and originally from the Axis powers.  I am not old enough to remember but there are some people here who will recall the feeling of pride in this nation when the people listened to the firm but gentle and polite rebuttal broadcast to the nation by the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, as opposed to the belligerent and bellicose speech made by Mr. Churchill at the end of the Second World War.  That was an assertion by the Taoiseach of the day of independence based on neutrality and it won the support of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It was important for a nation like ours to be neutral in those times; it is even more important now.  The world has changed fundamentally and dramatically since those days, but the issue and the values remain basically the same.  There is a struggle for power and influence between two major political blocs.  We have a Constitution which affirms basic human rights and principles and systems of Government.  In addition, we are a member of the EEC, which is the largest single trading' bloc in the world.  We enter the last 20 years of this century on a globe that has seen the gap between the rich northern part of the hemisphere becoming progressively richer and apparently more indifferent to the rapidly growing poorer southern hemisphere.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the gap between rich and poor, between the developed world and the Third World be narrowed rather than widened.  It is essential also for this country that our credibility as a neutral nation within the EEC is used constructively and positively to try to narrow that gap between rich and poor.  If this House fails tonight to reaffirm, clearly and distinctly the traditional all-party commitment since 1921 of the Irish state to the principle of neutrality, they will seriously compromise and undermine the current attempts of Irish people throughout the world to develop an understanding between North and South and will tie the <Col N="1443" /> hands of successive Governments in attempting to re-establish a neutral and non-aligned position, whether that be on the continent of Africa, in Latin America or in Europe itself.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about short-term party political advantage, though I have no doubt but that aspects of this entire debate were initiated during the Summit discussions between our Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister with that view in mind.  We are talking about something far more fundamental and serious.  The Taoiseach made two specific references to the EEC and to the western democracies. In the kind of clever script-writing that he has, he attempted to lock us entirely into a commitment to both.  In his speech he said that:</P>
    <P>The question of our neutrality also arises in another context, our membership of the European Community.  Let us be clear about one thing.  This country stands for certain values, enshrined in the Constitution.  Our place is with the Western democracies, and we share common concepts of human rights, freedom under the law, individual liberty and freedom of conscience. Our economic interests also are tied in with the Western industrialised world. We are, therefore, neither ideologically neutral nor politically indifferent.</P>
    <P>That may be the view of Fianna Fáil and of the Taoiseach, but I doubt whether the party's Nuremberg Ard Fheis, to be held in the RDS shortly, will discuss the question of neutrality.  But if the Taoiseach has the courage of his convictions and allows such an issue to go to the floor of the Ard Fheis, he will find out if his view is shared by Fianna Fáil as a whole.  The Taoiseach went on to state that:</P>
    <P>Our political commitment to Europe and the Western democracies, our military commitment to the UN are the principal determinants of the policy that the Irish Government have followed and will continue to follow.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil are so committed to Western <Col N="1444" /> democracies, I would ask the only representative they have here now, the Minister for Defence, whether we are committed to what is happening in El Salvador in the name of the major Western democracy and whether we committed to the British Government's connivance at what happened in Rhodesia.  If we are committed to the Western democracies, are we committed also to the consistent and continued support by the major Western democracies of the apartheid regime in South Africa?  Were we committed to the invasion and occupation of a portion of the Vietnamese peninsula by the major Western democracy? Were we committed to the invasion of Egypt by France and Britain, two highly-respected member states of the Western democracies?  If that is what commitment to the Western democracies means, let the Taoiseach say so clearly. Let him run the issue at the Ard Fheis and find out how many votes he will get for it.  It will take more than a few expensive silver teapots to sell that to the delegates.</P>
    <P>I would not wish to be tarred by any partisan brush.  There is a parallel set of invasions and strangulations so far as the other major power is concerned, starting with Afghanistan and going back to East Germany, to Hungary, to Czechoslovakia and now to Poland, where we do not know what is happening.  Commitment to any power bloc, whether east or west, locks us into that kind of complicity and guilt by way of association.  We do not want any part of such association.  But, if the Government, with their inflated majority, troop through the lobby tonight and abandon our neutrality, they will not be acting in the name of the Labour Party nor will they be acting in the name of a substantial section of the Irish public.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil want to make this issue an election issue they are welcome to do so, but they must do it honestly and openly.  Why should a country like ours try to be neutral?  Realistically, why should a country with a population of fewer than four million, with a small GNP internationally and of relatively small strategic importance try to be neutral?</P>
    <P>Even more important, what can the <Col N="1445" /> benefits of our neutrality bring to the world, in terms of 1981?  The Labour Party have studied this in some degree and in consultation with sister parties in the Socialist International, and have come to reaffirm the conclusions of previous leaders of our Party and the deliberations of earlier Irish socialists that a country like ours and a party like the Labour Party can make, in the international theatre of human relations, a positive contribution to the maintenance and development of human rights, to the pursuit of disarmament and to the whole question of development co-operation within the context of the North-South dialogue or, as it is now referred to, the Brandt Report.</P>
    <P>Ireland neutral, positively pursuing its policy of neutrality at the United Nations and within the EEC &mdash; both at the Council of Ministers' level and at the technical level of European political co-operation &mdash; has a positive contribution to make, if we have the guts to make it.  We can argue for human rights.  We can exercise pressure, for example, on the United States Government in relation to what is happening today, this very minute, in El Salvador.  Have we done so?  Despite his assurances &mdash; and let the Minister for Foreign Affairs deny this if he so wishes, when he comes into the House &mdash; to this House and elsewhere, I charge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 17 February at the Council of Ministers, with acquiescing to United States pressure not to release humanitarian aid to the refugees in El Salvador &mdash; aid which was going to be administered by, in the main, an ecumenical organisation of various churches. That is some neutrality.  That is some independence.</P>
    <P>We had the situation of the republican, neutral and independent Government of this country assuring us, through the mouth of the Minister for Sport that, of course, Ireland was neutral and, of course, we would go to Moscow, that we were a free, independent State and would not take the line from anybody.  Then the crunch came, gently, subtly, very firmly, and the Irish Government announced that we were not going to Moscow.  That <Col N="1446" /> is some neutrality.  That is some independence. If the Fianna Fáil Government wish to say honestly that neutrality does not exist, that they threw it away years ago, let them make the reality formally and factually evident.  This is something which we on this side of the House all know as long since having been abandoned. Let the Government say that clearly, but it has not been so said.  There is a constant and continuous attempt to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>So long as there are Labour Deputies on this side of the House, so long as this Party is represented, although we may not always be very successful in what we do, we will certainly ensure, as far as the record of this House is concerned, that Fianna Fáil will not have it both ways. They have been hinged now clearly and distinctly, on to an amendment which is unambiguous, which is not couched in Lynch speech, de Valera speech or Haughey speech, but clearly asks them to do what successive Fianna Fáil Governments have done from the time they entered this House belatedly after the Treaty of 1922.  That is, to reaffirm the principle of neutrality.  Either the Government are for it or against it and talking about fishery protection vessels which can or cannot take helicopters and about extending the area which we would have to patrol and about replenishing ammunition stock at the horrendous figure that the Irish Government are now to spend &mdash; several million pounds, to quote the Minister for Defence correctly, this at a time when the Department of Social Welfare do not appear to be able to afford a computer to organise their affairs &mdash; is to try to fudge the issue, to get away from the central theme of what being an independent State means after hundreds of years of struggle for liberation.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister for Defence was brought in to make the sort of contribution which he had to make.  It is clear evidence that this Government do not want to debate this issue.  It is consistent with the response from the time that the Party Leader, Deputy Cluskey, questioned the Taoiseach after the Dublin Summit Meeting.  Fianna Fáil do not want the public to discuss this issue <Col N="1447" /> and they certainly do not want their party to discuss it.  They know very clearly, as Deputy Molloy indicated over the weekend, that attachment to neutrality extends a long way and goes back a long distance.  Indeed, it was a countyman of Deputy Molloy's who, in the treaty debates in this House asserted the kind of independent spirit which was at the base of the struggle for national liberation, particularly on the republican side. On 4 January 1922, Deputy Liam Mellowes, representing the constituency of Galway, speaking against the treaty, argued against Ireland going back into the British Empire, argued against the material gains which would allegedly come from it, and went on to try to describe the motivation of the people who fought for freedom in this country and who took on at that time the superpower in the world.  I quote from column 231 where Mellowes states:</P>
    <P>We hoped to make this country something the world should be proud of and we did not enter into the fight to make this country as the other countries, where its word was not its bond and where a treaty was something to be struggled for.  That was not the ideal that inspired men in this cause in every age and it is not the ideal which inspires us today.  We did not seek to make this country a materially great country at the expense of its honour in any way whatsoever.</P>
    <P>It is this kind of sentiment, expressed back in 1922, which continues in unbroken line, whether it is James Connolly in 1914, asserting the independence of the Irish people to remain outside the capitalist conflict between Britain and Germany, or Eamon de Valera in 1927 and right on to Frank Aiken and other foreign ministers and party political leaders and which brings us to this debate today in 1981.  We believe that the Labour Party, in moving this amendment, is a continuous part of that tradition and that we have the support of the majority of the Irish people in reaffirming it.  If the Fianna Fáil Party want to break with that, then they have the opportunity to do so <Col N="1448" /> tonight.  In so doing, they must vote against our amendment and in so doing they will be saying formally to the world that, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, they are no longer neutral and they no longer consider that Ireland is a neutral state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I entered this House almost 22 years ago, I cannot think of a debate of greater importance than this one.  I am very sorry indeed that the 86 yesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party are not here in greater numbers to listen to a debate which is concerned about the apparent readiness of the Taoiseach for the time being to surrender Ireland's neutrality for propaganda purposes.  Notwithstanding all the conflicting statements about the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, there is still an area of considerable, grave doubt about what occurred at the meeting between those two heads of Government.  It appears that one of the areas of considerable confusion is that which concerns the neutrality of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the face of the widely expressed fears about the risk of a fall-out from a nuclear power station in Ireland, the Government were only too willing to make a declaration that they would not proceed with a nuclear power station without first having a public inquiry, but the risk of a catastrophe caused by a fault in a nuclear power station is negligible compared with the strong likelihood that Ireland will be a direct and early victim of a nuclear war if Ireland joins a defence pact with Britain, a nuclear power.</P>
      <P>There are those who in recent weeks have sought to deride advocates of neutrality on the grounds that they, for romantic reasons, are adhering to a policy which is no longer possible.  I am not concerned with whether yesterday or years ago our predecessors supported neutrality.  What I am concerned about is the future in which we and our children must live.  I am certain the only course of self-interest to Ireland dictates that we must not enter into any defence arrangement with any nuclear power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week when the question of neutrality was raised in the course of Dáil <Col N="1449" /> questions the Taoiseach raised a laugh from his own benches when he declared in reply to my question in relation to Article 28 of the Constitution that the Government had no intention of declaring war.  Article 28 of the Constitution is not about a declaration of war, but it says that Ireland may not be involved in a war without a vote of Dáil Éireann.  The point I wanted to make last week, amid the derisive laughter of Fianna Fáil members, many of whom were scared about what the Taoiseach had really offered to Mrs. Thatcher, was that even if there was now a defence arrangement entered into between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher, or even between this Parliament and the British Parliament, it could have no effect in a war-like situation without a new vote which would involve this country in war.</P>
    <P>Two or three months ago there was no European power, no American Government or no Russian authority questioning Ireland's neutral status.  Ireland was regarded as being a member of a very small group of nations which were not involved in military pacts.  That situation has changed utterly as a direct consequence of the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  I regard this as sinister and dangerous.</P>
    <P>I have the privilege of being a member of the European Parliament.  For four-and-a-half years I was a member of the European Council of Ministers.  I am aware that hitherto no pressures were brought to bear by the European Community, or any members of the Community, on Ireland to abandon her neutral status, but because of my role as a member of the European Parliament, within the last month I have become aware that many countries are now of the view that Ireland is changing her neutral status and is prepared to enter into a military obligation not only with her immediate neighbour, Britain, but as the British Prime Minister inferred in her speech in Belfast last week, is also prepared to enter into military obligations with other governments.</P>
    <P>Whether it was as a result of a deliberate suggestion on the part of the Taoiseach <Col N="1450" /> or as a result of his ineptitude, the word has gone abroad that Ireland is prepared to amend her neutral standing. Clearly the blame for that lies very definitely on the Taoiseach and the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not surprising when one recalls a speech delivered by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs in Wales about nine years ago where he expressed his regret that Ireland had left the British Commonwealth of Nations. He considered &mdash; and I believe this is still his personal conviction &mdash; it would have been better for Ireland to still have knelt before British imperialism for two reasons: first, because the British might be better disposed to us, and second, because of an extremely remote chance that it might make some people in the North see that if we in the South were green, there was a little red in our blood as well.  Membership of the Commonwealth 1922 to 1949 did not soften the Unionist cough.</P>
      <P>It appals me that we have this shilly-shallying by this Government on a fundamental issue like neutrality.  I am convinced that the Taoiseach raised the question of a defence pact with the British Premier when they met.  I am also convinced that his speech today was the result of a market survey made at the behest of the Government. Surveys show that the overwhelming mass of the Irish people wish Ireland to remain neutral.  I believe that since his gaffe in the meeting with the British Premier, the Taoiseach has seen the results of market surveys which show a fierce antagonism on the part of our people towards anybody who would sell Ireland's neutral position down the drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have glorious phrases about the virginity of Irish sovereignty which no Fianna Fáil Government would ever want to impair.  Neither the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor any other member of the Government was prepared to utter such phrases until they got the message from these market surveys which showed that our people, quite <Col N="1451" /> properly, are opposed to involvement in military pacts with anybody.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach chose his words very carefully in his speech to the House today.  His was not a speech left to civil servants.  They may have prepared the original draft, but every word is the Taoiseach's own personal decision.  He stated as follows:</P>
    <P>I wish to state unequivocally that the Government are not discussing or negotiating any kind of secret agreement on defence with Britain or with any other country or group of countries.</P>
    <P>This leaves wide open the probability that they are prepared to negotiate an open agreement involving Ireland in defence obligations towards Britain or other countries.  They hope to generate such a degree of alarm and anxiety on the one hand and ambition for the unity of Ireland on the other that our people may succumb to the temptation of surrendering to other nations their sovereignty over their own lives.</P>
    <P>We assume that in Britain, Russia, the United States of America and possibly elsewhere there are military experts who are studying the advantage to them of possession of Irish soil, airports and sea ports and launching sites for nuclear missiles.  It is understandable that military authorities consider such matters, while leaving it to civil Governments to say what is politically acceptable.  So far we have not heard from any member of the Western Community &mdash; I do not expect to hear it from the Eastern Community &mdash; any statement which would indicate that they would not under any circumstances consider that they had a right to invade Ireland in order to obtain possession of airports and other facilities. This silence underlines the argument in favour of neutrality.  If any members of the Western alliance consider that they have the right to invade Ireland in order to protect themselves, they show themselves morally as wrong as members of the Eastern alliance.  There are no circumstances which can justify the destruction <Col N="1452" /> of the integrity of an independent state which decides to remain neutral.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that we should assert our right to be neutral in the conviction that by so doing we considerably reduce the tendency of any country to consider Ireland as a possible target. If we waver on the issue of neutrality we will certainly increase the possibility of invasion from one quarter or another.  If we assert our position on neutrality I believe there is a greater possibility &mdash; no more than that &mdash; that we will be left alone in the event of an international conflict.</P>
    <P>There are those who feel that the effects of a nuclear war are so devastating and so indifferent to political boundaries that it will not be possible for any country to remain neutral in a world conflagration. I do not believe that the possibilities or otherwise of remaining neutral in a future world war will be any greater or less than in previous world conflagrations. To decide to remain neutral is one thing; not to be affected by the consequences of war is a totally different thing. But one does not necessarily reduce the consequences of war by becoming involved in that war of one's own volition. History points to the contrary.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a nuclear attack on, say, Liverpool and the wind is blowing eastwards, the likelihood is that the east coast of Ireland, and Dublin in particular. will be considerably damaged by that nuclear explosion.  That is a possibility, but the probability of nuclear attack is increased by entering into a defence arrangement, particularly with a nuclear power.  A country then finds itself obliged to have nuclear missiles on its own territory, thus inviting direct attack.</P>
    <P>What we are really considering is the balance of advantage in entering into a defence pact which would require us to have nuclear missiles on our own territory against a neutral position which might make us victims of nuclear fall-out as a result of attack on some other territory directly involved in a nuclear conflict. In 1981 and for many years to come Ireland's interests are in declaring its neutrality and its unwillingness to become <Col N="1453" /> involved in a situation which would invite direct attack upon this country.</P>
    <P>It struck me, when listening to the Taoiseach's speech, that while it was very good in terms of the forthcoming polls his heart was not really in it.  Near the beginning of his speech he declared that if at any time some modification in the policy seemed to be required then it would be the Government's duty to put the position before the people and their representatives prior to any decision being taken.  In other words, the Government are at present contemplating the build-up of such a massive fear and hysteria or ambition in relation to the unity of Ireland that they can sell Ireland's neutral position down the drain.  That is a totally unacceptable position for an Irish Government to assume at any time and particularly at a time when the world is so excited about the possibility of a third world war.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also raised the possibility that when a satisfactory political solution is arrived at in relation to Northern Ireland it might be time to review the most appropriate defence arrangements for the island as a whole.  I am being perfectly frank in saying that I do not believe that the Government having Ireland in a nuclear war arises in relation to the difficulties of Northern Ireland.  I believe that the Government having flown a kite in relation to this may lead to a situation in which some people in Northern Ireland, being totally opposed to unity, may introduce the red herring of the future defence of this island.</P>
    <P>By offering this hostage to them the Government have acted against the national interest.  Of course, there are many people interested in ensuring that Ireland is not a base to make any attacks upon the eastern or the western blocs.  I have already indicated the way in which we can ensure that the likelihood of attack upon us is reduced by making Ireland a neutral zone.  Another way to reduce the possibility of attacks on Ireland is to make it clear to any potential belligerents that if they come here we will make Ireland a hell for them.  We secured our neutrality in the last war to a large extent because it was clear to both belligerents <Col N="1454" /> that it would cost them more than they would gain were they to invade us. That situation still exists.  Even if there was a nuclear attack on us we could not be occupied by the attackers until Ireland became safe from the effects of a nuclear attack.  Even then, we would want to be in a position to make life in Ireland a hell on earth for any would-be occupier.</P>
    <P>When we talk about neutrality and our desire to remain neutral it is appropriate that we should assume the responsibility and the cost of making Ireland useless or impossible for any would-be occupier. That is something we are not doing.  One of the reasons why it is difficult for us to do it is because the British Government by their misrule of Northern Ireland by their ineptitude in overcoming the difficulties there, and not by reason of any internal subversion in our State, have imposed upon us a doubling of our defence and security costs.  I do not believe that in that situation the British Prime Minister has had the temerity to ask the Irish Government to increase their defence commitment.  We as an independent sovereign country have had to double our defence and police costs and have had to double our Army and police force in order to avoid subversion originating in an adjoining country which is not properly ruled.  I cannot conceive for one moment that the British made any demands on us in relation to defence commitments except that they might have possibly politely asked whether we would be disposed to enter into a nonaggression pact against Britain or into an agreement that we would not in any circumstances allow our island to be used for the purposes of an attack on Britain. I would assume that no Irish Government would hesitate to enter into such an agreement because it would be of mutual benefit to ensure that neither island would be used for the purposes of an attack on the other.  That is not a defence pact or a qualification of our neutrality. It is a strengthening of our neutrality.  It is a definite statement that we will not allow ourselves to be used for the purposes of attack on anybody.</P>
    <P>It was significant that today for the first time in a long time every seat in the <Col N="1455" /> Distinguished Strangers Gallery was occupied by a member of the Diplomatic Corps.  They were there because their governments were interested in Ireland's stance on defence pacts or neutrality. They would not have been there if this question had not arisen as a result of the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  The only reason why it arose subsequent to that meeting is because the Taoiseach left that grey area open to controversy, to comment and for debate.  We would not have had a denial from the Taoiseach if we had not insisted on a debate on the subject.  I read in at least a dozen British newspapers or respected magazines over the last three months about the idea that Irish neutrality is now at an end, that it will be no longer possible for Ireland to maintain neutrality and that indeed there was not a willingness on the part of Ireland to maintain her neutral position in future. I did not observe a denial of any of these reports from the Government, a Government supporter or spokesman.  They were willing to let these ideas float around in the outside world, adultering the commitment of the Irish people to neutrality.  This debate may have the possibility of clearing the air although the Taoiseach's statement, however often one analyses the phraseology used, still leaves considerable doubt.  The Taoiseach talks about not entering into discussions on a secret agreement and later on in a throw-away phrase he said that he could drop the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo;.  But he selected the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; in the preparation of his address.</P>

      <P>It is quite apparent to any reasonable person that there is some form of subterfuge.  The Taoiseach also said that, in relation to the Government's association with Europe, they are prepared to accept that if Europe enters into a full political union which included defence they would accept their obligations in that regard.  But there cannot be <Col N="1456" /> any further movement towards political union without the specific and direct agreement of the Irish Government, ultimately endorsed by Dáil Éireann, as the Constitution so provides.  The Taoiseach did not rule out the possibility that his Government might be prepared to agree to a political union which included defence.  If the Taoiseach was opposed to that idea and if he was determined to maintain our neutrality, he should have said so.  He should have said that under no circumstances would the Irish Government enter into a political union in Europe or anywhere which involved a defence commitment.  The Taoiseach was not prepared to say that.  We are still left, towards the end of this debate, with the possibility or, having regard to the record of Fianna Fáil in the past ten years, the probability that defence obligations will be entered into to such an extent that it may be next to impossible for the Irish people to withdraw from a situation into which the Government have already committed them.  It seems that the future is fraught with danger.  We have a Taoiseach and a Government who are ambivalent in relation to neutrality, who somehow or other seem to be ashamed that Ireland has been neutral in the 60 years since we achieved our freedom, and they want to escape from that neutral position.</P>
      <P>Various texts were quoted here today as to the origin of Ireland's neutrality commitment.  Ireland's neutrality began on the day we sought our freedom.  One of the most fundamental rights of any State is to decide not to be involved in a war unless it is attacked.</P>

      <P>The facts of the matter are that the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister &mdash; and they are the only two people who were privy to the talks &mdash; both said &mdash; and let us be serious about this matter &mdash; that defence was not discussed in any manner, shape or form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote further. What the Taoiseach said today is relevant to the point I have been mentioning and it is concerned with the whole question of defence being under discussion at the Summit.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a satisfactory political solution is arrived at, we would, of course, have to review what would be the most appropriate defence arrangements for the island as a whole.  It would be unrealistic and improvident not to do so.  It would also be mandatory that <Col N="1463" /> any such arrangements would require the full authority of the Irish people deciding on them as a specific issue.</P>
    <P>The point is that Deputy FitzGerald, (a) by the wrong use of the word &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; and, (b) by reason of the obvious falsehood that defence matters were under discussion at the Summit, sought to indicate that the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister were discussing defence in advance of other matters.  I would agree with him that, if there was any such negotiation, defence arrangements would be the last matter to be discussed. Arising from his knowledge and experience of these matters, Deputy FitzGerald is obviously right in that respect.  In his speech he sought to suggest that, on this occasion, this logical progression of the negotiation, if there was a negotiation which there was not, would include defence matters.  Of course it would, and Deputy FitzGerald knows that.  He knows that, and the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the officials in the Department of the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach and I, are well aware of that too.</P>

The EEC has made considerable progress in a whole area of social and economic matters. Political union, as such, is still a long while away.  I think a defence arrangement of any kind will be still longer away. Deputy FitzGerald, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I have always taken the stance and made the point that defence arrangements within the Community would have to be consequent upon and following upon the achievement of an acceptable political union.</P>

      <P>The status of Ireland internationally can be stated clearly and briefly.  We are not a member of any military alliance.  Neither are we a member of any non-aligned group.  I say this in answer to Deputy Browne and Deputy Quinn.  The non-aligned group are also a bloc.  There is a bloc situation in the world: the eastern bloc, the western bloc and the non-aligned bloc.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of our international contribution within the United Nations, we are much better off as a neutral member.  We are much better off being associated with the sort of category to which Austria and Sweden belong.  I should like to emphasise that point because it is important.  Many of the non-aligned nations are very heavy users of the sort of military hardware which Deputy Browne rightly deplores. Unfortunately that is the case.  I do not want to mention names of countries, but that is a fact.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again that, while we are neutral in the military sense, we are neither ideologically neutral nor politically indifferent.  We are neutral in the military sense.  We are not a member and we do not propose to become a member of any military group of nations either on a bilateral or a multilateral basis.  We share basic democratic, political and economic factors with our neighbours in western Europe and a common commitment with our partners in the European Community to work towards European integration and union.  We also have rights and duties under the United Nations Charter.  We have our own view, independently expressed, on developments political and economic in many parts of the world, and we do not hesitate to state them, in areas like El Salvador. Namibia and other areas throughout the world where we have a practical point of view.</P>

      <P>It is important to be clear about our membership of the Community. Joining the EEC did not entail any military or defence obligations for Ireland. The Community have not got a common defence policy as I stated already.  In the referendum our people endorsed the decision to enter Europe and to participate in defence commitments after the achievement of political integration, a matter which is a long way away by reason of the slowness in achieving European political union.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise one other point which I think was made by Deputy FitzGerald on another occasion. There is a very big difference between security, as such, and defence.  Security is a much wider concept bringing in our whole relations within the United Nations, international relations generally, political relations and all that area other than defence.  We must draw a distinction sharply between security on an international level and military neutrality.  We are neutral in a military sense, but we are not neutral in a political sense.  That is the net position.</P>

The attention of speakers was drawn to the fact that they had exceeded the half hour by a moment or two.  The informal agreement was that this was to be a three-and-a-half-hour debate, commencing at 3.30 p.m. and ending at 7 o'clock with a vote.

      <P>We were offered a three-and-a-half hour debate.  The Whips met and we agreed on the time.  I have the first agreement we came to, if you want to hear it.  This was agreed with the Whips.  Fianna Fáil were to get in at 6.30 p.m. to conclude at 7 p.m.  We had two or three discussions today about the procedure. About an hour-and-a-half ago the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, Deputy Seán Moore, came to my room and said he had heard that Deputy Ritchie Ryan was anxious to speak.  He said: &ldquo;We are prepared to give Deputy Ritchie Ryan half an <Col N="1475" /> hour.&rdquo;  We agreed on times.  He said: &ldquo;That will be cutting the Minister for Foreign Affairs back to ten minutes but we do not mind that.  We think that will be sufficient time for him to conclude.&rdquo; Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick was with me at that time.  Deputy Quinn did not take the full time.  He was five minutes short of the full half hour so the times were rearranged with Fianna Fáil Chief Whip and me.</P>
      <P>I came to the Ceann Comhairle and I read out the times.  I said: &ldquo;The agreement is Deputy Quinn will be 5.45 p.m. to 6.15 p.m., Deputy Ritchie Ryan 6.15 p.m. to 6.45 p.m.&rdquo;  I said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have five minutes extra and it will be 6.45 p.m. to 7 p.m. to conclude.  You said: &ldquo;In this gentleman's agreement you have exactly verified what the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Seán Moore, has told me.&rdquo;  That is the way things stand.  I am a long time in this House and when there is an agreement and three-and-a-half hours given, there is always a vote at the end of the time.  I can take an oath in any court in the country on what I have said.  I believe a man has only his word.  I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Moore, and I have dealt with him for a long time. He is a respectable responsible, and honest man and a man of his word up to this moment.  Whatever pressure has been brought on him by people who are absent from the House now and are not prepared to come in and defend the man they have put in the dock, I am surprised at what has happened.  I am telling you the truth.  Has it ever happened before that after three-and-a-half hours having been given for a debate, the vote was not put?  Is there any precedent for this?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the terms of the agreement with regard to the allocation of time has been clearly established in the press and other media over the last week.  We sought a two-day debate and the Government imposed a three-and-a-half-hour restrictive debate on this House.  I accept, fully and without reservation, that you have no hand, act or part in it and that you are acting in accordance with the rules.  I believe that those of us on this side of the House are possibly at fault.  We took the Government's word.  That was a very serious mistake.  We have been denied by a disgraceful breach of faith by the Government in an agreement that was entered into by the Party Whips with regard to time and voting procedure.  Stooping to such a disgraceful act speaks more eloquently than any thing that was said here this afternoon that they are undoubtedly bartering away the country's neutrality.</P>

      <P>I do not fear any debate on this matter.  Our record here is quite clear.  As I mentioned earlier, the Labour Party wanted a discussion on the December summit meeting.  I pointed out to them that we had discussed this last December.  The record is there and I brought their attention to this.  The Government then said they would give a three-and-a-half-hour debate.  In fairness to my fellow Whips from the Opposition side, they said they recognised the Government's right to put down a three-and-a-half-hour debate.  We had an informal agreement on the length of time they would take to speak.  Everything I have done here tonight has been in keeping with the Standing Orders of the House. Maybe I am too naive for this job, but <Col N="1477" /> we offered Fine Gael extra time at the expense of one of our Members.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs was speaking at 7 o'clock he reported progress. This happens every day in the House.</P>

With respect, I should like to tell the Deputy that I gave him the pairs of Deputies Eileen Desmond, Liam Kavanagh and Michael O'Leary, who are on European business, because the division was to take place tonight.  It was my clear understanding that as soon as Deputy Lenihan finished tonight the motion would be put because our three-and-a-half-hour debate had concluded.  In no way am I blaming the Chair but I am blaming the cowardly absence of the Taoiseach who has run out <Col N="1479" /> of the House on the question of neutrality.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Reference has been made by the Chair to the fact that there has been no binding agreement and I should like to deal with that matter.  The debate started at 3.30 p.m. and it was governed, ruled <Col N="1480" /> or controlled by an informal agreement under which each speaker was confined to 30 minutes.  On a number of occasions when the speaker exceeded the 30 minutes his attention was drawn to the fact that there was an informal agreement that speeches would be restricted to 30 minutes and he was stopped.  One thing that struck me was that when the Minister for Foreign Affairs reached 7 o'clock, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not make any effort, good, bad or indifferent, to say to him that, there was an informal agreement to the effect that the debate be concluded at 7 o'clock or ask if that agreement was being changed.

You had that information from Deputy Seán Moore before me and you said you were delighted that I had confirmed this to you.  You mentioned there was an informal agreement and you agreed with me.  You showed it to me where you had it written down and you remarked that what I had told you entirely agreed with what Deputy Sean Moore had told you.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to deprive Deputy David Andrews of the opportunity of voting against rescuing the Bray Travel victims, but I do want to raise with you on a point or order one thing.  I am sorry for the confusion there now is in this House but all of us in this House, indeed including the chief Government <Col N="1486" /> Whip, were under the impression that the debate was to be three-and-a-half hours and that it was to be concluded at 7 o'clock.  There was, and you are right in so saying &mdash; and the Chair is bound by rules &mdash; no formal agreement.  At 7 o'clock the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; perhaps mistakenly but nevertheless did so &mdash; invited the Minister for Foreign Affairs to move the adjournment.  We immediately said, a Cheann Comhairle, that that was not the agreement &mdash; and the record will show me correct &mdash; the Minister said: well if you are asking me to move the adjournment I will move the adjournment.  Frankly, I would prefer to take a benign view of what has happened over the past hour.  I would formally invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if there has been a mistake, if in the heat of a debate, he took up, perhaps mistakenly, the offer of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to move the adjournment, perhaps not fully aware of what might have been agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, with respect, the Minister took up &mdash; I am endeavouring to resolve this constructively, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was invited to move the adjournment. Either the Government had decided in advance that they were not going to adhere to a three-and-a-half hour debate, which is a malign view, or alternatively a genuine mistake was made.  On the assumption that a genuine mistake was made, which any of us can make, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am now formally asking him to say so and let the House have a vote. That is all that this side of the House wants at this stage, a vote on this particular issue.  I do not envy the task of the Chair but I do want to say this: I believe that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was mistaken in inviting the adjournment. This side of the House did not agree to the moving of the adjournment and no vote was taken on the adjournment at issue.  I would put it through you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a genuine <Col N="1487" /> mistake was made and that he should now have a vote because the alternative view is much different.</P>

You are dealing with the situation under Standing Orders and implying that an agreement between the Parties has no standing in this House.  There are a number of Standing Orders, including No. 20, which specifically refer to the House otherwise resolving.  If there is an agreement between the parties surely at any stage Standing Orders can be abrogated?  In this instance there was an agreement between the parties.  If you hold that such an agreement does not stand up, does not have the force of precedent here, then there can be no future for any agreement; there is no way that this House can be run in the future.  There was an agreement between the parties to have a three-and-a-half hour debate and I cannot see how a three-and-a-half hour debate can be adjourned after three-and-a-half hours.</P>

      <P>The only economic data on the lines sought by the Deputy which are available in my Department are now considerably out of date.  The classification of areas as disadvantaged or as more severely handicapped was not, in any event, based solely on statistical data but also involved careful consideration of the topographical and other characteristics as ascertained by official inspection.  Information on the agricultural situation in the <Col N="1364" /> area from local expert knowledge was also taken into account.</P>
      <P>In the review of boundaries of the disadvantaged areas and of the more severely handicapped part of those areas which was carried out by the Government in 1978, the position in the district electoral division of Killeenavarra was most carefully considered.  The boundary adjustments that were announced in mid-January were made only after protracted negotiations at Brussels, both at Council and Commission level, and it was not found possible to arrange that Killeenavarra should be reclassified as more severely handicapped.  The position is being kept under review, however, and should circumstances so permit the classification of the area will be further considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some difficulties have been encountered in dealing with benefit claims, particularly claims for disability benefit, due to the change-over from the system of flat-rate contributions paid by means of stamped cards to the system of pay-related contributions.  The pay-related contributions can only be collected in conjunction with the PAYE income tax collection system operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The change-over came into operation on 5 January 1981 and since then in a proportion of cases the claimants are continuing to quote only their old insurance number and as a result difficulty is being experienced in identifying their insurance records under the new RSI numbering system.  This has led to delay in the payment of benefit and in consequence there was an unavoidable build-up of arrears of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> I have issued directions to my Department to concentrate on removing all obstacles to the prompt payment of benefit. There is a full commitment of all resources to this task and the arrears are being steadily reduced.  If the Deputy is aware of any cases of delay in payment of social welfare benefits in his constituency, I will arrange to have the cases investigated and payment of benefit issued as quickly as possible.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that a person (details supplied) in County Cavan wishes to obtain suitable education for his nine-year-old son who is deaf and dumb and that he has failed to find a suitable school over a period of nearly two years; and if he will investigate the case with a view to providing proper educational facilities for the boy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that many farmers who got an estimate during the past two years for work to be carried out on their land under the western drainage scheme and who are only now in the process of carrying out this work due to lack of contractors, find that contractors' costings are much higher than the original departmental estimate and that in real terms they are getting a grant of almost 40 per cent of their outlay instead of 70 per cent; and if he will have those estimates revised to take account of the costings at the time of commencement of the work.</P>

      <P>The estimates used in approvals under the western drainage scheme allow for the completion of the work within a reasonable period.  It is not practicable to revise those estimates afterwards.</P>
      <P>By reason of the unprecedented number of applications under the western drainage scheme priority in approvals has been given to farmers who indicated that they were in a position to start work without delay.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid injury benefit for the full statutory period of 26 weeks from 18 June 1980 to 15 December 1980.  After that date he became entitled to disability benefit and payment at the full appropriate rate has been made to 21 March 1981.</P>
      <P>Due to an error in calculation he was underpaid pay-related benefit in respect of the period 2 July to 9 August 1980.  An adjusting payment has now issued.  The error is regretted.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit on 9 December 1980 in respect of an accident at work on 27 November 1980.  Pending investigation of his claim to injury benefit, his entitlement to disability benefit on an interim basis was examined.  He did not, however, satisfy the qualifying contribution conditions for disability benefit as according to the records of my Department he had less than 26 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>The inquiries regarding his injury have now been completed and his claim to injury benefit has been allowed.  Payment has been made to him in respect of the period from 27 November 1980 to 7 March 1981, the date of the latest medical evidence received.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from the 21 July 1980 to 23 August, 1980 when he was certified fit to resume work.  He was not qualified for payment at the time as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the necessary required minimum of 26 contributions paid since his entry into insurance.  Following inquiries it has been established that he had in fact sufficient weeks of insurable employment to qualify him for benefit.  Payment of all disability benefit due to 23 August 1980 has been made.  The delay in payment was due to the fact the he failed to reply to repeated requests for details of the period during which he was in employment prior to his illness.  When details of his earnings are available pay-related benefit, if due, will be paid.</P>

Payment of benefit could not be authorised as according to the records of my Department he had less than the required statutory minimum of 26 contributions, registered or credited, in 1978-79, the relevant governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries it has been established that he had 46 paid contributions in 1979-80, the contribution year which governs payment from 5 January 1981.

He has been requested to furnish details of his earnings in 1978-79 in order that his entitlement to pay-related benefit can be determined.  He failed to quote his RSI number on the medical certificates and other documents submitted in connection with his claim.

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on her return from the United Kingdom, where she had worked for many years, and after having worked for only one day in this country after her return.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant EEC Regulations an employment record in the United Kingdom cannot be invoked unless a claimant takes up full insurable employment since return to this country.  A deciding officer had decided that the employment of the person concerned since her return to this country was insurable for occupational injury and health purposes only, which consequently does not allow her UK insurance record to be reckoned for unemployment benefit purposes. Consequently the person concerned is not entitled to unemployment benefit as she does not satisfy the statutory contribution conditions on her Irish insurance record.</P>

      <P>The question of approving proposals submitted by Kerry County Council for the Fossa Road sewerage extension <Col N="1385" /> must be deferred pending the provision of additional capacity at the Killarney treatment works.  In this connection, I recently approved contract documents submitted for the mechanical plant and the sludge de-watering plant for the expansion of the treatment works.  Tenders may now be sought to facilitate completion of the planning of the civil works.</P>

      <P>In November 1980 the Department of Agriculture submitted to the EEC an outline programme, including a rural water supply programme, following the adoption of EEC Regulation 1820/80 EEC which provides for the stimulation of agricultural development in the less favoured farming areas of the west of Ireland.  I am hopeful that the proposals will be approved in the near future.  I will then be in a position to announce the implementation of an improved grant structure for group water schemes carried out within the framework of the approved programme in the western area.</P>

      <P>Kerry County Council submitted <Col N="1386" /> preliminary proposals for the Central Kerry Regional Water Supply Scheme on 20 April 1979.  The proposed scheme comprises six separate contracts.  The Department conveyed approval to the proposals to the council on 25 June 1979 and requested submission of contract documents for contracts Nos. 1-5 of the proposed scheme.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council submitted contract documents for Contract No. 1 on 11 January 1980.  Contract No. 1 principally comprises intake at Owgarriff River, rising main from Lough Guitane, gravity main from Sheheree service reservoir and a supply main to Killarney.  I hope to be in a position to convey a decision on this contract to the local authority in the near future.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council submitted contract documents for contract No. 6A (Tralee Ring main) on 11 February 1980 and requested early sanction, as the proposed watermain is required to serve the new county hospital in Tralee.  The relevant contract documents were approved on 26 September 1980; a loan of £100,000 was sanctioned on 16 October 1980; and acceptance of a tender was sanctioned on 28 January 1981.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council submitted contract documents for Contract. No. 3 on 13 February 1981.  Contract No. 3 principally provides for a distribution main within Killarney urban district, a service main to Madams Height service reservoir; a rising main to a break pressure tank situated at Boolacullane, Farranfore, and the construction of a large pumping station and a reservoir at Coolcoran, Killarney.  The relevant contract documents are under examination in the Department.</P>
      <P>The submission of contract documents for contracts numbered 2, 4 and 5 is awaited.</P>
