    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate a scheme being funded by employers to help maintain employment in the textile, clothing, footwear and leather industries. The scheme represents a response by employers as a whole to the need to help these industries in the present temporary period of recession.  The Bill enables employers to fund the scheme on the <Col N="3452" /> basis of a contribution of 0.2 per cent of their payroll for the contribution year running from 6 April 1981.  Payment of the contribution is not an enforceable liability.  The scheme will be administered by the Federated Union of Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industries, who will issue payments to eligible industries.  The amount collected will be paid into an FUE/CII account, the State retaining a sum in respect of tax.  It will amount to an estimated £6.5 million net of tax.  The scheme will be temporary, lasting one year.</P>
    <P>The scheme will provide for a payment of £5 per person employed per week in the eligible industries.  The number of employees involved is over 25,000 in about 370 firms.  Such a scheme, I believe, is a positive and praiseworthy response by employers as a whole to the problems being encountered by firms in the clothing, textiles, footwear and leather industries. These industries are basically viable, many of them having been restructured in recent years, but require temporary assistance if further redundancies are to be avoided.  Deputies will be aware that a sectoral development committee representing employers, unions and the Government has recently been established and one of its tasks is to evaluate sectors which are experiencing particular difficulties at present in trying to expand, or maintain output, or to maintain employment.  I believe that this evaluation will help in developing policies for the longer-term viability of many of our vulnerable industries.</P>
    <P>There exists at present a wide range of structural assistance to industry, including the industries in question in this Bill. This includes:</P>
    <P>&mdash;IDA grants for fixed asset investment in new undertakings, the expansion of existing ones and re-equipment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;research and development grants; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;loan guarantees and interest subsidies <Col N="3453" /> on funds borrowed to finance fixed assets.</P>
    <P>The ICC also provides a range of loan facilities for industry.  Under the second national understanding, the Government are committed to an intensification of services to improve the structural capacity of existing firms to compete in changing market conditions.  The objectives of all of these provisions is to provide for the continued strengthening of our industrial base, so that industry can become more competitive and thus help create sustained employment opportunities. This employers' scheme &mdash; representing a solidarity approach on their part to the problems of these industries &mdash; will complement the Government's efforts to encourage industrial expansion and to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  This measure will be of benefit to industries which, as the Minister has stated, are vulnerable and indeed have been vulnerable and ailing for some time. The Minister said that a sectoral development committee is in existence to establish what industries are in difficulties and to evaluate what can be done to benefit them.  This Bill does just that.  It comes at a time when we are talking about a general election, possibly later on today.  It is unfortunate that it did not come before now because it is well known that the industries involved &mdash; textiles, clothing and footwear in particular &mdash; did not have to wait for the sectoral development committee to report to the Government on the state they are in.  They have been in dire trouble for a long time, not only here but elsewhere.  They have been very sluggish.  The general degree of capacity utilisation in industry for the month of February this year, for example, had dropped to 60.8 per cent, which means that 40 per cent of capacity was not being used.  It is even higher in these industries and has been for some time. For that reason I feel that, while this is a welcome measure now, it ought to have been introduced before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A table in the CII <i>Newsletter</i> of 17 <Col N="3454" /> March 1981 shows the imports into the UK from this country of textiles, clothing and footwear.  We find that in the area of textiles there is a minus 3.4 per cent.  We are dropping &mdash; clothing minus 5 per cent and footwear minus 8.8 per cent &mdash; when at the same time these industries importing into the UK from other countries show an increase into that market.  For some time we have been losing ground on the UK market which has been our major market.  We are losing ground consistently to other sources of exports.  This measure is all the more welcome for that reason.  Its only fault is that it is coming somewhat late.  Because of the timing of its introduction it may be seen as an election gimmick, although I do not say that it is.  To the people who will benefit, it is far from an election gimmick.  I hope that the benefits accruing to this sector who have been in trouble will result in an improvement in their performance in productivity and in the export markets where we have been losing ground.  I welcome the Bill and feel that the beneficiaries will also welcome it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give some indication before the Bill goes through the House as to what extent the £6.5 million will benefit industries in relation to the amount of turnover or input needed to provide the necessary fillip for them.  How many jobs will this maintain or how many new jobs will it create?  In what way will this benefit these industries, and will the Minister also quantify this benefit?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill in so far as it will give some temporary relief to these four major industries.  However, it is long overdue that Dáil Éireann should review the extent to which the Government can and should provide long term direct assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason why the Government brought such pressure on the employers in the sectoral areas to respond to the difficulties of the textile, clothing and footwear industries was the unprecedented appearance at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis of highly entrepreneurial individuals who stood outside the Ard-Fheis <Col N="3455" /> and, to the amazement of delegates, handed out leaflets from the textile sector of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  The Fianna Fáil delegates are a notoriously hardbitten lot, as are delegates of most parties, but that hand-out took them aback and they began to wonder what was happening to the industrial policy of their party.  Arising from that, the flurry within the Cabinet in recent weeks and the pressures on the Government to do something about the difficulties in these key industries, the Government have belatedly come in here with this temporary relief measure.</P>
    <P>When other relief measures were going through the House during the past three or four years the Minister for Finance assured us that there was absolutely no problem with the Community and with Brussels, in terms of giving this type of relief.  From 1973 to 1977, when we made valiant efforts to bring in direct assistance to these areas, we were berated by Fianna Fáil because we pointed out that the Commission had considerable reservations about the extent of State aid generally and regulations against distortion of competition.  At long last a small effort has been made after a great deal of redundancy has occurred in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.  It is remarkable on the last day of the Dáil, before what one might call the nondescript experience of the past four years goes into happy oblivion as far as the parliamentary record is concerned, that in terms of legislation these sectors should have received such little support from this Government despite the many and manifest difficulties which they have been facing.  The Taoiseach at one stage was inclined to give direct assurances of personal and public commitment and support for these industries, but what is the record of the Government?  Today we have a belated effort after the termination of the employment maintenance subsidy, after the termination of the re-equipment grants scheme and the technical assistance consultancy grants scheme.  It points very clearly to the tremendous lack of cohesion and co-ordination within the front bench of the <Col N="3456" /> Fianna Fáil Party.  Perhaps that is excusable in the sense that they had so many Ministers for Labour and Finance over the past two or three years that even the IPA <i>Diary</i> had gone out of print before it was properly circulated in 1981.</P>
    <P>Most Ministers on that Front Bench, as I have observed over the past four years, take about five or six months to get any idea of what the problems are in those sectors, to get any conception of the problems, and then by the time they are settled into their Departments another upheaval occurs and off we go to another area.  That is the reason why we have this morning this <i>ad hoc</i> response by way of a Bill dragged through the Dáil at the very last moment to enable the Government to face the workers in the textile and allied industries with the prospect of giving them some indirect temporary assistance.</P>
    <P>This Bill is but another example of the primacy in the Government's approach, the primacy of public relations over policy, over industrial relations, and over industrial development initiatives in the Government's economic management of the country.  I know many of these industries in my capacity as a trade union official over the years.  I have visited and met individual sectors of the textile, clothing and apparel industry.  I had an opportunity on many occasions of visiting these plants and I strongly hold the view that these industries must be actively supported and lifted out of the relegation zone to which they have apparently been consigned by the Government.  They employ some 20 per cent of our total manufacturing work force.  That is substantial by any yardstick.  They contribute more than £400 million per annum to our industrial exports.  They are very strong in the provision of employment for women.  That is of considerable importance. Up to the early fifties Irish women were exploited in these industries.  They still have not got equal pay in many areas but despite that the industries provide suitable employment.  They provide opportunities for women and that is of considerable importance in a time of recession.</P>
    <P>Since 1977 when this Government took <Col N="3457" /> office many jobs have unfortunately been lost in various sections of this industry.  It is remarkable that despite the relative success of the IDA's job creation programme unemployment in these specific areas has suffered because of lack of attention by the Government.  It was this frustration which led these labour-intensive industries to the unprecedented action by the CII apparel industries group of handing out leaflets at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis condemning the sellout of their interest by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and his Government. In that leaflet he was named as a man who had clearly given certain definite assurances to the industry.  I would be the first to concede that these industries have experienced unique problems in the transition to free trade during the seventies. We have now had two recessions in that period.  We have had severe domestic inflation, particularly wage and cost rise inflation, and these have compounded the problems facing these industries. Some commentators are critical of these sectors for their alleged inefficiency.  I do not share that view today though I would have shared it in the sixties.  Today most of these industries are quite efficient. They have a real sense of entrepreneurial endeavour.  They board an Aer Lingus plane and head off to Frankfurt, Paris, London and New York to sell on the open international competitive market Irish textiles, Irish apparel, Irish styles and designs, all the products of an indigenous Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Again, I have seen this kind of work done in the Irish footwear sector.  Certainly I do not accept the view that those sectors are getting this kind of assistance this morning simply because of inefficiency. I would not accept that view though some other sectors might be inclined to that view.  I believe they can compete at home and in the export market provided they get a fair deal not just from the Government but also from the domestic consumer.  If one goes into a textile retail outlet or footwear or apparel outlet one can readily see that Irish industry does not always get a break because of competition with cheap subsidised imports.  To that extent there is a <Col N="3458" /> double-barrelled problem the solution of which requires help from the State and obliges the distributive sector to give priority to these goods.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill goes I am pleased to support the measure to help these people through this temporary period of difficulty. However I also hold the view strongly that the State should have endeavoured to double what is being offered here this morning.  In this atmosphere of electoral Dutch auctioneering which is about to start, this might be regarded as another election carrot.  It is not because I wrote my script for this morning about five weeks ago when I was considering the problems facing these industries and after I had met a number of their representatives I held the view then that about £10 per week per employee for the restoration of the employee maintenance scheme for a further period should be introduced for eligible firms.  The total amount involved here, which is of course paid by the employers, is £6.5 million.</P>
    <P>If one adds up all the other sums over the past few months &mdash; £15 million yesterday for building society mortgages, £50 million for the ESB on the basis that they will not implement until after the election, probably in October or November, the 12 per cent increase the Government refused to sanction, £7 million or £8 million for CIE and the refusal of the concessionary fares, £30 million for food subsidies.  £30 million for first time house grants &mdash; then out of a total package of some £150 million so far £6.5 million is directly employment-related.  This is a significant indication of the attitude of the Government towards what one might call industrial job maintenance and protection. The building societies subsidy will keep many people in employment and give temporary relief to mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>Then there is the £50 million for the ESB which will be funded by foreign borrowing, probably in petrol dollars to make it even more costly, and the £30 million for house purchase.  Already, as chairman of Dublin County Council, I have seen the way this has been interpreted <Col N="3459" /> by builders.  Houses in Clondalkin advertised for £23,500 are now being re-advertised for £27,500.  The builder is putting the £3,000 into his back pocket and saying: thank you very much.  He will probably give £1,000 to the Fianna Fáil Party as an election contribution, if he has not already done so, because, of course, with a scheme of 40 or 50 houses, he can afford to off-load that kind of political contribution.  I contend that the analogy of the £6,500,000 in terms of assistance to these areas of severe difficulty in employment is reasonably apt.</P>
    <P>If one is really serious about wanting to help these industries one must do a number of things.  On balance I would suggest that one should consider four or five major areas of change.  There is, first of all, the restoration of the employment maintenance subsidy for a further period at a level of £10 per week per employee to eligible firms.  Secondly, there is the restoration of the re-equipment grants scheme for selected sectors of industry experiencing special difficulty, the textiles and apparel sectors in particular. Thirdly, I would suggest that active and urgent negotiations be pursued with the European Commission, through the Council of Ministers of the EEC, to ensure that the multifibres agreement which is to be renegotiated later this year will take fully into account the special problems with which the Irish textiles and apparel industries are confronted.  In particular the new multifibres arrangement should incorporate a recession clause so that imports into the EEC are not given a guarantee of a growing market in Europe when aggregate demand falls within the EEC.  Similarly I would suggest that the new multifibre arrangement must deal effectively with the problems raised by outward processing so that the abuses emanating from this under the last arrangement are not perpetuated in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party advocate an enlightened and progressive policy in the development of world trading links, the interests of all labour-intensive industries must be protected by a balanced approach to this question.  A one-sided <Col N="3460" /> or narrow approach will be inimical to the long-term development of trade between member countries of the Community, such as Ireland and the developing countries.</P>
    <P>I would suggest again to the Minister that our Commissioner should also be fully briefed on this issue.  I do not know what the former Minister for Finance is now doing in Brussels.  I gather he is looking after the library there, trying to keep a register of personnel, but it might be useful if he were to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would suggest that it would be no harm at all for us to ask the Irish Commissioner to contact the Commissioner for Industry over there, and seek his aid in giving a boost to Irish industry.  Our Commissioner does not have to face the rigours of North Tipperary in the election this time so he might as well earn a crust or two in the national interest while he is avoiding that delightful prospect in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certainly other areas in which we could usefully assist these industries.  Within the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism there is need for a planning and development unit relating to these sectors. Such a unit should work in close consultation with the management and trade unions concerned in formulating a programme for industrial expansion in those areas.  Because the textiles, footwear and clothing industries are small they are not very spectacular.  We have the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism running around the country talking about the microchip.  We have become so microchip- and technology-conscious in our industrial development that we fail to appreciate that perhaps 30 or 40 workers in a textile, clothing or footwear factory, using conventional technology and well known methods, can also produce commodities of enormous value to the State in the line of exports. Within the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism there is need, as there was in the sixties, for greater liaison with those industries.</P>
      <P>The fifth suggestion I would make is that the structure of State financial incentives available to the labour-intensive sector should be reviewed so as to enhance their applicability and working capital requirements to these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally I would suggest that a review panel be established by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism which would include representation from the labour-intensive industries and distributive sector which would keep under continuing review the purchasing trends on the home market &mdash; in relation to domestically-produced and imported textiles, clothing and footwear &mdash; and the effectiveness of customs and excise controls as they affect labour-intensive industries here within the framework of <Col N="3462" /> EEC legislation and controls and within the terms of the multifibre agreement.  I would suggest further that that review panel report at regular intervals to the Minister on such matters bearing on those questions calling for attention by the Government or the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I hope the suggestions I make this morning will be regarded as constituting a programme of special assistance to labour-intensive industries in Ireland.  I hope they will be accepted as reflecting a realistic appreciation of the importance we must attach to these industrial sectors if we are to make any progress in the solution of our critical unemployment problems.  We must think not just as politicians but also at State level more creatively and work harder than ever before to create jobs for the unemployed, school leavers and those currently undergoing training.  We must look for new job creation in all industrial sectors through indigenous as well as foreign investment. Therefore it must be right that we concentrate some of our development resources in supporting and developing these industries which make the greatest contribution to the employment of our people.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I support this Bill.  As the Minister is aware, Deputy O'Toole and I have agreed to let all Stages through this morning.  We hope that the joint FUE-CII account can be set up in the very near future and the money disbursed to the firms in need.  These are our views and we support the Minister on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill like my colleague, Deputy O'Toole.  It is certainly original legislation in so far as we have here a Bill which shows commitment from employers to employers in trouble, so to speak.  Of course, it is also a reflection of the pathetic efforts of the present Government in regard to industry in general.  Companies pay their taxes and the Government have the primary responsibility of maintaining and encouraging employment and ensuring that firms prosper.  It is an indictment that we <Col N="3463" /> have in our country at the moment an employment level in excess of 125,000 and there is in this House this morning an admission by the Government that now over 25,000 employees are in danger of losing their jobs.  We are talking, therefore, in very starkly depressing terms in relation to the state of our economy when we may be facing an unemployment level of 150,000, which is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>The inaction of the present Government is extraordinary.  I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that a sectoral development committee representing employers, unions and the Government has recently been established.</P>
      <P>It has only recently been established.  I remember in the last decade and in the sixties when I was a student that the CII reports clearly identified sectoral problems in industry.  Yet it has taken up to 1981 for the Government to grasp the reality and to set up another committee to look at the problems in industry which had already been clearly identified by a number of experts.  It is only a window-dressing exercise by the Government that they should establish another committee.</P>
      <P>As an aside, I recall reading the recently published Government White Paper on educational development.  It is not a White Paper at all; it is a Green Paper.  That White Paper set up at least 13 committees to review problems in the educational sector which everyone knows existed in the educational system for God knows how long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>And there will be a task force behind every one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last few years the Government have been involved in a massive window-dressing exercise of very little benefit in real terms to the economy. The reason that these firms are now in trouble stems not so much from the fact that they were long established, because since we joined the EEC these firms have made solid steps forward in their own areas.  The real reason they are in trouble is that this Government have failed in <Col N="3464" /> one of their major tasks, which is to control inflation.  This Government have failed miserably and totally to take inflation in hand and control it and to bring the economy into control.  They have failed to bring their own finances under control.  Last year to mid-February they had an inflation rate of 21 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the reasons why these 370 firms giving employment to over 25,000 workers are in trouble and the reasons that this Bill is in this House today.  The primary reason is that the inflation rate in our economy is the second highest in the EEC and is causing terrible damage to the cause of economic expansion in this country. These firms in particular suffer more from this high level inflation than other more competitive industries.  Last year's inflation rate was another nail in their coffin and the outlook for this year's inflation rate of 18-20 per cent would mean that in two years the rate of inflation will have increased by 40 per cent.  That is an extraordinary rate of inflation which is sure to damage industries throughout this country.  It is the present Government's inaction and inability to govern over the past four years which has led to the high unemployment rate in our country and the high rate of inflation which is doing such damage to our industry.  The direct damage is being caused by the Government's inability to govern this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to a particular industry which affects my own constituency, Irish Leathers Limited, who have factories in Dungarvan and Portlaw and also in Carrick-on-Suir just outside my constituency.  That firm have for the past two or three years been trading under very difficult circumstances.  They have already closed their factory in Gorey, County Wexford and their accounts published recently make depressing reading and show that the company continue to have serious trading difficulties.  The reasons for the serious trading difficulties are as follows.  First is the high inflation rate under which they are trying to trade. <Col N="3465" /> Because of the very narrow profit margins in the competitive industry in which they work these infaltion rates have meant that the company have lost considerable moneys, especially in the last two years.  I would say that the company are in danger.  The second reason is imports into the EEC from third countries of raw and processed leather.  The EEC Commission have taken no steps whatsoever to stop the dumping of raw leather into the EEC markets.  I am extremely disappointed that they have not dealt with this aspect of this industrial problem. There should be a ban or a restraint on the import from third countries of leather or hide until such time as this industry gets on its feet again.  It is the present Government's lack of commitment and lack of force in putting the Irish position to the EEC Commission that has caused this industry to suffer through these importations from third countries.  I suggest to the Minister that a special case be made for the leather industry which is giving employment in my constituency to between 600 and 700 people potentially. It is important that people realise that the industry is in trouble and that the Government realise this also and take steps to secure the employment in a county which has suffered severely from the present recession.</P>
    <P>The moneys involved here are not adequate.  A subsidy of £5 a week is insufficient. I feel, like the last speaker, that the Government should have topped it up by an equal contribution to the scheme which would allow £10 a week subsidy to be paid per employee.  I believe the scheme is inadequate to meet the needs of the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of the employment maintenance scheme was referred to by the last speaker.  I certainly would support the reintroduction of that scheme for the employees in the textile industries, the clothing, footwear and leather industries.  I would like the Minister to explain in detail his statement today that payment of the contribution is not an enforceable liability.  I also want a detailed explanation how the FUE and the CII will determine which companies <Col N="3466" /> benefit from the payment.  Will all companies in the industries concerned receive this subvention?  What criteria will the FUE and CII use in examining each company? Will it be based on the production of accounts or will there be selectivity in the administration of the scheme?  If there is selectivity it is very important that the scheme is administered equitably and without bias.  I have no reason to believe that the FUE and CII would not have a neutral approach to which companies receive the subvention.  It is important that the House receives an assurance that the distribution of the funds is on an equitable basis, that there will not be any political bias in the distribution of those funds or that there will not be any interference by the Government in relation to the distribution of the funds to the firms concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to ensure the prosperity of our industries in general. We are today recognising that over 25,000 more jobs are in jeopardy.  This is a result directly of the Government's mismanagement of the economy and mishandling the affairs of the nation.  Thankfully, we will have a general election soon, the sooner the better and the sooner the people will have a change of Government.</P>

      <P>I give the Bill an unreserved welcome.  It is an excellent Bill. Anything which goes to help save the jobs of at least 1,000 people in my constituency will get my support.  The word &ldquo;originality&rdquo; was used with regard to the fund, but I do not believe it is original.  I believe it is a substitute for schemes we had in the past, specifically the one which was introduced by the National Coalition Government, when Deputy Michael O'Leary was Minister for Labour, the employment incentive scheme, which was later replaced by the Employment maintenance scheme.  A further fund was set up under the 1980 national understanding discussions under the aegis of the tripartite committee.  Some money was allocated for the type of relief which is being given under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the employment incentive scheme had to be abandoned because it <Col N="3467" /> was illegal under EEC regulations.  We will back the Minister to the hilt if he can get away with this type of support for ailing industries.  I was surprised by the Minister's statement that there are actually 25,000 jobs in the clothing, textile, footwear and leather industries.  No industry has taken such a hammering during the last ten years as those.  There have been huge job losses in those industries. We all expected this.  Those industries were guarded because of our protection policies over the years and we knew a lot of them would not stand up to open competition. I am glad that 30 per cent of them have stood up to this competition. We would be very glad if the Minister by this scheme could keep those industries going indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The FUE and the CII should be congratulated for supporting their brethren in those ailing industries.  However, the Minister stated that the amount collected will be paid into an FUE/CII account and the State will retain a sum in respect of tax.  How could anybody tax a rescue operation?  How could such a worthwhile venture be taxed?  Does the tax man have to get his pound of flesh out of everything, even a rescue mission?  This seems incredible.  I would like an explanation from the Minister about this.  We have seen the pendulum swing in this area of industry over the past ten years.  We welcome the transfer from a policy of protectionism to an open market, but the openness of the market is open to question. Surely free trading should be limited to within the EEC?  I agree with what Deputy Collins said in this respect.  We have not been vigilant enough in stopping third country imports, particularly in the clothing and textile sector.  If the French market is threatened, if the French sheep farmers feel that lamb from Ireland or Britain will affect their prices, they clamp down and to hell with EEC regulations. They have a very mé féin attitude when it suits them.  If it is cheap wine from Italy, they put up the shutters and do not mind breaking EEC regulations.  We apparently are the good guys of Europe. If jobs are at stake here we do not fight sufficiently hard to retain them.  There <Col N="3468" /> are times when we should be prepared to kick the traces and break the rules.</P>

      <P>There are two sides to every story.  If a German or a Frenchman says that industries in my constituency will close down because we are contravening EEC regulations, I will tell him to run off.  We should adopt that attitude a little more.  I saw a series of figures in <i>The Irish Times</i> last year showing the number of times each member State of the EEC had broken the rules.  There was good old Ireland, the champion, the bottom of the league.  We had broken the rules fewer times than any other country.  We should adopt a little more protectionism in cases like this, because if we had done so some of these industries might not have gone to the wall, they might even have been saved.</P>
      <P>We have been flooded by cheap clothing and textile produced from countries like Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea where labour costs are very low and the Japanese have the audacity to put under &ldquo;Country of Manufacture&rdquo;&ldquo;Déanta i Japan&rdquo;&mdash; I do not know if Roinn na Gaeltachta give them a grant to put that on their products with the result that many good businesses have gone to the wall.  This is where we should have made our stand in the EEC.  We have not been sufficiently tough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency of Waterford there <Col N="3469" /> are 1,000 jobs in the leather industry at stake.  Two years ago there were 1,400, but 400 jobs have been lost &mdash; 200 by the closure of the factory in Gorey, County Wexford, and 200 by redundancies in Dungarvan and Portlaw.  We want to see those jobs retained at all costs, irrespective of whether it is in contravention of EEC regulations, because it is the only leather industry in this country.  If it goes to the wall we will not have a native tanning industry, and for an agricultural country producing an enormous number of hides that would be a disaster.  We have seen this almost happen in the timber processing sector.  We are growing millions of acres of forest but we do not have any timber processing facilities.</P>
    <P>It could happen that Irish Leathers would be in jeopardy.  They have been in financial difficulties over the past two or three years and I hope this scheme will see them out of these troubles.  The Government have an obligation to save those jobs at any cost.  It would cost far less to save them than it is costing to save other failing industries which have been discussed here in the last week or so.</P>
    <P>There was a time when South American countries exported unprocessed hides.  That stopped about five or six years ago because they got wise and realised the value of these raw materials. The exportation of unprocessed hides from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina stopped.  That meant the world market for unprocessed hides was very restricted and foreign buyers, whether from eastern or western Europe, came to Ireland and competed for the available hides.  The result was predictable.  Prices rocketed. Two years ago hides which had previously fetched as low as £2 or £3 each suddenly fetched £36.  The Irish tanning industry found it impossible to compete and their financial viability came into question.  It was a very dangerous period for them, and I am glad they have survived. Their survival was due largely to the aid they got under the employment incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>In the interim, the position has ration-alised and hides are now fetching £5, £7 or £8.  The position has improved but we could go back to the state where the open <Col N="3470" /> market could result in prices rocketing. The British and Germans foresaw what would happen in South America and they did not let the grass grow under their feet.  Admittedly many tanneries in France, Germany and Britain went to the wall because of the limitations in the number of hides available on the free market, but the far-seeing British and Germans went to the Argentine, Brazil and Uruguay, set up their own tanneries and brought back the finished leather to Europe.  Those firms did not suffer unduly, although they may have lost some jobs, but they were getting their hides and finished leather as cheaply as ever &mdash; they circumvented the type of difficulty the Irish tanning industry experienced &mdash; and because of the large numbers employed in those industries, unlike the Irish tanning industry, they could absorb a certain amount of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to bear in mind that the leather industry is not in a good condition and because of world trends it could suffer further.  As I said, we have lost 400 jobs; we are now down to 1,000 jobs.  Waterford is probably the place which has been hardest hit by unemployment.  Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach for the unemployment figures in Waterford in April 1977 and April 1981.  During that period, there has been a 33? per cent increase in unemployment in my constituency.  This must be the highest increase in the country.  It is imperative that existing jobs be protected at any cost.  I am asking that the leather industry especially be protected.  The Minister is doing a good job in bringing in this Bill and I look forward to his continued support for aiding such industries.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed for their welcome of this Bill but, due to the fact that we will have a general election within the next 12 months, it is only natural that Deputies will refer to other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most speakers mentioned the delay in bringing in this Bill to aid what are called sensitive industries and pointed out that <Col N="3471" /> State aid is not allowed under EEC regulations. This is a fact of life.  While Deputies may say that we should break international law, it is not good for any Government to break international laws or international agreements.  For that reason I want to put on record how grateful we are to industry, particularly the CII and the FUE, for their decision to fund this scheme so that the textile, leather, footwear and clothing industries will be subsidised.  As I mentioned, there are 25,000 jobs in the 370 firms in these industries.  As far as I am aware, there will not be any redundancies in those industries and this scheme is being introduced to maintain those jobs.</P>
    <P>Very often we have heard it said it would be a good thing if we had some fund to subsidise workers' wages.  We have heard it at public meetings and we have heard it said in the House that there should be some kind of subsidy fund to prevent redundancies in industry.  I am sure every Deputy in the House has heard it said that such a scheme would be better than to have social welfare benefits being paid to redundant workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins spoke of the 125,000 unemployed.  I have never denied that, either in the House or outside.  I said it at the Ard Fheis.  However, I should like to put another figure on the record.  From 1977 to 1980 the total number of people in employment has increased by 80,000. Deputy O'Toole suggested that this Bill is an election gimmick&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have an election within the next year or so, but the delay in this case has been because of the protracted negotiations with the FUE and CII in order to get a scheme that would not be contrary to EEC regulations.  Deputy Collins remarked on the deduction of tax from the total amount being paid by industry towards the fund.  The Commission <Col N="3472" /> have made it quite clear that this could not be done.  If industry did not pay this money to the State, tax would be paid on it and that tax money would be received by the Revenue Commissioners. The figure mentioned is £6.5 million.  As far as I am aware, it is a net figure.  The gross figure would be in the region of £8 million.  The tax content of that £8 million, when used in the way this Bill proposes, is a State aid to the maintenance of employment.</P>
      <P>Deputies asked why we did not double up the amount the employers will pay so that there would be greater wage supplement. The reason we asked employers to fund this scheme is because under EEC regulations we cannot pay direct State money towards this object.  As Deputies are probably aware, the fund is being administered by the employers.</P>
      <P>Many of the matters raised were not strictly relevant to the Bill.  For instance, housing would not arise on it.  Some other matters raised would be more appropriate to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  I thank the Deputies who sincerely welcomed the Bill, and the FUE and the CII for their willingness to fund this scheme from their finances.  The object is to prevent redundancies in the short term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `qualified group' means a group consisting of not less than three individual persons as regards which the Board is satisfied that there is in force for the time being an agreement, in a form approved of by the Board and to which each member of the group is a party, whereby it is agreed by the group to do either or both of the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  by purchase, lease, hire or otherwise to acquire, or acquire the use of, turf development equipment and to use the equipment for the production of turf or turf products for fuel,</P>
      <P>(b)  to develop a bog for the production of turf or turf products for fuel;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially this amendment defines &ldquo;qualified group&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill and has the effect of bringing informal and unregistered groups within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Reading a number of Deputies expressed the view that the qualified society type of approach to co-operative or group developments, involving registration and submissions to the Registrar of Friendly Societies of annual audited accounts, could put off smaller groups who otherwise would be interested in coming together to develop bogs for the production of turf.  The essential purpose of the Bill is to maximise private bog development for fuel, and though <Col N="3474" /> there may be a tendency to exaggerate the formality aspect, I agree that in some situations worthwhile development might not be proceeded with by the interests concerned because of excessive formality.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I accept that a less formal and less sophisticated regime would be justified in cases of this kind. This amendment is designed to bring such informal groups within the scope of the Bill.  Such groups would not have formal existence in the terms of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893.  They would not have an obligation to register under that Act and they would be relieved of the other requirements associated with societies so registered.  As is indicated in the amendment, a formal agreement <i>inter se</i> would be executed by all members of the qualified group in a form to be approved by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I accept a balance has to be struck in regard to the degree of control that must be exercised to safeguard the State interest, but it is not my intention that procedural issues should be made so burdensome that possible bog development by these informal groups would be frustrated. That is the sort of approach I will be expecting from Bord na Móna when they are dealing with this type of bog development.</P>
    <P>Finally, this amendment fairly meets the points raised by a number of Deputies on Second Stage, to which I referred earlier.  I would, however, like to emphasise that for long-term bog development, under which it may be necessary to ensure long-term commitments from a large group of people, co-operation by way of a registered society can have distinct advantages.  A registered society assumes a legal personality which no informal group does for the purpose of, say, acquiring or proving turbary rights or commonage shares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not go the whole distance in the praiseworthy direction which the Bill displays and do what I asked him to do during the Second Stage debate, namely, insert a new part into the Bill which would have the effect of encouraging the establishment <Col N="3475" /> of total energy co-operatives of which bog development would be a plausible and legitimate part of their activities.</P>
      <P>Of course, I entirely agree with the Minister's anxiety to promote the co-operative effort.  I said that before.  I am glad the Minister recognises the peculiar appropriateness of co-operative effort through activity of the kind which this Bill is supposed to promote.  But I cannot really see the point of the amendment which is before us now.  I understand the Minister's anxiety not to tie people up in the necessity of getting themselves registered as friendly societies or as co-operatives in the strict legal sense of the word.</P>
      <P>But the relevance of this thing would be very slight were it not for the fact that a distinction is drawn by the Minister in a later section of his Bill between co-operatives and qualified societies and all other cases.  In other words, in the original Bill a distinction is drawn between co-operatives and private individuals. The Minister is now inserting a third category into the Bill, namely, what he calls qualified groups.  He is assimilating those qualified groups, which as he says are to be informal groups of persons who are not put under the necessity of establishing a formal co-operative, not into the category of individuals, not into the category in section 8 (2) (b), but into the category of qualified societies, in other words, co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was at Second Stage I questioned the legality of this.  I did not make a meal of it because I do not think there is anything sinister in it.  But I did advert to the dubiousness of discriminating even for such a praiseworthy purpose as co-operative development, and discriminating between co-operatives and individuals in a quite separate context where the purpose of the Bill is simply to extract more peat from the bogs.  I said that I could not see any reason why this discrimination should exist and that I could not see why the Minister could not simply have a flat rate of support for bog development, let it be the higher rate or the lower rate, though obviously he is likely to get more development the <Col N="3476" /> higher the rate is.</P>
    <P>In fact what the Minister has now done by a singularly clumsy method is to adopt my suggestion because this proposal about a qualified group is effectively going to eliminate the individual altogether. At least the way in which the Minister envisages the qualified group must have that effect.  He does not, for example, specify that the qualified group must consist of three or more individuals none of whom are related to one another, none of whom share any existing interest or property expectancy at the moment of the formation of the group.  That is not insisted on at all.  In other words, as I read the Minister's amendment, it is perfectly possible for a group to be constituted by a man, his wife and the old grandfather if he is still on the land.  Why not?  I can see nothing wrong with such a group and I am all in favour of them being as generously treated by the Minister as he can possibly manage.  But if I had a strip of bog in the country and were anxious to develop it and make the most of this legislation and I saw that if I did it under my own name I was going to get support from the State of 40 per cent but that if I did it under the title of a qualified group I was going to get 60 per cent I would not be very long roping in my wife and eldest son as members of the same group.  Not only is that so but the Minister does not even require in his amendment that that group should have any specified arrangements between themselves in regard to the share which each would provide in property and expertise, in know-how, in physical effort, in share of profit or loss on the development.  That is all left absolutely up in the air.</P>
    <P>I do not know what political instructions the Minister gave to his draftspeople or what the Minister's Department asked the Attorney General's department and the draftsmen there to include in it, but as far as the Minister's amendment goes it seems that the requirements for a qualified group are met if a farmer with a strip of bog and his wife and brother or his mother, if she is still alive and living on the land, or even if she is not living on the land, form a qualified group.  They can form a qualified group <Col N="3477" /> and it is not required by this amendment that they should each contribute a certain amount of money or that not less than two of them contributed the money while one contributed know-how.  All they need to do is enter into an agreement and so far as that goes the agreement might specify that all the financial support for the development, at any rate, the private financial support which the State does not provide, could come from one of the people and the other two could be simply written into the agreement as providing advice or simply cheering him on.  I do not complain about that at all.  I do not see anything sinister or undesirable in it. I am simply pointing out to the Minister that his amendment offers a loophole whereby any individual can transport himself from the 45 per cent bracket into the 60 per cent bracket by the simple device of writing in two of his relations into an agreement of which the Minister dictates not one single term.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is willing to allow that to sit, if he is willing to accept my exegesis of his amendment, he might perhaps go one step further and admit that there is no point in maintaining any longer the distinction between two categories which he has erected in section 3 and he might as well strike out the 45 per cent bracket altogether.  If he does that he might as well scrap, throughout the Bill, the painstaking references to qualified groups and societies.  I honestly think that would be a simpler way of doing the job.  It would have exactly the same effect in the end because the effect of the Minister's present amendment will lead to eliminating individuals, at least ostensibly, from the purview of the Bill and it will also avoid the admittedly only marginal danger that I adverted to on Second Stage, that his discrimination for an extraneous purpose in the administration of a bog development financial scheme might be constitutionally objectionable.</P>
    <P>There is one more point that I want to make.  Paragraph (a) in the Minister's amendment does not specify what form of purchase, what form of lease, what form of hire or acquisition he has in mind. Nor does it specify that this group has to <Col N="3478" /> have any legal personality of his own.  In other words, so far as the amendment goes, a purchase lease or hire could be effected by one group and undoubtedly that is how it is going to turn out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Kelly is under a misapprehension about this. First, let me point out that earlier in his remarks he referred&mdash;correctly, in my view&mdash;to the peculiar appropriateness of group working or co-operative working in relation to bog development.  That is perfectly true and that is the key to the whole approach here.  The distinction being made is between a registered co-op and an unregistered co-op which is in the form of a group.  There is some practical experience of the operation of this kind of thing under schemes which have been administered by the Department of Agriculture and they have worked satisfactorily without the difficulties that Deputy Kelly has envisaged.</P>
      <P>One thing Deputy Kelly said may have been literally correct but the implication was not correct.  The Deputy said that the agreement entered into by such a group would not be subject to the control of the Minister.  Literally that is true but it would not be subject to the approval of Bord na Móna.  To that extent the House can take it that an agreement of this kind would be subject to the approval of criteria.  For instance, I can see no reason why there would be any point in an agreement between a man, his wife and his brother if only one of them had something to contribute and it was purely a device to get the higher level of grants, as I could not see Bord na Móna accepting that such an agreement would meet with approval and would enable such persons to get the higher grant.  The parties to the agreement would have to be able to contribute something and I envisage that what they would contribute would be a stretch of bogland.</P>
      <P>This gets it back to the point about appropriateness of co-operation in regard to the development of bogs.  In order to make any economical use of mechanical methods of turf harvesting one requires between 200 and 250 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3479" /> The nature of the ownership of many bogs here is such that either there are numerous owners of small stretches less than 200 acres or large stretches of bog owned in commonage.  Either way each individual does not have access to a stretch of bogland enabling him to use mechanical harvesting on an economical basis.  That is what Deputy Kelly had in mind when he referred to the appropriateness of a group approach to the development of bogs.  That is a physical fact related to the pattern of ownership of bogland.  For that reason and because the purpose of the Bill is to increase the production of turf, it follows that we want to encourage mechanical production and that given the circumstances outlined we should give particular encouragement to groups to get together so that between them they can provide an economical basis from which to machine harvest turf. In recognition of that, primarily, the higher level of grant is being made available to co-operatives and groups.</P>
    <P>The individual who has a large stretch of bogland and proposes to develop it is almost certainly doing so on a commercial basis if it is sufficiently large to justify the use of machinery, or a company which is doing so will in the normal way do it on a commercial basis.  If turf is being developed on a commercial basis, having regard to the market available the grant of 45 per cent is not ungenerous.  In the case of the smallholders the level of grant proposed is 60 per cent and it cannot be regarded as being excessively generous having regard to the contribution of 40 per cent that each will have to make.</P>
    <P>There is no dispute between Deputy Kelly and myself on that score.  I gather that the Deputy objects to the distinction between the individual or company on the one hand and the co-operative on the other.  I have tried to explain why that distinction is being made.  The only question at issue in this amendment is that the amendment deals with a situation in which Deputies urged on Second Stage &mdash; and I was satisfied that there was some substance in their submissions &mdash; that in some cases the red tape formality and legal obligations involved in the registration <Col N="3480" /> of industrial or provident societies can operate to prevent the formation of groups which would otherwise go ahead and produce more turf.  This is a practical problem.  I found that some Deputies were trying to organise groups to form co-ops in anticipation of the passing of this Bill, to develop bogland, and they were running into this problem.  It is to meet that problem that I have introduced this amendment.  It will not have the effects that Deputy Kelly fears.  It will help to ensure achievement of the primary aim of this Bill which is to get more turf produced so that we can use our own resources and avoid imports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point and I sympathise.  If the Minister's point is to get people who have small areas of bogland to pool them without the red tape of forming themselves into a legal co-operative, I approve of it.  However, it does not come through in the words of the Minister's amendment.  I know a person who is more or less the sole beneficiary, the owner or proprietor of a stretch of bog which is in the process of development, and as matters stand he will qualify for the 45 per cent grant.  I agree that is a good grant.  However, so far as the Minister's section I goes, assuming that this amendment becomes law, that individual will be able to claim a 60 per cent grant by a device whereby two other people who would not contribute a yard of bogland to his enterprise will agree with him to do this work.  A technical employee or an associate of his could contribute know-how or interest and could ally himself so far as the Minister's amendment goes with the proprietor so as to form a qualified group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the board must approve of this agreement.  I do not see any sinister intention here but I must complain about legislation which includes a completely free floating arbitrary discretion in a statutory board effectively to shut someone off from the benefit of something which the law as it stands appears to give him.  On what criteria will the board approve?  If what is central to the Minister's thinking is that this provision is intended in ease of people <Col N="3481" /> who are all proprietors of bits of bogland and want to put it into a pool and qualify for the upper grant, let him say so.  What is to stop him having a further amendment or expanding or drafting this in a slightly different way so as to impose the black and white condition that each member of the group must be the beneficial owner or at least have an interest in a special bogland sufficient to entitle him legally to contribute that strip of bogland towards the common enterprise?  I cannot draft that amendment or expanded amendment off the top of my head, but I am sure I could do it in a quarter of an hour if I sat down and took pen and paper.</P>
    <P>So long as I have been in Opposition in this House and the other one I have listened to Ministers talking about law enforcement assuming that everybody will behave reasonably.  This is a bad principle, because history shows that the law books are littered with incidents of Ministers who did not behave reasonably, not out of any sinister intent but just because they misconstrued their powers and went too far or fell into the comfortable misconception that they could do what they damn well liked.  The Minister is going to give this free voting power to the board to approve or disapprove this agreement, and in those circumstances he ought at least take the trouble to write in the criteria on which this approval or disapproval is to be granted withheld.</P>
    <P>My party is anxious to see the Bill pass, and we will not hold it up or make a meal out of it, but I would appeal to the Minister to look again at the section and the amendment.  I make him a present of his having the best possible intent.  So far as the amendment goes I know its purpose is a salutary one, and I support it, but it is so loosely drafted it does not seem to exclude a development which would effectively eliminate the low level grant altogether or, if it does not eliminate it, allow it to survive at the uncontrolled discretion of the board exerciseable according to criteria which are not visible.</P>

      <P>When I spoke earlier I referred to the fact that I envisaged each <Col N="3482" /> party in the group regarding this amendment as contributing something.  I said that what I would normally expect would be that they would contribute a stretch of bogland, but I did not say that was the only situation that could arise.  It would be certainly the most common, but one could envisage a situation in which one party contributed the use of machinery and other parties contributed the use of bogland.  There could be other possibilities, and that is why it is not spelled out precisely here.  I will certainly undertake to consider further the points Deputy Kelly has made.  This is not just as straightforward as it looks if one wants to cover the various possibilities that exist. I would point out that something similar has been operated satisfactorily under schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.

This is not intended, and the official amendment is designed to clarify the position.  In its new form the definition gives equal status to all co-operatives registered under the 1893 Act but, for the purposes of the Bill, such societies must have for their purpose or objectives the provision of turf for fuel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion of the words &ldquo;to a significant extent&rdquo; would mean that even in a situation where the proposed development would be mildly detrimental to the board's interests the board could propose their refusal of a grant application and in that event referral of the change to the Minister in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section would be required.  Obviously there would be quite a few such cases and consequently a high rate of referrals to the Minister, thereby delaying or even frustrating worthwhile bog development projects by private interests for what might well turn out to be the most trivial of reasons.  Indeed, on its own and without what I might call the follow through in amendment No. 10, it would not have any other immediate effect.</P>
      <P>The net effect of amendment No. 10 would be to leave the Minister with no power other than that of confirming the board's power to refuse the application which, it can be assumed, it would have done in the first place but for the referral provision.  Accordingly, acceptance of this amendment would defeat the whole purpose of the provision which, as I said on Second Reading, I regard as crucial and necessary as a sort of assurance to private developers of fair treatment where there is a conflict of interest between them and the board.  For these reasons I am not disposed to accept amendment No. 7 or Amendment No. 10.</P>

      <P>The idea encompassed in these amendments is embraced already in section 6 (2) (b) in that refusal of a grant application in terms of subsection (2) (b) would, by inference, comprehend a development that would be detrimental to employment by the board.  Of course Bord na Móna's primary objective is the optimum development of bogs for fuel. While I accept that maintenance of maximum employment is of the highest importance, it cannot become a priority in itself in the context of this Bill, It is not the essential purpose of this Bill.  As I have already indicated, its essential purpose is the maximum production of turf for fuel.  However, it should be remembered that a considerable number of new jobs is expected as a result of increased activity in the development of bogs by private interests.  In these circumstances it would be inappropriate to establish what amounts to a statutory preference for employment by Bord na Móna over that by private developers, as these amendments would seek to do.

However, as I indicated in an interjection earlier on a point made by Deputy Kelly, I agree with the intent of the Deputy's amendment: that ministerial directives under this section should be made public.  This can best be done through including particulars of any such directives in the annual report which Bord na Móna are required under section 18 of the 1946 Act to furnish to the Minister and which he is obliged to lay before each House of the Oireachtas under that section.  Essentially I think this will meet the Deputy's concern that ministerial directives should be published.  In the circumstances I hope the House will agree that his amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>As the provision stands it imposes what amounts to a constraint on Bord na Móna in that it precludes the board from refusing to make a development grant solely for the reason that the bog the subject of the grant application is capable of and suitable for development by the board itself.  The amendment seeks to remove this constraint.  Quite an amount of bogland in this country could be classed as capable of and suitable for development by Bord na Móna and, by <Col N="3490" /> implication, similarly capable of and suitable for development by private interests who would be the owners or have turbary rights over such boglands but who in the circumstances of this amendment could nevertheless be refused a grant by the board which, a looking to its future development programme, might wish to reserve such boglands for their use though actual development might not be planned for many years to come.  I am not saying that this would actually happen but the amendment offers that possibility. Subsection (2) of this section provides for situations in which the board may refuse to give a development grant and affords adequate protection for any bog developments planned by the board in the reasonable future.  I regard the constraints imposed on the board by subsection (1) of this section as central to achieving the aim of this Bill and of respecting the reasonable freedom of bog owners or of turbary right owners to engage in private development.  I think it will be clear to the House that it is necessary to endeavour to maintain a fair balance between the requirements of Bord na Móna and those of the owners of bogland or of turbary rights.  I sought to do this in the Bill.  To upset that balance would be not alone unfair but might well call into question the legality of this Bill.  For that reason I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

These are what we might call conflict of interest type cases.  It is my intention that the nominee of Bord na Móna would be appointed to be a member of this advisory committee.  I would expect that such a nominee would take into account the interests of the board's work force regarding issues on which the committee would be consulted by the Minister.  I hardly think that second congress representation would be required.  Therefore, I am not inclined to accept this amendment and I think that in the circumstances I have outlined it is not necessary.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the matters he is referring to are matters of administration the requirements of which may change from time to time.  I am not sure that it would be appropriate, even if it were possible, to provide for this in the Bill.  My intention in spelling out the obligations which I see devolving on Bord na Móna and having <Col N="3494" /> been on the record of this House is that they can be utilised in dealing with Bord na Móna and would be a guideline to Bord an Móna with regard to the administration expected on this scheme.

I can see that there might be material reasons for changing a scheme or criteria on which a scheme is administered, but I would be anxious to make sure that the public and the people interested in availing of this know where they stand.  It should not be possible for the board arbitrarily and at a whim, capriciously perhaps, to change criteria in such a way that a scheme which would have got by on one of these group agreements or a plan for development which would have got by last month will not get by this month or <i>vice versa.</i>  I will not hold the Minister up, but he might consider between now and the time the Bill goes to the Seanad whether he will write a short section into the Bill.  Of course, that would mean coming back to the Dáil, but we will facilitate him when he is seeking for this from the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I know we have inflation, but this is ridiculous.  It is only two months or perhaps a little more since this Bill arrived in this House.  Was it since Christmas or just before Christmas?  I am not exactly sure, but it was in the middle of the winter.  At that time the purpose of section 13 was to provide for an increase in this limit from £28 million to £40 million and in the short space of these few months second thoughts have overcome the Department and presumably the board and now it is £50 million they want.  Is there any reason for this sudden raising of the ceiling in such a short time?

      <P>I would like to say, at the risk of boring the Minister, leaving party politics out of it, that I hope, whoever is in charge of his Department after the next election, will dig out the idea which I advanced on Second Stage and again this morning.  This is the idea of trying to see, in the localities in which the country could conveniently be divided for such a purpose, if it might not be possible to establish co-operative societies or groups with the simplest possible structure in which there would be widest possible and most informal local membership devoted to conducting an energy audit in the district to find out how much energy of various kinds in that district is actually consumed.  This could show what room there is for cutting down that consumption, the potential source of energy creation which exists there in the form of bog development, small-scale hydro development and, once the technology becomes cheaper and better understood, the generation of wind power which could be fed into the national grid, the collection of waste and the heating of large premises, schools, factories or glasshouse undertakings.  These are all small-scale activities which our experience over the last eight years has taught us we should not despite.  The collective effect of those in the conditions we live in could not possibly be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also activities that lend themselves well to voluntary effort and, I make no apology for saying, to juvenile effort, the kind of effort which even very young people can be encouraged to take an interest and pride in: the collection of waste, the reclamation of small patches of ground, the planting of small-scale forests and so forth.  I am not suggesting to <Col N="3497" /> the Minister, if he is still in charge after the election, any more than I would ask my own colleague if we are in charge or if I am that Minister myself, that the Department or the State should engage in a wild, nationwide overall attempt to do something which has never been done before.  I am however, suggesting that some consideration should be given to the possibility of total energy co-operative development along those lines in localities which are small enough for the individual to have a certain over-view of, so that he can see and feel the results of his own particular effort in the development of alternative sources and so on.  A co-operative effort of that kind would actually be money-making depending on the rate of success.  This could, on an experimental level, even if it was only in a gingerly way, be tried out and, if the experiment proved promising, it could be gradually extended.  If it did not prove promising it could be folded up.</P>
    <P>The Bill had an unreserved welcome from this side of the House, as the Minister will admit.  The thing I most like about it is the co-operative element which it discloses.  I am glad to see the Minister take an interest in it even though I am not entirely happy about the form of discriminating between co-ops and others. I would have liked the Minister to go further.  I wish, if things go against him in the election, that whoever is responsible for that Department on my side, will go further, precisely in the energy field, along the lines of co-operative effort.  I, however, welcome the Bill and I am glad, after a rather dull and unadventurous four years in the Dáil, in which it was very difficult to see that any great initiative was being shown or any great new thinking was anywhere around in the Government ranks, that we appear to be closing on a note on which I do not have to speak any bitter words.  I know there is other business to come but that will conclude my contribution to the 21st Dáil.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to Deputy Kelly that, as he knows, we are engaged in the process of evaluation and are successfully bringing to the attention of the public the importance of a number of aspects of energy production and energy conservation which, as he correctly said, was not very highly regarded a few years ago.  Energy conservation is a matter to which I have given a great deal of attention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly mentioned juvenile participation. I am glad to tell him we have had a very successful competition for children of first and second level schools in connection with energy conservation. The standard has been very high, particularly in the primary schools.  The prizes will be awarded very shortly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of co-ops which would pursue all of those matters at the one time in particular areas, that idea has considerable attraction but I am not yet convinced that it is capable of practical application.  I hope in due course to have the opportunity to examine that in more detail.  I would again like to thank Deputy Kelly for his approach to this Bill.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Fisheries)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our fishing industry is in a chaotic state.  Over the last four years it has gone steadily downhill.  There may be other factors involved but, basically the Government must take the lion's share of the blame because the ills of our fishing industry, which originated in Brussels, have continued over the last four years and festered.  The result is that there is great dissatisfaction around our coasts. Fishermen have not been so badly off for many years.  At one stage, fish was very scarce because of the inordinate amount of poaching engaged in by our continental EEC partners, principally the Dutch, French and, recently the Spaniards. When we built up our naval protection service, eliminated a great deal of illegal fishing and got viable catches of fish, we found the fish could not be sold at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person is to make his living at any business he must be able to sell his produce and make a fair margin of profit. The reverse has been the case in the Irish fishing industry over the past four years. During the debate on this Estimate some astounding figures which illustrate that point were brought to light.  A Government Deputy, the newly-elected Member for Donegal, Deputy Coughlan, supplied us with figures from the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation which were a damning indictment of this Government and their lack of a fisheries policy and, in particular, their lack of a marketing policy. According to the figures supplied by that organisation, in 1977 a box of whiting would fetch £11.50; today it fetches £8.40.  If it is sold into intervention a man will get only £6 for it because, as the Minister of State told us two months ago, the price for whiting sold into intervention has been reduced from £8 to £6 a box by the EEC.  This Government agreed to that reduction, despite the fact that costs have spiralled out of all proportion. The costs of running a fishing boat, buying diesel and so on have been <Col N="3500" /> multiplied.  Nevertheless, a box of whiting which fetched £11.50 in 1977 now fetches the princely sum of £8.40.  In 1977 a box of haddock fetched £15; today it is still £15.  In 1977 mackerel fetched £3.50 a box; today it is £3.31, another drop.  In 1977 herring fetched £14 a box; today it is £12.20 a box.  In 1977 cod fetched £20 a box; today it is £17.69.  In 1977 haddock fetched £15; today it is £8.40.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister say the Irish fishing industry is thriving?  He said the prophets of doom and gloom are wrong, that there is no crisis in the fishing industry. Of course there is.  Those statistics spell it out, not that the consumer is benefiting from the drop in prices. Despite the prices I have quoted the consumer still pays at least 80p a pound for cod, whiting or any other fish.  The box of whiting for which the fisherman gets £5.70 contains approximately 42 pounds when filleted.  Sold by the retailer at at least 80p a pound, it will bring in £33.60. This is what is happening.  Would you blame the fishermen for complaining? They are paid £5.70 for a box of whiting which sells for £33.60.  Cod fetching £17 a box sells at £54.60.  This means whiting is sold for six times the amount paid to the fishermen and cod is sold for three times the price paid to the fishermen.  A number of people along the line are making a kill.  But what is being done to improve the marketing situation?  When our fishermen are getting only one-sixth of the selling price, something is very seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>In most provincial towns it is almost impossible to get fish any day of the week. It may be available on the Dublin or Cork markets and it may be landed at every port from Killybegs to Dunmore East, but it is not being distributed or marketed properly.  The buck stops here.  The Minister is the person responsible.  There has been a total collapse in the distribution and marketing of fish and that is one of the prime reasons for the present chaos in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the present situation is our inability to negotiate in Brussels. A fisherman has no security.  He does not know what the future holds. Now, nine years after our entry into the <Col N="3501" /> EEC, we still do not have a common fisheries policy.  The French are still insisting that, come 1982, they will fish up to our shores.  They should be told to take a run.  This thing of safeguarding their fishermen's rights is a lot of poppycock. The French have done more to ruin Irish fisheries than any other country in the world.  They persist in fishing with small mesh nets.  They kill anything they come across.  They have no respect for conservation.  They take what they can get and sell it.  They eat virtually everything from the size of a sprat upwards. They do not deserve to get a hearing when they start talking about historical rights and fishing up to our shores.  Their historical performance has been that they destroyed our fisheries.  The French go after the bottom fish and the Dutch are prone to chase herring and, latterly, mackerel.  The Dutch have destroyed our herring fishing.  These people should be put in their place.</P>
    <P>That was the job of the present Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Lenihan, and they failed miserably.  The fishermen know it and are feeling savage over the lack of strength being shown by the two Ministers in question at the negotiating table in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The best bit of negotiating done for Irish fishermen with our EEC partners was by the present Leader of Fine Gael at The Hague in October 1976 when he got the other eight members to agree that Ireland's case in fishery matters should be given special consideration.  I have here a report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which states:</P>
    <P>It was agreed by the members of the EEC that the Irish fishing industry is unique in the Community in that it is still only at a developing stage whereas the industry is contracting in the other member states.</P>
    <P>At that Hague meeting a resolution was passed declaring the intention of the EEC to provide for the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry on the basis of the Irish Government's <Col N="3502" /> fishery development programme for coastal fisheries.</P>
    <P>That was a firm commitment but where has it gone?  What has happened to that resolution?  It has been thrown out the window.  The French insist that from 1 January next they will fish up to our shores, a complete retraction of the 1976 Hague agreement under which Ireland had a special case.  According to the French, the Dutch and the others who signed the agreement, no longer is that case valid.  They have reneged on their commitment.  The Minister should be in Brussels fighting to see this is not allowed to happen.  That is his job.</P>
    <P>Instead of getting special treatment for our fisheries we have got nothing, and basically the reason for that is that we made a cardinal error two years ago when we tied ourselves to the British stance in negotiations.  The present Minister for Foreign Affairs then came back from Brussels and told us he would adopt the British approach in fishery matters.  He had failed to enforce the terms of The Hague agreement.  He found the British Minister in charge of fisheries digging his heels in and getting somewhere, so he decided to tag along.  But between the jigs and the reels, the British did not get anywhere and in tagging along with them we allowed our case under The Hague agreement to go down the drain.</P>
    <P>Here we are back at square one.  Under the terms of that Hague agreement we were to be allowed to double our catches in a three-year period.  In 1976 Irish fishermen caught 75,000 tonnes of fish and by natural progression, therefore, we were to be allowed to catch 150,000 tonnes in 1979.  In the Minister's speech he estimated that we caught 86,000 tonnes in 1979.  That in itself is an indictment of our fisheries policy during those three years.  Why was that basic element of The Hague agreement not fulfilled if the Government, as they stated in their manifesto, were committed to the development and expansion of our fishing industry?  That target was attainable. Why has there been this disgraceful shortfall?</P>
    <P>In his statement introducing the Estimate <Col N="3503" /> the Minister made great play of the increase from 1979 to 1980 in our fish catches.  He told us our fishermen landed 135,000 tonnes of fish in 1980.  Let us not get carried away by that figure &mdash; let us scrutinise it.  We will find that a considerable part of that catch was taken by purse seiners fishing off the north west coast.  They took huge quantities of mackerel.  Of course, statistics can mean anything if you twist them enough.  That is why I am taking a realistic look at that figure of 135,000 tonnes.  How much of it was mackerel, how much of it was herring and white fish?  If we look at the species of fish taken we will see that a considerable portion was mackerel.  Other species mean more employment on boats and on shore.</P>
    <P>We may be told that we are making the catch up by taking so much mackerel.  My answer is that there has been a disgraceful lack of control of the manner in which mackerel are being caught by purse seining. It is the deadliest form of fishing practised.  The fish have not got a chance. Whole shoals of fish are surrounded and caught wholesale.  All you need is a 120-foot boat, but in terms of conservation it is a disaster.  Purse seining was responsible for wiping out the herring stocks in the North Atlantic and in the North Sea. They then concentrated on the Celtic Sea and we know the result.  It was over-fished by purse seining, a practice outlawed in many countries.</P>
    <P>Serious thought should be given to whether we should continue to legalise that form of fishing.  I live in Waterford. A most modern port was built in Dunmore East because of the herring fishing in the Celtic Sea.  Nowadays it is virtually idle because there are no more herring because of over-fishing.  We are now inviting the same disaster by allowing purse seining of mackerel off the northwest coast.  I do not know if any control is being exercised in this matter.  Three or four months ago the Minister admitted that there had not been any reckoning of the total catch in that area.  The Minister has admitted that in the years 1979, 1980 and 1981 there have been no quotas &mdash; none.  The whole stock out there could <Col N="3504" /> be wiped out in one year and nobody could be prosecuted for breaking the law because no total allowable catch figures have been set.  That is a totally irresponsible position.  The most important things regarding fish stocks are management, control and conservation and we are doing nothing in that regard with respect to the mackerel fisheries off the north west coast.  I suppose what happened was that there was a bit of a boom, that up to 10 or 12 years ago we saw mackerel only in July, August and September when they came up to the beaches and you could catch them with the hook and a sprat. People did not think they were commercial fish to be netted.  First to do that I think were the Kerry and Cork men on the Beara peninsula.  In more recent times mackerel have become an all-year-round fishing stock.  In our usual and consistent fashion we are about to wipe them out.  It is time we had a policy and had control to see to it that there is not complete over-fishing as I believe there is at present, not just by Irish boats but by many foreign countries some of whom are in the EEC such as the Danes whose fishing methods are unscrupulous and ruthless.  They have been known to wipe out whole fishing areas all over the North Sea.  Their commercial fishing enterprises are capable of taking more fish out of the sea than the remaining EEC countries put together.  But they are being allowed in.  I should like to know from the Minister who is out there monitoring what is being caught and how much because as surely as day follows night that stock will be eliminated shortly.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the position of limits and lack of limits, I suppose it is boring and repetitious to go back to what the present Taoiseach said in 1975 and 1976 and what an array of present Ministers said when in opposition about the fifty-mile limit.  In a nutshell it was 50 miles and not an inch less &mdash; that was the message. What have we after four years of Government by the very same people? We have the French telling us that they will fish up to the shore from 1 January next, that they will not allow an exclusive limit of one inch, never mind 50 miles. Would the Minister tell us what he is <Col N="3505" /> going to do to stop the French from coming in because if they come in they will all come in and the little quantity of fish we are now catching will be lost?  It is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>On top of this, looming ahead we have the imminent membership of Spain in the EEC.  The Spanish fishing fleet is probably larger than the fleet of any of the present members of the EEC.  If they get into our inshore fishing grounds we will get no more whiting, plaice or haddock because they thrive on those species. Presently, we have them kept out to some extent; they are off the Inishkea Islands and the west coast of Mayo and they are getting catches of hake under licence, but when they become EEC members they will not need a licence.  They will not be in court as they were in Cork yesterday, ten of them being fined a total of £235,000.  They will be thumbing their noses at the Minister and saying that they can fish up to the shore on the same terms as the French.  Now is the time to make a stand.</P>
    <P>Before we went into the EEC the six existing members of the Community formulated a policy which was so heavily biased in their own favour that it was not funny.  Before the Spaniards get in we should get that common fisheries policy finalised and let us keep out at least one set of vultures.  We do not seem to be able to keep out the others.  I am not confident, seeing the way the Minister is negotiating, that we will have any success in keeping them out.  If the fish are there we should be allowed to retain them.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for the IFO suggestion that if these people are going to fish in our waters they should have to land a stipulated amount of their catch in this country.  If we were working in other countries I think we would encounter that kind of localised law under which you had to reciprocate so that if you were taking something you would have to give something in return.  It should be stipulated that a certain amount of the catch taken by these fleets, French, Dutch or German within our 200-mile limit would have to be landed and processed in Ireland. It is not good enough that they should hare back to their own ports with <Col N="3506" /> the whole lot and create employment on a huge scale with what they have taken from our waters.</P>
    <P>The ratio of shore-based jobs to jobs at sea in our case is less than one to one. For every man fishing we have fewer than one on shore earning a living in the processing industry.  I think what the Minister says in his statement is that in fish processing operations we have 1,600 people employed.  That is not something to boast about but rather to be ashamed of.  Possibly another 1,600 are employed in transport and ancillary activities but that would amount to only 3,200 people while we have 6,500 people fishing.  So, fewer than half are employed ashore and the ratio is about one to .5 which is a disgrace when one considers that the Danes and the Dutch have a ratio of one to seven or one to six.  For every fishermen at sea they have six or seven men ashore processing fish.  That illustrates how hopelessly we have handled the business of providing jobs.  The Fianna Fáil 1977 manifesto made great play with that very point and I invite the Minister to look at it.  It said they would provide many more jobs in fish processing.  I have not seen them.  Over all I think there may have been a drop in the numbers.  Certainly, the effort is pathetic.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with limits and our collapse at the negotiating table in Brussels and the bad prices Irish fishermen are getting, but the most disgraceful episode of all in recent years has been the way in which the EEC have allowed fish imports from third countries.  This is an area where any Irish Minister, seeing the market collapse before his eyes in this country, should invoke his power of veto.  That should be done.  We are not to be taken as a sop in Europe.  We are entitled to stand up and fight our corner.  Apparently it is all right for the Germans and the French to trade with the Canadians, the Icelanders and the Norwegians behind our backs but they should not be allowed to get away with it.  The primary reason why the price of fish in Killybegs, and our other ports, is as low as I mentioned earlier is imports from third countries.  That should not be tolerated.  We are aware that countries such as Norway, Canada, the Faroe <Col N="3507" /> Islands and Iceland have their own exclusive 200-mile limit.  They have excess fish and are only too willing to sell it off dirt cheap.  That is what they have been allowed to do for a long time.  That represents a disgraceful performance by the EEC and our own Minister.  Those countries should not be allowed to glut the markets of Europe with fish.</P>
    <P>In league with those countries we have the multinational supermarket chains. The whole fish industry seems to be tied up by half a dozen supermarket outlets which probably originate in Britain or some other part of the Continent.  It is those supermarkets, in league with the importers from the countries I mentioned, who are ruining our fish market. Why should Canadians be allowed to dump herrings here in unlimited quantities? The fishermen in my part of the country, whether they were fishing legally or illegally, could not sell their herring catches last winter because the country was flooded with imports from third countries.  No attempt was made to stop those imports.  In some ports in England boycotts are in operation to prevent imports from Norway, Iceland and other countries but the fish is imported through other ports.  All of Europe is being flooded by fish, processed and unprocessed, from third countries.  In any supermarket here one will find that shelves are stacked with processed fish from other countries.  Very little of the fish on display is processed here although the fish being sold can be caught off our coast.  It is an utter disgrace to allow such imports.</P>
    <P>For us to have a sound fishing industry we need proper management, proper controls and conservation.  That boils down to good policing.  The Naval Service are to be congratulated on the wonderful work they have been doing in recent years.  They have proved that given the proper equipment they can do a good job.</P>

      <P>There is still the smell of turf around following the discussion on the Bill dealing with turf by Deputies Colley and Kelly.  I could not think of two more unlikely individuals to be discussing turf.  In 1968, 1969 and 1970 we had but one fishery protection vessel.  The Dutch when they had about 200 boats fishing off the south coast could pay people onshore to monitor the journey of that fishery protection vessel.  If that vessel was seen steaming around Mizen Head the Dutch fished right into the shore around County Waterford.  I saw them at that time. When I complained about this poaching it took at least one full day before the corvette got around to put a cat among the pigeons.  I do not want any Fianna Fáil Minister to tell me about the lack of fishery protection.  It is only since the early seventies that a realistic attempt has been made to provide a proper fishery protection service.  Now that the Naval Service have the vessels at their disposal they are doing an excellent job.  We could <Col N="3509" /> see that if we read yesterday's <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  That newspaper printed a story of what happened to the Spaniards who tried to blight our fisheries.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service cannot do much more unless we fight our corner in Brussels.  What can they do to the French if there is not a common fisheries policy by the end of this year?  The French can thumb their noses at them again; they can wave to them and fish right into our shores.  The Naval Service will be powerless unless the Government give teeth to legislation which will give us exclusive limits.  After four years of Fianna Fáil Government we do not have such legislation despite the plea of that party for a 50-mile exclusive limit and not an inch less.</P>
      <P>It is another indictment of our lack of progress in fishery matters to say that we do not know what is out there.  Our lack of knowledge of the fishing grounds around the country is a serious matter which is causing great concern, as it should be.  In the last couple of years BIM commissioned trawlers to try to identify new fishing grounds.  That met with considerable success but we still have a very limited knowledge of what is there.  We were caught unaware, it appears, by the declaration of the 200-mile exclusive fishing limit.  I asked the Minister, and his predecessor, to outline the attempts that have been made to get aid to survey those fishing grounds.  It is ludicrous to think that we have this vast fishing ground and we do not know what type of fish is in most of it.  That could be an immensely rich fishing ground out there but we do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the last three or four years that we found out about the enormous mackerel fish bed off the north west coast and it was only two years before that we found out about the huge amount of blue whiting off the Galway coast, in the Procupine Bank area.  That is in recent times. There could be further huge new fisheries off the south coast and off the south west coast about which we know nothing. There has been very little money spent in this pursuit.  Our Common Market partners have an onus on them too because <Col N="3510" /> the bulk of these fishing grounds are open to them.  They have a duty to see that the knowledge is made available.  It is a huge undertaking.  If one takes in the 200-mile limit, the whole area is considerably greater than the area of Ireland itself.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's intentions regarding the Celtic Sea herring fishery? In reply to a Dáil question here on 10 March last the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Hussey, who was standing in for the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, had been negotiating in Brussels for a limited re-opening of the Celtic Sea.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of his demands to get that limited re-opening. It is obvious that the Celtic Sea would not be able to sustain a major fishing effort for herring and I am in no way advocating that it should be open to middle water trawlers.  But I am strongly advocating that it be opened to small boats which are driftnetting from here.  It was a source of concern to me two weeks ago that some of my constituents were actually prosecuted and convicted in court in Waterford for fishing for herring by drift netting out of small boats.  These charges should have been dropped. These people are having a very rough time.  They are fishing out of open boats and their fishing effort is seasonal, herring in winter time and salmon in the spring and summer.  Their return for salmon catches, in particular last year, was disastrous.  It was the worst year for many decades and they did not make enough money last year to pay for the gear that they were using.</P>
    <P>They are having a very rough time of it and I feel that that limited opening of the Celtic Sea for herring fishing should be allowed.  I find it hard to believe that the EEC Council of Ministers could refuse such a request.  I would like to see for the forthcoming season a definite commitment to the reopening of that sea for driftnet boats.  Their catching power is extremely limited and they certainly would not deplete stocks.  It is well known in fishing circles that a certain amount of fishing is good for fishing stock.  They are inclined to become diseased if not fished, and limited fishing would certainly not <Col N="3511" /> damage the stock but sustain it and help it to increase.  I would not agree that the trawlers should be allowed back in. Obviously the fishery would be destroyed in a short period if they were.  I appeal to the Minister again to renew his efforts in Brussels to see that the Celtic Sea fishery is reopened.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to tell us what has happened regarding the St. George Fishery in Galway Bay.  Deputy Donnellan raised this matter at Question Time and attempted to raise it on the adjournment, maybe with some success on one occasion.  I believe that the Minister and the Taoiseach have given a commitment to the local fishermen that the St. George Fishery is going to be retained for the use of the fishermen in the Galway Bay area and that the French concern which is alleged to have purchased it are not going to have exclusive rights.  I would like the Minister to clarify the situation because I am told by Deputy Donnellan that the fishermen down there are not sure what the position is.  They are afraid that it might just be another election promise and that once the election is over the French will have the whole thing again.  We would all like a commitment as to the Government's intentions regarding the St. George fishery for Galway Bay.</P>
    <P>A considerable section of the Estimate deals with forestry.  I have mixed feelings about the state of the forestry industry here.  It is obvious that we have got a considerable amount of raw material and that we are making very poor use of the timber that is growing in State forests. Look at the figure quoted in this Estimate. There are 900,000 acres of this country's land under forestry at the moment.  That is a considerable amount of land.  A lot of that timber is coming to maturity at present and a vastly increased amount of it will come to maturity by 1990.  What are we doing with that timber? We have one processing plant in the whole country.  When this Government came into power in 1977 there were four timber processing plants here, the existing one at Scariff in County Clare, Irish Board Mills in Athy in the Minister's own <Col N="3512" /> constituency, a timber processing industry in Clondalkin and Munster Chipboard in Waterford.  To the Government's discredit three of these industries have closed down during their current term of office.  It is an absolute disgrace to think that we have 900,000 acres of forest and that we have only one processing industry and that that industry, according to this Estimate, has to be shored up by the Government.  How is it that with such a vast natural resource we cannot make it pay?  I suspect it is for the same reason that the fishing industry is not paying, unlimited imports from third countries, dumping of excess goods from Scandinavia or Eastern countries.</P>
    <P>This is where we lack clout within the EEC.  We are not prepared to fight our corner and to stop this type of activity which is putting hundreds, if not thousands, of people out of work here.  The Government must be tough and dig their heels in.  We should not allow chipboard or any other type of processed timber in if it means that factories here must close down.  We have not been sufficiently militant at the negotiating tables in Brussels. What happens is that these imports are allowed for far too long.  When they are finally stopped the industries here have been ruined financially.  The delay between the time we object and the time the dumping is stopped is too great. There must be some instant method of stopping that dumping.  The EEC lack teeth in this respect.</P>
    <P>Here we had four timber processing industries and three of them have closed down and the reason was dumping from Third countries.  I can think of no other reason because we have the raw material here ourselves.  The Munster Chipboard factory in Waterford should never have been allowed to close.  We had a categorical assurance from Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Fisheries that that factory would not be allowed to close.  It did, and the machinery has been sold off and the place cleared out.  That factory had employed about 400 people directly and indirectly and it should not have closed. The Minister's excuse was that the closure was due to a picket by a small group. A Government should not allow a picket <Col N="3513" /> to dictate policy.  The Government are here to govern.  If a few militant people can close down a major industry we must question whether the Government are doing their job.  That was not a valid excuse for closing down this factory.  If the will was there the factory would not have closed.  It is a clear case of the Government reneging on a promise to public representatives in the Waterford area, and it is to the eternal shame of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there has been an announcement of a new timber processing plant in Clonmel.  I hope the job projections are realised.  There is obviously a great need for a whole series of timber processing plants here.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of the provision of a chemical pulp mill during Question Time last week and the Minister did not respond very well.  That is the ultimate in the processing of timber.  A chemical pulp mill eventually manufactures newsprint, which is the limit to which one can go in the processing of timber.  At the moment we import vast amounts of newsprint every year.  I am told by forestry experts that we have now approached a stage where we can set up a viable chemical pulp mill which could process virtually all the output of the State forests.  That is an interesting proposition.  In his reply would the Minister tell his intentions in that regard?  The Minister's predecessor Deputy Lenihan knew about this project. There is such an industry in Fortwilliam in Scotland.  It had a lot of teething problems but it is now operating on a viable basis.  There is enough timber here to justify the establishment of such an industry. It would also be an excellent opportunity for cross-Border co-operation because the forests in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;could be included in the catchment area for the material to be used in such a plant.  It needs a vast amount of timber to be viable, and the whole country could provide enough timber in the next year or two to make it a <Col N="3514" /> going proposition.  Now is the time for us to examine this project.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that in the port of Waterford where an industry employed 400 people one can now see the timber piled higher than this building to be exported to Sweden at £1 a ton.  We closed down an industry and the timber which we would have used in it is now being exported for £1 a ton, as admitted by the Minister at Question Time in the Dáil, to the people who were responsible for dumping products which led to that closure.  It does not make sense, but that is what is happening.  It is incredible.</P>
      <P>We do a lot of talking and we react to disasters.  We close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  What fire safety measures are taken in State forests to prevent a lot of the 900,000 acres from being burned down?  If we have a very dry summer there will be a great danger to forests.  In updating the fire services have we included forests, which are potential areas for major disasters?  Most of our provincial fire services are a sort of bucket and shovel operation.  Some of them have to move the equipment by hand although some are lucky enough to have a fire tender which may be a 1910 or a 1915 model.  A fireman at Cappoquin told me that if there was a fire up in Melleray, a famous monastery above the town, the fire engine would not be able to get up the hill.  We are very deficient in this regard.  Is there a scheme to combat major fires which could happen or will forestry workers be confined to using buckets of sand and shovels to combat them?  We may have lost sight of this aspect when we were thinking about discos, dancehalls and other potential disaster areas.  Forests constitute a greater danger, particularly if we have a long stretch of dry weather.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will answer some of the questions, particularly those of Deputy Donnellan and in relation to setting up a chemical pulp mill which is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know much about fishing so I will not delve into something that I do not know much about.  The Minister has given a fine <Col N="3515" /> account of how his Department operate; he has an interest in it and he is doing a good job.  I do not understand a lot about fisheries but in relation to the processing of fish there is also the question of the marketing of fresh fish.  Fresh fish is unavailable inland, and I wonder what can be done to improve marketing in this area.  I would like the Minister to take up this question.  I will not go into EEC decisions, but I feel we have been dragging our feet in relation to fishing limits.</P>
      <P>Another type of fishing interests people not making their livelihood from fishing.  It is the fishing engaged in by tourists who come here to fish in the inland fisheries.  I am referring to rainbow trout.  I have problems myself in connection with rainbow trout lakes.  Some of them seem to be well stocked but, for whatever reason, it seems to be very hard to get any fish out of them.  I live beside a rainbow trout lake and it is stocked every year and the excuse given for bad fishing in it is too much feeding in the lake.  That is the excuse that is offered. What is the point in putting in fish when it is so very hard to get them out again?</P>
      <P>There are regulations governing fishing and I am wondering if enough research is being done.  I would like the Minister to have a look at it because this was a tremendous tourist attraction.  It used to be a splendid lake for fishing in, but now it is very hard to get fish out of it.  The first two years were superb.  What happened after that I just do not know. I do not know a great deal about fish but, as a public representative, I must naturally take an interest.  I merely mention fish in passing.  I live inland and I do not know enough about fish to go on talking about it.  However, I see the problems of fisheries within the EEC in regard to reaching agreements on certain limits.  I cannot understand why the French should be allowed to fish right up to our coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to forestry, I want to say a few words.  The Minister has given a detailed account of what the forestry people are doing.  I see here in fish, forestry and even the cattle trade the same problem. I cannot understand how it is we can <Col N="3516" /> export fish at a profit &mdash; the same goes for cattle &mdash; and apparently not command sufficient profit on domestic markets. Here we have the raw material in fish, in timber and in livestock.  Yet we are actually importing timber and sometimes that imported timber is sent to be processed abroad.  How that exercise could be economic I just cannot understand.  We seem unable to compete though we have all the raw material.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see something has been done for chipboard because that is very important as far as I am concerned.  I am on the border of Clare where there is an area of State forestry.  It provides good employment.  When these forests were initially planted the Fianna Fáil Government set great value on what they would produce for the nation.  As Deputy Deasy said, we should now be reaping the fruits of that planting.  Between now and 1990 I can see a great many jobs being provided as a result of afforestation.  I am glad the Minister visualises the Post Office and others buying and using Irish timber.  Everyone should use native timber as far as possible.  It is very important that forests should be replanted.  With the improvement in land reclamation it is possible that some of these forest lands could be reclaimed for agriculture.  I am glad to note there will be a new timber processing factory.  Afforestation has been heavily subsidised, but from now on the State should reap a good income from our forests for the money invested in them down through the years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hazard of fire, I would ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the position of the caretakers, many of whom live 12 or 13 miles from a telephone.  They should be provided with walkie-talkies to enable rapid communication. In that way it might be possible to cope with an outbreak of fire before too much damage has been done. Some of the areas are so isolated that the only help available would be the fellow who started the fire with a carelessly discarded match.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the importance of forests. There will be tremendous benefits from employment there within the next ten <Col N="3517" /> or 15 years.  I cannot understand importing anything from third countries.  Sometimes one is tempted to ask the Minister to use the veto in EEC.  On entry we were told all the advantages we would gain as a result of membership.  I do not know what advantage there is in third countries being enabled freely to import into the Community countries.  First we were to have a market in six countries and then in nine and that market was to be confined to member countries except in certain circumstances.  Now there are third countries flooding the EEC countries with produce which can be produced within the Community.  That should be discussed seriously within the EEC.</P>
    <P>The main reason I spoke was the Forestry Vote.  I am not qualified to speak on fisheries and I do not like speaking on a subject on which I am not an expert.  I hope the few suggestions I have made will be of help to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  He is one of the most agreeable men one could meet and, whether one is right or wrong, he is always prepared to have a joke with one. He is doing an excellent job and whether he be from Kildare or Killybegs, when he undertakes a job, one knows he will carry it out in the best interests of the people he represents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer first to the Forestry Estimate which provides for expenditure of £1,293,000 relating to the formation of Chipboard Products Limited.  This money represents State investment in the taking over of Scarriff Chipboard Limited by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister made his introductory remarks in the House on 26 March last I rose to protest but not at the taking over by the Government of Scarriff Chipboard because I welcome that move in principle.  In principle I welcome the provision of State finance and indeed State involvement in our timber processing industry.  I should make that quite clear. The State has an obligation to protect its investment in the forestry resources of the country and it is important that that be clearly stated.  The situation relating to forestry in general was outlined by the Minister in his introductory remarks from <Col N="3518" /> which I might quote at column 260 of the Official Report of 26 March last:</P>
    <P>Deputies are no doubt aware that, following on the closure of most of our mills processing small dimension wood, there have been serious difficulties in providing markets for forest thinnings.  We cannot reap the benefit of producing good saw log &mdash; from which the main income of forestry derives &mdash; unless forests can be thinned regularly.  Forest thinnings are now coming increasingly on stream as the heavy plantings of earlier years reach commercial stage of development.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the maturity of our forests will become evident towards the end of the present decade.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of the timber processing industry there were two reports identifying short-term problems in the chipboard processing industry but recognising its long-term prosperity. One was a confidential consultants' report which the Minister for Forestry commissioned himself and which has not unfortunately been published in full.  The second was a report of one of the State independent economic consultants &mdash; I think it was the NESC &mdash; who reported also that the long-term prosperity of the industry was assured.  It is against the Minister's own statement recognising the problem of dealing with forest thinnings, together with the clear indication of the long-term prosperity of the forestry processing industry, that what I have to say should be noted.  Munster Chipboard Limited was a factory which was processing the thinnings of our forests.  At full production it provided adult employment for approximately 400 people and afforded indirect employment to perhaps 200 others whether engaged in our forests or in carrying thinnings to the factory for the end product.</P>
    <P>I believe it was a disgrace that the present Government should have allowed the Minister Chipboard factory to close and go into receivership in view of the need to process forest thinnings and the long-term viability of the timber processing industry.  When Munster Chipboard Limited threatened closure I <Col N="3519" /> went on a deputation with others from Waterford to the then Minister for Forestry, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I recall that meeting quite clearly.  We found the Minister was <i>au fait</i> with the situation, as were the civil servants advising him.  We came away happy from that meeting because we had received categoric assurances. I remember those words particularly because I asked the Minister for a categoric assurance of the continued operation of Munster Chipboard Limited. We were given that categoric assurance that the factory would remain open. What a perfidious Minister we were talking to.  What a sad outcome the result of our being misled on that deputation &mdash; we had been sent really by the people of Waterford &mdash; by such a perfidious Minister. When deputations approach Ministers it is sad that they cannot be told the truth.</P>

      <P>There should be standards. There used to be standards.  When one would go to a Minister one would ask a question and receive a straight, honourable reply.  That was not the case in this instance.  We went home happy in the knowledge that Munster Chipboard Limited were secure in their operations, that the Minister would use his influence in the Cabinet and probably also his powers under the Forestry Act to provide the necessary finance.  We went back to Waterford happy in the knowledge that the State would back what it should be backing, indeed that it has a responsibility to back, that is, its investment in the resources of the country.  We went home like innocent lambs having been led to the slaughter.  The Government did not back up the Minister's categoric assurance and the factory was allowed to die <Col N="3520" /> an unnecessary death.  The excuse advanced by the Minister was that because of an unnofficial picket mounted at the gate the interested company, which I think was Cement-Roadstone, refused to continue.  Of course that was also a misleading reason; I think Cement-Roadstone were introduced into the situation as a red herring.</P>
      <P>The industry was allowed to die without State aid.  The Fianna Fáil Government, therefore, refused to back up their own investment in Irish resources, in Irish forestry.  They refused to recognise their responsibility to ensure that the raw materials of the country are processed to the best advantage of the people of Ireland. We have now on the quayside of Waterford the spectacle of the raw material, the thinnings of our forestry, being exported.  That was an obvious result of the lack of facilities to process these material resources which was caused directly by Fianna Fáil.  I do not blame the entrepreneur for exporting the raw material, and I wish him luck.  I do not believe it is £1 a ton.  It may very well be £1 a ton ex forest but I understand that by the time the thinnings get to the quayside the approximate cost is £13 per ton which I further understand is something the same as the price delivered to the factory.  I am not quite sure of my final figures and the Minister would have the greater authority, but I believe the costing on the quayside is somewhat comparable to the costing at the factory gate. Be that as it may, it is unfortunate that we are now exporting raw materials to Sweden which we could probably process at home and thus give good employment on a long-term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very sad episode in my political life was that we should have been misled in such a cavalier fashion, by a Minister of a Government making little of a deputation and of the mayor and public representatives of any constituency, in this case Waterford.  I feel that there was a Machiavellian plot aboard.  Indeed, I am convinced of it, because the money is now provided in Vote 38 and under forestry for the salvation of Chipboard Ltd., Scarriff.  Good luck to the people and good luck to the employees in County <Col N="3521" /> Clare.  I am happy for them.  However, the same thing could and should have been done for the Munster Chipboard Company in order to secure the maximum utilisation of the resources of this country.  I am afraid that political patronage was involved.  I fear that the Government are enamoured of a particular company, McInerneys, who are great supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party. Good luck to them, but I am sad to have to say to this House that I feel that the prime motivation of the Government in taking over Chipboard Scarriff was the political involvement of the partner, whereas in Waterford there is no such political involvement.  The Government were wrong not to support the two factories. The two factories apparently specialised in slightly different areas of chipboard marketing and both areas should have been supported.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed too by the Minister's reference to the ordinary share capital of Chipboard Ltd., Scarriff.  We are now investing in a company and I want to be assured by the Minister in his reply that the State will maintain a majority interest in this company.  That was not stated in the Minister's opening speech. I want to be quite sure that the share option scheme mentioned in the Minister's speech was not McInerneys'&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that of the partnership firm in the deal, and that the share option does not operate against the huge State investment in Chipboard Ltd., Scariff, involving apparently £334,000 of ordinary share capital.  The State will also subscribe a powerful £200,000 for 15 per cent redeemable cumulative preference shares and will provide a loan of £466,000 for a period of 12 years.  There will also be a provision for the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to provide, if he continues to be satisfied with the company's programme, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, capital grants totalling £1,012,000 over a three-year period.  That is a phenomenal investment <Col N="3522" /> by the State.  In addition to all this the Government will guarantee £400,000 of a bank loan.  I want to be assured unreservedly that the State will maintain, so to speak, in perpetuity a majority of the ordinary shareholding in this company and that there will be no question of the partnership firm, the private firm, buying out the shares of the Government.  This is the wealth of the people of Ireland and they are entitled to have it protected.  I will insist in this House on the protection of the people's investment in this company.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the same could have been done for the Munster Chipboard Company and it should have been done for them.  The then Minister for Fisheries and Forestry gave every indication that whatever steps would be necessary to maintain the Munster Chipboard Company as a viable firm would be taken.  He reneged on that undertaking, to his discredit and to the discredit of the Government and of the general standards a parliamentarian likes to feel exist among Government Ministers. We certainly are suffering from low standards in high places, if I may quote Deputy Colley, Minister for Energy, in a statement he made some years ago.  It is unfortunate for the people of Ireland that that should be, but what is the position now?  Apparently we are going to have a new Medford Corporation at Clonmel who will reverse the position, but the position could have been reversed by sustaining the Munster Chipboard Company and by adapting if necessary the processing in that firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad tale of political patronage but it is also a direct blow to employment in Waterford city, my own constituency, where nigh on 400 people could and should have been employed this very day and should be looking forward to long-term future prosperity with the Munster Chipboard Company.  It is a terrible waste of national resources and a terrible indictment of the Government that they should see fit to throw away the opportunity of having further processing of our forest thinnings and our natural resources.  That is where the main fault lies.  Unfortunately, it is a reflection of <Col N="3523" /> the commitment of Fianna Fáil to the development of the Waterford region.</P>
    <P>The reason for the lack of prosperity of the Munster Chipboard Company in the short term was dumping of chipboard products on the English market especially by third countries.  There again the Government were weak.  They did not take the necessary steps at EEC level to protect the markets from dumping from third countries.  Again, this was a weak Government operating in a weak fashion at EEC level, but we have come to expect that.  We have a reflection of it here every day.  We had a discussion this morning on special provisions for certain industries. When we joined the EEC in 1973 we had allowed the EEC to settle the fishery policy in 1972.  Directly in the middle of our negotiations the carpet was swept from under our feet and EEC regulations were established just before Ireland joined the Common Market.  This is a reflection of the ineptitude of the then Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing the same ineptitude in agriculture, where the performance of the Minister and his predecessor has allowed farm incomes to fall back over 50 per cent during the past few years.  The Minister has not got the clout at European level the country is entitled to and had under the last Coalition Government. The Minister for Agriculture under the Coalition Government was the most successful Minister for Agriculture the country has ever seen.  He stands out in sharp contrast to the failure of the present Minister for Agriculture in relation to all matters.</P>
    <P>It is becoming quite obvious at all levels that the Government are a weak government divided amongst themselves and are badly prepared to fight our cause in Europe.  They have failed on almost every front to secure prosperity for our people.  We have the second highest inflation rate in Europe.  I remember the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, saying that he would resign if unemployment went over 100,000.  It is now in excess of 126,000 and this morning we were told that the jobs of a further 25,000 people were in jeopardy without the special <Col N="3524" /> employment scheme which has been introduced.</P>
    <P>That is the sad story of a Government elected with a flourish by the people, a strong Government with a 20-seat majority. People expected great things from them.  How disappointed they must be now.  The ineptitude of the Government has also spread to forestry, where there was not a commitment to ensure the development of our forests.  We are not happy to see what could have been an excellent company go down the drain. An opportunity has been lost to have a flourishing timber processing industry for the nation.</P>
    <P>I represent a coastal county on the Celtic Sea.  Dunmore East was a prosperous harbour bubbling with a herring fleet in the early seventies but it is now a depressed port.  The Celtic Sea has been closed for herring fishing.  I understand the need to preserve stocks and I support measures for the conservation of herring stocks to ensure the long term availability of herring.  There are in my constituency about 500 driftnet fishermen who operate small boats up to 50 feet in length.  They depend for their livelihood on fishing for herring during the herring season.</P>
    <P>This is the reason why I asked the Minister on 10 March last to open the Celtic Sea to those small fishermen who operate small boats.  Their catch is not very large when compared with the large boats.  It is extremely unproductive in commercial terms but they were getting a livelihood from driftnet fishing.  When I asked the Minister to allow the Celtic Sea to be opened I did not get a very satisfactory reply, and I raised the matter in an Adjournment Debate on 18 March when I pleaded for those 500 driftnet fishermen who operate from Waterford and some from the Cork coast.  The Minister said, as reported in the Official Report, volume 327, column 1838:</P>
    <P>I am doing everything possible to bring it about.  I have high hopes we will get that limited opening for October 1981 at least.</P>
    <P>That was a small move in the right direction. I pleaded for the Celtic Sea to be opened for the full herring season in 1981 <Col N="3525" /> for those driftnet fishermen.  It is well established that they would not materially affect stocks of herring by being active in this period.  Income would be provided for a hard pressed sector of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The EEC Commission should favourably meet this request.  The Minister can press for the opening of the Celtic Sea, although it may not be in his hands in three weeks` time.  Those people are hard pressed, especially in relation to repayments. It is crucial now that the Minister takes every possible step to ensure that those small driftnet fishermen are allowed to fish for herring for all the herring season.  He will be negligent in his duties as Minister for Fisheries if he does not take every possible step to ensure that those driftnet fishermen, who operate with boats up to 50 feet long, have a livelihood next winter.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the press statement of 3 April 1981 of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, who have approached the Taoiseach for special aid for fishing.  Their statement is a reflection of the state of the fishing industry and shows that a serious arrears position has arisen between fishermen and BIM.  It appears that the repayment of arrears owing to BIM rose from £1.065 million in September 1980 to £1.2 million in December 1980 and that the April figure was in the region of £1.5 million.  This indicates the serious financial plight of our fishery industry and the fishermen who are so deeply involved in investments and who depend on fishing for their livelihood.</P>

The representatives of the association pointed out that in certain areas arm bands were not worn to the same extent as in other areas.  They offered their co-operation, starting next year, in the campaign to make people more aware of the need to wear arm bands.  Their co-operation is very much appreciated.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Council did not include these works in a list of schemes which they recently submitted to me, to absorb a special grant of £300,000 which I allocated for junction improvements, signalisation, car parks, etc.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to the council to utilise their own resources for additional works, supplemented by the general block grant amounting to £727,000 which I notified to them for this year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern of local residents about emissions from this factory.  I understand that planning permission was granted on 3 November 1980 by An Bord Pleanála in respect of this factory subject to certain conditions. It is for the Dublin County Council to take appropriate action to ensure compliance with such conditions.  I understand that the council have not been satisfied that all the conditions imposed by An Bord Pleanála have been complied with and they are at present actively pursuing this aspect of the matter with the company concerned.</P>

As a result, the planning authority issued a latest day notice under section 31 of the 1963 Planning Act.

      <P>The taking in charge of housing estates is a matter for the local authority and I have no function in the matter.

Outstanding works in relation to the construction of a link road and the completion of open space and other ancillary services remain to be carried out.</P>
      <P>I understand that legal action relating to the completion of the estate is being taken by the council.  With regard to the construction of a link road I understand that the council have also taken legal proceedings which are currently on appeal to the Supreme Court from a High Court decision refusing an order to the council under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, providing for the carrying out of the development in accordance with the permission.</P>

He should have taken some steps during the years to have this estate taken in charge.  Can he not make money available to Dublin County Council to put the estate in some kind of reasonable order?

      <P>It is primarily the responsibility of the waste producer to see that the waste is disposed of by acceptable means.  Local authorities have been urged to do all they can to ensure that waste disposed of in their areas is disposed of without causing environmental harm or nuisance.</P>
      <P>I understand that planning permission has been granted by An Bord Pleanála for the use of a quarry in County Tipperary for the disposal of waste arising from the company's industrial processes.  The permission was granted subject to stringent conditions including the condition that the use should cease after 12 months from 23 February 1981 unless before that time permission was obtained to continue. The permission granted by An Bord Pleanála followed the appeal of a third party against a decision by Tipperary South Riding County Council to grant permission, also subject to stringent conditions for the proposal.</P>
      <P>Other conditions relate to controls on the discharge of waste on the site, and to the management of the site, including the control of leachate, provision of protective fencing and monitoring of the effects of the operation.  The permission provides for the disposal to cease in the event of the adjoining river being affected prejudicially, and for any serious odour conditions affecting the area to be remedied. The use of the site in line with the conditions laid down has been determined in accordance with due process and following consideration of the objections.  I am not in a position to give any assurance about an alternative disposal site.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that men who were laid off by Cavan County Council towards the end of last year have not yet been re-employed because of the shortage of funds; and if he will take steps to remedy this position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a number of casual road workers who were laid off by Cavan County Council in October of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions on the employment of road workers are made by individual local authorities having regard to all relevant circumstances.  I have notified substantially increased road grants to Cavan County Council this year and it is a matter <Col N="3542" /> for the council to determine the extent to which these grants should be supplemented from other resources at their disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the amount made available to Cavan County Council and to other local authorities is not sufficient to enable them to carry out the work already arranged and to employ the staff necessary? Is he also aware that those he refers to as casual staff are people who have been employed continuously by Cavan County Council for a number of years and were in the main pensionable servants? Will he have another look at the matter and see if something can be done to re-employ these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the council, the funds having been made available to them.  Looking at the amounts made available I cannot see why Cavan should be so adversely affected.  I shall give the Deputy the totals: in 1976, Cavan County Council got a total of £436,000; in 1977, £564,000; in 1978, £848,000; in 1979, £960,000; in 1980, £1,115,000; 1981, £1,401,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that road materials alone have been increased by over 35 per cent between 1980 and 1981?  Is he not aware that local authorities had to pay VAT for the first time in 1981 on road materials and machinery output?  Is he not also aware that about 80 per cent of the money allocated to local authorities this year had to be spent on increased costs of material and staff wages and how does he expect any county council to re-employ men laid off through shortage of money last year in those circumstances?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in fees is part of it and the other part is that there is now no waiting list for driving tests beyond five or six weeks.  Previously we had a longer waiting list.  Also, in 1980 some of the receipts went by way of refund to people who were not able to have their tests and had paid their money in 1979.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a waiting list it is because the driver testers are working to full capacity and if that is so the maximum possible income is being derived. If there is no waiting list it would seem to imply that the driver testers are not working to full capacity and that would appear to indicate a falling-off in income rather than an increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Central Kerry Regional Water Scheme which is based on Lough Guitane.  Kerry County Council submitted preliminary proposals for the Central Kerry Regional Water Supply Scheme on 20 April 1979.  The proposed scheme comprised six separate contracts.  The Department conveyed approval to the proposals to the council on 25 June 1979 and requested submission of contract documents for contracts Nos. 1-5 of the proposed scheme.</P>
      <P>I approved the seeking of tenders for contract No. 1 on 23 March 1981.  The question of loan finance will not arise until the recommended tenders are submitted to my Department and approved by me.  Contract documents for Contract No. 3 were received by my Department on 19 February 1981 and are under examination. I have also approved contract documents, a tender and a loan of £100,000 for contract 6A, Tralee Ring Main, which is urgently required to serve, <i>inter alia</i>, the new County Hospital in Tralee.  The submission of contract documents for contracts 2, 4 and 5 is awaited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the serious position in relation to Midleton, County Cork, he will now sanction the new sewerage scheme there and arrange for the provision of a treatment plant if it should be required subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in proceeding with the scheme as planned has been the decision of Cork County Council not to proceed with it unless it incorporates a treatment plant, which would greatly increase the cost and impose a very heavy financial burden on <Col N="3553" /> Midleton UDC.  In a letter of 1 May 1981 from Cork County Council the suggestion has been made that it may be possible to resolve the impasse by an arrangement whereby the scheme as planned would proceed on an undertaking being given that its operation would be monitored and that if the effluent came to exceed an accepted level, a treatment plant would be provided.</P>
      <P>This is being examined, but I must await the advice of other Departments. The Department of Fisheries and Forestry have been asked for their views as to any likely adverse effect of the proposed scheme and the Department of Health is being consulted about the possible effects of the proposed scheme on the quality of oysters taken from the local oyster beds.  There is also an application to the Department of Transport for a foreshore licence for the proposed discharge of sewage at Rathcoursey Point.</P>

      <Col N="3563" /> The Deputy has asked for the various borough areas and county areas.  We have not got that information.  We have the information in regard to County Louth. But to get the information the Deputy is looking for would delay the housing grants and hold up inspections and payments and it would not be advisable to do that.</P>

I would be grateful if the Minister would give me the total for the county under the headings. The Minister could sent it to me at his convenience as he will have plenty of time during the next few weeks.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £20,194,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31 December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the adjournment I was appealing to the Minister on behalf of drift net fishermen who operate small skiffs in the Celtic Sea.  I appeal again to the Minister to ensure that the Celtic Sea will be open to these fishermen, about 500 in all, who operate drift nets and depend for a livelihood at a particular time of the year on such fishing.  For some years past this livelihood has been denied them.  If they are allowed to fish in the Celtic Sea I am quite satisfied there would be no danger to herring stocks because of the low productivity, if you like, of these small skiffs.  We discussed this at some length on 18 March last and the Minister is aware of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of the fuel subsidy given to fishermen in other EEC countries, particularly France?  I would be grateful if, when he comes to reply, he would give the House details of these fuel subsidies.  Would he also tell us if he is prepared to match these subsidies, because at the moment our fishermen are at a considerable disadvantage fishing against these other countries?  This is a serious matter.  The Government made a minimal attempt to subsidise fishermen <Col N="3580" /> recently but the subsidy is of little or no benefit.  The Fine Gael spokesman on fisheries pointed out quite clearly the magnitude of the difference between the price paid for fuel by our fishermen and that paid by fishermen in the other EEC countries.  The House is entitled to a full explanation on subsidies from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the disastrous drop in the prices being paid to fishermen for their catches.  These were described in detail in the submission of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation to the Taoiseach when seeking temporary financial support for the fleet.  The arrears due by fishermen to Bord Iascaigh Mhara have increased from £1 million in September 1980 to £1.5 million this year. That is a considerable jump.  It is caused by two factors.  One is the extreme and continuing weakness in the prices available plus the excessive increase in operation costs with particular emphasis on fuel.  I trust an explanation will be forthcoming from the Minister when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The continuing weakness in prices is very serious and very damaging to the fishermen.  They have a valid case and in the circumstances prevailing there should be no repossession of trawlers until each case is considered on its merits and every step has been taken to ensure that the fisherman concerned has no possible chance of repaying the loan.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara have a special responsibility to ensure that repossession of trawlers will be avoided if at all possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to fishery protection, I would appeal for one protection vessel to be sited in Dunmore East.  This is one of our main fishery ports.  There is no vessel sited there at the moment and I believe there is great justification for the stationing of a fishery protection vessel there all the year round to ensure our fisheries are properly protected.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the failure to establish in University College, Galway, a fishery science course.  This should be a vital part of overall fisheries policy.  The research automatically attaching to such a course should be established in one of our universities because fishing has a tremendous <Col N="3581" /> long-term potential for the economy.  It is absolutely astonishing that there is as yet no fisheries science course available in any of our universities.  Such a course has been sanctioned by the higher Education Authority for University College, Galway, but unfortunately the finance necessary for its establishment has not been forthcoming.  The lack of such a course is an appalling gap.  A degree level course should be established and I believe University College, Galway, has agreed to the establishment of such a course.  I am aware of the research already done by that college into this industry.  There is need for the establishment of research facilities.  I would, of course, expect the Department to work hand in glove with University College, Galway, on such a course.  The Government have been lacking in their commitment to finance the course, something that is most unfortunate and certainly is to the detriment of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the abandonment by the Fianna Fáil Government of Munster Chipboard Limited, extremely disappointed with the commitment of the present Government to our fishing fleet and I plead with the Minister to open the Celtic Sea to driftnet fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am availing of this opportunity, probably the last I shall have, to refer to a motion on yesterday's Order Paper in my name reading as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the announcement by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry of the proposed amendment of the Foyle Fishery Act, 1952, to reduce the salmon netting season by one week, to prohibit the use of driftnets in the open sea during daylight and to extend the weekly close time for commercial salmon fishing from 60 hours to 72 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had that motion put down as a result of a meeting of fishermen operating in Lough Foyle, I should say the driftnet fishermen operating in Lough Foyle and Greencastle and the driftnet fishermen operating in the River Foyle from Carrigans <Col N="3582" /> to Porthaul.  While other Deputies in the House may take a very broad view of the fishing industry throughout the length and breadth of the State around the coastline from Carlingford Lough to Lough Swilly, I propose to confine my remarks to the fishermen in the constituency of North East Donegal, namely, those who operate Lough Foyle, the River Foyle and the sea between the two demarcation lines that determine the Foyle Fisheries Commission catchment area.  I am not satisfied that the present Foyle Fisheries Commission have succeeded. In fact their track record shows that they have clearly failed.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fishery industry is one which goes back many years, right to the very plantation of Ulster when Anglo-Irish people recognised the wealth of salmon in Lough Foyle and set up an organisation to deal with it.  It has had a stormy passage over the years and I do not propose to go into its history.  Certain difficulties arose when this State was established in 1922, difficulties which were resolved only in 1952 with the setting up of the Foyle Fisheries Commission. The Foyle Fisheries Commission were given full responsibility by this Parliament and by the British authorities to operate and develop the salmon fishing of Lough Foyle and their catchment area. Since they took over, the fishing season and indeed the fishing week have been shortened.  In the time I have been a Member of this House, I have read with monotonous regularity statements issued by the Foyle Fisheries Commission, by the Department of Fisheries here in Dublin and by their counterparts in Belfast explaining in great detail, in carefully chosen words, the need to conserve fish, to conserve salmon.  Therefore it was regrettable that they had to curtail the fishing season or the fishing week.</P>
    <P>If the salmon fishing has failed in Lough Foyle there is nobody to blame but those people responsible for its development. The fishermen who operate from Greencastle, those who operate the Lough and those who operate the River Foyle do so because they want to earn a living and it is in their interests that the industry be developed.  Nobody would be <Col N="3583" /> more pleased to see the industry go from strength to strength than they.  While it is to be acknowledged that there is some abuse as far as poaching is concerned, it is no worse than in other fishing areas.  It is a very lame excuse on the part of the Foyle Fisheries Commission to say that there is far too much illegal fishing in Lough Foyle, the deep sea end of it, the Lough and the River Foyle.  It just does not wear any longer because the fishermen themselves know it is not a fact, that it has not increased or decreased over the years that they have been operating there.  It is no greater or no less a problem than it is in other fishing areas.  But in other fishing areas there is not a crisis situation such as there is in Lough Foyle at present, where the entire fishing industry is threatened with collapse.  About that there must be no doubt.  And if it is threatened with collapse, which most of us recognise as a very serious situation at present, the responsibility rests clearly and squarely with those people whose responsibility it is to develop the Foyle and who have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise them unduly.  All I or anybody else has to do is to look at the track record.  In 1952, when they took over the management of the Foyle, it was a thriving industry.  I remember as a very young boy going down the river bank and experiencing the excitement of watching the fishermen pull their nets in and count the salmon they had caught, a most exciting exercise for a young boy.  I remember that clearly.  It is not that many years ago, but such things no longer exist.  It is a rare occasion now that one walks along the river bank and sees the salmon nets being pulled in, with the fishermen, as they say, drawing a blank or having one salmon in the net.  This is not the fault of the fishermen who operate the Lough or the river, it must surely be the responsibility of those people whose job it is to promote it.</P>
    <P>I have spoken publicly about this in other places.  I want to put on record &mdash; and perhaps there is no time more appropriate than the present, because rumour has it that this House will be dissolved in about an hour's time with a resultant <Col N="3584" /> general election &mdash; that should there be a change of Government, which I hope there will be, and should I be either a backbench Member supporting that Government or part of it, whatever role I may have to play in it I will be asking for a public investigation into the handling, management and running of Lough Foyle, not because of any bitterness, personal objection or animosity I might have towards any member &mdash; I do not even know the names of the four commissioners at present &mdash; but rather as one coming from an area which prided itself on the fact that they had a thriving salmon fishing industry, which has now collapsed.  I share the concern of those fishermen at the manner in which their fishing industry has been allowed to collapse.</P>
    <P>Because of that deep interest I want to pledge here and now to this House and to the fishermen whose livelihood is at stake that in the event of a change of Government, and even of there not being a change of Government, I will be speaking publicly on their behalf on every occasion that I have the duty to do so.  As I have said, through maybe not fully, in the event of a change of Government I will be asking whatever new Minister takes over fisheries to have a full and thorough investigation into the affairs, running and management of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission are unique in many ways.  They are one of the few organisations in Ireland who straddle the Border.  They are one of the few organisations who were given full autonomy and full responsibility to organise the running of the fishing industry in a specially designated area without interference from this Government or the British authorities.  They were allowed to operate without outside interference. Maybe that was a weakness.  Maybe they did not appreciate fully the autonomy and responsibility which they were given. In fact, the records show that if they did appreciate them they did not put them to full use.  There was no one telling them what to do.  They were allowed to do as they thought best, but they failed.  I am surprised that the Ministers for Fisheries and Forestry, present and former, have <Col N="3585" /> not noted the fact that the salmon catches from deep sea drift netting, from the Lough drift net fishermen and the draft net fishermen who operate the rivers have fallen to such an extent that extreme measures should have been taken.</P>
    <P>As I say, the Foyle Fisheries Commission were unique.  They had no interference from outside bodies.  They were given the freedom to do what they thought was best, and whatever judgements they have taken were wrongly taken.  They believed that by reducing the salmon fishing week and the fishing season more fish would get to the spawning beds, therefore creating larger stocks. That is a fair assumption for ordinary individuals who are concerned only about the number of salmon they can catch per week, the livelihood they have to earn, how they are going to repay BIM for extremely large loans on fishing vessels and equipment, how they are going to repay other loans and how they are going to survive.  That is the extent of the interest that most of the fishermen had initially, and while they do have a further interest in hoping or seeing that the industry will develop, it is not their immediate responsibility to do something about it.  Yet now the people whose responsibility it is have failed them and they are entitled to ask what has gone wrong.  They are entitled to say now that this new proposal by the Foyle Fisheries Commission to reduce the fishing season and the fishing week is no more valid than the ones which have failed.  At the outset, without the knowledge and experience and without seeing those proposals in practice and examining the results, it could have been argued by the commissioners, by the Department of Fisheries and by the British authorities that these steps were necessary.  However, these steps have already proved to be failures.</P>
    <P>I have not got the time factor at the tips of my fingers, but when I was a boy the fishing week in Lough Foyle started at 6 o'clock on Monday morning and concluded at 6 o'clock on Saturday morning. There were two days per week which were closed.  The weekend was closed and generally speaking those two days of non-fishing on the River Foyle were <Col N="3586" /> observed by the majority of fishermen. Admittedly, we will always have the poacher, but he was resented in those days because the licensed fishermen were able to earn a living during the licensed hours of fishing.  The fishing season started some time at the end of April and did not conclude until the end of August. Now we have the fishing week cut down to literally hours and the fishing season reduced to a position where it is now impossible for fishermen to earn a living. They have so much time off the river that the hours of non-fishing on the river are open to abuse for those individuals who want to fish outside hours.</P>
    <P>The whole policy of the Foyle Fisheries Commission has failed.  I do not have to say it; the record shows it, and I hope that the Minister when he is replying will refer to this because there is general disquiet among all the fishermen whom I have spoken to, ordinary, sensible men who use the commonsense which God gave them to good ends, men who can arrive at simple and fair conculsions. They know that the fishing on the River Foyle is now in a very dangerous situation and they do not know what happened, they just know that it has happened.  They know also that those people responsible who have been telling them through the years &ldquo;Do it our way and we will ensure that this is one of the richest salmon fisheries in the world&rdquo; were wrong.  When other fisheries have improved it is sad that the Foyle has gone the opposite way, and there is no reason for it.  The game has been played according to the dictates of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  If any public representative spoke out of turn or was too harsh in his criticism of the Foyle Fisheries Commission or their activities, or regarding good public relations on the part of former employees, I would have got a telephone message asking me if I would be available to speak to them.  I gladly did so, and listened to their point of view and proceeded to try to talk to the fishermen to find out if there was a point of compromise.  That game is over.  There are no telephone calls any more.  Even within the ranks of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the employees who work for them know now that the <Col N="3587" /> whole thing has failed, and they do not any more criticise public representatives such as myself for being unduly harsh in my criticism of the affairs of the commission.</P>
    <P>It is getting late in the day and maybe the Minister wants to reply to this debate before the Dáil adjourns at 5 p.m. and probably is dissolved before 6 p.m. Because I will not have an opportunity of moving item No. 88 on the Order Paper I ask the Minister to give a pledge to this House that the terms of my motion will be complied with and that he will not sign the order put forward by the Foyle Fisheries Commission until he has a public investigation into it.  I am not saying that there is anything illegal in what the Foyle Fisheries Commission or those people who work on their staff have-done.  I am not suggesting, nor do I want it to be interpreted that I am suggesting, that there have been any malpractices.  I am saying clearly without apology to anyone that since the Foyle Fisheries Commission took over in 1952 their records show clearly that the number of salmon caught in those days as against the number of salmon now being caught has fallen so drastically in spite of all policy decisions taken by the Foyle Fisheries Commission, in spite of all the promises, all the money spent and all the assurances given.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission are in a serious state.  The livelihood of the fish ermen who operate from Greencastle, the livelihood of the fishermen who operate Lough Foyle and the River Foyle, who need to supplement their annual income with a few hundred pounds from salmon catches, is being destroyed.  They no longer have security in going to the Foyle Fisheries Commission, taking out a licence, buying a boat, and buying the nets to fish the lough, the deep sea or the river.  After making that investment and putting great effort into it so that at the end of the day they would have money in their pockets, they now have nothing.  It is a sad state of affairs that after almost 40 years we arrive at this stage.</P>
    <P>We may have criticised foreign interests <Col N="3588" /> being involved in Irish affairs but the Irish society, which first set up fishing in Lough Foyle provided a livelihood for fishermen in that area.  Those people were always accused of taking too much money away and abusing their rights in relation to the Foyle but the amazing thing is that under the Irish society fishing was never threatened.  The men who worked there were sure of their employment and of pay at the end of the week. The number of salmon caught was stable. I was glad to see the end of this Irish society and to see the Foyle Fisheries Commission set up.  However, the catches under the Irish society were never as low as they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to pay particular attention to the motion which I have on the Order Paper, to read it carefully and to realise that it reflects the attitude of the fishermen who earn a living on Lough Foyle, the river Foyle and the deep sea out of Lough Foyle.  As the Minister should represent their interests I want him to assure the House that he will not sign the order put forward by the commission until he is absolutely certain that the policies they are pursuing are in the best interests of all concerned.  I doubt those policies are in the best interests of all the people concerned because this is a repetition of what they did last year, the previous year, ten years ago and even 20 years ago.  The only answer the Foyle Fisheries Commission can come up with is a shorter fishing week, a shorter fishing season.  That approach has not worked and will not be the answer.</P>
    <P>There will have to be greater dialogue between the fishermen and the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  The relationship between the fishermen and the commission has broken down so much that the fishermen now treat the commission with contempt.  That is not in the best interests of the commission, the industry or the fishermen.  I acknowledge that somebody has to be in charge.  The person in charge can only pursue a successful policy if he has the full consent and the good wishes of the fishermen who operate the system. I want an assurance from the Minister while the Government are waiting on a new Government to be elected, that he <Col N="3589" /> will not abuse the powers he has at the moment and sign the order which the Foyle Fisheries Commission have asked him to sign.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain to the House why there is such a delay in the development of Greencastle Harbour?  This was one of the areas identified by the cross-Border study initiated by Deputy Garret FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs during the National Coalition period of office.  The former manager in County Donegal, Mr. John B. Williams, and his counterpart in Derry city, deserve a lot more credit than was given to them.  They worked very hard to try to get people on both sides of the Border to agree to terms of reference which would make it possible for a cross-Border study to take place without suspicion in some quarters north of the Border.</P>
    <P>They came up with certain proposals. Greencastle pier was one of the areas identified as being worthy of EEC support. I was told that Brussels would pay 50 per cent of the cost and that the Irish and British Governments would each pay 25 per cent of the cost.  There has been a great delay in the development of Greencastle. We occasionally hear that a Fianna Fáil Deputy in the county has been advised by the Minister for Fisheries that a certain stage has been reached or a local Fianna Fáil councillor may be told the same thing.  There is no evidence of any development which has taken place at Greencastle which would not have taken place if the cross-Border study was not undertaken.  This was the first thing involving the Irish Government and the British Government in the regional fund. It should have been supported by both Governments but it was allowed to go by default.  There was a lot of speculation about it.  The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is now Commissioner in Europe, welcomed it with open arms when he took over from Deputy Garret FitzGerald in 1977.  He announced that £40 million was to be spent there although I understood that £50 million was to be spent.  It took about three months to establish that the figure was £40 million.  Where is this money which was to be spent on cross-Border communications? <Col N="3590" /> I do not see any evidence of it in the Donegal region.  If it is being spent it must be north of the Border.</P>
    <P>I do not see any extraordinary achievement at Greencastle as a result of that study.  The honest conclusion I have come to is that the study told us on paper things we already knew.  It brought together comprehensively in three volumes details that had to be attended to in that area. That is all it gave.  There has been no support from the British Government for the development of Greencastle and the EEC seem to have lost interest.</P>
    <P>When we come back to this House I will ask the new Government to fully support the proposals made in the cross-Border study for the development of Greencastle.  This is one fishing port which has been developed in a major way in the 20 years I have been in public life. It services mostly Donegal people, but it is there to service people from County Derry, too.  This ties in with the idea of a united island.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission are responsible to the people on both sides of the Border.  This Government have given less attention to the Derry fishermen than they have to the fishermen of County Donegal.  Not very long ago the present Minister went unannounced to a Fianna Fáil Party function in that area. He did not even tell the Foyle Fisheries Commission he was going.  He passed on the Donegal bank of the river while the commission's offices are on the Derry side.  While this might have been a blank spot on his part, I do not think that a Minister who is concentrating on his work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the Minister's private business.  I am talking about the Minister for Fisheries, who has a duty and a responsibility to the fishermen of County Donegal.  The unique relationship the Foyle Fisheries Commission fishermen have with the present Government, and across the Border, deserves more attention from a Minister for Fisheries, even if it is a private visit. He should have paid them the courtesy of calling to the offices or arranging to speak with the fishermen.</P>
      <P>If I had done that, I would have been severely criticised.  The Minister can take it that he was criticised by members of his own party who were wondering which he considered more important, going to a Fianna Fáil Party function or meeting the fishermen whose livelihood was at stake. The fact that the Minister did not get in touch with the commission may have been an oversight.  If it was, I forgive him. But, once it had been brought to his attention, he should have been more courteous to the Opposition Deputy who brought it to his attention.  Of course, I criticised him because the role of an Opposition Deputy is not to praise but to criticise when necessary, and that criticism should be accepted as such.  I acknowledge that the Minister went back at a later date, but it must be taken into consideration that he had other interests there at that time.  But that is all water under the bridge, or should I say water down the Lough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the few remaining weeks Deputy Power has as Minister for Fisheries I wish him God speed and good luck in the work he has tried to do.  My criticism of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and of the lack of interest shown by the Department in not arriving at a conclusion earlier, and recognising that the policies of the commission had failed, were offered in the interests of the fishermen whose livelihood was at stake and not out of any animosity I have towards the present occupant of the Government benches.  I offered my criticism because I believed it <Col N="3592" /> was in the best interests of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>In the last few days the Minister has to exercise these powers I want him to assure me, the House and the fishermen that he will not sign the order put forward by the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  I have already given the reasons.  Instead he should ask that the position be reexamined, not because of a witch hunt on my part or on his part, but to ensure that the policies to be pursued will deliver the goods, because clearly the present policies have not done so.</P>
    <P>Why is the money promised for the development of Greencastle Harbour not being spent at the rate we expected? Would the Minister acknowledge publicly that the work being carried out at Greencastle is going no faster or slower than it would have gone if there had not been a cross-Border study?  No matter what the result of the election, I hope we will see the Minister's face back in the House, preferably as an ordinary Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>One must bear in mind, first of all, the shocking state of the Irish fishing industry.  Never in the history of the State were there so many anxious depressed fishermen, their wives and families throughout the country.  There are many reasons for this but the main one is and apparently will always be that foreign trawlers with the most sophisticated equipment can fish to within 12 miles of our coast.</P>
      <P>Ask any fisherman in Killybegs, Howth, Skerries, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dungarvan, Youghal or elsewhere, in any harbour outside Galway, and they will tell you in aon guth that the fish are not there, that they are caught before they come in.  From his recent tour of the fishing ports I am sure the Minister is aware that the overheads are so high that nearly all fishermen have sleepless nights. Is it any wonder that the fishermen's organisations recently said that 75 per cent of trawler owners are in arrears with their repayments?  Never before did such a Doomsday situation exist for fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it be a Fianna Fáil or some other Government, I hope the powers <Col N="3593" /> that be will ensure that the bailiffs will be kept away from their door, that their trawlers will not be repossessed.  In my home port I saw six trawlers going out the harbour mouth being repossessed when Deputy Blaney was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Why are fishermen in arrears?  One of the main reasons is the price of diesel. The Minister brought a proposal to the Cabinet to ease the price of diesel for fishermen and he succeeded in getting 2p a gallon off.  However, the price of diesel has escalated since and it is well known that the Prices Commission are now sitting on another application for a substantial increase.  Of course they will sit on it until after the election.</P>
    <P>In whatever type of manifesto or programme the Minister has to announce I hope he will include a positive plan to relieve the anxieties of the fishing industry. For the life of me I cannot understand why fishermen are being held up to ransom, being made the pawns of the Government's bargaining in Brussels.  Everybody knows what happened when Deputy Lenihan abandoned our 50-mile limit in 1977.  Now the bargaining is going on again simply because the fishermen have not the political muscle to do anything about it.  Many of them live in inlets, small villages and towns scattered throughout Ireland, many of them part-time farmers.  The Minister does not seem to worry about them.  He is from the rich plains of Kildare and he does not have to live with them.  When you made your tour of the fishing ports you met only the selected few instead of meeting and talking to all fishermen in these ports.  They would not have eaten you.  They might have been cranky at the beginning but they have patience, and although you do not know it, you have many friends among them.  If you had met all the fishermen you would have a more open mind.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I hope he will head the poll in County Wexford and do remarkably well.  There is nothing personal in this and I hope the remarks I make would not be taken in that way. Before I was rudely interrupted by the Chair I was about to make the point that there are many omissions from the Minister's Estimate speech.  I cannot understand why he did not mention the insurance of trawlers.  Is this a sacred cow that the Department are afraid to touch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister hear me out.  Even if I am getting close to the bone, the Minister cannot feel guilty about it because the system was there before he became Minister for Fisheries. He need not be so sensitive on this issue. Before I was so rudely interrupted by the Minister I was about to mention the appalling closed shop that exists in insurance as regards trawlers.  Why have the Department not some control over this weird, archaic system?  Whom are they protecting?  Whom are the personnel involved in this massive rake-off from <Col N="3595" /> Irish fishermen in this insurance racket? It is a scandal and a disgrace and it is time this was said.  If some enterprising person were listening who would do research on where all this insurance money has gone, rosy cheeks would grow pale.  Again, we probably would be told that it was not a matter for the Minister.  But it is his business. There is a massive rake-off whether it is for a punt, a small trawler, a launch or a big trawler.  It is time some action was taken by the Department to control this massive exploitation of the poor, unfortunate fishermen who have to pay so much for diesel oil and maintenance of their trawlers and then have insurance in addition.  Will the Minister tell me the name of the company and if it has any association, directly or indirectly, in the past or in the present, with BIM?</P>
      <P>When you speak about insurance, about the sale of boat yards about marketing of fish, about arrears of payments and about prices there must be one culprit that stands condemned in the eyes of the fishermen and it is BIM.  They have failed dismally.  They have no respect for the fishermen, these men who inhabit Hume House.  The fishermen you see riding up through the sound of the Blasket Islands watching a south westerly breeze do not bother them.  They have a centrally heated office in Dublin.  They can write a note to some third party in the country and tell him he can put more insurance on a particular man and he has to pay it.  That is a disgrace.  The situation must be faced and the sooner the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how the FEOGA grants, the golden handshakes from Brussels, are allocated.  Some people get the grant while another person in the same category, making the same application and the same in every way, is refused.  Why is this system allowed to prevail?  Surely if Dick can get the FEOGA grant Harry should get it if he complies with all the rules and does the very same thing?  Is it a mockery?  What is going on in relation to the allocation of these grants?  This is a matter of deep concern.  It is wrong that one man can get the grant while the man next door is refused.  That system should not be tolerated. <Col N="3596" /> The Minister should try to have it amended as soon as possible if it is within his competence.  Perhaps he would let me know when replying whether or not he has control of it.  I should like to get rid of the confusion that exists regarding the allocation of those grants.</P>
    <P>Neither can I understand why if a man gets a Gaeltacht grant for a trawler BIM should tell him straightaway that he has to put up a greater deposit than if he did not get that grant.  Yet I know people who used political muscle and were in that situation who did not have to pay the percentage.  This also is wrong.  The same system should apply to everybody.  Perhaps there are technical difficulties that I know nothing about and, if so, they should be corrected as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>No wonder the fishermen are really depressed.  You can buy a black sole in Dingle for £1.50; the same black sole in any restaurant in Dublin, an average size fish, will cost £6.50 or £6.70.  There must be a massive rake-off by the middle men in this area.  This is where BIM stand indicated in the eyes of the country because they have made no effort to get back into the marketing of fish.  What is the point in having BIM if they will not be involved in every aspect of the fishing industry, boat building, marketing and allocation of trawlers.  They should be involved in all those things.  Public relations exercises such as fish cookery demonstractions are all right in their own way but the people running the fish cookery demonstrations would be much better employed in trying to get markets for Irish fishermen.  Several inland towns that I know do not see fresh fish from one end of the week to the other.  Why is that so? One would think BIM would make some effort to develop the marketing of fish.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that fish is caught in this country, mackerel or whiting, and when it is landed, whether in Dingle, Castletownbere or Dunmore East, it does not reach a certain price.  The official of the Department of Agriculture comes along, doing the job he has to do, and sprays the fish with red dye.  It is taken out and sent either to a fishmeal factory or dumped in the middle of the bay while people in the country are hungry.  That is a crazy situation. <Col N="3597" /> Is there any agency that could come in here?  Surely some charitable organisation such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been long enough on the road &mdash; I have met him at race meetings and many other places &mdash; and I have found him to be a good man to take the crack but it is this pertinent point that he is reacting to.  He should not react in that way.  He should accept it in the spirit it is given.  The Minister is big enough in every sense of the word to take it.  His officials should set up some type of an agency to distribute the fish before it is sprayed with the red dye to those who need it.  There are many who need fish at present because of the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not need free fish but many would gratefully accept it.  I hope that Brussels, or the Minister, will devise a scheme to make available this fish to those who need it throughout the country.  When the Irish fishermen made their dignified and restrained protests, whether it was outside Leinster House or Government Buildings, by handing out fish in plastic bags there were plenty to take it, including senior civil servants. They all like fish.  I appeal to the Minister to make some tentative arrangement to ensure that we never again have the crazy <Col N="3598" /> situation of the dumping of fish for fish processing, or for food factories or for dumping out in the middle of the sea if there are people who will accept it.</P>
    <P>I could speak for hours on this Estimate but my colleague, Deputy Boland, has something pertinent to say about Skerries and I would not like to deny him the opportunity.</P>

      <P>The sale of the boatyards was a disgrace.  They should have been offered to the men who were working in them first.  They should have been given a chance to form a co-op.  The Minister was less than fair to himself in deciding not to divulge the names of those who bought them.  The people of the country were entitled to that information.  I have no hesitation in saying that if we are returned to government we will name those who purchased the boatyards.  That is the way it should be because taxpayers' money is involved.  I can recall that Deputy O'Malley, as spokesman on Industry and Commerce, made great play about a mine that was purchased and threatened that if the Government did not disclose everything he would do so.  He disclosed what was paid for it and I do not see any reason why the Minister cannot do the same.  The Minister said the boatyards were white elephants but I do not agree because they were providing a service for the local fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>When a boat is damaged now it costs a lot of money to repair it. That was not the way when BIM had control of the boatyards.  If the Minister checks out on some of the bills he will see I am telling the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the role of the Naval Service as far as fishery protection is concerned.  It is regrettable in the extreme that the Naval Service has fired on an Irish trawler and damaged it.  I put a question on a number of occassions about this and for some reason or another it was always declared out of order.  If the <Col N="3599" /> Naval Service want target practice there are plenty of poachers, whether they be French, Spanish, Dutch or Russian, but for God's sake the Minister should tell the Naval Service to stop firing at the Irish fishermen.  It is not good enough. Lives could be lost.  When the Bill dealing with fisheries was going through the Dáil I made the point that on no account should the Naval Service fire on Irish trawlers and the Minister of the day, Deputy Lenihan, accepted that.  It should be announced loud and clear to the Naval Service that Irish fishermen are not there for target practice.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any control over imports from third countries but if he has he should go to Brussels immediately and quote whatever regulation is relevant to stop the dumping of fish here for processing.  If he did that he would be giving a lift to Irish fishermen.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the honesty he displayed by stating he intended granting more salmon licences for drift netting off County Kerry.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary I introduced many deputations to Deputy Michael Pat Murphy but they were shot down every time, no hope.  At least the Minister has promised them something and I hope he will deliver on those promises.  I cannot see any reason why Kerry with their nine drift net licences should be carrying the can of preservation for the whole country.  I should like to thank the Minister and I hope he is returned.</P>

      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on his negotiating ability in relation to our fishing industry.  I must confess I do not have a great knowledge of that industry but I have a considerable knowledge of the forestry industry.  Deputy Begley was the Parliamentary Secretary in the good old days when the Coalition were last in power.  He confessed to the fact that he was dealing here in this House with a Minister who obviously has greater appreciation of fishery problems than his predecessor, Deputy Murphy, when he was in charge of that Department during the lifetime of the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined in his introduction to the Estimates that we have a tremendous potential for expanding the timber industry because from now on timber harvesting will be a major activity and there will be much greater emphasis on the development of forest roads and on the development of machinery for this purpose.  I welcome particularly the information that came through some time ago in relation to the success of the Minister's Department and the IDA in attracting the Medford Corporation of Oregon to this country for the manufacture of medium density fibreboard. Frankly, the timber industry here had <Col N="3601" /> appeared to be on a downward course arising from closures.  So this is a tremendous injection into the industry.  This factory will be able to use forestry thinnings as a basic raw material in this extremely viable industry.  From that point of view this is one of the greatest achievements that this Department have had under the guidance of the present Minister, together with the negotiations that went on successfully to save the Scarriff industry. This industry, apart from a marketing point of view, does not affect my European constituency, but a certain amount of the employment affects my existing Dáil constituency.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware of the great importance which the Government attaches to the adoption of a universally acceptable convention on the law of the sea.  It had been hoped following the substantial progress made at the Ninth Session of the Conference in August 1980 that the tenth session would see final agreement on the few remaining hardcore issues.  I am naturally disappointed that the policy review undertaken by the new US administration, which involves a comprehensive re-assessment of the draft convention, meant that this was not possible.</P>
      <P>High level representations in both Washington and Dublin have made clear to the US authorities our concern with the delay and in particular with the threat such a delay could pose for the prospects of overall agreement.  I am hopeful that the US policy review will be speedily completed and that negotiations on the existing draft can be finalised without re-opening fundamental issues on which compromise has been reached after years of exhaustive and difficult negotiations during which concessions were made by all interested parties.</P>

      <P>As the price of soft drinks at the retail level is not controlled and as soft drinks are available at different prices through a wide variety of different outlets, it is not possible to give the Deputy details of increases in retail prices during the period mentioned.</P>
