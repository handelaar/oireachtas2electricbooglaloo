      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate each subhead of each Vote for which he is responsible which is to be increased in the 1981 Estimates by less than 16 per cent and/or the officially expected rate of inflation in 1981; and how economies, if any, are to be made in respect of each such subhead so as to keep within the provision in the subhead.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed information sought by the Deputy can more appropriately be raised when the Estimates for my Department and for An Chomhairle Ealaíon come before the Dáil.  In the meantime I wish to state that the allocations shown in the Book of Estimates conform with the overall allocations decided by the Government and the necessary steps are <Col N="734" /> being taken to ensure that they will not be exceeded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he proposes to meet any of the requests for additional financial assistance for private secondary schools made by the CSPA and the National Federation of Christian Brothers' Parents' Councils.</P>

    <Col N="735" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided to increase the grant <i>in lieu</i> of tuition fees from £70 to £77 with effect from the commencement of the school year 1981-82.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House why a sum to provide for this increase does not appear in the current Book of Estimates?  Will the Minister be introducing a Supplementary Estimate to meet the additional charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the amount of money provided in the Book of Estimates will cover adequately the increase in the grant <i>in lieu</i> of tuition fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that his proposed increase to £77 falls far short of the £92.10p which the schools in question are looking for?  Is this his final answer to their request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that all the demands on the Department of Education are greater than the amounts given and this is a common factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that their demand was unreasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I am adequately catering for the schools in the increase in the grant <i>in lieu</i> of tuition fees and that it has been my pleasure to increase that substantially.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the demand from the secondary school sector was 33? per cent and he is only granting them an increase of 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that over the years I have made substantial increases in the grant <i>in lieu</i> of tuition fees.  The <Col N="736" /> £7 increase will operate from the beginning of the 1981-82 school year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant has been increased by 54 per cent by me in that period, a substantial increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the estimated cost of the proposals in the White Paper on Education and the cost of those proposals which will be implemented in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals in the White Paper range over a wide area of educational activity and the cost of implementation of the proposals in it cannot be segregated from the cost of various other developments.  No realistic estimates as envisaged in the question could accordingly be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not extraordinary that the Department can put a price on everything except the cost of the proposals in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  In fact, to take the long distance programme, for example, there are so many variables that it would be impossible to quantify it until the scheme is under way.  There is a matter of purchasing materials, for example, from television companies.  There is also a matter of making new programmes through RTE and the involvement of the adult education officer, the National Council for Educational Awards and the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin.  As far as the engineering and science courses are concerned, and the reduction in the requirement of honours for the award of grants in that sphere, the Deputy will agree that until the results of the 1981 leaving certificate examinations <Col N="737" /> are available there is no way we could quantify the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not customary in a White Paper to take one year as a base year, use the available information in respect of the cost of personnel and materials and extrapolate from the base year forward?  The Minister should have within the Department sufficient personnel to carry out a cost analysis and prepare a time table for the White Paper, something he has failed miserably to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that it is very easy indeed to estimate on the basis of figures given, for example, in the White Paper what the additional teaching force will cost.  It will be very easy indeed for any Deputy to make out what the capital cost of the provision of schools and so forth is.  I do not think that the White Paper falls down in any way in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>To bring us back to the long term and the short term, has the Minister any idea of the cost&mdash;apart from the cost of necessary increases of pupil enrolments&mdash; of the White Paper proposals which he intends to implement in this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned two of the innovations, the long distance study one and the cost of the change in the conditions for awarding grants in the third level sector.  The Deputy must agree with the logic of my statement that until we know the number of people applying in the science and engineering faculties in the third level institutions it is very easy to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to answer a question without being interrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is attempting to avoid answering the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering it quite straight up.  It is difficult to know until we <Col N="738" /> know how many applications are in under the new conditions for the award of third level grants.  The Deputy will know also as far as the distance study is concerned that there are too many variables to be able to assess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister if I heard him correctly to say that there are substantial parts of the White Paper that he would not know the cost of until he started to implement them.  If that is so how could one possibly make reasonable policy decisions if one does not know the cost of one's decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy thinks that costing it is the most important part rather than the provision of the service, be it so.  We put the White Paper together on the basis of what was desirable for the Irish education scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be reasonable to assume that the Minister has given up all hope of meeting during his term of office the manifesto commitment of eradicating classes of over 40?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not given up hope and I call on the House to witness the advance that has been made.  When <Col N="739" /> I took office there were 3,620 classes of 40 or over.  There are now 980 such classes.  I call the attention of the House to the fact that there are almost 40,000 pupils in classes of 30 or under, some of them with a pupil-teacher ratio of 15 to one.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is familiar with the recommendations and we gather from them that it would not be possible for me or any other Minister to direct that any one of the recommendations should be put into effect immediately.  Rather were the recommendations a combination of exhortations and logical statements on the position of young people in sport.  Arising from that I have had consultations with community games organisations, mini-sport organisations and all bodies so involved, asking them to take note of the contents of the report, copies of which I have sent to them.  I know that the Deputy will accept that as being as much as we can do in the circumstances.</P>

The facilities at the regional laboratory in Sligo, which is already handling a certain amount of 30-day pre-movement testing, are being extended to provide an expanded service for north western counties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose taking Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The ewe premium was designed to compensate producers for losses of income that would arise if as then expected market prices for lamb fell in a number of member states following the introduction in October last of the Community's sheepmeat regime.  In fact market prices generally throughout the Community have been very buoyant since October and as a result a ewe premium in respect of the current marketing year will fall to be paid only in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  However, because of the good market prices that have been obtaining for lamb the premium to be paid here will not now be as high as was originally estimated.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to say what the precise amount will be but I hope to be able to announce it soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at every church gate in Donegal the Minister and his colleagues promised £7 per ewe?  What has happened to that subsidy promised to the Donegal farmers? Did the Minister not know the small print that was in that agreement when speaking outside church gates in Donegal? Why not tell the people the truth? Why mislead the farmers as the Minister did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions we made the position quite clear <Col N="746" /> about the premium.  In fact at the time when we chose that option we were being accused from many sources, particularly the Opposition, about what would happen the sheepmeat industry, that there would be no floor price.  The reverse has happened and I am sure many producers are quite happy with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he and all his colleagues promised £7 per ewe to the electors of Donegal. Why did you fool them at that time and why did you not tell them the truth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was on the basis of the estimated drop in sheepmeat prices at the time when the Common Organisation came into effect.  Thankfully the sheepmeat prices have increased beyond all our expectations and therefore the £7 premium on an annual basis will be reduced somewhat.  As I said in the reply I am not in a position to state what the amount will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the fluctuations in the sheepmeat market would the Minister not agree that while at the moment the price of carcase sheepmeat may be high by the time the lamb is fattened next June, July, August, September or October the market may again be depressed and that it is difficult for sheep breeders to accept the idea that they are going to get £7, then produce lambs and find at the end that they did not get the £7 and that the market is depressed?  The system is open to many problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the <Col N="747" /> Deputy says.  I think that is the important point.  The marketing year as such is only half a marketing year this year, from October until April.  One can only get the discussion going about the £7 premium or what size the premium would be on an annualised basis when we see the progress of a full marketing year from October.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture how he expects to effect each of the following expenditure reductions, for which provision is made in the Book of Estimates: (a)  £68,000 for post office services; (b) £18,000 for advertising and publicity; (c) £3,000 for consultancy services; (d)  £1.09 million for agricultural schools and farms; (e)  £64,000 on the £103,000 expenditure in 1980 scholarships and training; (f)  £23,000 on technical assistance; (g)  £415,000 on sheep headage grants; (h)  £16,000 on the £50,000 <Col N="750" /> expenditure in 1980 on the beef classification scheme and (i)  £17.3 million on the farm modernisation scheme; and if any of them will result in a reduction of the level of services provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduced provisions for advertising and publicity, agricultural schools and farms and scholarships and training reflect the extent to which responsibility for the services concerned has been transferred to ACOT. The reduced provision for post office services arose as a result of a refund by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of services provided in 1979 and from the elimination of arrears resulting from the 1979 postal strike.  The provision for consultancy services is sufficient to cover the cost of anticipated assignments in 1981.  The technical assistance grants scheme was discontinued as from 11 February 1980 and the reduced provision is in respect of residual payments.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the Common Organisation of the Market for Sheepmeat it is no longer permissible to grant national aids in the sheep sector.  The provision for 1981 is intended to cover commitments made prior to the introduction of the Common Organisation of the Market for sheepmeat.</P>
      <P>The reduced provision for the beef classification scheme does not entail any reduction in the services; the higher provision in 1980 was required for the purchase of equipment.</P>
      <P>Because of a variety of factors expenditure under the farm modernisation scheme reached an unprecedented level in 1980 and necessitated an increased provision of £23 million by way of Supplementary Estimate. It is considered that the current provision will be sufficient to meet applications under the scheme in 1981.</P>

      <P>While trade in eggs between member states cannot be restricted, I have been concerned about certain aspects of the increasing imports from Northern Ireland and have been following these up at Community level.</P>
      <P>At the Council meeting in July last I sought and received an undertaking from the EEC Commission to examine measures needed to improve the Community egg market.  In the meantime, the Commission has had discussions with the trade interests involved about possible ways to improve the market.  In addition, I asked that the feed price allowance to Northern Ireland egg and poultry producers be discontinued. This was done at the time.</P>

      <P>Yes, I accept that the situation about low cost selling is something which we have asked the Commission <Col N="757" /> to treat as very serious.  The egg market generally in the Community has been a difficult one.  The increased imports from the Netherlands and France to the UK market has, if you like, kept the North of Ireland eggs off the British market and they are coming down into our market.  This is a difficult situation but one which I hope that we can, in the community context, resolve in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary steps towards the reorganisation of the milk recording service have already been taken in that the pilot schemes in the Bandon and Cork areas, which proved very successful, are being continued and it is expected that similar developments will be extended this year to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to be able to announce at an early date arrangements for the reorganisation <Col N="760" /> of the service on a national basis, in co-operation with the dairying, co-operative and other interests concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Minister says and am pleased that Cork is doing very well in this area.  Could the Minister give some indication to the House as to the percentage of herds presently involved in milk recording and what positive steps he proposes to take?  It is a matter of extreme urgency to increase the percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are anxious to have the national scheme organised at an early date and every possible effort is being made to ensure that that happens.  My Department have organised and set up a committee in order that a new independent co-operative could be registered to organise this.  As far as the percentage of farmers who are included in the present scheme are concerned, about 205 herds are involved with 11,000 cows in the Bandon area, and 76 herds with 4,500 cows in the Cork district.  Obviously, the success of the scheme and its operation through the rest of the country is important and there will be no delay on the part of the Department, the co-operative interests and the farming interests in getting it going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, am I correct that on a national basis the percentage involved in milk recording is only 3 or 4 per cent? Secondly, may I put it to the Minister that the fees involved, to be charged to the farmers, should be kept as reasonable as possible.  Steps which were taken two years ago by the present Government in doubling the charges should not be a precedent for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The study group set up to examine the possibility of having a milk recording service recommended that the State, co-operative interests and the farming interests would all have a part to play in the scheme.  The Department carries the headquarters service.  The co-operative carries the laboratory and analysis service and the farmers themselves the actual field recording costs. <Col N="761" /> This has been agreed on by all concerned and it is a most acceptable way to organise the scheme.  It would not be in the farming interest at the moment to introduce further negotiations as to how the scheme should be organised.  This has already been agreed and we are anxious to get the scheme going as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that almost all farmers and in particular small farmers are dissatisfied with the lack of action by the Land Commission; and the plans, if any, the Government have to update the Land Commission to enable them to operate more effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is no.  Statistics of Land <Col N="762" /> Commission activities over the past four years show that some 37,000 hectares were acquired for purposes of structural reform, while a total of 46,000 hectares was divided amongst upwards of 6,000 allottees.  The area of lettable land awaiting allotment which stood at 32,000 hectares in 1977 has now been reduced to 24,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the Government's proposals on future land policy which were published in a recent White Paper.  As indicated therein, measures are being taken to update and streamline the administrative structure and procedures of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware that the small farmers rely purely on the Land Commission to buy land and divide it out between them?  Is the Minister aware that in recent years the amount of land purchased by the Land Commission has fallen?  Would he make a statement on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent of the drop in land acquired by the Land Commission in recent years has been totally exaggerated. I do not wish to delay the House now in going into exact details and comparisons. The drop was not significant because the Land Commission were asked to concentrate their activities on reducing the acreage of land previously purchased but not allocated to deserving smallholders.  It is quite clear from their success in recent times that this strategy has succeeded in allocating thousands of acres which had been lying idle or been let by the Land Commission.  It was preferable to try to reduce this acreage substantially. More progress will be made on this in the future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>
        <Col N="763" /> That would be about 25,000 acres.  Is the Minister aware that in recent years a normal year's allocation was 34,000 acres, and therefore the Minister's figure is a serious reduction?  Are the Land Commission doing anything?  They are not taking in any land and apparently their allocation has dropped from 34,000 acres to 25,000 acres.  In view of the Minister's statement that the Land Commission have been concentrating on allocations of land already acquired, would he explain the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a clear statement from the Minister on land acquisition?  Throughout the country people consider that Land Commission acquisition operations have been closed down.  The Minister has said the Land Commission are concentrating on dividing land.  This is utter hogwash.  Is it not the true situation that the Land Commission are not being given money for the acquisition of land, particularly in the last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my earlier reply that in 1977, 34,000 hectares of land were available to the Land Commission for division but not yet divided, but by the end of last year that had been reduced to 24,000 hectares although in the meantime considerable acreages were acquired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why the Land Commission insist on taking land and holding on to it for a number of years?  Number two, is it not true that in the past two years particularly, practically no land was acquired in some of the counties where formerly a lot of land had been acquired &mdash; I am thinking particularly of my constituency?  Number three, is it not also true that the Land Commission <Col N="764" /> appear to be phasing out the purchasing of land for division?  Is it not true that the Minister's predecessor made a statement to that effect two years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government obviously view with alarm a policy which would leave in Land Commission hands large areas of land for too long a period. It is a priority to ensure that delay will be cut to a minimum.  However, there are circumstances in which the possible acquisition of additional land adjoining a holding already acquired might enable the Land Commission to carry out a much better rearrangement programme.  It is only in such circumstances that there would be a delay in dividing a holding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

Deputy FitzGerald will appreciate that between 1976 and the middle of 1979 land prices reached an astronomical level and if Land Commission activities had been extended to the purchase of land at the rate he and his party suggest I doubt if a <Col N="765" /> number of the farmers who would have benefited by the acquisition of those lands would find themselves in a position to pay the annuities that would be required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduced provision will not entail any reduction in services.  The decrease arises solely from the fact that this year credit is being allowed to the Lands Vote for the amount by which payments in previous years exceeded the actual cost of providing the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The gross estimate for 1981 was £361,000 but because payments in previous years exceeded the actual cost of the service by £179,000 credit was allowed for the sum.  I am not in a position to indicate exactly when the credit was allowed and for how long a period, but it is quite clear that the arrangements by which payments are made by the Department of Agriculture for services from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in relation to 1979 because of the postal strike would have meant that a figure very much in excess of what was in the Estimates was paid and this is responsible for the bulk of the refund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke the other day I referred to a passage from the Taoiseach's speech in which he said that it was the policy to protect the living standards of the underprivileged and less well off in the difficult <Col N="806" /> economic circumstances of today.  The budget has done just that.  It was designed to meet existing circumstances and the challenge of the future.  It was a social welfare budget because the Government in their wisdom, backed by the people, have made provision to give to the needy sections of our society, the handicapped and the aged, an increase in their pensions of roughly 25 per cent, the same increase as last year.  It was also the desire of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that we should afford some greater measure of security against want to our pensioners.</P>
      <P>I am not by any means an economist but I believe that if something is morally right then it is economically sound.  To give increases to the blind, the handicapped and the aged is surely morally right.  The most conservative economists will agree that it is a real investment in human terms.  I am very proud of the Government who prepared this budget and I am glad to say that people in this city to whom I have spoken about the budget have been full of praise for its provisions.  Like myself, many of them cannot follow the finer points of economic science.  I do not feel at a loss because of that but the Government deserves the backing of the people for this budget despite the fact that it has been criticised by various sectors, most of which exert a lot of muscle.  Old age pensioners may not have much muscle but to receive the thanks of these people assures one and gives one confidence that whatever obstacles we face will be overcome under this Government and we will beat this recession.</P>

      <P>John Donne said that no man is an island, and during a world recession very few countries are islands from an economic point of view.  What happens elsewhere affects us here.  There is no good in putting the blame on the Government for everything that goes wrong.  I have yet to hear an Opposition speaker give genuine evidence that they are pleased by the social welfare increases which were given.  People will not kick against extra tax once they know the money is being well spent.  The Government gave relief not just to the social welfare sector.  They took 38,000 people out of the tax bracket and relief was given to PAYE taxpayers.</P>
      <P>It has been a very wise budget.  Last week there was a barrage of criticism from some sections but this week the atmosphere has changed and people now realise what a great budget it is.  I am happy to note that the construction industry have publicly backed the Government because this industry is a kind of national barometer which shows how well the country is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have shown evidence of our desire to forge ahead with the plans envisaged in this budget.  This budget is constructive so I must take the Opposition to task on the line their speakers have taken.  They accused the Government of over-spending and then said that they had not spent enough.  They forget that people have intelligence and that they can perceive the false approach of the Opposition in promising increased social welfare payments and in also promising a cutback of expenditure.  I heard a throw-away remark from the Opposition front bench recently where public sector salaries were criticised.  If the Opposition were back in power would there be a pay cut-back in the public sector?  An Opposition statement last week criticised our expenditure on salaries in the public sector and lest I do them an injustice I would ask them to clarify their attitude.  If they feel that <Col N="808" /> wages are too high they should say so. They cannot sit on the fence.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact of the recession. The Opposition parties should treat people as being mature and realise that they will not fool them with that type of argument. In the budget the Government pointed out the difficulties and the sacrifices that are called for and they have not asked the weaker sections to make sacrifices. Many people can afford to make sacrifices towards the common good and they should be prepared to make those sacrifices.  The Government have ensured that the old age pensioner, the widow or the orphan will not be asked to make sacrifices to fight the recession but the onus is on the wealthy people to make sacrifices so that we have a society of social justice.  The Taoiseach has indicated that despite the recession we are doing as well as and better than some countries who are stronger than us.  We should have a unity of purpose towards making this a better country.  We should work a little harder so that we can ensure a decent living standard for everyone. We will always have the poor and despite the efforts of the Government many people have not a decent standard of living but there is no reason why they should not have it.  If the Government pursue their plans we will eventually have a society where we cherish all our people equally; there will be proper housing and as much employment as possible.  We can build an economy equal to some of the more prosperous economies in Europe. It will not be easy.  The Government do not have a magic wand but neither do the Opposition.  We must all work for these things.</P>
    <P>The Government investment plan offers a new opening to the private sector for investment in the national development. A lot of the money that will be invested by the private sector will come from pension funds which are the savings of the employees.  The trade unions should consider forming co-operatives and using their savings and the pension funds to invest in public development. This may not be a new suggestion but we have no examples of it yet.  Jim Larkin in his wisdom, in order to provide employment, <Col N="809" /> opened a factory in Dublin to manufacture shovels, spades and so on and the trade unions today, who are far stronger, who have greater expertise, should follow along those lines.  When the transport union built Liberty Hall to house their staff they were severely criticised but I always felt it a worthwhile investment.  All credit is due to them for this project.  They have also shown that the trade unions can extend their role in these areas.  Many amenities are needed throughout the country and the trade unions could fill a vacuum and provide them.  The Government can only do so much and they must rely on taxation for finance.  The Government are leading the drive for greater prosperity in giving the private sector a new opening in which to develop.  I know that the private sector will take up the offer to become involved in enterprises which up to now were not open to the private sector.</P>
    <P>We are too small to neglect any sector and the traditional role of the trade unions has been to better the lives of their members.  They had to fight very hard in the bad old days to do this.  The Government recognise this now and they have brought in the private sector.  I hope the trade unions will consider taking on this type of development.  There are State grants and there is money provided by the Exchequer to help certain projects. I feel the lead of Jim Larkin and the transport union could be followed to make a much better society.  We must all be one in this matter.  I hope the trade unions will come forward with some project which will benefit everybody.</P>
    <P>The budget is to enable us to develop our resources.  The Government are doing a very good job in the present circumstances in introducing this budget. I believe that over the next few days when we are discussing the budget people will realise the great instrument it is for development and that no sector is neglected. I hope there will be greater trade union investment in the type of projects I have mentioned.  The unions have a lot to offer.  They have got leaders, expertise and craftsmen.  I hope they can mould themselves into a unit.  The British trade unions gave us the co-op development <Col N="810" /> and this shows what can be done by the unions.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of an Opposition to criticise. I hope they will be a little more constructive in their criticism than they have been up to now.  I hate mentioning names in the House but one of the Opposition speakers made the worst speech I have heard on the budget.  He had not done his homework or he could not follow the budget.  I am sure that he, like everybody else, believed that the social welfare increases deserve some mention but I do not recall his mentioning them. The Fianna Fáil Party have always been very strong on social welfare provisions. I hope that will always be the case.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest tasks is to provide proper housing for our people.  The Construction Industry Federation praised the budget.  If the construction industry are kept going at full blast we will increase employment.  We will find work for our craftsmen and many ancillary industries. In addition, we are providing proper housing for our people.  RTE had a programme last night about a flats complex in Dublin.  There is still a lot wrong in Dublin city housing and money has to be found to ensure that we make further progress.  Money is being provided in the budget to do this.  We have, thanks to Government backing, started on a policy of urban renewal in the centre of the city. The bad houses, which were built well over a century ago, are being pulled down.  Many of our people are forced to live in some of those bad houses.  Great progress is being made a short distance from this House.  I should be delighted to take any Member of the House on a tour of our inner city to show what is being done.</P>
    <P>I know that Members on the Opposition benches, who are members of Dublin City Council, are very sincere in pressing for such development.  I worked with them for years.  They have always shown how anxious they were to get rid of the bad housing in the city.  It is important to provide large sums of money for this work.  It costs £15,000 to £20,000 to build a house in the suburbs, but some of the houses in the inner city are costing £40,000 to build, taking the acquisition <Col N="811" /> cost, clearance costs, and the erection of the house into account.  I believe we are justified in spending that money.  Dublin is not the only city which has decay.  The same can be said about Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  I am glad to say that Dublin Corporation, with Government backing, are tackling the problem of housing decay in the heart of the city.  We will no longer have the centre city without any people living in it.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Dublin Corporation will provide at least the same amount of housing this year as was provided last year. We do not build flats any longer.  Money is being found to build houses in the inner city.  There will be 1,500 new dwellings this year, which is the same as last year. There will also be a few hundred vacancies, so this means we will be providing about 2,000 new lettings this year.  It is very hard to quantify the waiting list but, if we take it as around 6,000, it means that it will not take very long to solve the problem.  However, this will not happen too easily because a growing city will always have a housing problem.  If a city is dying there are no houses needed. Dublin, Cork, Galway or Waterford are not dying.  They are all living cities and they need more houses.  We must make sure that sufficient money is provided in the budget to keep up our magnificent housing drive.</P>
    <P>Last week I gave figures for the number of people who have come back to our cities and towns.  During the Donegal by-election I spoke to a teacher in a small school who told me the number of children there who were born outside this country and who had come back here.  Ours is an expanding country.  The population is rising. Nowadays people demand higher standards which we are providing for them.  We must use all our resources and we must involve every section of the community to ensure that we do a good job. With this budget we will succeed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one should not look for credit for doing something good.  Some people think this was not a good budget and we must disabuse their minds of that idea. More and more it is being recognised as <Col N="812" /> a very good instrument for national development.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is a statement from the Construction Industry Federation.  They welcome the budget and the Public Capital Programme. They say that the estimates for 1981 &mdash; £1,732.6 million compared with £1,269.9 million &mdash; should give the construction industry a badly needed boost. I do not think we can spend too much money on the building industry.  We will always have people who need housing.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the industry too.  Every penny possible should be ploughed into the building industry to provide better houses and to create employment.  It may be said that investment in housing does not provide great financial dividends but it is the best social investment which can be made.  With the expertise of our craftsmen there is no reason why public sector housing should not be really profitable for all concerned. We will need many more dwellings and we will provide the money for them.  Any money which can be spared should be invested in the building industry to assist in the plans and programmes for urban renewal which were drawn up by local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We would all like to provide more money for each item in the budget but, to a large extent, we are governed by what is happening in the world outside.  This is self-evident.  There is no use in blaming the Government for doing the wrong thing or for not doing enough.  We have to watch world developments.  We are winning against the recession.  There are closures of industries, but we all know the magnificent record of the IDA in replacing job losses.  It is not recognised generally that more people are in employment at present than ever before in the history of the State.  The vast majority of that employment is well paid and productive.</P>
    <P>People will always point to the unemployment figures.  We cannot shut our eyes to them.  We have to do our best to reduce them by providing employment. Let us take some heart from the fact that, over the past three years, there has been a colossal growth in the number of people in employment.  In their wisdom the Government <Col N="813" /> have budgeted for expansion. Some people say we are overspending.  I would ask Opposition speakers where they would cut back in public spending. Arguments should be backed by solid facts.  The Opposition must spell out where they would make the cut-backs.</P>
    <P>People have criticised the Government for increasing the cost of motor registration. They say we removed tax from cars and now we are putting it back.  We are doing no such thing.  If we had left the tax on cars, motorists would now be paying £60 million in tax.  We relieved them of that.  Had we not taken the rates off private houses years ago people would still be paying rates.  It was always very difficult for young married couples to pay rates.  I would not be in favour of reintroducing rates.  I have heard rumblings from Opposition speakers that local democracy has failed because rates can no longer be struck.  Not many young couples would agree with that.  The rates were removed because we thought the system was inequitable.  Opposition speakers should be more explicit when they criticise the removal of rates from private dwelling houses.  Have they any intention of restoring rates?  Let them speak out if they have.  Perhaps they could make a good case for doing so.  Let us hear that case.  I do not think there is a good case.  People who are sniping about the removal of rates should let us know what is behind their thinking.</P>
    <P>The budget is an instrument for national development.  It is a clarion call to all sections to come in behind the Government in order that the excellence of the budget may be experienced to the fullest extent.  That is why I have appealed to trade unions to play their part in national development.  It may be said that the role of a trade union is to look after their members.  That is quite true, but we are one of the most unionised countries in Europe.  We have about 93 trade unions.  I am told that in Germany they have less than a dozen.  I will not go into the argument for fewer trade unions.  I am trying to show that the trade union movement is very strong and has a tremendous part to play in the drive for national prosperity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I want to pay tribute to the Taoiseach and his Ministers on the manner in which they framed this budget.  It is one of the best budgets ever introduced in this House.  We all speak for the people.  It has been wonderful to hear the thanks and the praise from the weaker sections of the community for the provisions in this budget for bigger pensions and greater reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has gone to the country with an energy saving campaign which is very necessary.  We have to conserve fuel nowadays.  The Government did not miss out on that either and fuel vouchers have been increased.  I do not say a pensioner has a fully adequate pension but he has a fairly adequate one.  He also has free travel, free television and gets help with the payment of telephone bills.  We have kept faith with pensioners and have shown what we can do.  It is only lack of money that prevents us from doing more.</P>
    <P>The budget will enable us to develop the national economy.  The bigger the national cake the more there will be for everyone.  Next year we will be able to give more to the pensioners.  The treatment which we gave to pensioners in this budget justifies any sacrifices asked of the better-off sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No budget in the history of the State &mdash; this is my twentieth annual budget in the House &mdash; has evoked such widespread condemnation as the present one.  The immediate, spontaneous reaction from this side of the House to the Minister's speech when presenting his budget last Wednesday has been reiterated in the media and confirmed by the reactions that I am sure every member of the House, irrespective of his party, has been getting from constituents and the man in the street.  Reactions from the different sections of the community and from spokesmen representing different sectoral interests have had one underlying common denominator. It could be described as a shock reaction, a realisation that the Government, as revealed in the budget, have not been able to come to grips with the very severe economic and social problems that confront us at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> We must be honest and face this as objectively as possible.  The country is in the grip of a very severe and frightening economic crisis.  There were great expectations that in the 1981 budget the Government would avail of the opportunity to clearly demonstrate that they had some of the answers to our serious problems. A most objective analysis of the budget and of the Minister's speech must show up one thing with frightening clarity and that is, unfortunately for the country, the budget contains no answer for the serious economic situation we have at present.  There is no real answer in the budget to the grave crisis that confronts the country's most fundamental and important industry, agriculture.  There is no real answer to the very serious situation with which Irish manufacturing and processing industry are faced with continuous spiralling costs and inflation eroding their cost competitiveness almost to a state where it is becoming impossible to sell products profitably.  There is no real answer in the budget to industrial problems. The third major sector of the economy, the tourist industry, has gone through a difficult period in recent years but 1980 was an absolutely disaster for it. Yet there is nothing in the budget to help the tourist industry or to enable it to reach new objectives or implement new promotion policies for the 1981 tourist season.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of the budget is that expectations were aroused that the Government would show clear proof that they realised the country was on the brink of a serious economic crisis and that new policies and economic strategies were called for to tackle the insidious inflationary spiral which is playing havoc with tourism, agriculture and industry.  The peoples hopes and expectations were not realised in the budget.  As a result of hopes raised three-and-a-half years ago when the Government took office now being shattered in what is perhaps the last budget of the present Dáil, there is, particularly among the young people, a growing disillusionment with the whole political system, a cynicism about politicians, politics and parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> There is, and I am sure other Members of the House who have taken the trouble to analyse the reactions of the people will also have noticed it, an almost fatalistic acceptance of the gravity of the situation and a total lack of confidence in the ability of the elected representatives, the Government and national parliament, to face up to the reality of the situation.  I say in all sincerity that we have reached a situation where the gravity of the situation and its very frightening consequences for employment, industry and agriculture, transcends purely party politics. There is an obligation on all political parties and on all Members of the House to pool their resources, talents and abilities by constructive criticism and bring new ideas and attitudes to bear on the very severe national crisis that faces us at present.</P>
    <P>I have had the honour and privilege of being almost 20 years in the House and have served both in and out of Government. We would be living in cloud-cuckoo-land and be totally unrealistic if we did not recognise and admit that the country is in dire trouble.  I have always believed in looking for a silver lining.  It is a good confidence motivator to look for a silver lining, but how can young people who do not have any real prospect of securing employment that will meet their aspirations, their qualifications or their talents see any silver lining?  Is it any wonder that there is abroad a dangerous cynicism, disillusionment and lack of confidence in the ability in elected representatives to come to grips with this problem?</P>
    <P>The Government have failed in the budget to deal with this matter.  I am not trying to minimise the difficulties which confront the Government and public representatives but the budget is a disaster as far as restoring confidence in the economy, agriculture, industry and tourism is concerned.  I have read the Minister's speech on many occasions to try to find some cause for optimism but I could not. Spokesmen for the various sectors of the economy have also failed to find some cause for optimism.  At present we have to deal with growing unemployment, galloping inflation, a spiralling cost of living, <Col N="817" /> the worst agricultural crisis in half a century and a processing industry that is fighting a losing battle against inflation. The most serious aspect in relation to the processing industry is that the cost competitiveness of their products has been destroyed.  The tourism industry is in a shambles.  Our fishing industry, one of our great natural resources, is in a chaotic state.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the increases in social welfare benefits, we must be concerned at the revelations of recent surveys in relation to poverty.  They revealed an appalling situation.  Prior to Christmas a Redemptorist priest in Limerick city stated that as a result of inquiries he had carried out he had learned that 25 per cent of the population of that city were on the poverty margin.  That statement provoked considerable controversy among politicians and others.  We were aware that poverty existed in the third city of the Republic because we had to deal with such people at our weekly &ldquo;clinics&rdquo; and for that reason I reserved judgment on the figure of 25 per cent.  However, two weeks ago details of a national survey into poverty, carried out under the auspices of the St. Vincent de Paul society, were revealed.  That survey indicated that 25 per cent of the population were living on the verge of poverty.  That is a terrible situation and is a shocking indictment of the policies pursued by successive Governments since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>It is terrible to think that such poverty exists in a country that has so many natural and underdeveloped resources.  That report was the worst piece of news I read in the last 12 months.  It is more serious than all the other problems that confront the nation, such as economic recession, rising oil prices or redundancies in industries. Considerable play has been made of the decision to increase social welfare benefits by 25 per cent in the budget, but I had hoped that the increase would be more substantial.  It is possible to show that the increase represents so many percentage points above our inflation rate but in my view it was the minimum any Government, faced with the impact of inflation and the rising cost of living on <Col N="818" /> such unfortunate people, could grant.  It will not improve their lot and will not solve the appalling poverty situation revealed in the two surveys I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the sixties the late Seán Lemass used describe the budget as the main instrument of Government economic policy. He also said that the acid test of Government policy was the creation of jobs and employment.  Having a proper social policy depends on whether the Government have a proper economic policy and <i>vice versa</i>.  As a major instrument of an economic and social policy for the country the budget is an abject failure.  It reveals the lack of ability by the Government to produce any type of policy.  They must be aware of the problems but have not been able in the budget to come up with a formula for national recovery which would restore confidence among our people in the various sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>The sector of the economy causing most concern at present is agriculture.  It is a fundamental and basic national industry. However, it has been in decline in recent years.  The present crisis did not materialise overnight.  The Government have been aware of the crisis in that industry for some years.  That industry, the most important one we have, has been crucified by the Government in recent years in the form of additional taxation, all types of levies, resource tax and the abolition of rates relief.  Prior to Christmas we introduced a six point programme to help meet some of the difficulties confronting farmers.  We expected that those six suggestions would have been accepted by the Government and implemented in the budget.  The budget contains certain concessions for the agricultural industry but they are useless as far as dealing with the crisis in the industry is concerned.  More is needed.  Reputable economists have estimated that a transfer of resources of the order of £200 million to £300 million is necessary to restore confidence in the agriculture sector. The package for agriculture in the budget represents a paltry sum and it is doubtful if it will have any effect on the morale of those engaged in that industry. It could not be regarded as something <Col N="819" /> that will release a new dynamism which will restore confidence in the industry.  I am aware that the Minister is endeavouring to negotiate a package from Brussels. I know also that he is endeavouring validly to separate the deal for a special package now from the annual price review, and I agree with that strategy.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the EEC in 1973 the Government's annual budget in this country and in every member country of the EEC is affected and influenced by the financial instruments of the EEC which provide annual subvention, grants and so forth to the various countries.  Since we entered the EEC every Government have to take into account the anticipated flow of funds from the EEC, the CAP, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and so forth.  For the sake of the agricultural industry I hope that the Minister for Agriculture will succeed in negotiating a realistic package.  Furthermore, speaking as one who has the privilege of being an MEP at present, in the December session of the European Parliament my Irish colleagues of all parties and I joined together, transending party politics, and tabled an all-party Irish motion calling on the Commission to come to the aid of the Irish agricultural industry and that motion was passed by a substantial majority of the European Parliament. The Minister for Agriculture can go out and has been going out to Brussels negotiating and I hope sincerely that the combined efforts of the Irish MEPs have strengthened his hand.</P>
    <P>The EEC and the funds flowing from it are very relevant to the annual budgetary processes in this country.  They must be.  I believe that we could be facing very grave difficulties and I would like to avail of this opportunity of saying bluntly, and as briefly as possible how I see the situation.  The EEC themselves have been for some time and will continue to be in a severe budgetary crisis.  Their major financial instrument, their most important one, the CAP, is under very severe and sustained attack.  The Minister, the Government and the MEPs of all parties will have to be on the alert to ensure that any reforms of the CAP will <Col N="820" /> not be detrimental to a small, underdeveloped country like ours which is more dependent on agriculture than any other one of the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture in negotiating the package for Irish agriculture has a cast-iron case because, first of all, under the protocol through the Accession Treaty recognition was given to our state of underdevelopment.  The entire island of Ireland was recognised as an underdeveloped country meriting special aid under various financial instruments of the Community.  Our annual agricultural output of productivity per acre, per cow and so forth is probably half the European average and we are still in a developing state.  We must be careful to ensure that any changes made in the CAP will not be global changes but will take into account the special underdeveloped state of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Honestly and sincerely, I wish the Minister for Agriculture well in his negotiations. Great expectations have been aroused now, particularly as a result of the fact that the budget did not come up with anything like the answer that the farming community were expecting and which their spokesmen and Deputies on all sides of the House representing constituencies which have an agricultural sector have been advocating.  Great expectations have been aroused and much is expected of the Minister for Agriculture.  After listening to the debate in the European Parliament and speaking in that debate in December and hearing the members of that Parliament and the Parliament as a whole accepting the fact that Ireland has a special case for assistance, I can say that if this is to strengthen the Minister's hand he will have to adopt a tough attitude and bring home the goods as far as the agricultural industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>A factor that must be recognised and should have been recognised in the budget is the fact that unfortunately, sections of the farming community and the sector of agricultural industry have been hit most severely by the economic recession of the last year or two.  Those who have been most severely hit by the credit restrictions that have operated over the <Col N="821" /> last year have been the younger and most progressive farmers.  The farmers who invested to improve their holdings and the productivity of their land, to install proper equipment, mechanise their farms and so forth have had to borrow enormous amounts of money to do this.  This was a fantastic investment in the future of Ireland.  This is something that should at all times have been encouraged.  It must continue to be encouraged, even though we are in an economic recession this year because the future of this country will depend on the development of our agricultural industry more than ever before.  The most progressive farmers, the young farmers, must be given every encouragement to ensure that they will invest their time, their talents and their lives, so to speak, in developing their farms to the maximum degree.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this budget to encourage this.  Worst of all, there is nothing in this budget that would encourage young and progressive farmers, and older farmers also, who have invested their money and mortgaged their lives, so to speak, in developing their holdings, thereby contributing to the national export drive, the development of the national economy, the creation of employment in food processing industries and so on.  Their morale has been shattered very badly and their confidence has been almost totally destroyed, because it was expected that the budget would be a real indication that the Government recognised that the economic future of this country depends more on the development of agriculture than on any other single factor.</P>
    <P>The greatest weakness of all in the whole economic strategy of the Government, as revealed over the last six or eight months, as revealed also in the budget we are discussing and in the Minister's speech, is that there has been no indication of any long-term planning for agriculture.  We need a proper package to get us out of the present crisis, but in order to engender confidence in the future we need longer-term planning, a proper five-year plan.  It is rather strange that the Government have been encouraging farmers to formulate development <Col N="822" /> plans when neither the Government themselves nor the Department of Agriculture have a five-year or other long-term plan for agriculture.</P>
    <P>The budget is a grave disappointment to everybody in the agricultural industry. Probably for the first time in many years all sections of the community more and more realise the fundamental importance of agriculture to the economy because there have been catastrophic consequences directly and indirectly as a result of the agricultural crisis with food factories and meat processing factories closing or going on short-time, redundancies, and agricultural machinery producers and agricultural service industries disemploying people.  Business is dropping catastrophically.  I am sure that every shopkeeper in every rural town and village has felt the impact of the agricultural crisis in the past six months.</P>
    <P>Another sector of the economy causing great concern at present is manufacturing industry.  We have an almost daily litany of industries in difficulties with redundancies and so on.  We have a very serious situation in that the cost competitiveness of our industry is being seriously eroded. This has frightening implications for employment.  As a German colleague in the European Parliament is forever saying, inflation is the mother of unemployment. The least one would expect in this budget when the common denominator affecting agriculture, industry and tourism has been inflation is that an attempt would be made to tackle it.  If the impact of inflation on agriculture has been catastrophic its impact on industry has been likewise.  I should like some Member of the House to indicate if possible where and how this budget has even attempted to tackle the inflationary spiral.</P>
    <P>I read reports of commentators and economic analysists over the past few days and they forecast that the net result of the budget will be a 3 or 4 per cent rise in inflation.  I accept this must be so because we must take into account the increase in the petrol price and the increase in telecommunication charges and postal services.  Communications are vital to business and industry in this small island country remote from world markets <Col N="823" /> and a good communications system is of paramount importance.  We have a 35 per cent increase in the cost of communications which will have a crippling effect on industry and on tourism in particular. The increased petrol price will add to the cost of motoring and this will make Ireland less attractive to motoring tourists.  It will make it impossible for the hire-drive sector of the tourist industry to operate.  Instead of getting some indication of the determination and the ability of the Government to tackle inflation the net result of all the budgetary strategy is that inflation will rise by 3 or 4 per cent by the end of the year.  If this is so we shall be in very serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I wanted to approach the budget from the economic point of view and look at it against the background of what it should be, a major instrument of the Government's economic strategy.  There are one or two aspects of it about which I am very concerned.  I already referred to the fact that there are no answers in the budget to the problems of agriculture, industry or tourism.  I do not know if the fishing industry is even mentioned.  Tá rud eile a chuireann buairt mhór ormsa agus is é sin nach bhfeicimse focal ar bith i ráiteas an Aire Airgeadais ná rud ar bith sna Meastacháin a léireodh go bhfuil aon phlean nua ag an Rialtas chun leas na Gaeltachtaí agus leas na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Tá staid na Gaeilge san lá atá inniu ann go huafásach ar fad.  Bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta cúpla bliain ó shin agus is mór an phoiblíocht a bhí ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas an am sin gurb é bunú Údarás na Gaeltachta an rud is tábhachtaí a thárla riamh sa Ghaeltacht agus dúirt an tAire nuair a bhí sí ag labhairt san díospóireacht sin go mbraithneodh obair an Údaráis ar an Rialtas a bheadh ann agus ar an Aire Ghaeltachta a bheadh i mbun oifige.  Níl rud ar bith san cháinfhaisnéis seo nó i ráiteas an Aire a thaispeánann go dtuigeann an Rialtas na deacrachtaí móra eacnamaíochta agus sóisialacha atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta san lá atá inniu ann.</P>
    <P>An phríomh aidhm a bhí agamsa nuair a bhí mé im Aire Ghaeltachta ná lánfhostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="824" /> a luaithe agus is féidir.  Níl na figiúirí oifigiúla agamsa ach chomh fada agus is eol dom níor tháinig méadú ar bith ar líon na ndaoine atá fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i mbun oifige agus tá líon na ndaoine atá fostaithe go lánaimseartha ag titim in aghaidh na seachtaine.  Cé nach bhfuil aon cheantair Ghaeltachta i mo Dháil Cheantar i Luimneach Thiar, mar sin féin is é mo thuairimse go bhfuil suim ag muintir na hÉireann uile i leas muintir na Gaeltachta mar is é an Ghaeltacht tobar agus foinse ár dteanga agus ár gcultúr.  Bhí gach éinne ag súil go mbeadh airgead breise nó plean nua ins an cháinfháisnéis seo agus i ráiteas an Aire a thabharfadh dóchas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtais rud éigin a dhéanamh chun na fadhbanna eacnamaíochta móra atá sa Ghaeltacht anois a chur ar réiteach.  Mo bhrón, níl aon chruthúnas i ráiteas an Aire nó i Leabhar na Meastachán go bhfuil aon rud ar intinn ag an Rialtas maidir leis an Ghaeltacht agus leis an teanga.</P>
    <P>A final point I should like to make and I hope it is relevant &mdash; I presume it is because we must look at the whole strategy and judge the whole economic and social strategy of the Government from the budget and particularly from the Minister's speech and the Taoiseach's speech the other day &mdash; is that there is a very important asset in the mid-west region, the Shannon Airport and industrial complex.</P>
    <P>This year the subvention has been cut by £13 million at a time when there is great concern regarding the future of the airport, the duty-free shop and the industrial estate.  A number of other Ministers such as the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism are involved in this matter.  I hope there will be some indication of the reason for this substantial and frightening reduction in the amount of money available to the Shannon complex in the current year.  I do not think it is in order in this debate to talk about the problems of Shannon <i>per se.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point in relation to the budgetary provision for Shannon and the concern felt with regard to the reduction in the subvention. Another disappointing feature of the budget has been the miserable pittance given to one of the most outstanding national organisations, namely, Muintir na Tíre.  This movement was founded in the 1930s by the late Canon Hayes.  He was a prophet before his time.  Now the concept of community development has been recognised throughout the world as an important element in national economic and social development.  Muintir na Tíre have a vital role to play, particularly in this difficult time of economic crisis, in encouraging local communities to come together and to make their contribution to the development of their localities.  This is vital and worthwhile work and it should have been given special recognition and assistance.  When I was travelling to Dublin by train today I heard from a member of Muintir na Tíre that the Government had given the organisation an extra £1,500 this year.  I ask the Government to reconsider this matter.  I am not sure which Department make the subvention &mdash; I think it is the Department of Education.  Like me many Members of this House have been involved in Muintir na Tíre and some of us had the privilege of knowing the late Canon Hayes.  This concept of community development, of encouraging local communities to make their contribution towards the economic and social betterment of their areas is an important element in overall national development. Community co-operatives have done worthwhile work.  I plead with the Government for a realistic subvention.  I ask that more active encouragement be given to Muintir na Tíre and to other community development organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly happy to contribute to a budget debate for the first time as Minister for the Environment.  In addressing this House for the very first <Col N="826" /> time in my new capacity as Minister for the Environment in October last I clearly put on record the firm commitment of the Government and myself to ensuring the future development and well-being of the building and construction industry, to maintaining a high level of housing completions each year and to ensuring an expanded programme of infrastructural services in order to further stimulate economic development.</P>
      <P>The services for which I am responsible make very heavy demands on resources. I consider it very fitting that they should because the contribution of these services to the economy is immense.  All sectors of our economy are affected in one way or another by these services, whether by reference to the houses or general environment in which people live, the roads system which is so essential to our industry, agriculture, and tourism industries, the provision of adequate water supplies for industrial, agricultural and domestic use or to a host of other services which are essential to the effective management of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget delivers on the commitment of the Government made by me in October last &mdash; it is, therefore, a cause of immense satisfaction to me.  In a developing economy capital must always be limited relative to demands and of necessity there is, therefore, a keen competitiveness between the different services for the available resources.  I am glad to say that all of the main services for which I am responsible have done very well and their continued expansion throughout 1981 is assured.  I will be dealing in turn with each of these main services.  At this stage I will simply put on record a few of the more striking and impressive facts and statistics: £87 million allocated to road authorities by way of grants for road works for 1981, an increase of 49 per cent on the allocations in 1980 and a massive 227 per cent increase on the level of grants allocated by Deputies on the opposite side of the House when last in Government in 1977, capital amounting to £74.7 million provided for sanitary services for 1981 as against £51 million in 1980, an increase of 47 per cent; an allocation of £242 million for housing for <Col N="827" /> 1981 representing an increase of 33 per cent on the original provision of £183 million for 1980; the highest upper limit in any year at 12 per cent for 1981 on the increases in the rate in the pound to be struck by local authorities.  The grant in relief of rates now stands at £121 million. I would like to remind Deputies that this grant arises from the decision taken by the Government on their return to office in 1977 to derate domestic and certain other property; still on the question of rates there is the introduction of further concessions for farmers who will now be fully exempted where the land valuations are under £50 rateable valuation and have 50 per cent relief in cases with land valuations of £50 or over but under £70; we also have a proposal to introduce a new special allowance of 100 per cent, which would be set against rental income, in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction of moderate-cost rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>For the building industry this is a good budget.  It gives further confirmation of the Government's commitment to the general wellbeing of the industry and in particular to the employment aspects, a commitment already incorporated in the agreed terms of the second national understanding.  It will strengthen the relationship between government, industry and trade unions, based on positive goals and mutual trust.  The building industry, as everyone knows, is a key industry, the second largest employer in the country.  The health of this industry is vital to the health of the whole economy on two fronts: first, because of the level of employment it provides, and secondly, because it is the vehicle for providing a basic infrastructure necessary to support all other industry and vital social development.</P>
    <P>The difference between the treatment of the building and construction industry under the Coalition Government and this Government is indeed striking.  It is very difficult to understand the callous indifference of the Coalition Government when in office to the needs of the industry. Let us briefly examine the facts.  During <Col N="828" /> the years 1974, 1975 and 1976, which were the three full years in which the Coalition were in office, public capital investment in the building industry fell by 4.5 per cent, 7.2 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively &mdash; an uninterrupted slide downhill away from prosperity and into unemployment and depression.  Output in the industry actually fell by 1 per cent in 1974 and by a further 7 per cent in 1975.  In the mid-1970s, employment in the industry fell by at least 5,000.  That is indeed a picture of unrelieved gloom. I can assure the House that there will be no repetition of this dismal performance by this Government.  Our record speaks for itself.  Between 1977 and 1979 output in the building industry rose sharply. Output in 1980 was about 28 per cent above the 1976 level, while direct employment increased by about 13,000 during this period.  In 1980, when the current recession began to have its effect on the industry, the Government took immediate action and provided additional State support to the tune of over £92 million, again aimed at boosting confidence and stabilising employment. Faced with this type of problem at the end of 1973, the Coalition Government reduced public capital expenditure in each of the following three years with disastrous effects.  Indeed, the effects were felt for years after, particularly through shortages of skilled operatives lost to the industry and disruption of design teams and contracting firms.</P>
    <P>This should be a good year for the building industry.  With their 1981 Investment Plan, the Government revealed their capital investment strategy for the years ahead.  This strategy will increase building activity on a wide front, increase employment and generate confidence, not only in the building industry, but in many related industrial and service activities, while at the same time providing the essential infrastructure needed for further industrial and social development.</P>
    <P>I would like now to speak on certain housing aspects of the Government's strategy.  In order to put the housing situation in 1981 in context, I wish to outline what has actually been achieved in the <Col N="829" /> recent past.  Firstly, new house completions in 1980 totalled 27,785 &mdash; an all-time record.  Deputies will have been aware of the steady growth in completions from 24,000 in 1976 to 24,500 in 1977, 25,400 in 1978 and 26,500 in 1979. Private new house completions in 1980, estimated at over 21,700 were also a record.</P>
    <P>The provision for housing capital expenditure in 1981 at £242 million represents an increase of 33 per cent on the original provision of £183 million for 1980 and an increase of 20 per cent on the estimated outturn of £201 million.  The 1981 provision shows an increase of 34 per cent in real terms compared to 1977. Expenditure between 1975 and 1977 in fact dropped by 57 per cent in real terms. Deputies may use the age old arguments that not enough money is being pushed into the housing area.  Of course, I would like to have a free hand in the provision of finance for housing &mdash; what Minister for the Environment would not?  &mdash; but I accept, and I think that all fairminded Deputies will agree, that the public purse has its limits and in the context of overall national financial resources housing has done extremely well this year, as indeed it should.  Internationally, we compare favourably with other countries in terms of our rates of housing completions and investment in housing generally.</P>
    <P>For the eighties, Government housing policy will continue to be directed to ensuring that, as far as the resources of our economy permit, every family can obtain a house of good standard, located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent they can afford.  My predecessor asked local authorities in January 1980 to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the nature and extent of existing housing needs and needs expected to arise up to 1985.  I expect the results of this assessment to be available within the next few weeks when they will form the basis of the Government housing strategies over the next five years or so.  Pending the availability of the detailed results of this assessment Government housing policy continues to be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with some of the more <Col N="830" /> important aspects of housing.  Social housing continues to obtain a high level of funding from the public capital programme. The local authority housing programme experienced some difficulties in 1980.  Prompt action was, however, taken to get over these; a review of the situation was undertaken and the Government authorised the allocation of an additional £12 million for local authority housebuilding.  This ensured that building continued at a satisfactory level.</P>
    <P>New house completions by local authorities in 1980 again topped the 6,000 mark.  The Government have thus maintained the level of completions within the range 6,000 to 6,300 for the fourth year in succession.  Despite the difficult period in mid-1980, average monthly employment last year actually increased to about 6,800 as against an average of 6,650 in 1979, and 5,600 in 1976.  Overall then, I think the Government can be well satisfied with the performance in the local authority housing area, having completed another successful year of steady progress.</P>
    <P>The indications for 1981 are that there will be some fall in the level of cost increases.  However, the levels of claims by housing authorities for their programmes show that the demands on the available capital will be impossible to meet.  This is in the normal order of things and I would be very surprised if local authorities did not ask for more than they could reasonably expect to get.  However, I would ask authorities to appreciate that the pool of capital available for the pro-programme is not without its limits and that excessive demands from any area can be met only at the expense of other areas.  I will give due consideration to the special claims pressed by authorities but I would ask authorities to resist the temptation to pursue completely unrealistic demands which make the already difficult task of fair allocation even more arduous.</P>
    <P>With co-operation from authorities in this regard and with careful management of resources, I am confident that the total provision of £108.5 million for local authority housing in the public capital programme for this year will ensure that <Col N="831" /> the programme is kept on course this year.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a record number of private houses was completed last year.  Local authorities continue to provide extremely valuable assistance to this sector by means of their ordinary house purchase and low-rise mortgage loan scheme.  The Government are fully conscious of the importance of this scheme to the categories of persons who are not catered for by the commercial lending agencies and this is evidenced by the very substantial increases which have been made in the qualifying loan and income limits in the past three years.  Since we resumed office in July 1977 the loan limit has been increased from £4,500 to £12,000 &mdash; an increase of 166 per cent while the income limit has been increased from £2,350 to £5,500 &mdash; an increase of 134 per cent.</P>
    <P>An indication of the extent to which the scheme is fulfilling the purpose for which it was intended is the growth in the demand for the loans.  The increase in the loan and income limits in January 1980 resulted in exceptionally heavy demand for payment in 1980 and consequently, put considerable pressure on the limited funds available.  Although an unprecedentedly high allocation was made in the public capital programme for the loan schemes in 1980, it was necessary to allocate a further £7 million to meet increased demand during the year to bring the total available to about £63 million.  This compares with expenditure of £17 million in 1977.</P>
    <P>A record sum of £98.5 million has been made available for the house purchase and low rise mortgage schemes in 1981. This compares with £17 million in 1977. This is about 44 per cent greater than the amount provided in 1980.  The provision of so substantial a sum is a further indication of the Government's commitment to ensuring that the schemes continue to cater for the deserving categories of persons for whom they are intended.</P>
    <P>Building societies, who contribute approximately 70 per cent of house purchase loan finance, are dependent to a very large degree on the level of inflow <Col N="832" /> of new funds from investors.  Despite a drop in the level of inflows in the early part of 1980 societies were able to maintain a reasonably high level of approvals because of the exceptionally high inflows during 1979.  The inflow situation was improved, however, as a result of the introduction of a subsidy in April 1980 which had the effect of allowing societies to increase their investment interest rate while maintaining the mortgage rate at 14.15 per cent.  In coming to this decision to subsidise, the Government were extremely conscious of the heavy additional burden which would otherwise have fallen on house purchasers with building society loans to repay.  In the absence of subsidy the additional repayments on an average loan of £16,000 would, for example, have been approximately £30 per month.  While the primary aim of the subsidy was to eliminate the hardship which would have been caused to borrowers, the subsidy also had the desired effect of increasing inflows to societies, enabling them to make loans amounting to approximately £270 million in respect of an estimated record of 16,800 houses.  I am confident that societies will also make an impressive contribution to the financing of the Government's housing programme in 1981.  The downward trend in interest rates in the latter half of 1980 made it possible to terminate the subsidy with effect from 1 October 1980 and enabled building society mortgage rates generally to be reduced to 13.15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for the Environment, on a number of occasions, both in this House and elsewhere, I have reiterated my own and the Government's commitment to the implementation of the programme of works identified in the Road Development Plan for the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The importance of good roads to this country is evident from the fact that up to 95 per cent of internal passenger traffic and 85 per cent of freight traffic is carried on the road system.  Road transport forms a significant element in agricultural, industrial and commercial costs, and it can be a deciding factor in the choice of location of new industry.  The growth of <Col N="833" /> tourism and of social development are related to the efficiency of the road system. Development generally brings a growing demand for higher standards &mdash; for road widening, by-passes, new access roads and bridges and for special attention to maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Government, in their appreciation of the deficiencies of the road system and of the economic costs which these deficiencies impose, published the Road Development Plan for the 1980s.  This plan outlines its objectives for the development of the road system in the current decade through the preservation of the overall network up to a satisfactory standard; the provision of an adequate strategic inter-urban road system connecting the principal towns, seaports and airports; the adoption of a minimum two-lane standard for the national route network, without prejudice to the necessity for higher standards for particular sections of that network; the provision of by-passes of towns on the national routes where these are considered necessary on planning, traffic or environmental grounds; a special programme to meet the need for new river crossings, ring roads and relief routes in the county boroughs and other major urban centres.</P>
    <P>The recently published Investment Plan 1981 identified the major road network as deserving priority in increased infrastructure investment, on the lines proposed in the Road Development Plan.  The Government this year will provide £80 million in grant expenditure for road improvement and maintenance works.  This level of finance, unprecedented in the history of the State, is a positive demonstration of the Government's determination to bring the standard of the road network into line with the demands of today's transportation needs.</P>
    <P>The provision of £80 million has enabled me to allocate this year grants to road authorities totalling £67 million for improvement works and £20 million for maintenance works.  This represents an increase of 49 per cent on the road grants allocated last year and of a remarkable 227 per cent on the level of grants which were provided by the Coalition Government <Col N="834" /> four years ago at the beginning of 1977.</P>
    <P>The allocations which I have made for improvements include grants of more than £31 million for major works identified in the Road Development Plan.  The grants provide for progress on 13 of the major works in the Dublin region including the commencement of a new road for the N 1 from Whitehall to the airport; a by-pass of Swords on the same route; Balbriggan by-pass; a new road linking Clontarf Road with the East Wall road; a new bridge in the vicinity of Heuston Bridge and a by-pass at Palmerstown on the N 4 to the west.</P>
    <P>I have allocated grants for seven of the major works listed in the plan for Cork city including three new bridges over the Lee and a new ring road.  For Limerick, Waterford and other large urban areas, I have provided grants for 14 of the major works identified in the plan, including ring roads in Limerick, new bridges in Waterford, Athlone and Galway and inner relief roads or ring roads in Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Tralee and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>For other sections of the national routes I have provided grants for 47 of the major works identified in the plan, including the Naas by-pass; new Cork-Mallow road; new road through the Curragh; and ring roads or by-passes at Dunleer, Navan, Mullingar, Carrick-on-Shannon, Collooney, Ballinasloe, Oranmore, Roscrea, Donegal, Midleton and Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>While the plan highlights the major works to be undertaken, it also provides for an extensive programme of normal improvement works designed to bring all sections of the national primary routes and significant sections of the national secondary routes up to a specified minimum standard.  The programme will include realignments, provision of hard shoulders, eradication of accident black-spots and strengthening of pavements, and I have allocated grants of more than £21 million for such works in 1981.  I have also provided substantial grants for road maintenance, block grants to supplement the resources of road authorities and grants for special works, including bridge <Col N="835" /> works, on roads other than national roads.  The need for the strengthening and renewal of critical sections of the principal roads has not been overlooked and the grant allocations I have made provide for expenditure of over £6 million for a special programme for such works.</P>
    <P>The 1981 grants programme is an ambitious one by any standards.  I am confident that the capacity and enterprise of the road authorities will meet the challenge offered to take a major step towards the development of a road network adequate for the 1980s and beyond.</P>
    <P>One of the prime considerations of the Government when preparing the Investment Plan 1981 was the need to protect existing employment and to create as far as possible additional work opportunity. Road works as a means of generating employment has been well established in Ireland.  Not only do they give a wide distribution of on-site employment throughout the country but also they afford substantial indirect employment in quarrying, plant and other related industries. The bulk of investment in roads is spent on Irish labour and materials and equipment of Irish manufacture and origin.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the provision of £80 million this year will generate a significantly increased level of employment both on-site and in ancillary industries producing road-making materials and equipment.  I expect that at least 11,500 road workers will be employed on the 1981 works programme of the road authorities which will represent an increase of over 600 such man-year jobs over 1980.  On that point I have impressed on the managers of road authorities the need for the maximum use of Irish materials to ensure that employment in Irish firms is protected and increased.</P>
    <P>Investment in road improvement works must be complemented by improvements in traffic management measures.  The problem of traffic congestion is not only a source of frustration to road users and of damage to the environment of our cities but also imposes an unnecessary burden on the economy and <Col N="836" /> threatens to place serious constraints on economic development.  Though it would be difficult to quantify the costs of traffic congestion, its adverse effects in terms of energy wastage, disruption of public transport and delays to the system of distribution of goods and services are considerable.</P>
    <P>In view of its position as the nation's principal commercial and industrial centre the traffic situation in Dublin gives most cause for concern.  As well as disrupting the economic and social life of the city, the costs and delays caused by congestion have effects throughout the country and the economy.  The Government accordingly have accepted the need for special measures and decisive action in order to tackle this problem effectively. The programme to be followed will involve co-ordinated action on a number of fronts with a role for both the public and private sector.</P>
    <P>I recently made regulations under the Road Traffic Acts to provide for the necessary statutory traffic signs and roadway markings to enable the implementation of certain bus priority measures which will begin to take effect in the coming months.  These measures are designed to assist the improvement of the operation of public transport.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem in Dublin has been worsened by extensive illegal parking.  To counteract this practice the Garda Commissioner has recently recruited the equivalent of 100 full-time traffic wardens, the results of which in terms of increased enforcement are already becoming evident.  In view of the limited space which can be made available for on-street parking it is essential, particularly in the interests of the commercial life of the city, that priority be given to short-term parkers.  On this principle Dublin Corporation recently installed an additional number of parking meters and propose to extend the system to further streets in the near future.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional off-street parking spaces is, of course, essential.  I am, therefore, glad to say that in both Dublin and Cork there are proposals in hands to provide such new facilities. These proposals, which are being pursued <Col N="837" /> as a matter of priority, should provide approximately 950 additional parking spaces in Dublin and about 750 such spaces in Cork.  It is particularly encouraging to note that interest has been shown by the private sector in participating in these developments which will be of considerable benefit to the commercial life of both cities as well as playing a vital role in contributing to a solution of traffic problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>Apart from the country's public road network, there is a considerable mileage of &ldquo;non-public&rdquo; or accommodation roads, which are of particular importance to the agricultural community.  The Local Improvements Scheme caters for the improvement of such roads, as well as for minor drainage works and so on, for the joint benefit of groups of farmers.  The provision under this scheme has been increased to £2.714 million in 1981 compared with £2 million in 1980.  The scheme is of particular benefit to the western counties and provides valuable seasonal employment in the rural areas. It is estimated that this year the scheme will provide the equivalent of 300 man-year jobs.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that a proportion of the expenditure on accommodation roads in the western counties under the local improvements scheme, as well as on selected county roads in these areas, will attract aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, known as FEOGA, under an EEC Regulation adopted last year.  This regulation provides for aid for infrastructural improvements, including roads, for the stimulation of agricultural development in the western counties.  A suitable programme has been submitted to the EEC for approval.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the necessity to make our roads safer for all road users. The Road Development Plan, which as I have indicated will be pushed ahead vigorously under this year's road works programme, clearly spells out road safety as an important objective.  As well as providing improvements in transport, efficiency and mobility the plan aims at removing accident black spots, better standards of signposting, road markings <Col N="838" /> and so on, all of which can contribute positively to reducing the risk of accidents.</P>
    <P>Continued support is being provided for the roads research work af An Foras Forbartha which provides a valuable base for the formulation and implementation of policy in relation to road planning and construction, the improvement of traffic management and the promotion of road safety generally.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978, has enabled the Garda to pursue vigorous action against the drinking driver.  The grant to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety has been increased substantially this year to £315,000 to enable it to deal with the increasing number of specimens received from the Garda Síochána for analysis.  The number of specimens analysed by the bureau in the first nine months of 1980, the latest available statistics was 6,897, This represents an increase of 12 per cent over the same period in 1979 and is equivalent to an annual rate of 9,200.  A disturbing feature is the large percentage of specimens which exceed the legal blood alcohol concentration limit and, more especially, the 40 per cent which have over twice the legal limit.  These figures show that there is a very substantial body of persons who regularly drive after drinking heavily.  It is the duty of all responsible people to do everything in their power to curtail these practices.  Amending legislation will come before the House in the near future which will clarify and rectify some of the existing provisions in the law dealing with driving while under the influence of alcohol so that enforcement measures will take their full effect.</P>
    <P>The major responsibility for the practice and promotion of road safety rests and will always rest on individual road users.  It is the actions of each of us, whether driver, cyclist or pedestrian, that determine whether the roads will be safe for ourselves and for others.  This is a heavy responsibility but one which we must face up to if we are to discharge it properly.  The provisional statistics of road accidents in 1980, which show the lowest number of fatalities since 1976 and a reduction compared to 1979 in the number <Col N="839" /> of people injured, are some encouragement to the belief that people are gradually responding to the need to show more care and consideration on the roads.  The development of an awareness of, and the responsibility of the road user for, safe road behaviour is the task of road safety education and publicity.  It is not an easy task but one which has been faced up to with considerable success by the National Road Safety Association, whose activities are to a large extent funded by an annual grant from my Department.  It is hoped that the association's achievements in securing sponsorship from the private sector for a number of valuable road safety projects will encourage an even wider range of interests throughout the country to become involved in aiding this valuable work,</P>
    <P>Since returning to office the Government increased the capital provision for public water and sewerage schemes by almost 90 per cent &mdash; from less than £25 million in 1977 to £46.75 million in 1980. The sanitary services programme is benefiting from the Government's commitment to increased infrastructural investment in the Investment Plan 1981.  As a result the present year will see a huge increase on the previous level of investment, with £66 million in capital being made available for the public water and sewerage programmes &mdash; a massive increase on the 1980 non-voted capital provision for public schemes.  In addition, £7.4 million is being provided for group schemes grants and £1.3 million for special grants for public schemes in western counties, giving a total of £74.7 million. This will permit a considerable expansion of the programme and will clear the backlog of major schemes at tender stage.  I have recently sanctioned the seeking of tenders for 11 major schemes estimated to cost £6.75 million, and will shortly sanction tenders for a further four schemes estimated to cost £3.5 million. In addition I am approving contract documents for a further number of major schemes estimated to cost £25 million. Contract documents for further schemes will be approved as soon as the capital <Col N="840" /> allocations to individual sanitary authorities have been finalised.</P>
    <P>Small public water and sewerage extensions are frequently required to cater for unforeseen developments at local level and to cater for urgent building proposals.  Proposed small schemes need not be submitted individually to my Department for approval.  Local authorities submit statements annually of the small scheme proposals they intend to carry out.  A global allocation is subsequently made to the local authorities who can then proceed to carry out the most urgent works involved.  The Government increased the capital cost limit for small schemes from £20,000 to £30,000 in 1978.</P>
    <P>I am now happy to inform the House that I intend to increase spending on these small schemes by 50 per cent in 1981.</P>
    <P>The large-scale building of industries, houses, factories and other buildings is using up serviced land at an estimated rate of over 6,000 acres per annum.  New water and sewerage schemes must be approved and undertaken now to ensure that an adequate stock of serviced land is available to allow this country to take advantage of a future upturn in the climate for private investment at home and abroad.  Failure to make provision for medium-and long-term water and sewerage requirements would lead to acute shortages of serviced sites and the loss of potential industries dependent on sanitary services.  Such a shortage would also cause inflation in land prices and thereby increase the cost of building factories, houses and community buildings including schools and hospitals.  I am proud that this Government, despite the current difficulties in the national and world economies, have had the courage and the conviction to invest heavily now in sanitary services.  In this way we will build a sound basis for the future economic expansion of our country.</P>
    <P>Successive industrial plans published by the Industrial Development Authority have emphasised the importance of an adequate network of piped water and sewerage schemes to attracting new industries and to the advance factory programmes. Moreover, the Government <Col N="841" /> and the IDA are determined that industrial development will proceed in a way which is consistent with protecting our environment &mdash; which is part of our natural heritage.  This requires the construction of new and improved sewerage schemes which are capable of safely disposing of the growing volume of effluent generated by industrial development.  As Minister for the Environment, I am determined that a sustained effort should be made, over a period of years, to eliminate pollution caused by the overloading of existing public sewage disposal systems.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies will be aware that modern farming requires adequate supplies of wholesome water.  A farm without piped water supplies has limited potential for expanding livestock numbers, milk production and for the improvements in farm hygiene so essential to animal health.  Many farmers still have to spend undue time and effort in drawing water to their holdings.  Agriculture is a cornerstone of the Irish economy and we simply cannot afford to have the modernisation of farming impeded by deficiencies in water supplies.  This is why I intend to approve a number of county council water schemes this year which will cater for the servicing of several thousand farms and for the development and expansion of the food processing industries.</P>
    <P>Private group water schemes play a major role in bringing piped water to rural houses and associated farms.  Group schemes have installed water in a total of almost 90,000 houses, including almost 10,300 grant-aided installations made in 1980.  The future prospects of group schemes are bright.  At 31 December 1980 220 schemes had been designed to serve over 7,100 houses; Work was in progress in installing water in a further 7,300 houses approximately; about 1,500 schemes were at earlier stages of development including the location and testing of suitable sources, preparation of designs and so on.  The level of group scheme activity will receive a big boost in 1981 and future years as a result of aid being available from the FEOGA under the Western Package approved in July <Col N="842" /> last year.  An outline programme has been submitted to the EEC Commission for approval.  As soon as this programme is approved, I will be in a position to announce details of increased grants for group schemes in the western areas.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the major services for which my Department have responsibility.  I would now like to move on to some of the other areas in which, although they could not be classed in the same category as housing, roads and sanitary services from an expenditure point of view, nevertheless, are very important in their own right and of vital importance to the whole community.</P>
    <P>It is essential that an adequate level of capital investment in the fire service be maintained if lives, property and jobs are to be given reasonable protection against the effects of fire outbreaks.  Capital investment in fire stations and equipment has increased significantly in the last few years and I am confident that this year's provision of £2.5 million will enable local authorities to continue to make good progress with their programmes for the provision of urgently-needed fire stations and the acquisition of modern fire fighting equipment.  As a measure of the progress being made, I would mention that 14 new or improved fire stations have been completed during the last three years, 11 are at present under construction and a further six are expected to get under way shortly.  In addition proposals for financing the purchase of 44 new fire appliances, crash rescue, communications and other fire service equipment were approved by my Department in the same period.</P>
    <P>For many years the public library service received a very scarce allocation of capital for new or improved buildings and other facilities.  In fact, as late as 1977 the relevant provision stood at just £290,000. It is encouraging, however, that since 1978 the capital provision for investment in libraries has increased significantly. This pattern will be maintained in 1981 with over £1.4 million in capital being made available to public libraries.  In all, about £5½ million has been assigned for this purpose between 1978 and 1981, which is approximately four times the <Col N="843" /> amount provided in the previous four years.  This, together with increased revenue spending on public libraries by local authorities is making for a very real improvement in the spread and quality of this important service.</P>
    <P>The inner city of Dublin is also an area with which I am concerned.  Responsibility for the Inner City Group and Fund was transferred to the Minister for the Environment in February 1980.  The group have been active in a number of areas in the economic, social and education fields and have allocated approximately £824,000 to date from the Inner City Fund for inner city projects.  Assistance is being given to local co-operatives. Grants have been given for the provision of recreational facilities and for employment in environmental improvement schemes including a special tree planting scheme.  Money is also being made available for improvements to inner city schools and for the provision of teaching equipment.  A special inner city employment programme is being implemented by the National Manpower Service on behalf of the group.  The programme is in operation from 1 January and under it any employer who employs people from a special inner city register will receive a premium of £30 per week up to a maximum of 26 weeks for each adult worker employed.  It is hoped that up to 200 people may be employed under the programme.</P>
    <P>Additional money is being made available to the Inner City Fund this year to enable the group to continue their work of alleviating the many problems of the inner city.</P>
    <P>We are not the only country experiencing problems of urban dereliction. Most developed countries have similar problems.  With a view to stimulating interest in urban problems and to accumulating ideas for their solution the Council of Europe have decided to sponsor, during the current year, a campaign for urban renaissance.  To organise our participation in the campaign a national committee has been set up under my chairmanship and it is currently involved in assessing national demonstration projects <Col N="844" /> from local authorities and the private sector which will be reported on to the Council of Europe and which illustrate various aspects of urban renewal and improvement.  It is hoped that the campaign will encourage greater co-operation between local communities, business sector and local authorities in seeking solutions to problems of urban dereliction and in carrying our renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>While a budget debate naturally tends to be concerned for the most part with practical financial and economic matters we must not lose sight of other issues which are vitally important in modern society.  Good environmental conditions are in more demand and are now more highly valued than ever before.  Many of the major financial provisions in the budget will have environmental and pollution implications.  Our physical environment is coming under increasing pressure as our population increases, towns expand and our economic development proceeds.  Industrial, agricultural and infrastructural developments can have far-reaching environmental consequences. A new sense of environmental responsibility is, therefore, necessary, from individuals, local communities, private and public bodies.  As Minister for the Environment I have the specific function of promoting the protection and improvement of the physical environment.</P>
    <P>The quality of the environment is a matter of direct concern to all of us and in recent years there has been an increasing public debate on many environmental issues.  I welcome the growth of public interest and involvement as an expression of the general concern to protect the good quality of our amenities and natural resources.  The public, after all, can be the best watchdog in such matters provided concern for the environment does not impose unreasonable conditions on legitimate development.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the continuing growth and expansion of economic activity in order to provide increased job opportunities for our people and raise the standard of living.  The resulting development, and other changes taking place in our society, such <Col N="845" /> as the growth and movement of population, the increasing trend to urban living, the increase in tourism and the demands for better recreational facilities, are increasing the pressures on the environment. We must ensure that we are in a position to deal with these pressures so that the quality of the environment does not suffer as a result.  We are fortunate that, despite some problem areas, we still have a very pleasant natural environment and the overall quality is high.</P>
    <P>The Government are taking steps to ensure that progress in economic and social improvements is not offset by a deterioration in environmental conditions. In particular, infrastructural services are being improved so that development will be facilitated without harming the environment.  This year, the Government are substantially increasing investment for this purpose.  In so far as my Department are concerned, I have already mentioned the significant increases in the level of finance being made available for housing, roads, water supply and sewerage facilities.  This expenditure will generate additional employment, encourage private investment, facilitate further development and help to ensure that environmental resources and amenities do not suffer.</P>
    <P>The State will continue to play a major part in funding investment and, indeed, in carrying out development.  This may be done through the local authorities, as in my Department, or through the activities of other State and semi-State organisations. A good standard in these developments, together with the physical planning and pollution controls on development generally will continue to play a significant part in determining the quality of our future environmental conditions. In this respect it is important that the needs of the environment must be given adequate consideration when investment decisions are being taken.  Such consideration will be greatly facilitated by a national environment policy, which I intend to develop.  The adoption of such a policy will be an important step in ensuring that our environment is protected for the future.  The environment council have recently prepared a report <Col N="846" /> on this subject which is being considered in my Department and I hope to be in a position to say more about it before long.</P>
    <P>The question of the disposal of toxic and dangerous waste has been prominent in recent times.  Such prominence is, indeed, fully justified by the importance of the subject.  I would like to assure the House that the question of the measures that can be taken to improve our capacity for dealing with this problem is under active consideration at present.  A team comprising experts from the IIRS, the Geological Survey Office and my Department have been studying the various options open for the disposal of dangerous wastes for the last few months.  I hope to have their report and to be in a position to consider these options very soon.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware I recently visited Denmark with some of my officials in order to observe at first hand the manner in which problem wastes are dealt with in that country.  I have no doubt that what I saw and learned there will be of value to us as we proceed to consider the arrangements that can best enable us to deal effectively with our own particular circumstances.  It is evident that local authorities will have an important part to play in the future arrangements to be made to ensure that industrial development and employment growth will not be impeded for want of an adequate and safe system for the accommodation of industrial wastes.</P>
    <P>I believe that the litter problem is our most widespread and inexcusable environmental problem.  The Environment Council have described the litter problem, rightly in my view, as &ldquo;a national scandal&rdquo;.  It is totally unnecessary because we carelessly create it ourselves. Its effects on our national image are devastating particularly when our visitors see recreational and scenic areas, and public places generally, littered with refuse of all descriptions.  We must convince people that litter is simply not acceptable.  A new community based awareness of benefits in keeping street and countryside clean, tidy and beautiful is required.  Litter is essentially a local problem and without the support and involvement of local communities the problem will never be <Col N="847" /> solved.  Local authorities are the prime custodians of the environment and they have a leading role to play in this task. By their leadership and encouragement much can be achieved locally by their efforts.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have made considerable efforts, including anti-litter campaigns, and at some considerable cost, to deal with the problem but generally to little effect.  Bord Fáilte ran a very commendable campaign last year. Young people are frequently blamed as the major cause of litter but even casual observation would show that many adults are just as blameworthy in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is need now for stronger and more co-ordinated action.  There are no easy answers and no instant solutions. Attention is being given in my Department to a number of anti-litter activities. The Litter Bill that I will shortly be introducing is one aspect of an important element in what will be a long term programme of action to deal with this problem.  I do not wish to go into detail about the Bill at this stage beyond stating that it will strengthen the powers for dealing with litter offenders and enable more effective arrangements to be made for controlling litter.  It will also provide for action on abandoned vehicles and unsightly accumulations of disused vehicles and other articles which can be an eyesore in many areas.</P>
    <P>Our pattern of behaviour and attitudes of indifference need to change and in the longer term an educational programme gives the best hope of improvement.  My Department are in consultation with the Department of Education on this matter at present.  Also, an anti-litter leaflet is being prepared in my Department, which I hope to have distributed widely at an early date.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that local authorities have been notified that I have determined 12 per cent to be the upper limit on increases in the rate in the pound to be struck by local authorities for 1981 over the rate in the pound struck by them for 1980.  This is the highest limit in any year since the burden of rates was removed from householders.  I think it <Col N="848" /> would be as well for me at this stage to spell out what the effects of this limit are.</P>
    <P>The most direct effect is on those people who pay rates, industrialists, shopkeepers, business people of all sorts and some farmers.  The upper limit means that on the same effective valuation as in 1980 a ceiling of 12 per cent is put on the maximum increase in their rates liability for 1981.  The actual increase in liability will depend on whatever increase within the 12 per cent limit is determined by each local authority.  I make no apology for taking action to limit the burden on ratepayers in this way.  Those who have criticised the limit as too low might well explain that what they are advocating is an increase in the burden on the industrialists, small shopkeepers, hoteliers and others who pay rates.</P>
    <P>A second main effect is that the limit helps to hold a reasonable balance between central and local expenditure. The cost of the removal of rates from dwellings, community halls, secondary schools and certain farm buildings is met by the Exchequer.  The upper limit on rate increases is a mechanism by which understandable aspirations of local authorities to improve and extend their ordinary day-to-day services is balanced against the cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most relevant aspect in the context of this debate, and the least understood, is the effect on local finance. Critics of the 12 per cent increase have represented it as a measure of the increase in local authority expenditure in 1981 as compared to 1980.  It is no such thing.  The 12 per cent is not in any way a measure of the extra money local authorities will have to spend for 1981. What local authorities have to spend in any year depends on a whole series of items, such as their capital allocations, income from direct charges, rents, housing loans repayments and so forth, State grants for a whole range of individual programmes, as well as the income from rates and from those State grants related directly to rates.  Of these only rates and the State grants directly related to rates, such as domestic rates relief and agricultural grant, are influenced by the rate limit.  But these account for only about <Col N="849" /> one third of the total capital and current spending of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Even this one-third is not limited by the 12 per cent.  Buoyancy of valuations which is about 3 per cent per annum for the whole country increases this part of local income before any rate increase is added.  The comparison between current expenditure of local authorities, leaving out capital altogether, and the rate limits shows how wrong it is to regard the upper rate limit as a measure of local authority expenditure.  Since we removed the burden of rates from householders, the cumulative maximum increase in rate limits has been 34 per cent.  This is made up of the 11 per cent for 1978, 10 per cent for 1979 and a further 10 per cent for 1980.  In the same period the total current expenditure of local authorities went up by 62 per cent.  The current expenditure of local authorities in 1977 was £317 million. The 62 per cent increase means that there has been a massive increase of almost £200 million in three years to bring the current spending of local authorities in 1980 up to £516 million.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat, this increase of nearly £200 million or 62 per cent in three years relates to current expenditure alone, and current expenditure gives only part of the picture.  If capital is taken into account, total expenditure of local authorities jumped from £439 million in 1977 to £744 million in 1980.  This is an increase of £305 million or 69 per cent in the same period when the cumulative increase in the rate limits was 34 per cent.</P>
    <P>These figures speak for themselves.  It may be useful though to take a single year.  To take 1980 alone &mdash; local authorities were able to budget in respect of 1980 for current spending of £516 million or £76 million, 18 per cent more than the previous year.</P>
    <P>In 1980, when current and capital spending are taken together, local authorities were able to budget for spending about £129 million more than in 1979, an increase of almost 21 per cent.  Yet in respect of 1980 the upper limit placed on the size of increases in the rate in the pound was 10 per cent.  The expenditure of local authorities, between current and <Col N="850" /> capital rose, not by 10 per cent, but by 21 per cent in 1980 over 1979.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from these facts that the upper limit of 12 per cent is not a measure of the extra money local authorities will have to spend in 1981.  Apart altogether from the decisions local authorities might take when they come to consider their rates estimates, the allocations already announced for road grants, capital for water and sewerage and housing will clear the way for an expansion in local services and employment.</P>
    <P>The one criticism which cannot validly be made for the main services such as roads, sanitary services, housing, and so on, for which I am responsible is that the funds provided are inadequate.  Yet my colleagues on the opposite side will make this criticism &mdash; a clear indication of how bereft they are of any worthwhile ideas. However, before making this type of ridiculous criticism they would do well to look back at their own abysmal record when in office.</P>

      <P>The present budget represents a milestone for roads and sanitary services especially and will clearly be seen in the future as such.  I make no apology for again putting on record, as I did in debates in this House in October and December last, the firm commitment of the Government and myself to ensuring the continued development and wellbeing of the building industry, to ensuring the continuance of a high level of house completions and to ensuring the implementation of an expanded programme of roads works and sanitary services in order to further stimulate economic development and employment.</P>

      <P>I will say for Fianna Fáil that in their worst days down through the years they could always get somebody to come into this House and bluff and bluff and tell all sorts of stories in the expectation that somebody might believe them.  Following the 1977 election manifesto <Col N="851" /> very few people are prepared to believe Fianna Fáil's bluff.</P>
      <P>If there had been no reduction in the value of money over the years the Minister for the Environment, who is just leaving the House, would be doing a remarkable job.  However, not only has inflation gone wild, but we have had a devaluation of the punt to the tune of 25 per cent.  The Minister must think the Irish people are a lot of morons if he believes they will accept what he has said this evening as being factual.  As we all had in Government, he has very good script-writers and I give him all the credit in the world for the way in which he read the script.  I would not blame him for leaving the House as quickly as he could after he finished, because the figures he has given must be related to what the county engineers said a few months ago: unless there was expenditure of an additional £20 million on the roads of Ireland in 1980, approximately £20 billion would be required to rebuild the Irish roads if they were left in that condition for another winter.</P>
      <P>I do not know anybody else who travelled around the country in the storm last night but I did, and I did not realise how bad the roads were until I discovered there was water all over the place.  The pools of water were easy to see.  The surface of the roads, not only the county roads but the national secondary and primary roads, seems to be completely broken up.  The money the Minister talked about is less than what was being spent on roads when I left office and this means we will have to continue with a very poor road surface at least until Fianna Fáil leave office.</P>
      <P>It may be considered good politics to promise to do wonderful things in the knowledge that those promises will not have to be kept, and knowing that the people making the promises will not have to carry them out.  That is the only salvation I see for Fianna Fáil.  The Government who introduced this budget had no imagination, and the way in which they dealt with ordinary budgetary matters showed that they were not very interested in their effect on the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> The Minister for Finance told us he was introducing a budget which would be acceptable to the people.  I have been knocking about for quite some time and I have been in politics for a good while and I never heard such an outcry against a budget as I heard over the past few days.  The only person I heard saying a good word for the budget was an old age pensioner.  This was an old lady who thought she was not doing too badly until her neighbour reminded her that she was now paying £4.60 a bag for two bags of coal she was buying each week.  The first old lady got black in the face and she was nearly as black as the coal before she finished.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on simple matters connected with road maintenance has gone through the roof.  For example, a few years ago it was possible to buy a signpost for a few pounds.  The cost of a sign now is over £20 and the post itself costs another £13 or £14, and that does not include the cost of labour.  I was amused listening to the Minister for the Environment talking about his interest in road workers.  I can claim priority because, for 30 years, I have been attempting to get road workers into a position where they could live on what they were getting and that when they were leaving they would get some recompense for their long service.</P>
    <P>This year for the first time in many years men who were employed on road work for a long time have been told there was no work for them.  That was not the right expression.  The work was there but there was no money to pay them.  A number of county council officials told me that in their areas they had plenty of work to be done, and they had the staff but, if they kept on the staff, they would not have the money to buy the materials, and if they bought the materials they would have to let some of the staff go.  This is the result of three-and-a-half years of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for the Environment talking about local government affairs.  I paid him a compliment and said I felt that he would fight hard for local government, but there is no point in <Col N="853" /> trying to fight hard when the situation is that approximately 80 per cent of the income of local authorities last year had to be earmarked for wages and salaries. The Minister said they were able to spend 21 per cent more than the previous year although they got only 10 per cent.  On that basis the 12 per cent this year would enable them to spend 3 per cent more.</P>
    <P>There is no local authority that is not up to its ears in debt.  Is the Minister aware that every local authority owes not thousands, not hundreds of thousands, but millions of pounds?  They had to overspend to get jobs done and they were promised money for housing.  Do the Government understand that they have almost wrecked the country and that we are fast reaching the stage where we can be compared to Israel where the rate of inflation can go up to 100 per cent?  It is most remarkable that people can come into the House and tell us everything in the garden is rosy.  Either they do not know the situation or they are telling stories that are not correct.</P>
    <P>How are those wishing to be housed by local authorities dealt with?  If a sum of £5,000 was coming into a house, not just being paid to one person, no matter how badly housed those people were they would not be entitled to be rehoused.  In 1973 I took over the Department after a two year rent strike by local authority tenants under a Fianna Fáil Government. I got a reasonable agreement and we had peace with them.  Before the last election NATO met Fianna Fáil who promised them solemnly they would honour the agreement made with me in 1973.  This year the Government threw it overboard, they refused to negotiate with them but told them the rents they would be charged.  The Government did not ask them what they thought nor did they try to seek a compromise.  I heard the Minister for the Environment saying that the rents were as low as 15p a week.  They were in my time but there is no such thing now.  Everyone, even those living on the edge of poverty, are paying from £3 and £4 a week upwards.  A Government who do that have no respect for their own word nor for the unfortunate people who are unable to buy houses for themselves. <Col N="854" /> The rents being charged are too high and it will take a change of Government to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Those who were refused housing were told they could build their own and that they would be given a loan of up to £12,000.  However, a person with an income of more than £105 a week does not qualify for an SDA loan while a person earning below that figure only gets a loan in proportion to his income.  In 1977 a three-bedroomed house cost £13,000 but today it is well over £27,000.  We know how useful a £12,000 loan is even if people get it.</P>
    <P>A person who applied for a loan was given a letter stating the amount of the loan he qualified for.  On the strength of the letter a lot of people got bridging finance from banks to enable them to build their houses.  They and the bank were under the impression that when the house was finished the loan would be forthcoming from the local authority. Around June last local authorities tumbled to it that they were not getting money.  I know of one local authority who were looking for £2½ million and got slightly under £1¼ million over the full year.  Those on bridging finance found they were unable to pay the rest of the money and they were paying interest of between 17 and 18 per cent on the bridging loan.  The result was that several people had to dispose of their houses and were left literally on the road.  In June local authorities sent out circulars to applicants stating that their application had been received and they would be allocated £X if money became available. Some local authorities, not Dublin city or Cork city, have as many as 500 people on their list who have been half-promised SDA loans for which no money was given last year and none will be given this year if my guess is right.  It was promised because there is an election in the offing. The Department increased the income limit and the amount of the loan but they did not increase the amount of money given to local authorities.  A person with a £12,000 SDA loan will pay £33 a week for the next 30 years.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 grant, which Deputy Lynch said last year could be used as a deposit <Col N="855" /> on a house, is not paid until the house is completed.  I had a letter from a person who has been living in his house for one and a half years and still has not got his grant.  If a person is lucky enough to get a £12,000 loan and £1,000 grant he still has to find the rest of the £27,000.  Some people have gone to great lengths to borrow the money, and I am sorry for them. I cannot see them being in a position to repay the loan.  We have reached the situation where, with the odd exception, young people getting married will never own their own house unless they are willed it.  The Government are doing nothing to help such people.</P>
    <P>Building societies are doing a lot and, for all their faults, have helped many people.  They do not have an endless amount of money, although some people do not appreciate that.  The assets of a building society, which they may advertise to show how strong they are, are tied up in people's houses.  If anyone wanted to realise on the assets they would have to sell out a lot of people.  When I took over the Department in 1973 the building societies were operating under an Act which had been passed through the British Parliament at the end of the last century. I brought them into this century and into the situation that they are now in a position to get pension funds.  When the disastrous joining of the EMS took place one thing it did was bring back money to the country from Britain.  Many people invested it in building societies.  They can only do that once.  That money was spent and is not there now.</P>
    <P>The building societies have been messing around for some time.  That is one of the things I regret not having dealt with in that Bill because there should be a regulation as to the qualifications for a loan.  One building society this week will say that applicants should have a deposit of £1,000 with them for six months but the following week it may be £2,500 for two years and later it may be £1,000 for 18 months.  Although the regulations are pretty strict I am not too happy that all the money building societies get is being used for the purpose it was intended for, the building of houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Last year when the interest rates were too high the Government followed my example and introduced a subsidy.  That operated for a while but the Government were quick to withdraw.  When they were in Opposition they told us that the rates were too high but they do not find anything wrong with people having to pay a much higher rate when they are in office. In fact, they withdrew their subsidy and that situation continues.  This year the situation in relation to housing will be very bleak.  This morning I heard a representative of the construction industry congratulating the Government on their investment in housing.</P>

      <P>It did not upset me when I was Minister for Local Government that the same person spent a lot of his time abusing me and does not upset me now. It must be straw that will be used in building the houses because Cement Limited say they are not selling cement. I do not know what is happening.  The Government are not giving the money to local authorities and the building societies will have less available than they had last year.  The money the Government say will be made available for building has not been provided for and for that reason I wonder where the money the gentleman in the construction industry said will be available is to come from. The fact that some of the builders&amp; lsquo;suppliers are laying off workers does not bear out what that gentleman said.  It is possible that within the next few months when the Government have got their just reward we will be able to assess the true position.  When Fianna Fáil are in Opposition they will suddenly discover that the building industry is not going well but they will then blame us for what they did not do when in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the fire service because it requires a lot of extra money.  I do not see why the <Col N="857" /> insurance companies, on whose behalf the fire service works as much as for the general public, should not pay some of the cost.  After all, the more that is saved by the fire service the more such companies benefit.  It is time something definite was done about that.  Many of the water and sewerage schemes the Minister said he sanctioned have been awaiting approval since shortly after I left office. In fact, some of them were approved before I left but so far the money has not come through.  One scheme in my constituency which was to be completed in stages annually is tied up now and I do not think it will be completed until the Government are put out of office.</P>
    <P>Water and sewerage grants are not available and there is no point in the Minister telling us that there will be a big development on that front because the money is not there.  There is a lot of talk about protecting our countryside and preventing effluent destroying our rivers and streams but since the foundation of the State sufficient money was not spent on the installation of proper sewerage schemes in our big towns and cities.  We made a brilliant start and it is a pity that effort was not continued.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about litter but I am sure he is aware that this city and the remainder of the country have got tatty again.  The Minister said that money is available to tackle the problem of litter but he is aware that many local authorities had to suspend their litter collections because of lack of money.  Some had to reduce weekly collections to fortnightly and, in fact, some had to cease the collections altogether.  One area in my constituency had to change the litter collection to fortnightly instead of weekly and had to cease commercial litter collections. It was surprising against that backround to hear the Minister tell of the big improvements that will take place in the litter collection.  He told us he intended introducing a new Bill to deal with litter and spoke of the many walls that were defaced.  When I was in office I asked local authorities to clean such walls. There is no reason why they should not. There is no reason why, because some moron wants to write slogans on such <Col N="858" /> walls, we should allow signs about H Blocks, the IRA and many other things of little relevance, to remain.  Recently I asked a local engineer if his local authority had ever thought of cleaning local road signs which could not be read because they were covered with mud and I am glad to report that a start has been made on that work in my area.</P>
    <P>There was a comment on the question of driving while drunk.  It is a problem and while a lot of people have been prosecuted a lot seem to be enjoying this.  I do not know how it is that so many people are allowed to drive motor vehicles while under the influence of drink.  That law should be tightened up.  I am aware that the amount that can legally be consumed by a driver is far greater than in other countries but we do not appear to mind that.  People will continue to drive around while under the influence until something is done about this.</P>
    <P>During a discussion on the Bill dealing with malicious injury I mentioned that something should be done about stolen cars.  Those cars are either crashed or abandoned after windows have been broken and objects stolen from them.  In this city there is a section of the Garda to deal with stolen cars and one would imagine that if that section was notified that a car had been abandoned, or was crashed along a road, it would be moved but that is not the case.  We have come to accept that a car which is abandoned in an area is fair game for those without much conscience to take apart piece by piece.  The wreck is left spoiling the countryside.  It happens in Dublin a lot.  The Minister for Justice should consider asking the Garda to be a little more active in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister the number of road fatalities and accidents dropped last year.  That is good news.  This year we are likely to have a further drop but it will not be because people are driving any better.  If the Government continue to increase the tax on petrol as they have been doing I am sure they will successfully prevent people from driving at all.</P>
    <P>Also there is reference in the budget to what they call the registration fee on cars. I remember before the last general election <Col N="859" /> cars going around with stickers on them saying, &ldquo;After Fianna Fáil are elected we will pay no more tax&rdquo;.  Good for them, but what they did not know was that a rose by another name would smell just as sweet.  So when the election was over they did not pay road tax but they did pay what was called by Fianna Fáil a registration fee of £5 the first year doubled to £10 the next year, doubled to £20 this year.  If Fianna Fáil are there I wonder what it will be next year.  The reason why it is called a registration fee instead of road tax is that the road tax went into the road fund and the potholes in the roads were in the main filled by people who were employed out of money from the road fund.  Therefore, if there is no road tax there is no road fund and the £20 will go now into a different fund altogether.</P>
    <P>Talking about potholes, I was coming up the road the other day to Dublin and I saw something which was a very good idea.  It must be the local authority who did it.  The red and white cones which the Garda use when there has been an accident and they want to close off the area were beside the bigger potholes on that road.</P>

      <P>I am aware that from time to time people have broken axles and one person I know got rather a serious injury through getting a puncture going into a pothole and crashing into the side of the ditch.  We have reached the stage where we may forget about roads being repaired at all.  One thing that annoys me, particularly driving along a narrow road, is to find somebody driving in the middle of the road.  In fact I think everybody does it.  People dare not go to the side of the road because the sides are all gone and so they drive in the middle of the road and that is an extra hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is reference to an additional sum of £35 million which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in some peculiar way is going to produce in the next few weeks as his share of the budget.  I suppose <Col N="860" /> that £35 million means extra on letters, phone calls, installation of phones and so on.  We might get a little service with regard to the phones because I have complained again and again in this House about phones even in this House.  With the phone in room 116 upstairs where I am it is impossible to get a call out without getting at least three wrong numbers. It is ludicrous that a Minister of any Government should go around the country telling everybody about the wonderful things he is doing for the telephone service while the existing phones cannot be made to work.  Three people were with me today.  One of them is a Post Office employee and his phone is out of order and he cannot get anything done with it. Another is the General Secretary of NATO and he has not been able to use his phone for two months.  They came out and looked at it and that was all.  The other person has not had a phone for several weeks.  I had phone calls from factories in my area a few weeks ago. Usually the story is that something has gone wrong with an underground cable. While this is going on we are told by the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, that he had 62,000 last year and this year he is going to have 80,000 and he is going to flood the place with phones.  Shortly we will be able to go into Woolworths and buy a phone for a couple of pence and bring it home and stick it into something and I suppose we will get as good a service as we are getting now.</P>
    <P>With regard to letters the service we get from P &amp; T is pretty good but I notice particularly around Christmas that a lot of people stopped sending the usual greetings.  They just could not afford it. Many people tell me that they cannot afford the money.  People phone me and say that postage is so expensive.  We can kill the goose that lays the golden eggs and the Minister and the Government are going a very long way towards doing that.</P>
    <P>One peculiar thing in the documents which we got before the budget concerns social welfare.  If my figuring is correct there is a very substantial reduction in the amount of money being made available for social welfare.  More peculiar <Col N="861" /> still, there is a reduction of about £700,000 in the post and telephone bill for that Department.  If I add the two together I assume that an attempt is being made to tell us that not alone will people not be able to get the money which they are entitled to &mdash; and God knows some of them are finding it hard enough to get it now &mdash; but the telephone service and particularly the postal service will be curtailed so much that many letters fewer will be sent out with their money.  If they are the letters which are sent out to people who apply for social welfare and the reminders, that would be all right.  One man applied a few weeks ago.  He had 40 years unbroken service and he sent in his certificates, four in four successive weeks, and then he got a UB15 which he was supposed to fill up and send back. He did not get any money although he had 40 years' continuous insurance with the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I met a woman whose husband had died 12 months earlier. She had two children and she could not get her widow's pension.  Eventually she got the widow's pension and was told that no arrears were due to her.  After a lot of trouble with the Department they paid her eventually when severe pressure was put on them.  She was paid in Christmas week and the amount of arrears due to that poor woman was £1,800 and it should have been paid from nearly two years earlier.  I am not blaming the Department officials.  The people who are to blame are the people who sit on those benches over there.  There must be an arrangement whereby there will not be an excessive draw on what they used to call long ago the fund.  If too much money is taken out there will not be money enough to pay for other things such as executive jets.  The result is that many people have complained to me. Today I have had about ten complaints from various people who are social welfare recipients.  Some of them were paid for a few weeks and then payment stopped.  Some people did not get it at all.  All right, when I write to the Department these people will be paid, but it should not be necessary for a Member of this House or anyone else to have to write <Col N="862" /> to the Department to get these people what they are entitled to.  These people are entitled to their money and again I believe it is not the workers in the Department who are responsible here.  I believe that it happens because they are told to do things in a certain way.</P>
    <P>We have not yet been able to find out, though I am sure we will know shortly, whether the additional PRSI and the additional income tax allowance which they are supposed to get will balance out or whether it will be found, as most people say, that they will be getting less in their week's pay package, until the next wage increase comes along, than they were getting before the budget.  I imagine that that is what the score will be, but it is just too bad that people at the bottom of the ladder seem to get caught every time when these things come along.</P>
    <P>The Minister for social Welfare is also Minister for Health and we have similar complaints from the health boards, who say that they have not nearly enough money and they will have to cut drastically the benefits which people are getting from them.  Some of them have been cut fairly tightly over the last couple of years but it appears as if they are going to be cut now, and the wonderful hospitals and so on which they were promised in the sweet by and by are very slow in coming. We are told that money is not made available in this year's capital programme for certain hospitals which were planned and sung about over the last couple of years. Today I heard what I thought was the last word.  Certain repairs were being done to a hospital and there was not enough money to finish the work so somebody did a whip-around and collected £5 each from the nurses.  Did you ever hear anvthing like that in your life, having to collect money from employees?  The next thing will be that somebody will get on to a bus and collect from the CIE driver and conductor to pay for the running of CIE.  The health services have been deteroriating and no effort is being made to bring them up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether the farmers did well or not, as I see it, having been born and reared in the country, the farmers <Col N="863" /> have got very little help and a great deal of promises.  If somebody in the EEC decides to do things in a certain way perhaps the farmers will come out all right; if not, the farmers will get nothing out of it.  Fianna Fáil succeeded in getting away for a long time with their belief that something promised was better than something given.  I do not think that will work again.  So long as the promise was there, there were people who felt that they might do better.  So, if the Taoiseach, as I believe he is, is preparing to go to the Park in the near future his promise that the Minister for Agriculture through certain people in the EEC will be able to help the farmers considerably later in the year is expected to work.  I do not believe it will: the signs are that the EEC will yield very little extra for farmers. Nobody knows this better than the farmers.  They had a couple of good years, but they needed them.</P>
    <P>I shall never forget two days before the election attending a meeting of 300 or 400 farmers in the company of those who were representing the constituency along with me.  Fianna Fáil representatives were then prepared to tell them that they would not interfere with the taxation system and certainly would not interfere with rates on agricultural land, which the Government have done away with completely, have added on and done away with again.  I do not know what the next move will be.  The suggestion they are making now is only for 12 months anyway. They were told then that the valuation liable for tax would not be interfered with nor would they interfere with the system of collecting tax.  They were very definite about that and waved the manifesto saying: We have written it down; you can see there what we propose to do.  We know what they did, and nobody better than the farmers.</P>
    <P>As one who lived all his life in a country district and who negotiated with farmers in good times and bad for farm workers, I can say that when farmers had the means they paid and when they had not it was very difficult to get anything from them.  Now I fear we are reaching a time when the only way farmers will be able <Col N="864" /> to keep going is to let workers go.  I saw such times before, saw workers being let off because the farmers felt it was the only way they could survive.  Farm workers are still underpaid.  They must be experts now to work on a farm.  They must know crop rotation and everything about running machinery and how to repair it if something goes wrong.  While they have never been properly paid I claim to have been responsible for improving their lot very substantially through trade union action, but it now looks as if many of them will find it very difficult to keep their jobs as things are going.</P>
    <P>Farm workers who are getting on in years are not eligible for State employment. Men of 45 and over know that many of them may never see a job again &mdash; a terrible thought.  At the last count we had a register of 122,000 unemployed not counting those on short time.  It is not long ago since Deputy Jack Lynch said that any Government that could not keep unemployment under 100,000 should not stay in office.  I am sure he meant it then &mdash; he got out anyway.  Perhaps he meant the whole lot should go and he was trying to keep his word.  I agree that there are 30,000 or 40,000 people who have not worked for a long time and may not be able to continue in employment even if they got it.  There should be a special register for them and they should be paid in a different way.  Leaving that aside, no effort has been made in the budget to produce the kind of money and ideas that would generate employment for people who, despite what may be said about them, would much prefer to be be working than drawing the dole or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>There is a myth particularly among young industrialists, people who got sizeable grants and were unable to succeed in many cases, who talk about the country going to the dogs because of all the people getting the dole, as they say.  I have had to remind them many times that they got money from the State as a handout while the people drawing unemployment benefit get it because they and their colleagues stamped cards to provide against hard times.  We still have so many unemployed <Col N="865" /> that I do not know if ever, certainly hardly in my lifetime, we will see anything like full employment.  Despite the microchip it seems that we are going farther and farther away from that ideal.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government appreciate the mess they have put the country into.  I heard the Minister for the Environment talk about&rdquo; when they did away with rates&ldquo; and I want to put on record again that Fianna Fáil did not do away with rates.  They talked about it but did not do it; we did it and they just carried on.  The record stands, no matter what they say.  Perhaps we should not have taken them all away or done it in a different way, but we did it.  When we have the type of thinking evidenced during the week by the new Minister for Labour, who talked aloud to some pressmen, we are in a dangerous position.  I remember the early days of Fianna Fáil and when I came to this House they had been in and out of office for many years.  They were not men of very high intellect; one or two perhaps could be so described but they were men of integrity who really believed that the country came first and they were really intent on doing something for the country.  When I look at the Front Bench now and try to compare I find there is really a big change.  It appears that what we have now is a group of people who will look after themselves and to hell with anybody else.</P>
    <P>We have redundancies and the three-day week with many factories closing down.  Even in Drogheda last week three big factories went on a three-day week. This is a terrible prospect for people who thought they were secure in employment. Yes, Fianna Fáil will talk about the 1,000 jobs about to be provided somewhere else in the area in a couple of months. That is usual and it is also usual to talk of job potential, not a job.  There is a great difference.  One hundred potential jobs may mean 15 actual jobs and they may not even last very long.</P>
    <P>We have meat factories closing down. This in my opinion is caused by Government bungling because we have people from Northern Ireland prepared to offer up to £100 per beast more for cattle than the local factories can offer.  Is it any <Col N="866" /> wonder our factories are closing?  Something must be done.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked today about foreign potatoes being imported.  Last year I saw foreign potatoes being sold in a plastic bag with &rdquo;Foras Talúntais&ldquo; stamped on it.  Perhaps somebody pulled a &rdquo;fast one&ldquo; but if Foras Talúntais lend assistance to that kind of thing, it is wrong.  I asked the Minister to investigate it and I hope he will.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get Irish grown vegetables and I blame the farmers and horticulturists for much of this.  I do not think they are doing their job.  If they were there would be plenty of Irish vegetables on sale.  Perhaps it is easier for them to deal with other aspects of farming. The Government should encourage them to produce home grown vegetables and potatoes.</P>
    <P>Some moments ago I spoke about the value of the punt.  It is noticeable that of the stocks in supermarkets about 80 per cent comprises British goods.  A short time after we joined the EMS our currency started to slip.  When we tried to draw attention to this I distinctly remember Ministers saying in this House that it was a very good thing, that a drop in the value of the Irish £ gave us an edge on the British market.  Our currency went down and down and now it is more than 25p under value as compared with the £ sterling.  A few days ago our £ went up by nearly 1p and they nearly lit bonfires in RTE.  It was mentioned two or three times when the news and the news headlines were announced.  Either it was good for the country when the value of our currency dropped or it was good for the country when it went up.  We cannot have it both ways.  It is bad enough that we have to pay additional money for foreign goods but when the drop of 25p does not give us an edge on the British market it is obvious that something is wrong with the management of the country.  Something must be wrong when we cannot take advantage of that.  It is a devaluation of our £ to the tune of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The State operates a very expensive scheme encouraging people to but Irish goods and I am 100 per cent behind that. A person who does not buy Irish goods <Col N="867" /> when he can do so is entirely wrong.  In my view it is a certain type of snobbery to go for foreign goods when Irish goods are available.  People who do this are making a mistake and they should not be allowed to do so.  I will give an instance to the House.  The carpet industry is in a parlous state but recently RTE, after consulting the Irish Goods Council, purchased carpet tiles in Holland.  I do not know what to make of the mentality of people who do that.</P>
    <P>In my area a school that was started four or five years ago was finished last year.  When the children returned to school after the holidays they were given a leaflet that contained a photograph of children sitting at similar desks.  It was pointed out to the children how important it was to encourage people to buy Irish goods, that this would have a major influence on whether they got jobs when they left school.  Yet, when the school was being carpeted it was French carpets that were used.  What can one make of people who do such things?  I am sorry the Minister of State is occupying the place of another Minister to whom I would have liked to say these things because it was the Office of Public Works who supplied the carpet.  Is there any sense in an Irish Government Department preaching to people to buy Irish and then going abroad themselves to purchase items that could be bought 20 miles away in Navan where there is one of the best carpet factories in the country?  Perhaps the Office of Public Works wanted to have French carpets but, God knows, the children would not have objected to Irish carpets.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister for Education today one got the impression that the Government were spending millions of pounds on building schools.  I was glad to see him figure in the local papers recently.  He seems to spend most of his time opening schools in Cavan and Monaghan and good luck to him.  He says he is going to build a technical school in Kingscourt &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  The strange thing is that the children of that area are going to an excellent technical school at Nobber but that school is not large enough and <Col N="868" /> agreement has been reached with the Department for the erection of additional rooms.  Two years ago that project was to start &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;&mdash; if the &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; in the case of Kingscourt school means the same thing I would not advise the people of that area to start dancing in the streets for a while.  Similarly, Kells was to have a new technical school; it was sanctioned but that was the end of it.  The same situation applies with regard to Trim.  It is impossible to get money from the Department.  They are not spending the money that is necessary.  Unless we can put enough money into primary, vocational and secondary school levels, there is no point in talking about universities.</P>
    <P>Even in 1981 some 60 per cent to 70 per cent of pupils do not go further than secondary school level.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a row &mdash; one of the numerous rows in which the Minister for Education has been involved &mdash; regarding the appointment of temporary teachers. The manager and the parent-teacher group asked to meet him but I understand he said he would not.  That was very foolish.  In our kind of democracy the Minister should have met those people and discussed matters with them.  He cannot always be right.  Some people have the impression that they must always be right but the Minister is all wrong if he thinks that is the case.  I ask him to reconsider his attitude.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister of State who is present now some questions regarding Garda stations.  First he would not answer me; he said the Office of Public Works were responsible only for the shell of the stations.  Then he said the Department of Justice were responsible.  I have been looking through the Estimates and I have not seen provision for additional money for this item.  A number of Garda stations throughout the country are a disgrace &mdash; they require furniture, repair and painting.  Somebody should take the job in hand and do what is necessary.</P>
    <P>This Government have not made an effort to deal with prices.  Even in the budget they ignored the fact that people have less purchasing power now and this affects wage earners particularly.  This will go very strongly against them when <Col N="869" /> they go to the polls.  The Government should, in conjunction with the Central Bank, attempt to do something about the púnt.  People who saved all their lives, when money was hard to get, are trying to live on the few pounds saved.  Some have invested it and some are attempting to eke it out as best they can.  These people are suffering very badly as a result of this Government's failure to protect their interests.  Having looked at all the aspects of Government which I have had time to do tonight, and having studied the budget, particularly the capital budget, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one salvation for this country, that is for the Taoiseach to seek a new mandate.  If he does not, and stays in office much longer, he will create here a situation which will be impossible for any Government to rectify for a long number of years.  My advice to the Taoiseach would be: in God's name go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider, having regard to the present times, that this is a truly excellent budget.  The main thrust of criticism which I have heard around the House, from the Opposition benches and generally, is at 15p on the gallon of petrol.  Apart from that, general public satisfaction has been expressed at the increases in social welfare allowances, particularly to old age pensioners, widows and people on long-term benefits, not to mention those on short-term benefits and the unemployed.  However, I read in the newspapers more critical comment of what is not in the budget and which should have been than what is in the budget, particularly in relation to what I consider to be the lack of a warm welcome by the media in general to the social welfare increases.  These have been given a welcome of a sort but not the welcome that the majority of our people gave them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments time after time have introduced increases in the social welfare categories far beyond anything ever envisaged or granted by any other Government in this State.  The mealy-mouthed criticism of the budget by the Labour Party in particular &mdash; and the more left they are the more anti-budget <Col N="870" /> they are &mdash; is disappointing.  I would have thought that the likes of Deputy Dr. Browne would have welcomed the budget-by saying that, whatever else he did not like about it, he liked the increases in the social welfare allowances. Instead, they took the line that it was far beyond what we can afford in present times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully has described RTE as lighting bonfires because the púnt has increased by 1p against the English pound.  The point here is that RTE in particular, but the media generally, always equate the drop of the púnt against sterling.  They never say that European currencies dropped further against sterling on the markets.  What is happening is that all the EMS currencies are dropping against the pound sterling. Everyone here knows the problems which this is creating in Britain.  It is causing tremendous unemployment because of the uncompetitiveness of British products as against other EEC currencies.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister is following a very unpopular policy of housekeeping, cleaning out a lot of unprofitable industries. Good industries are also going, but mainly industries which would go over the years in any case.  She considers it a good housekeeping drive.  Whether it works or not remains to be seen at the next British election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think this is good housekeeping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that it remained to be seen whether or not this policy will work.  When the next British election comes in the next year or so we shall see whether or not it worked. We must remember that what is good for Britain is good for us and what is bad for Britain can be bad for us in the long term. We want a strong economy in Britain because 43 per cent of our exports go to that country and we want them to be in a position to buy our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question about it, were we still tied to sterling we could double the number of people on the employment register.  That has been to our advantage. <Col N="871" /> We are still approximately in the middle of the European basket of currencies.  We are still holding our own against other European currencies.  What grieves me are the attacks of unpatriotic people in this House and in this country who all the time try to make other countries lose confidence in our ability to work our way through a recession when we are doing that far better than other EEC countries. We have heard recently about the big problems being experienced by West Germany, which was the most powerful economy in the EEC.  We are getting through.  In the last three years we have created more jobs than in any similar times since the State was founded and in the face of continuing world recession. We are continuing to build up our industrial arm at a tremendous rate.  When this recession is eventually over we will be one of the fastest growing, fastest moving countries in the EEC, make no mistake about that.  We will have those words on the record of this House to haunt the Deputies who keep pointing the finger at Fianna Fáil and telling them that everything is going wrong.</P>
    <P>Right through the Minister's Financial Statement one can see the improvements being made &mdash; small savings are up, the money being put into building societies is increasing, the job creation programme is going ahead.  To listen to Opposition Deputies one would think that everything was crumbling around our feet.  We are doing pretty well in the face of present problems.  How many of the 80,000 people working in the new jobs created by Fianna Fáil lost their jobs during the Coalition Government?  These people will not forget that, although the Coalition have forgotten.  The coalition of Labour and Fine Gael has never been anything but that, in spite of what people say.  I have always said that Governments are rejected, not elected.  There is no way that the people of this country want another Coalition back for many a year, until again, as has happened before, the damage they have done to this country is forgotten.</P>
    <P>Fíanna Fáil have always recognised the great importance to our economy of the <Col N="872" /> building industry.  It has been slumping slightly, but Fíanna Fáil are taking remedial action to get it back to what it was and will continue along this road.  The building industry will receive large inputs of capital from the Government's capital investment programme.  The Construction Industry Federation welcomed the investment programme and were pooh-poohed and laughed at by Deputy Tully. Most of our work force get their employment through the building industry and Fíanna Fáil recognise the importance of the building industry.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1981. - Private Members' Business: Youth Employment: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, seriously concerned about the increasing number of young persons who will be seeking work in mid-1981, calls on the Government to review urgently and introduce adequate job creation schemes for youth employment.</P>
      <P>To this motion the Minister for Labour has put down an amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;approves of the policies of the Government for stimulating the creation of employment for young persons and is confident that the Government will keep the operation of these policies under continuous review.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I intend briefly to deal with the Government amendment because it does not deserve extended consideration. It is basically the minimum possible amendment the Government could have put down in order not to have to vote against the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be amused, if it were not such a serious matter, at the latter part of the Government's amendment, &ldquo;that the Government will keep the operation of these policies under continuous review&rdquo;. Unfortunately all of us are familiar with <Col N="873" /> what the Government mean when they say they are keeping something under review.  It means they will not do anything at all about it.  Members of the House who are concerned particularly with social and other such matters have received letters from Ministers or Departments, notably from Posts and Telegraphs, and they know the results.</P>
    <P>I hope to show to the satisfaction of the House first of all the extent of the problem we are now dealing with and, second, the inadequacy of the Government response to that problem.  I hope to sketch some proposals not for a solution but for a more positive and practical way to meet the problem.  The first thing we have to do is to try to estimate the size of the problem.  In a labour survey in 1975 it was indicated that there was then an unemployment rate of 44 per cent or thereabouts among young people.  Since then, it is true to say there has been some criticism of the findings of that survey but to say that the problem is not that great does not mean that it is not a great problem. It is a great problem, one which has persisted under this Government.</P>
    <P>We have the advantage of a new quarterly age analysis of the live register now being published by the CSO.  The latest one, dated 17 October 1980, refers to people on the live register on 18 January and 18 April 1980.  On the latter date, the most recent we have, there were 20,439 young people up to the age of 24 looking for work.  They represented virtually a quarter of all those looking for work at that time.  Therefore, 22 per cent of all those looking for work then were aged between 15 or 16 and 24 years.  What the figures do not tell us unfortunately is the percentage of the total labour force those 20,500 forms, and if the Minister for Labour has that information we would be grateful to him for it.</P>
    <P>This represents a very serious situation because it indicates that there are not just 20,500 looking for work but that between 18 April last and 1 September 1981 that 20,500 figure will have been swollen by the numbers leaving school, with or without qualifications, who will be looking for work for the first time.  When we look more closely at the figure, the regional <Col N="874" /> aspect is worth investigating.  For instance, the figures tend to show that of those under 20 years looking for employment on 18 April last, 37 per cent lived in the eastern planning region.  I think we can accept that the problem of youth unemployment is particularly acute in the eastern region.  The extent of youth unemployment in the eastern region is probably greater than the proportion of the work force which actually resides there.</P>
    <P>We also have to take into account the fact that the live register for various reasons understates the numbers of those looking for work.  Those of us who in our constituency work deal with unemployment benefit and assistance cases know very well that for the average teenager living at home there is a series of disincentives to sign on for unemployment assistance.  A means test is applied to young people who live at home to such an extent that what they are offered when they sign on at employment exchanges a couple of times a week would not pay the bus fares to get them in and back.  They simply do not show up, they have been squeezed off the live register.</P>
    <P>I suggest it would be a conservative estimate to say that the underestimation of these age groups in the unemployment statistics is probably as high as 33? per cent.  Therefore, we can talk with some confidence of a base level of youth employment of the order of 30,000.  It is to this level that we must add the school leavers of 1980 and 1981.  The sad fact is that this is not a transitory phenomenon but looks set fair to be one of the most intractable economic and social problems not just here but in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>A publication by the Council of European National Youth Committees for 1977-78 noted that at that time &mdash; things have not got much better &mdash; 17 million people were registered as unemployed in the 24 OECD member states.  That figure represented 5.3 per cent of the labour force.  The important thing is that 41 per cent, or almost half, were under 25 years of age despite the fact that this age group comprised only 22 per cent of the active population.  In other words, in the OECD <Col N="875" /> countries, which represent a fairly broad spread of economic activity, young people are represented in the unemployment statistics twice as heavily as one would expect them to be, given the proportion they form of the total population and of the labour force.  The Council commented:</P>
    <P>There is an increasing amount of evidence that youth unemployment is no passing cyclical phenomenon. There is growing recognition that in many respects youth unemployment is basically a structural problem aggravated by cyclical factors.  This implies the need for more effective long-term actions than have so far been undertaken if the problem is to be solved rather than alleviated.</P>
    <P>That is the base line.  Let us look at the situation as it has developed since then. We can take the recently published White Paper on Education as a guide and assume fairly accurately that approxiamately 50,000 17-year-olds would have been coming on the labour market last year and something similar this year.</P>
    <P>This represents the best part of 100,000 young people who will be showing up in the live register statistics when they are published.  My indications are that the figure last year was 54,000 and this summer 57,000 young people will be coming on to the labour market for the first time and looking for jobs.  Equally we could argue that this rate of young people coming on to the labour market will continue for the foreseeable future.  We have the fastest growing youth population in Europe and our sluggish approach to the problem of unemployment in general, and youth unemployment in particular, does not offer any great hope that this problem will be seriously tackled, much less resolved.  The best we can hope for under this Government is that minor adjustments will be made so that the kettle can be taken off the boil in order that the total effects of unemployment on young people will not be politically damaging to the Government in power.</P>
    <P>Up to 1990 there will be approximately 70,000 17-year-olds every year, not all of <Col N="876" /> them can be catered for by the extension and expansion of higher education. Indeed it is questionable whether they ought to be because higher education is a particular form of education which should, in my view, be available to people throughout their adult life and not just at the age of 17 or 18.  To attempt to solve the youth unemployment problem simply by expanding third level education would simply be to postpone a solution to that problem.</P>
    <P>I spoke a moment ago of the social effects of youth unemployment and these cannot be emphasised enough.  It has now become increasingly evident that unemployment, like many other unpleasant things in life, frequently affects those least well equipped to deal with it.  The general breakdown of community life in large urban areas has often left young people with few social contacts outside school and school-related activities.  Having left school and failing to find a new work environment in which to develop their social contacts, young people may often become isolated and insecure.  Insecurity can often manifest itself in aggression. Finding themselves unable to prove themselves or establish any kind of independent identity through the norm of work, young unemployed may often turn to petty crime as a means of proving themselves outside the social norm.  This rejection of social norms, coupled with aggression based on insecurity, can often lead to a dislike of authority, to put it as mildly as possible, and to a distrust of police and a cynical attitude towards anti-unemployment measures, social workers and youth organisations.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody in this House who watched the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme yesterday dealing with Fatima Mansions would have to travel any further for the evidence.  Deputy Briscoe, who spoke a few minutes ago on the budget, represents the area in which that particular establishment is located.  This programme gave the most graphic illustration possible of the kind of social damage that is inflicted on young people in our society who are condemned to unemployment. Unemployment is bad enough when it hits the young or the educationally <Col N="877" /> disadvantaged but when it is inflicted on those who are not only young but educationally disadvantaged as well the cumulative effect can be horrifying. Those of us who work in the city will know of the social problems which are allied with the economic ones.  They will know of the difficulty of getting a job if one's address is Fatima Mansions or even Ballyfermot or some other comparatively long-established suburb or inner city area which has come to have a bad name.</P>
    <P>Not only do young people in these areas find it difficult to get jobs but when they do succeed in acquiring employment they are frequently exploited to the most merciless degree.  The Irish Transport and General Workers Union, as part of their concern for young workers generally, have published quite scarifying details of the degree to which young workers are exploited and the degree to which laws which were passed by this House in an attempt to prevent the exploitation of young people are being flouted, morning, noon and night.  That is the level of the problem &mdash; a base of 30,000 seemingly almost permanently unemployed young people and 55,000 or so coming on to the labour market in each year.  It is a prospect to make even a strong Government quail and this is by no means a strong Government.</P>
    <P>To indicate the inadequacy of the Government's response in this area, I should like to refer very briefly to some of the provisions in the recently published Book of Estimates.  In Vote 30 &mdash; Office of the Minister for Education &mdash; there is a grant-in-aid for youth employment schemes.  Last year it was £500,000; this year it is being increased by 10 per cent or the miserly figure of £50,000.  We all know what the inflation rate has been in the past year and that it has not been 10 per cent, so we may take it as axiomatic that under G. 5, the Department of Education's main contribution to youth employment schemes, there has been, as in so many areas, a cut-back in real terms.</P>
    <P>Let us now turn to the Department of Labour or the Department of the Environment, both of which are relevant in this area.  I am glad to see the Minister for Labour in the House and perhaps he <Col N="878" /> can enlighten us further.  The employment incentive scheme, which was not entirely devoted to young people but partly so, has actually been halved.  Last year the amount provided was £4.1 million and this year it has been reduced to £2 million, so the unemployed young people who are looking forward to some employment under the employment incentive scheme &mdash; and that scheme had its faults, although at least it was a scheme &mdash; will be half as likely to get assisted places in employment this year than they were last year.  Under the heading for the Department of Labour the work experience programme has been pegged at £2.1 million.  Taking into account the fall of 18 per cent in the value of money this represents a drop in real terms.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to subhead G in the Vote for the Department of the Environment where the amount being made available for grants in respect of environmental works, on which many young people were employed, has been cut by 30 per cent from £1.5 million to just over £1 million. In all the Departments through which were provided funds for youth employment of one kind or another the story is devastating.  There are only cutbacks and retrenchment.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Department of Labour which deserves special consideration is that related to AnCO.  It could be argued that the work of AnCO is not youth employment but training.  To some extent that is true, but when young people go on AnCO training courses they come off the unemployment register so it is, after a fashion, a form of employment scheme.  The evidence is that young people take up about 80 per cent of AnCO training places.  I will look briefly at the AnCO Vote to see the degree to which AnCO have been enabled to meet the responsibilities being thrust on them by the Government's failure in other areas.  The general grant for AnCO this year is up by about 11 per cent from £17.5 million to £21 million.  One does not need a pocket calculator to work out how far below the rate of inflation that is.  If AnCO were to continue to provide the same measure of services they provided <Col N="879" /> last year, assuming last year's were adequate, which they were not, that grant would have had to be substantially increased.  That grant, like many others has been a victim of the axeman who sat around the Cabinet table towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that the increase for AnCO in the capital expenditure grant is hefty.  It is, as it has been increased by £6 million to £9½ million this year, an increase of more than 50 per cent.  It is important that the capital grant should be increased as AnCO cannot provide anything for young people unless they have premises in which to provide it.  However that increase must be looked at in the context of the overall need and is the context of AnCO plans.  The AnCO organisation began a massive expansion programme in 1978 and in order to achieve the Government's targets they planned to double the number trained to around 20,000 by 1982.  To continue the impetus of those plans it was estimated that £11 million would be needed in the capital programme for 1980.  Barely half of that amount was provided in 1980.  In effect, in the 1980 budget, certainly the original budget, all they got was an extra £1 million which was the absolute minimum required to meet 1980 commitments entered into in 1979.  Last year in relation to AnCO capital development was virtually at a standstill.  The situation now is that with much huffing and puffing the Government's 1981 figure is still £1½ million short of what AnCO needed last year if they were to provide the places for training opportunities coming up to 1982.</P>
    <P>There are various AnCO schemes which we will be paying for this year. There is at least one that was organised in co-operation with the VECs for summer programmes of six weeks duration for young people which could not be held last year because of the cuts and will not be held this year for the same reason.  We get the impression in relation to the AnCO Vote that the positive effects of spending this £9½ million in capital terms will not be seen in the youth employment statistics for this year and that we will be lucky if they are seen by next year if the <Col N="880" /> many serious problems involved in planning the work of such a large organisation over such a long period are to be adequately tackled.  Basically, the programme which was ruthlessly interrupted by the Government last year, in AnCO development has been restarted but it is over a year behind schedule.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to consider extending the funding to AnCO to allow them to reintroduce their career training programme, run with the VECs, in the VEC schools which are unused in the summer recess.  These courses were immensely popular with the VEC authorities and with young people and resulted in a very high degree of jobs placement afterwards.  If we are not prepared to spend money on this now we will be picking up the pieces and paying far more for doing so later on, not just in terms of social unrest but in terms of social inadequacy, unemployment and related problems.</P>
    <P>I have made one suggestion and I hope in a more concrete from to suggest four major steps that can be taken to close the gap on youth unemployment and give our people more hope and more confidence in their future and in the future of the country.  I would argue for the establishment of a special register for all school leavers and young unemployed people.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this, will the Minister seriously consider whether or not, first on a voluntary basis but perhaps later on a statutory basis, employers should be required to notify the manpower service of vacancies occuring in their plant.  Several EEC countries insist on compulsory notification of vacant jobs by employers to the national manpower services.  It is incredible that such a step takes so long to carry out not just for the effect that it has on the ability of people to find jobs and the likelihood that they will get jobs that are suited to them but because the absence of such information must make a Government manpower policy that much more difficult to plan.  Jobs are notified to employment exchanged from time to time.  Is is likely that no more than 30 per cent of all vacancies are so notified.  There is a serious shortfall of information.  I believe requiring employers <Col N="881" /> to register will not only help young people but over a period of time it will also, taken in conjunction with the fair employment legislation, help to erode the kind of situation in which people get jobs not because of what they are but because of who they are.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to eliminate patronage completely from the employment network but we should be taking steps which will give young people more confidence in the employment market, which will make sure that all the jobs that are there are actually notified to them and that they will have a reasonably fair chance of getting any job for which they are likely to apply.  Would the Minister consider notifying job vacancies in countries other than this one to young people?  This, for obvious reasons, is a subject which has to be approached very delicately.</P>
    <P>Our first priority must be to provide jobs for all our young people at home.  If there are jobs available abroad and if young people want to go abroad for a couple of years to broaden their experience and come back here better qualified more experienced and more useful to our society on a voluntary basis, why should we deny them that opportunity by not at least making the information available to them?  When I was 21 I went away and worked outside the country for one-and-a-half years with every intention of coming back.  In my experience young people who have done that are very often able to make a very positive contribution to the world of work, the world of politics and society generally here because of the slightly broader experience.  If the jobs are there and if they can be notified, especially to young people, why are they not being notified?  Will they be notified?</P>
    <P>The second major area in which an improvement can be made is in the coordination and extension of existing temporary schemes and the development of an integrated and planned programme of employment and training opportunities for the young unemployed.  At the moment we have schemes under the Departments of labour, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education.  Those schemes are not only working in some odd sense in competition <Col N="882" /> with each other but very often the grant and payment levels applicable to broadly similar schemes are different in different Departments.  It confuses young people and their parents.  They are encouraged perhaps to believe that a scheme which pays most money is the higher status scheme and the most benificial one whereas it might not be the case.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a much more integrated approach than there has been in the past.  Even at the most basic level, the absence of any formal link of any significance between the trainee authority, AnCO, and the placement authority, the National Manpower Service, must be seen as a cause for concern. The right hand must know what the left is doing.  There is even a case perhaps to be made for a manpower authority, not another superstructure of bureaucracy but a small steering committee or organisation designed to make sure that as far as possible the needs of young people and the needs of the employment market will be matched to the closest possible extent.</P>
    <P>The third possible solution is that we would think seriously, in view of the seriousness of the problem and in view of the fact that employment hits young people proportionately harder, of setting up a youth employment agency as an integral part of a manpower agency or a manpower authority which would have the authority and the staff resources to implement a programme and mobilise the efforts of local communities in devising schemes.  The youth unemployment problem is not just a problem: it is rapidly approaching the dimension of a crisis.  If we have not got measures like this we will do no more than scratch the surface of that problem of crisis.</P>
    <P>The fourth concrete proposal I would like to make is that there should be a development and extension of school based work-experience schemes.  A number of schools already have begun such schemes with great success.  It is only now that many people involved in education are coming to realise that the majority of school leavers will not be going into higher education immediately and that <Col N="883" /> the school curriculum and outlook has been determined to far too great an extent by the needs of the third level sector and to a far too small extent by the needs of the huge majority of young people, well over 80 per cent, who will be going directly into the world of work if they are lucky and to the world of no work if they are not.</P>
    <P>The schools, and many educationalists will tell you this today, have been for far too long too much the Ivory Tower, too removed from the hurly burly of the work place, too removed from the realities of the very hard life many young people have to go into.  I believe there is room for massive expansion of those work-experience programmes based on the school.  I believe that as long as they are based on the school and do not pose any threat to employment in the normal sense those schemes will be developed and encouraged by the trade union movement. Now is the time for the Minister for Education and the Minister for Labour, acting together, to extend those programmes to encourage further experimentation so that young people will learn about the world of work not in a brutal and sudden way but as part of a transition that can start as early as the age of 14 or 15.</P>
    <P>Four years ago the Government, then the Opposition, made considerable play of young people, their needs, particularly their needs for employment.  I do not know the degree to which that produced any electoral results.  I believe that it was the anxious parents of the young teenagers of that time rather than the teenagers who responded electorally to that plea on the part of the then Opposition. Many of the young people to whom that plea was directed four years ago are still unemployed.  They will still be unemployed if they are unlucky another four years from now, if the weak and ineffectual policies of the Government in relation to youth employment in particular are allowed to go on unchallenged.  The Labour Party challenge the adequacy, the direction and the relevance of these programmes and call on the Government <Col N="884" /> now, even at this late hour, to do something about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan) Thomas Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Nolan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;approves of the policies of the Government for stimulating the creation of employment for young persons and is confident that the Government will keep the operation of these policies under continuous review.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before giving the Government's viewpoint on the way forward and the solutions to the problems, I should like to compliment Deputy Horgan on his contribution as he sees the problem, and on being honest enough to admit that the problems are not only Irish problems but European and, indeed, world problems. Like many Opposition speakers, Deputy Horgan has told us all about the problems and has made a few suggestions about solutions, which is normal and usual.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to say at the outset that the subcommittee on Youth Employment of the Manpower Consultative Committee emphasised that young people should not be regarded as a separate element of the labour force and the provision of special schemes, such as those introduced in the current recession, should not indicate a separation of youth employment from the general labour market.  In so far as there is a youth unemployment problem, its main cause is the lack of overall job opportunities in the economy and not something which is specific to youth.  Therefore, a reduction in the level of youth unemployment will be achieved mainly through economic growth and the consequent rise in labour demand.  In saying this, I am conscious that, because of our population structure, we have increasing numbers of young persons with a higher level of education than ever before and with expectations that reasonably look to a satisfying future in our country.  I must repeat that these young persons should not be regarded as a separate element of the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cause of the present youth unemployment problem are many.  The major ones are, of course, the recent low rate <Col N="885" /> of economic growth in most countries and, in some cases, the demographic effect of the post-war &ldquo;baby boom&rdquo;, with many young people entering the labour force in the mid-seventies.  Structural factors have also played a part and various job protection measures have placed young people in a weaker competitive position in the labour market compared with older workers.  Trends in relative wage and non-wage costs may have made employers less willing to hire and train young people.  Finally, some commentators have asserted that there are increasing mismatches between the qualifications and attitudes of young people and the jobs available.</P>
    <P>As regards the future, our economies are experiencing a second major recession triggered by a sharp rise in oil prices. Nevertheless there are indications that the beginning of the end of the present world economic recession is in sight.  Previous experience indicates that the increase in unemployment will be borne mostly by young people.  For the seven larger member countries of the EEC indications are for a sharp rise in youth unemployment over the next year-and-a-half with youth unemployment rates increasing by more than one-third on average.  At present about 64,000 young people leave annually from all levels of the education system here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service have carried out an annual survey for several years in which second level schools are asked, in late spring, for details of the destinations &mdash; that is, employment, unemployment, further education, and so on &mdash; of the previous year's school leavers.  The latest results available are those for the survey carried out in 1979 concerning young people who left school in 1978.  The following are, for each year, the proportions of those who entered the labour market and who were in employment at the time of the survey:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> These figures indicate that the majority of school leavers obtain employment and this is also true in relation to those leaving third level education.  It is, of course, the objective that every young person should have the opportunity of permanent employment as soon as possible after leaving the education system.  A major survey involving direct interviews with a sample of those who left school in 1979 was carried out in May 1980.  The results of this survey will be available in the near future.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a closer examination of the youth employment situation.  The 1977 Labour Force Survey showed that over 280,000 young people under 25 years of age were in employment at the time the survey was carried out, representing almost 30 per cent of our labour force as opposed to the European average of just 17 per cent.  While concrete estimates are not yet available, the indications are that the number of young people in employment grew substantially between 1977 and 1979.  The people entering the labour market are likely to increase still further in the next few years and to stabilise at a high level thereafter.</P>
    <P>The live register figures produced by the Central Statistics Office have been criticised on the grounds of non-inclusive of many young unemployed.  An age breakdown is now available, which shows that 30,000 registrants are aged under 25. It is considered that there are, at most, 15,000 first-time job seekers not shown in the figures of registered unemployed, resulting in an estimated level of youth unemployment of 45,000.</P>
    <P>High levels of unemployment are being experienced in western countries both those in the OECD area and in the EEC. The increase in unemployment in three EEC countries in 1980 was significantly greater than in Ireland.  In the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands unemployment increased by 66 per cent, 56 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively, compared with an overall increase of 38 per cent here in the same period.</P>
    <P>In addition, our experience of the <Col N="887" /> 1974-76 recession shows that an improvement in the unemployment situation occurred much earlier in Ireland than in most other EEC countries.  There are indications, admittedly tentative, that unemployment is reaching its peak here. During November and December the increase in the seasonally adjusted live register, which indicates the underlying trend in unemployment, was significantly less than in previous months.</P>
    <P>While the Government take the view that the best solution to youth unemployment lies in the creation of permanent jobs, nevertheless, special measures have been introduced aimed specifically at young persons.  The four main special schemes are as follows: Community Youth Training Programme (AnCO); The Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment (Department of Education); The Environmental Improvement Schemes Programme (Department of Environment); and The Work Experience Programme (Department of Labour).</P>
    <P>AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme was set up to provide extra training opportunities for young people. It was designed to supplement AnCO's existing training programmes by offering opportunities for young unemployed people under 20 years of age, with no previous work experience, to acquire basic skills and learn about the world of work by undertaking community projects. The objectives of the programme are to impart basic industrial skills and to develop self-confidence in young people and a sense of responsibility and co-operation which would enable them to obtain suitable full-time employment. The number of young people who participated in the scheme in 1980 amounted to 2,071 representing a total of 735 man years' employment.</P>
    <P>The temporary grants scheme for young employment operated by the Department of Education provides for the payment of grants to youth and sports organisations towards the cost of projects aimed at improving local amenities.  The scheme provides jobs for unemployed young people aged 17-23 years and gives <Col N="888" /> them an opportunity of learning some basic skills and to acquire work experience. During 1980, 1,850 young people participated in the programme making a total of 560 man years employment.</P>
    <P>The environmental improvements schemes programme is implemented by local authorities and under it unemployed young people are engaged mainly in work of an environmental amenity or recreational value to the Community.  It is a condition of the programme that 75 per cent of the jobs provided should be for persons under 25 years of age.  Young people participating are paid full wage rates.  Figures for 1980 are not yet available. In 1970 a total of 909 man years employment was created.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme which is administered by the National Manpower Service of my Department was introduced in September 1978.  The programme is designed to help unemployed young people under 25 years but particularly those in the 18 to 20 age group who are experiencing difficulty in securing suitable permanent employment to gain practical knowledge of working life which is a valuable asset when seeking full-time employment.  Under the programme these young people are placed with employers both in the private and public sector for a maximum period of 26 weeks to get first-hand practical experience over a range of different activities. Since the programme commenced about 11,000 young people have participated in it.  The success of the programme in alleviating youth unemployment may be judged by the fact that over 80 per cent of the participants succeeded in getting permanent employment &mdash; almost half with the employers offering the initial work experience.  The throughput for 1980 amounted to 7,258 participants representing 2,122 man years employment.</P>
    <P>These are the four principal schemes introduced by the Government to cope with the problem of unemployment among our young people especially school leavers and I should like to take this opportunity to ask employers, local authorities, sports and community organisations to participate more actively in these schemes in 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> At our request the OECD have agreed to carry out a major examination of our youth employment policies this year. This is part of a series of such examinations being carried out in member states of the organisation and will enable us to review all aspects of policies and programmes aimed at youth.</P>
    <P>The special position of the disabled and disadvantaged in obtaining employment has not been overlooked.  The Government are committed to increasing the employment opportunities for disabled persons in the public service.  This will have a favourable effect on the employment prospects of young disabled job seekers.  The Government confirmed this commitment in the Second National Understanding for Economic and Social Development and it is determined to achieve a quota target of 3 per cent of public service employment for disabled people as quickly as possible.  Acting on this determination, my Department has arranged for suitable disabled people to be recruited to a wide range of grades in the civil service.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the special social and economic problems of the Dublin inner city area the Government set up an inner city group which is now under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and provided it with a sum of £1 million for expenditure on projects in the Dublin inner city.  The group has no executive functions; those are discharged by the appropriate Department or agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is actively involved in assisting and encouraging local authorities, health boards and other State bodies to increase their intake of disabled persons in line with the Governments commitment to a 3 per cent quota.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly mention some of the projects being assisted by the group which it is hoped will assist in reducing youth unemployment in the inner city area.</P>
    <P>The Dublin inner city employment programme was drawn up by my Department on the recommendation of the inner city group.  It is a special employment incentive scheme for the relief of unemployment in the inner city.  The scheme which came into operation on 1 January <Col N="890" /> 1981 provides that any employer who employs a person from a special inner city register of unemployed will receive a weekly premium of £30 for each adult worker and £20 for each worker under 18 years of age in respect of eligible employees. Premiums will be payable for up to 26 weeks.  A sum of £161,000 has been allocated for the scheme and it is hoped that up to 200 persons will be employed under the programme.</P>
    <P>The second project worthy of mention is the Lourdes Youth Community Centre in Rutland Street.  A sum of £12,000 is being given to this centre to renovate its premises at Rutland Street School for use as a community and youth service centre.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £8,000 has been allocated towards the running of a craft centre in these premises.  The purpose of the craft centre is to give young persons an introduction to basic skills such as woodwork or metalwork which will be of benefit to them when seeking employment.</P>
    <P>AnCO is also involved in running courses in the inner city of Dublin and in communuity work shops in which almost 600 people were trained during 1980.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to draw attention to the north inner city co-operative.  This co-op, based in Killarney Street, has established a furniture workshop and a design workshop.  The inner city group fund will recoup the salary of the manager of the co-op for two years to help it in its initial phase.  Two supervisors' salaries will also be paid.  The group have also agreed in principle to give financial aid to the co-op to lease new premises which will enable the co-op to expand its activities and provide more employment.</P>
    <P>The Government are also concerned at the plight of travelling people and AnCO has assisted in establishing a number of workshops for travelling people in 13 locations around the country.  These workshops are aimed at young people in the 16-25 age group and are geared towards integrating the travelling people on to main courses in AnCO centres and into their own local communities.  Almost 250 such young people were trained in these workshops during 1980, and it is <Col N="891" /> hoped that a similar number will be trained during 1981.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981&rdquo; referred to an apparent bias against industrial employment in Ireland. The Manpower Consultative Committee, of which I am Chairman, established a working party on attitudes to industrial employment in June 1979 to examine the apparent bias against industrial employment, the reasons for it, and to suggest ways of overcoming the bias.</P>
    <P>The task of the working party is to recommend ways to attract a greater inflow of young people into industrial employment by keeping them informed of career prospects and to eliminate, with the assistance of industry itself, any bias which may exist, and it has already made a number of recommendations in this regard.  Amongst these recommendations is the setting up of a schools-industry links scheme.  The aim of the scheme is to facilitate contact between industry, schools, teachers and parents in order to develop informed attitudes towards industrial employment on the basis of adequate information to create an understanding of the career opportunities in industry and generally, to create informed opinion about industry.</P>
    <P>The first schools-industry link scheme was started in Athlone on a pilot project basis in mid 1980.  The second was launched in Dun Laoghaire last month. A further two schemes will commence this month in Letterkenny and Sligo.  I visited the one in Athlone and was pleased to see the advancement there. Management are going to lecture there and students will see what it is like to work on the factory floor.  This is a worthwhile project and I hope it will expand. Similar projects will be launched later in the year in Castlebar, Ballina, Carlow, Skibbereen and Finglas.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the importance of ensuring that young people are adequately trained for the current needs of the labour market and thus avoid mismatch between supply and demand.  The Government accordingly committed themselves in the Second <Col N="892" /> National Understanding for Economic and Social Development to increase the state's contribution to the financing of the training and retraining of workers.  In line with this commitment, the subventions to AnCO and Cert have been significantly increased for 1981.</P>
    <P>AnCO trained 15,700 people during 1980, 79 per cent of them being under 25 years of age.  AnCO is confident that it will provide training for at least as many people during 1981.  During 1980 AnCO placed in jobs almost 70 per cent of people completing courses and this figure rises to 80 per cent in relation to those under 25.  One of the reasons for this high placement rate is the fact that AnCO is responding to changes in technology, and now caters for such areas as electronics, computer programming and advanced welding, areas very relevant to the needs of modern industry.</P>
    <P>AnCO are monitoring the apprenticeship situation very closely to ensure there is no drop in the stock of apprentices as happened during the previous recession. Such a drop could seriously retard a quick take off in industrial production as the recession eases.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the MCC report on youth employment referred to the need for a comprehensive examination of the educational system regarding its relevance to modern employment of a technical nature.  The rapid technological developments in many areas of Irish industry which are anticipated in ensuing years, will lead to a need for continuous updating of the education and training systems so that we will have a properly qualified work force with the incentives and enthusiasm necessary to meet expanding technology.</P>
    <P>Education policy at all levels will have to try to satisfy the needs of society as will as individual needs.  In the Government's recent White Paper on Education the Minister for Education indicated his proposals to meet this challenge.</P>
    <P>At second level there has already been significant progress in developing programmes to prepare students for their various roles in society.  The pre-employment courses which have been operating <Col N="893" /> for the past number of years are an example of these types of programme.  There are, at present, over 3,000 young people attending pre-employment courses being held in 120 schools throughout the country in 91 vocational and 29 community comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The courses are an excellent method of preparing young people who would ordinarily leave school to seek employment when they reach the school leaving age, to make the transition from school to working life.  The courses provide participants with the opportunity of pursuing a programme which is specifically designed to assist them secure suitable employment.  Young people are helped to acquire the skills which are important in working life and to bridge the gap between the values and experiences of the world of school and those of the world of work.</P>
    <P>The pre-employment courses are designed as both a learning and maturing process and also as a career orientation process.</P>
    <P>The three main components of a pre-employment course are: (1) Personal development; (2) Technical knowledge; and (3) Work experience for one day per week</P>
    <P>The work experience element of the programme is important in that it provides participants with first-hand formal experience of work situations.  Indeed, it is through these direct contacts with employers that many of the participants find employment.  Between 60-70 per cent find jobs before the programme ends and the final employment level is often as high as 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is now a greater appreciation of the need for an educational system at both second and third level to take more account of the needs of the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Government continue to be concerned at the lack of suitably qualified technicians and will be establishing new regional technical colleges in the Dublin area and expanding that in Tralee to help redress the imbalance between the supply and demand situation of well qualified manpower.  Three thousand places are <Col N="894" /> also being provided at the National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin and 2,000 additional places at NIHE, Limerick.</P>
    <P>In response to the work of the Manpower Consultative Committee in the area of occupational shortages, the education authorities have expanded existing courses and developed new courses in the engineering and computing fields.  There has been a tremendous response from the education sector to the manpower education programme.  This is evident from the fact that input to the normal four-year engineering courses in the universities, and colleges of technology increased by 230 or one-third between 1979 and 1980.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the budget provisions announced last week included increases above the general average for science and technology.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, education, employment and industry have developed independently and this has led to imbalances between supply and demand.  Now with the work of the MCC and greater coordination between the various parties involved, it would be hoped that this would not occur in the future.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department each year invites all young persons leaving the education system and seeking employment to avail of its services. Placement officers of my Department interview these young people, advise them regarding opportunities, training facilities, career options, youth schemes, and also register them for employment.  The National Manpower Service also, of course, assists employers to fill their vacancies from its register of job seekers.  This register includes persons of many professions and skills as well as general workers and first-time job seekers.  I would encourage employers to use the service, avail of its facilities for selection and, if necessary, aptitude testing, in seeking to fill their vacancies.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning that the Government do not view the provision of jobs for youth in isolation from the total labour market.  This year exceptional measures have been taken to provide jobs.  The investment plan will result in <Col N="895" /> higher direct employment of about 10,000 most of which will be in building and construction.  This extra employment will be largely additional to the jobs arising in manufacturing industry as a result of investment by the industrial promotion agencies.  Substantial indirect employment will, of course, also arise.</P>
    <P>The plan will also affect employment in the manufacturing sector.  The combination of the planned investment in industrial credit and promotion and the corporation tax regime is expected to lead to 15,000-16,000 new manufacturing jobs arising from the IDA's activities and 1,500 from those of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The investment plan will lead to the employment of 2,000 additional engineering, telephone and other staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, of which 600/700 will be trainee installers between the ages of 18 to 20 years.  In addition some less significant increases in other areas of public services such as teachers are likely.</P>
    <P>The record number of job approvals negotiated by the IDA during 1980 will generate a high level of industrial investment in 1981.  The IDA have set a minimum provisional target of 30,000 job approvals for 1981.  Here I might mention that, in a recent IDA survey, the percentage of the work force in new firms aged under 25 was 55 per cent and 23 per cent of those recruited were new entrants to the labour force from the educational system.</P>
    <P>Young persons in their final school year are often under very considerable pressure.  Too much emphasis in the media and other fora on the economic difficulties which may create problems for some in securing their first employment is to be deplored.  As I have already pointed out, the results of surveys by my Department show the majority of second-level school leavers do obtain employment.  A climate of despondency is no help to young persons already possibly facing examination stress.  I would urge all concerned to take a more positive and responsible approach towards them when discussing job prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> I have outlined the various ways in which my Government are encouraging the creation of employment and the special measures to assist young persons obtain employment in the present difficult economic climate, a climate which is paralleled in the current experience of many of our European partners.  It is generally held that the burdens of recession bear heaviest on those possibly least equipped to deal with them.  To this extent we have continued and developed special youth schemes to relieve their situation.  The Government will keep these special schemes under continuous review and will honour their commitments under the national understanding.</P>
    <P>The age structure of our population provides us with a potential for development uncommon among our EEC partners while at the same time presenting us with one of the greatest economic and social challenges of our history.  The ultimate solution to these in the opinion of the Government is the provision of adequate and worthwhile opportunities for satisfying the work aspirations of all our young people in accordance with their aptitudes and capacity.  While special measures may continue to be necessary in the case of the handicapped and disadvantaged I return to my opening proposition: that young persons' employment cannot be regarded as a separate element of the labour market and, as the rising tide lifts all boats, so the best method of ensuring employment for our young people is to push forward the economic development of our country by all the means at our disposal and with the whole-hearted support of all sections of our people.</P>

      <P>First, I would like to welcome the Minister for Labour.  It is the first time I have confronted him in this House as Minister for Labour.  I wish him every success in his onerous task.  I would also like to agree with him in the last sentence he uttered concerning the co-operation which will have to be shared by all sectors of the community and all sectors of political thought in this country if we are to make progress in the area of <Col N="897" /> employment and specifically in the area of youth employment.</P>
      <P>My praise for the Minister ends there and ends abruptly.  I cannot give the same welcome to his speech as he gave to Deputy Horgan's speech.  He referred to Deputy Horgan's honesty.  I am not questioning the Minister's honesty or his integrity, but I do question the approach he adopted on this occasion.  I sat here some months ago listening to his predecessor Deputy Fitzgerald, now Minister for Finance but then Minister for Labour. He treated us to a long series of schemes and a dissertation on how they work.  The Minister has done exactly the same tonight; he could have cogged Deputy Fitzgerald's statement on that day.  But the motion on which we are speaking expresses concern at the increasing number of young people who will be coming on to the labour market in mid-1981.  The Minister has evaded the crunch issue and has avoided putting forward any real proposal which would hold out any hope for the many thousands of young people who are now on the live register and the many more thousands who are facing that prospect on leaving school.  The most intriguing statement made by the Minister was the admonition to the media concerning their activity, I assume in the recent past, in placing too much emphasis on the economic situation.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  We are not in the good news business and the media will not be in the good news business until there is good news to report.  If we are to have a Minister coming in here and telling the media that they should not emphasise the economic mess we find ourselves in in their reporting, then I am afraid we are facing a very serious situation.  I would hope that the media treat that kind of admonition with the contempt it deserves regardless of who is on the far benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a mania across there about good news.  I have been accused of being unpatriotic for stating the facts as I and every economist here sees them.  One is now somewhat less than patriotic if one stands up and says that one person in every four became unemployed in 1980.  That is a true, factual statement and in saying it I do not feel one bit unpatriotic.  The people ought to know because for far too long this document here, which used to be prescribed reading but is now proscribed reading for everybody on the far side of the House and will probably be on the censor's list some day, has been bandied about.  Looking at a section of that Fianna Fáil manifesto which is headed &ldquo;Youth Employment&rdquo; and listening to the Minister tonight one could not imagine that he was speaking for the party who strung this list of promises together.  The Minister might be flying a kite like he did last week speaking on behalf of himself.  But he was careful to point out at the beginning of his speech that he was speaking on behalf of the Government.</P>
      <P>In the section on youth employment there were to be community task forces set up to work on local projects.  They operated for a time and were then withdrawn. The extension of the AnCO apprenticeship schemes was never carried out; in fact they have been cut back, as one can see if one looks at the Estimates. Nothing was done about the encouragement of early retirement. There was nothing done about the encouragement of in-company training and rotation of duties and nothing was done about staff exchanges between ourselves and other EEC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in the manifesto that Fianna Fáil would establish a special employment action team, representative of Government Departments, local authorities, trade unions and community and youth organisations, for the purpose of initiating immediately suitable employment schemes for school leavers and other young people.  That action team came into action under a glare of publicity led by a well-known sportsman here who did his best to get that team off the ground <Col N="899" /> and initially did good work.  But what happened?  For some unknown reason the Minister for Labour, Deputy Nolan's predecessor, came into this House and announced that this action team had been disbanded.  The team itself were not aware of this until they read it in the morning papers.  Indeed, the most paradoxical statement that I have seen is to be found in the report of the Manpower Consultative Committee, where in the foreword by the then Minister for Labour, Deputy G. Fitzgerald, it is mentioned that the introduction of new youth employment schemes and the expansion of existing schemes which resulted mainly from the work of the Youth Employment Action Team and the general improvement in the economic and employment situation from 1977 onwards considerably alleviated the youth employment problem.  Then in the first paragraph of the report it is stated that in his 1979 Estimates speech in Dáil Éireann the Minister for Labour announced that he intended to terminate the youth employment action team; yet in the foreword the Minister is quoted as saying they did enormous work.  Why were their actions terminated?  Why were they not replaced?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of 30,000; my inquiries resulted in the following information.  As of 1 February 1981, 122,220 people were on the live register.  Of that number 31,288 were under 25 years, and of that figure 20,691 were males and 10,577 females, a 2:1 ratio.  The Minister stated that apart from that figure we could safely add a further 15,000 young people seeking work but not on the live register.  That means we have approximately 45,000 young people under 25 years unemployed.  As the Minister stated the computation method which gives the number of those on the live register is not very accurate.</P>
    <P>We all recall that during 1976 and 1977 when we had a severe recession the unemployment figure rose to 120,000. The screams from the far side of the House were that there were not 120,000 unemployed but 160,000.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  The fact is if one applies the same criterion to the method of computation or calculation used, one would get 160,000 or 170,000 unemployed, and of that number 45,000 or 50,000 would be under 25 years of age. This motion demands that the Government take action to relieve the pressures on our youth.</P>
      <P>During his first Árd Fheis as Taoiseach, I recall the Taoiseach casting aspersions, in a subtle way, on certain political parties who, he said, treated the fact that we have a young and growing population as a problem and he castigated them for so doing.  He said he did not consider them to be a problem but a challenge.  After his performance in office for one year that challenge has become a problem because he has failed to face up to that challenge.</P>
      <P>One would have expected that putting down this motion would have provoked the Minister and his Department into producing something that would hold out some hope for the 45,000 young people who are unemployed, but nothing has come from them.  Many years ago James Joyce described the city of Dublin as the centre of paralysis.  If he were around today I am sure he would consider that an apt description of the present Cabinet. The day has gone when Members of this House and the people and youth of this country will tolerate a Minister's response to a motion like this as a long litany of measures that are going on and that have been initiated in the past three-and-a-half years, when patently these measures have not worked.  We want new ideas and new initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The Minister said we must look at our educational curricula.  His colleague, the Minister for Education, last week made the profound statement that it was time we did likewise and that we should look at the whole system with a view to a more technical orientation of our educational system.  This, too, is in that famous manifesto. After three-and-a-half years we have been advised by the people who have the power to change things that we should see if it is possible to make changes.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were the people who were talking about these changes three-and-a-half years ago; they were the people who stood idly by and did nothing about them; and they are the people who are now saying these changes should be made.  Will they do it and stop talking about it?  Certain gestures will be made and certain promises will be made and despite the fact that they swallowed and regurgitated this document three-and-a-half years ago, certain gullible people will fall for these promises.  From a Government who tell us something should be done about our educational system, this is a very poor performance.</P>
    <P>It is well known fact that over the past two years we had vacancies in the faculties of technology in many RTCs and in engineering and related faculties. The Government have done nothing about them, despite the fact that Ministers have made statements and speeches up and down the country that we are short of trained personnel to avail of higher technology.  We went abroad and got a number of trained Irishmen to come back from the United Kingdom but we failed to change anything, even though it is a well established fact that if we are to tackle successfully future industrial opportunities we must have trained technologists and personnel trained in engineering and related faculties.  We have not done that.</P>
    <P>If we had these people the spin-off would be to provide an attractive industrial environment for foreign investment. We all agree on that but nothing has been done.  We heard cliché-ridden speeches about the importance of youth and the provision of work which is satisfying, fulfilling <Col N="902" /> and so on.  What did we get?  We got clichés like &ldquo;thousands of man years and man hours&rdquo; which mean nothing to 45,000 young people and mean even less to their parents who are at their wits' end wondering what will happen their children, for whom they paid dearly when rearing.  There does not seem to be any great future for many of these young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say I should not say that because it will not do anything for their morale, but they cannot eat morale, and neither can their parents.  They want facts and the opportunity to take appropriate action.  During the past few days we had an example of a dismal failure at a cover-up in relation to the importation of goods for the month of December. The same kind of cover-up is going on in relation to unemployment and job opportunities. The Minister mentioned something which was amusing in one way but sad in another.  He said it was not that youth were out of jobs, it was really a lack of overall job opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  The question of the establishment of a review body on teachers' pay was a very pressing one early in 1980. The teachers' unions were, rightly, pressing for substantial increases in salary and other allowances.  Because of public pressure on the Minister by the teachers' unions and by Members of the House, the Minister on 27 March 1980, made an announcement that Judge Patrick Noel Ryan, a Circuit Court judge, had agreed to act as chairman of a review body.  That review body consisted of the chairman, Mr. John Walsh and Mr. Michael Collins, both members of the Labour Court, Mr. Richard Cooke, S.C., and Dr. Dermot McAleese, Trinity College.  Their terms of reference were set out in a statement issued by the Minister on 27 March:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> A&mdash;(1)  To examine and report on the levels of salary and allowances of teachers on the common basic scale taking cognisance of the circumstances of other groups with comparable professional qualifications and responsibilities;</P>
    <P>(2)  To have regard in the overall assessment of salary levels, allowances and promotion opportunities to the nature and conditions of their work including hours of work and length of school year, and the role and value of the teacher in society;</P>
    <P>(3)  To make an interim report by 30 September 1980;</P>
    <P>(4)  To submit the final report and recommendations by 31 January 1981.</P>
    <P>B&mdash; To make recommendations in regard to the procedure for the determination and review of the conditions on which persons may be appointed in various vapacities for work in connection with the Certificate Examinations of the Department of Education, including the rates of payment for such work.</P>
    <P>Those terms of reference were wide enough to allow the review body to take into account the whole professional status of the teacher and his or her role in society.  It is interesting to note the position now is that over 75 per cent of students in St. Patrick's College of Education in Drumcondra are female.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely indicating a particular social development which is interesting to note and indicative of the fact that teachers' pay has not been as high as I would like to have seen it.</P>
      <P>The interim report was recommended on 22 September 1980.  It proposed certain salary increases and so on.  These salary increases were strongly rejected by the teachers' unions and, as a result of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, substantial amendments were made to the recommendations in the interim report.  The main changes were in regard to the amount of the increase in teachers' pay, an agreement on the shortening of the time spread over which a teacher would reach the maximum on the scale and the retention of B posts of responsibility. I agree with what the Minister did in relation to the salary increases, the retention of the B posts and the shortening of the length of time it took a teacher to reach the maximum on the scale.  There were several improvements which the Minister correctly made.  The Minister, on other issues, totally ignored the recommendations of the review body. I will quote from paragraph 2.6:</P>
      <P>The salary we recommend will, we believe, correct those inadequacies but we would emphasise that the salary so recommended is justifiable only if it is overtly recognised that supervision, substitution, parent contact and pastoral care are integral parts of the teaching function and essential to the proper running of a school.  The response we would wish to see generated from the teachers is that these requirements will be met by them generously in the part they play in the moulding and development of their pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ignoring by the Minister of that central recommendation is the reason why the review body submitted their resignation to the Minister on 30 October 1980. Why has the Minister not initiated negotiations <Col N="905" /> with the reachers' unions on these vital matters which affect parents, teachers and children?  From the point of view of improving our system of education, it was essential that the Minister should at least initiate negotiations on these matters of supervision, substitution, parent contact and pastoral care. There are many parents who would like to have seen some move forward on these fronts.  It is obvious that the Minister has not made any attempt to open negotiations on these matters.</P>
    <P>There is another matter stated in paragraph 2.6:</P>
    <P>From the evidence presented to us we are concerned that the quality of school service is not being fully maintained at present.</P>
    <P>If that is not a serious indictment of the Minister for Education then I am a Dutchman.  For an impartial review body, chaired by a judge of the Circuit Court, to indict the Minister for failing to ensure that the quality of our school services is maintained, is one of the most serious indictments I have heard from an independent authority since I was elected.  Would the Minister make some statement on that aspect of the interim report?  They stated again, quite clearly in paragraph 2.6:</P>
    <P>We believe that our salary proposals recognise the value and inherent worth of the profession and we feel it our duty to state that the prerequisite of any such contracts should be the meeting in full of school requirements of teaching, caring and management.</P>
    <P>The review body submitted their resignation on 30 October 1980 setting out their reasons for that action.  I do not agree with them on one or two points but the fact that they decided to resign is a serious matter.  It is the first time since I became a Member of this House that an independent investigating body resigned because their recommendations were ignored.  It is sad to think that when the Minister received that letter of resignation he did not do anything about it.</P>
    <P>In the course of their statement on 8 January the review body stated that at the time of their letter of resignation of <Col N="906" /> 30 October the ballot on the Minister's proposals had not been completed and for that reason, in deference to the Minister's wishes, they delayed making public their decision.  It appears from that statement that the Minister made some request to the review body not to resign but I do not think he made any effort to meet the recommendations of the review body because on 11 December they wrote to the Minister, since no communication had been received from him in the interim, indicating their intention to issue a press release on 2 January 1981.  Apparently, the Minister's private secretary asked for a delay in the publishing of the resignation and in the first week of 1981 the Minister, in the course of a letter to the review body, expressed his gratitude to them for accepting the onerous duty and so on.</P>
    <P>The point I am making &mdash; I want this clearly taken and not misinterpreted &mdash; is that it is very difficult for one man to put a value on another man's labour.  In a society which has been suffering from serious inflation for the past ten years I have seen the revaluing of peoples' incomes in different sectors of the economy changing drastically.  It was because of the ravages of inflation that the tremendous pressure built up within the teachers' unions for very high increases. <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 April 1980 reported that vocational teachers were to push for a 50 per cent pay claim.  They were the type of figures spoken of early that year. It was because of many years of neglect that the teachers rightly sought radical increases in their pay.  The recommendation was not acceptable to them and it subsequently went, on the Minister's initiative, to conciliation and arbitration where a higher figure was agreed on.  I welcome the agreement reached at that time.  Some aspects of the recommendations were not to my liking such as the length of time it took teachers to reach the maximum, the retention of the B posts and the overall increases suggested. I felt those increases could be improved on.  The figures agreed by the Minister and the teachers' unions were to my satisfaction and I stated publicly that I welcomed the agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> However, I was disappointed that in other vital areas the Minister was extremely neglectful in that he chose to ignore what must be considered to be important aspects of the teaching profession. I look forward to the time when such matters as supervision, substitution, parent contact and pastoral care would be integral parts of the school system.  I look forward to the time when the income of teachers will be such as to include all those aspects of professional status.  If that happens we will not have the annual wrangle about fees to be paid for supervision of examinations or the correcting of examination papers.  We should have an automatic way forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister has missed an ideal opportunity to deal with such matters by not taking up the recommendations of the review body.  By ignoring what can only be considered as the pleadings of the review body on 30 October and 11 December the Minister has deprived the teaching profession of further increases in salary.  He has deprived them of a final report which would have dealt in a comprehensive way with the professional status, with their place in the examination system and with other matters the review body cared to address themselves to.  By his own negligence and omission the Minister has denied teachers a further increase in salary and has denied children and parents a clear recommendation on the path our educational system should take in the eighties in such vital areas as pastoral care, supervision and so on.  As a result we are left in a vacuum.  We are missing something and teachers are missing out on a further increase in salary.</P>
    <P>I looked forward, as Opposition spokesman on Education, and as a parent, to the final report of the review body. However, because of the Minister's incompetence, neglect and omission in dealing with the recommendations in the interim report a serious disservice has been done to Irish education.  A wider implication is that in future it may be difficult to get independent people of standing to serve on Government committees or Government-sponsored review bodies.  Why should they if their <Col N="908" /> major recommendations are to be ignored?  Even when they take the trouble to communicate with the Minister and point out certain matters which are not to their liking their serious submissions are ignored.  The final report of the review body could have played a vital role in improving the relations between the teachers' unions, parents and the Department of Education.  It could have helped in some way to improve our school system, something which would be to the benefit of all children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins has performed a circus act of trying to ride two horses at the same time.  He should face up to the question of whether he agreed with what the review body recommended or the teachers with regard to salaries.  Does he agree with the range of the salaries, the scale which was recommended?  If he does agree with the range then he agrees with what the Minister for Education did in this regard.</P>
      <P>He came out with what to me is the most extraordinary statement about the composition of the teaching profession. He said something to the effect that there was a 75 per cent women intake in St. Patrick's College of Education in Drumcondra because, he felt, men did not see the profession as one which would enable them to marry and raise a family.  I was not quite sure whether I was hearing aright.  I thought that this blatant sexism had departed from our social life, but here comes Deputy Collins, knotted club in his right hand and dragging a female with his left out of his cave as he says, &ldquo;This person here thinks that she should have a place in the teaching profession but it is not good enough for me because I am a male&rdquo;.  The fact is that the majority of trainees are women because they beat the blue socks off the men at the examinations and interviews.  It is as simple and blunt as that and has nothing to do with the fantasy which we had from Deputy Collins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in this House put it on the record that I rejected the vitriolic attacks made on the review body for the sake of the review body themselves but also because <Col N="909" /> we had here a group of highly competent professional people who were providing services voluntarily for the State and who produced a good report.  I am glad to take the opportunity again to pay tribute to the review body for their approach to the task.  It was a thorough approach and an expeditious one.  They reported very quickly and painstakingly and their report was imaginative and far-reaching in its recommendations.  The recommendations were for a salary structure which would &ldquo;be such as to attract and hold persons of quality and dedication which the profession needs and the public desires&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the report from the review body are still being considered through the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme.  However, I consider that it would be in order for me to make the following observations.  The proposals put before the teachers' conciliation council for the purpose of an agreed recommendation did not depart fundamentally from the proposals of the review body.  It was agreed that the span of the long-phased increments should be reduced substantially from 23 to 11 years, but, on the other hand, the length of the normal scale was to remain at 15 points instead of 13 as recommended in the report of the review body.  The minimum of the revised scale was fixed at £5,300 instead of the recommended £5.050, but the amounts of the increments over most of the scale were precisely as recommended in the report, and the maximum to be reached by way of the long-phased increments was fixed at the level recommended by the review body.</P>
    <P>All proposals in relation to salary adjustments for teachers are processed, as the House well knows, through the conciliation and arbitration machinery and the arrangements for the processing of the proposals through the conciliation council were no different in this case from the arrangements for processing the proposals on pay under the national understanding and previous national agreement on pay.  Agreement on a recommendation at the conciliation council requires the agreement of all the parties constituting the council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> Agreed Report No. 4/80 of the conciliation council records the agreement of the council to recommend the implemtation of proposals in relation to the revised basic scale of salary for teachers which had been negotiated at meetings between representatives of the teachers' unions, the managerial authorities and the Departments of Education and of the Public Service, chaired by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Agreed Report 4/80 also records that: (a) the official side said that they were prepared to offer the revised scale on condition that it must be regarded as fully comprehensive and inclusive, that is that no additional payment would arise in any circumstances in respect of any functions discharged by teachers as part of the duties of their posts in individual schools; (b) the teachers' side said that if employers wished teachers to undertake additional functions which do not form part of the teacher's contractual duties the teachers' unions might present claims for allowances for those teachers who were prepared to undertake such functions.</P>
    <P>The report 4/80 does not record any statement from the representatives of the other parties constituting the conciliation council in relation to the discharge of functions by teachers.</P>
    <P>The functions to be discharged by teachers, other than teaching functions, may vary in accordance with the circumstances of individual schools and of different categories of schools and it is my view that, to the extent that such may be necessary, they would be set out in the contract between the school authorities and the teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>I am aware that negotiations have been taking place over a period between representatives of the managerial association, for example, of secondary schools and the teachers in those schools in relation to the contractual duties of the teachers, but I, as Minister for Education, have not been a party to such negotiations.</P>
    <P>The duties attaching to posts of responsibility in secondary schools are set out in a memorandum agreed between the joint managerial body and the ASTI.  Again, of course, the Minister for Education is not a party to this agreed memorandum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> I am satisfied that matters which are regarded by the school authorities as essential functions of individual teachers in the running of the school should form part of the contractual duties of such teachers and should be specified as appropriate and to the extent considered necessary in the contract of employment. It is a matter for the school authorities concerned to make such arrangements accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have informed the chairman of the review body that I understand fully the view which he expressed to me during the course of a meeting which the members had with me in October last that they would not consider it appropriate to invite submissions in regard to the outstanding item in the terms of reference as set out originally, namely to make recommendations in regard to the procedure for the determination and review of the <Col N="912" /> conditions on which persons may be appointed in various capacities for work in connection with the certificate examinations of the Department of Education including rates of payment for such work. I stated that it seems to me that this matter might be satisfactorily considered through the official procedures available for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the House that my action as Minister for Education is justified fully in the circumstances and that the review body have left a lasting imprint on the format of the salary structure in this country and I am grateful to them for it.</P>

The name is given by some vocational education committees to some schools established in accordance with the provisions of the Vocational Education Acts.</P>
      <P>In general, a community school is provided in circumstances where one school is being established in an area and both the religious authorities concerned and the vocational education committee desire to be involved in its administration and are prepared to implement the provisions of the deed of trust.  The features of each particular case, with special regard to the ascertainable views of the parents of the children involved, are taken into account when a decision has to be made between conflicting views as to whether the school to be established should be a community school or a school to be administered by the vocational education committee.</P>

In this connection I would like to explain that in 1979-80 and 1980-81 the creation of 200 additional posts was authorised in second level schools over and above the normal allocation of teachers to cater specifically for remedial education.  These posts were allocated in the areas of greatest need from among the applicant schools.  It was not possible to include the Sacred Heart school, Drogheda in the allocation.  Neither was it possible to include the teacher among the strictly limited number who could be accommodated on the course in remedial education.</P>
      <P>It will be open to the manager of the school to make application for the inclusion of a staff member in any such course which may be notified to schools by my Department for the school year 1981-82. All such applications will be considered on their merits.</P>

      <P>Since most of the information is of a statistical nature I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The information requested under numbers (5), (7), (11), (14), (15), (16) and (17) is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No. (5) &mdash; The western drainage scheme, which is financed to the extent of 50% by the EEC, provides for a five year drainage programme of 100,000 ha. Because of the unprecedented demand under the scheme, it now looks as if this target will be exceeded and in view of <Col N="771" /> this, application will be made to the EEC for an extension of the programme.</P>
    <P>No. (7) &mdash; There is no provision in the scheme whereby a landowner can be compelled to provide a satisfactory outlet.</P>
    <P>No. (11) &mdash; The time allowed for completion of approved schemes is generous and it is in the farmer's own interest to complete the work within this time.  However, where an applicant shows that he was unable to complete the work by the specified date due to factors outside his control, consideration would be given to extending the period.</P>
    <P>No. (14) &mdash; The range of machinery purchased by co-operatives includes excavators, bulldozers, mole ploughs, stoning carts, and ancillary equipment.</P>
    <P>No. (15) &mdash; In order to qualify for aid on the purchase of drainage machinery, each co-operative are obliged to give a written undertaking that the machinery will be used solely for drainage in the western counties.  In addition, periodic checks are made to ensure that the undertakings are being honoured.</P>
    <P>No. (16) &mdash; Under the terms of the relevant EEC directive on which the scheme is based, the provision whereby grant-aid was allowed for the purchase of drainage machinery expired on 31 December 1980.  It cannot, therefore, be extended beyond that date.</P>
    <P>No. (17) &mdash; I do not accept the contention made in the press article referred to.</P>

It follows that the science budget cannot be produced at the same time as the Estimates volume and that some reasonable time must be permitted to elapse after the publication of the Estimates volume in order to ensure that a meaningful and worthwhile science budget document is produced.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that this year's science budget will be published before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>During 1980 salmon fishery patrols were carried out on the north Mayo coast by Naval patrol vessels and by the Bangor and Ballina Boards of Conservators.  Ten arrests were made for illegal drift netting in the area of which two have been decided in court and eight await court hearings.  The two cases which have been decided arose from patrols by the Naval vessels and the penalties imposed were as follows: (i) fine of £130 with £60 expenses plus forfeiture of fishing net, 1,600 yards long, and of three <Col N="793" /> salmon; (ii) fine of £50 with £30 expenses plus forfeiture of fishing net 3¼ miles long. The above two forfeited nets have not yet been disposed of; their value depends on their condition.  The value of the salmon forfeited was about £27.</P>
      <P>As to the remaining eight arrests, one arose from a Naval vessel patrol and seven from patrols by Ballina board of conservators.  In addition the two boards of conservators seized 35 unattended illegal drift nets each measuring about 90 yards to 220 yards by 60 meshes deep. There was no special concentration of Naval patrols off the north Mayo coast.</P>

In general the prescribed maximum length of drift net is related to fishing conditions and fishing tradition in each area.
