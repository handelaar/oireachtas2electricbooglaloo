      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was replying to the points made by Deputy Colley and I would again like to take this opportunity of thanking him for his comprehensive contribution to the debate.  I would now like to reply to some points made by other Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan made a long and wide-ranging speech on a number of aspects of the activities of the ESB.  I agree with him, in principle, when he says it is important that we cut down the amount of oil <Col N="340" /> imports and rely, as far as is economically possible and feasible, on our own natural resources.  In this respect I call the Deputy's attention to the prospect for natural gas usage within our economy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of coal burning stations, I would like to refer him to the Government's plans in the jointly agreed Fine Gael and Labour policy document. I refer him to point 6 of our programme under the heading of Industry, Commerce and Energy:</P>
      <P>Pending a significant oil find in Irish waters, no more oil burning power stations will be built and the dependence of the national power system on oil will be reduced to one-third through a switch to coal and to alternative energy sources.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind Deputy Flanagan that in the course of my speech I pointed out that by the end of the present decade we will be moving to a dependence on oil for generating electricity from the present position of 60 per cent to 40 per cent, which would be a significant move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan also referred to industrial relations in the ESB.  I consider these to be of paramount importance to the economy.  In view of the fact that I have not had a report on the balloting of the comprehensive agreement among the unions involved in the ESB, I feel I am precluded from making any further statement on industrial relations in the ESB. I hope the comprehensive agreement will be accepted by all the unions involved and that we can look forward to a long period of industrial peace within the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy laid great stress on the Leinster coalfields.  The survey of these coalfields will be completed as speedily as possible by the technical experts involved.  I am anxious to ensure that any workable coal seams which come to light will be exploited and that intensive efforts will be made to use the realisable resources of Arigna crow coal.  Every effort to use that and other sources of coal and anthracite will be made.  It is important that we should be satisfied that it is technically and economically feasible <Col N="341" /> to develop any such fields.  Such a valuable and indigenous source of coal will not be neglected by the Minister.  However, we must be sure that the reserve is workable and economical.  I want to make that quite clear to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also was quite clearly against the nuclear energy concept.  I have already made known my position on that in answer to Deputy Colley's submission.  Deputy Keegan also stressed the desire to develop our natural resources and was anxious to ensure full development of mini or micro hydro schemes.  Obviously any move towards using alternative sources of energy would be welcome.  However, I would point out that such schemes are, by and large, in the experimental stage.</P>
    <P>I referred in my introductory speech, to the four wind machines for electricity generation which are being erected at various points.  The ESB are satisfied that there are, in fact, few hydro possibilities left of any sizeable scale.  The ESB have recently completed a very small hydro scheme at Parteen Weir, County Tipperary, which has a capacity of only 0.6 megawatts.  All other similar potentials are being considered. With regard to wind generation programmes, there is considerable potential for small private units, say, supplying a farm, as was suggested, or a small business. The possibility of the sale of any surplus energy to the ESB grid would be kept in mind.  I intend to formulate and support an experimental demonstration programme on private mini hydros and to provide some funds to grant-assist well executed projects.  I remind Deputies that, while the technology is not difficult, the cost can be fairly substantial, relative to output.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for his contribution and his support of the Bill.  He made a number of valuable points.  He was very concerned that many people, especially those on fixed incomes, are unable to pay ESB bills.  I take the point. There are certain categories, old age pensioners and such, who are given a free electricity allowance.  I can see a situation where some people find themselves in a distressed position in so far as payment <Col N="342" /> of their ESB bills is concerned.  I suggest that that is not the responsibility of the Department of Energy.  The question of family support and income support is quite clearly the responsibility of other Departments.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the ESB are by statute, obliged to operate on a non-loss-making basis and I must discharge my duties as Minister in that regard.  I do not like the need for the fuel variation cost charges being put on some people's bills.  Nevertheless, the energy crisis which began in the mid-seventies still exists.  The fuel cost variation is a fact of life.  I can only say that the legislation, as passed by this House, obliges the ESB to pay their way, year in, year out.  That is the position which will have to be maintained. No other position would be acceptable to this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock also mentioned the extremely high cost of installation of electricity supply.  I must refer him to the ESB's position in relation to rural electrification. The ESB say that about 99 per cent of all rural householders are now connected to the ESB.  However, a number of houses remain unconnected, whose owners or occupants, for one reason or another, have no electricity supply. In some cases, the householder concerned refused, or did not take up, offers of subsidised supply.  In other cases, the houses in question were built after the subsidisation scheme and, therefore, are not eligible for subsidised electricity.</P>
    <P>Under the ESB (Amendment) Act, 1976, all householders who have found themselves unable to pay and declined to accept connection on the terms offered under the previous 1971-75 rural electrification scheme were offered connection on terms which did not require the payment of a capital contribution.  Work under this scheme is still in progress and will be substantially completed this year. Twenty-six houses have still to be connected. Some farmers who failed to obtain a connection under rural electrification schemes may be eligible under the FEOGA scheme.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 10,000 to 12,000 new houses are being constructed annually in rural areas.  The <Col N="343" /> ESB have been at pains to bring to the notice of persons building new houses that the location of a house in relation to the electricity distribution lines can significantly affect the cost of connection to the supply.  In practice, unfortunately, some rural householders have very little choice in relation to sites.  It should be mentioned that certain county councils may be able to make grants towards the cost of electricity connection to county council dwellings.</P>
    <P>Following ministerial consultation with the chairman and board of the ESB in 1978, the board agreed to more generous connection terms for rural domestic houses, whereby the first £160 and 50 per cent of the cost in excess of £850 is met by the board.  Deferred payment facilities over a period of five years are also made available.</P>
    <P>I would not consider the ESB position to be a generous one in the light of inflation over the last three years.  I am under-taking to examine the current cost practice of the ESB in this regard and I intend making representations to the board of the ESB to have a review of their attitude towards the subsidisation of new electricity connections in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to mention the question of the FEOGA scheme as it applies to electrification schemes in the west.  I hope to bring before the House in the very near future a Supplementary Estimate to allow the ESB to partake in this FEOGA scheme, which would be subsidised substantially from FEOGA funds, because it will be of immense benefit to the western region.  It will benefit farmers by way of new supplies, improved supplies and, in some cases, by the installation of three-phased supplies. I would not like to go into this scheme in detail until I have an opportunity of bringing the necessary Supplementary Estimate before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keegan referred to the non-accountability of the ESB to this House. I cannot accept that point.  There are a number of channels through which the ESB are accountable to this House.  As Minister, I am responsible for the proper running and management of the ESB in <Col N="344" /> a broad context and for the operation of the various Electricity Supply Bills. Members can put down parliamentary questions on matters affecting the ESB. They can raise questions on the Adjournment. We have the Committee of Public Accounts which examine the positions of Departments every year; and there is the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  All these channels are open to Members who wish to question the activities of the ESB.  Therefore, I cannot accept the charge that the ESB are not amenable to Dáil accountability.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of wood briquettes is another possibility to which I have already referred, especially in relation to forest thinnings.</P>
    <P>While I have not had time to carry out a full review of all the strands of the energy policy which I wish to pursue, I can indicate to the House that the following appear to be the main pillars which I am anxious to pursue.  I think it is essential that we have a cohesive integrated energy policy, all the elements of which are in broad harmony with one another, but with sufficient flexibility to allow for the changes which no system of forecasting, no matter how perfect, can fully take account of.</P>
    <P>While the order in which I mention them does not indicate the order of preference, I hope to press on with an examination of the following major items.</P>
    <P>First, to get construction on the gas pipeline from Kinsale under way at the earliest possible date and to get a supply flowing to the homes of Dublin city, and to other cities and towns between Kinsale and Dublin as far as possible within the time span of a few years.</P>
    <P>Second, to pursue vigorously the search for oil and gas and to lay on the benefits of this to the economy as early as possible.  Included in that will be a policy of the maximum possible refining in Ireland of any oil or gas finds.</P>
    <P>Third, to ensure that the ESB carry through their capital development programme consistent with the expected needs.  In the course of my reply yesterday I indicated that there is an extensive programme in hand, with sufficient flexibility to meet changes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Fourth, to reduce the dependence on oil not only for the purposes of electrical generation, and as I said yesterday this has been partly achieved, with a drop from 60 &mdash; 40 per cent by the end of the present decade.  This will be pressed further in view of the cost and the possible insecurity of supply throughout the eighties and to the end of this century and after.  The same will apply towards the switch away by heavy industry, in as far as I can encourage and develop this trend for industry and commercial enterprise as well.</P>
    <P>Fifth, to encourage and foster an effective programme of conservation, and I mean this in the wider sense including the pursuit of research and development for realistic alternative sources of energy, giving priority to as much of this from indigenous sources including bog development as I can.</P>
    <P>In the very short term I intend to look at the security of our strategic stocks of oil on Irish soil and also on the strong desirability of having refining capacity operational in Ireland.  No modern economy can stand a disruption of even a very short time of its economic life due to a break in supplies or shortages for any reason whatsoever.  In common with all countries of Europe, which have taken very significant steps in regard to stocks, I intend to look very critically at this area so that our small economy, with its need for growth and stability, will in no way be jeopardised by any problems on the oil supply front.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Deputy Colley and other Deputies for their contributions which I value very highly.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment and passed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby appoints Mr. Seamus Pattison of 6 Upper New Street, Kilkenny, Co. Kilkenny. (who has been nominated in accordance with Section 15 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977 by The Labour Party) to be a representative in the Assembly of the European Communities for the constituency of Leinster in the place of Mr. Liam Kavanagh who was elected as a candidate of The Labour Party and who has resigned as a representative in the Assembly with effect from 30 June, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These motions seek the appointment of Deputy Pattison and Deputy Treacy to the European Parliament in place of Deputies Liam Kavanagh and Eileen Desmond.  Both motions are in order and will not be opposed by this side of the House but there are some pertinent remarks I wish to make.  It is quite clear under section 15 of the European Assembly (Elections) Act, 1977, that when casual vacancies of this kind arise it is the prerogative of the party whose representatives had been elected to the European Assembly to fill them. These two motions are in proper form in accordance with law.  Deputies Kavanagh and Desmond having been nominated by the Labour Party and elected to the European Assembly, that party now have the right to appoint Deputies Pattison and Treacy to those positions.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on the undesirability of pursuing what is known as the dual mandate.  I am glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service, Deputy Barry Desmond, present today because he and I spent many constructive hours on the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  We participated actively in the deliberations of that committee which on 4 June 1975 resulted in a report signed by the then chairman, Deputy Haughey.  Paragraph 10 of that report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present Treaties members <Col N="347" /> of the European Parliament must be members of their national Parliaments. The draft Convention provides that &ldquo;membership of the European Parliament shall be compatible with membership of a Parliament of a Member State.&rdquo;  The experience of the members of the Joint Committee who are also members of the present European Parliament suggests that dual membership will, in fact, be difficult to sustain particularly when the powers of the European Parliament are extended.</P>
    <P>The considered view was that it would be very difficult to sustain the duality of membership in regard to the national Parliament and the European Parliament. That report was published in 1975 and we now have an extended European Parliament.  The arguments against dual membership have increased tenfold.</P>
    <P>In practice most political parties within member countries are following the headline established in this country by the Fianna Fáil Party and are debarring their members from dual membership. The British Labour Party have rightly adopted this view and have a rule barring dual membership.  Every British Labour Party representative in the European Parliament is a member of that Parliament only and not of the House of Commons. To a large extent the Conservative Party have followed the same line.  Of the total British membership of 81 in the European Parliament only four are members of either the Commons or the Lords.</P>
    <P>A similar pattern is evident elsewhere. Of the total of 410 members of the European Parliament only 125 are members of one or other House of the home Parliament. Almost 75 per cent of the members of the European Parliament are specialists in the work of that Parliament and concentrate on only one job.  This goes back to the fundamental rule which has been adopted as a principle of trade unionism over the years.  The British Labour Party rightly saw the import of that from the point of view of giving specialised attention to the job to be done in the European Assembly and decreed that any member of their party who opted <Col N="348" /> for the European Assembly had to concentrate on work within the Assembly and cease to be a member of the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Apart from the obvious desirability of specialising in parliamentary work and being in a more effective position to discharge one's obligations either in the European Parliament of the national Parliament, there is an obvious social and moral principle involved in setting a headline for the people of the Community. The British Labour Party saw that it would be undesirable from the moral and social point of view that the people should see trade unionists and other members of their party holding down two jobs.  In effect this is what the Irish Labour Party are asking this House to approve today in asking it to select two people who will each hold two jobs.</P>
    <P>At present we have serious economic problems and in a climate where good example should be shown to people throughout the Community it behoves the Irish Labour Party to take an obvious stance in this respect as did their counterparts, the British Labour Party.  Deputy Barry Desmond along with myself on this committee, whose report was published in June 1975, supported each other in this regard.  To ensure that there was a link between the European and the national parliaments the committee recommended that dual membership would be difficult to sustain and that in order to ensure that the knowledge and experience of European affairs should continue to be available to the Houses of the Oireachtas that where a member of the European Parliament is not a Member of the Oireachtas he should be given a right of audience in the Dáil and Seanad and in appropriate committees of both Houses.  The committee believed that this objective could be achieved by making appropriate provisions in the standing orders of both Houses.  The committee concluded that the dual mandate should go and that in its place there should be provision for the right of audience in both Houses of the Oireachtas for members of the European Parliament to make available to them the views of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> The only party who have made an attempt to face up to this is the Fianna Fáil Party.  Of the 15 European Parliament members there are five Fianna Fáil members none of whom is a Member of this House.  That is not just a fortuitous circumstance.  That was a decision reached by the parliamentary party.  For that reason Mr. Noel Davern did not go forward for election to the Dáil, and had Miss Síle de Valera been elected to this House it would have been mandatory on her to give up her European Parliament seat.  Mr. Gerry Cronin, a former Minister, also made a conscious decision not to go forward for the Dáil but to opt for the European Parliament, and Mr. Paddy Lalor, also a former Minister, made a similar decision.  Three of our five members prior to the election opted to stay with the European Parliament and not to contest the general election.  Miss Síle de Valera went forward for election in the knowledge that she would have to give up her European Parliament seat and our fifth Member, Mr. Cronin did not stand in the general election.  Our position is above board.  We came to grips with the reality of performing work effectively in the European Parliament and at home. The contrast is obvious.  Of the four Fine Gael Members of the European Parliament only one chose not to stand in the general election, the former Minister Mr. Mark Clinton.  Deputies O'Donnell, Richie Ryan and McCartin all hold a seat here and one in the European Parliament. The other day Deputy Richie Ryan had to make a hasty exit to the European Parliament because of the ludicrous situation of having to attend two Parliaments, thus helping to reduce the Government majority in the election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is supposed to embrace trade union principles.  All four members of the Labour Party, or three members of the Labour Party and a member who was elected by the Labour Party as Ceann Comhairle, will by reason of this proposal, which merely replaces two Labour Party Deputies, be members of the two Parliaments.</P>
    <Col N="350" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Mr. Cluskey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of Mr. Cluskey, in whose case it was due entirely to an unhappy event at the polls. There was no conscious decision by the Labour Party to ensure that following the election a Deputy would cease to be a member of both Parliaments.  In the case of Mr. Cluskey the fact that he will have only one seat was a fortuitous circumstance. The other three Labour Party members now seek to maintain the impossible dual membership situation, a situation which is substantially aggravated by the increasing pressure of work on the European Parliament.  There is much more committee activity in the European Parliament and they have engaged in a very strenuous battle to strengthen their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other Community institutions.  The European Parliament have not yet achieved their rightful place as one of the key Community institutions.  This Assembly is carrying a substantial burden of work in which Irish interests need to be advanced in a positive manner.  In a situation where we have only 15 out of 410 seats it is incumbent on Irish members who are after all representing a small country with a minority representation in terms of numbers, to be there all the time, to be active in committees and to be in a position to persuade and to make their presence felt.  It is doubly important for the membership of a small country within the European Parliament to be effective.  I speak from experience of membership of the nominative Parliament that existed prior to the directly elected Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the larger countries are concerned, their interests are met by their Governments.  Their Governments are strong and powerful.  Their parliamentary representation is strong as well and the British, French and German interests will be looked after.  But it is of paramount importance for a small country, with a very limited, minority representation such as we have, 15 out of 110, that all members of the European Parliament concentrate on the work of the Parliament, <Col N="351" /> on the committee work, make direct contact with the Commission and Community institutions and the various committees existing within the Community framework.  They just cannot do that work and attend this Dáil.  It is just not possible.  Everybody here who has got one bit of honesty in their hearts and minds will agree with me in that; it is so clear, logical and rational.  It is absolutely certain that there will be massive inattention to the basic detail of work required of these European parliamentarians, particularly by virtue of the present representation we have in this House.  That doubly exacerbates the situation.  As a result of the general election we have now a very tight marginal situation in this House itself, a situation in which the Government are barely able to continue in office, as was seen the other day when the Government were defeated.</P>
    <P>In such a situation European Parliament members will be pulled back for votes and divisions, pulled back and forth between Strasbourg and Dublin, placing them in an impossible situation in which they will be making no contribution in this House or in the Assembly in Strasbourg but will spend most of their time commuting in aeroplanes and hanging around at airports endeavouring to fulfil deadlines in Dublin and Strasbourg.  All we shall have will be wasted manpower, wasted wearing of energies and minds and physique.  That is all we are doing here and everybody knows I am telling the truth.  The Deputies present here &mdash; there is nothing personal in this what-ever; I am talking entirely on a point of principle &mdash; will find this out themselves: that if this Government are to be sustained they will be put under certain pressure, the pressure about which I have been speaking, and will be unable to participate in any meaningful parliamentary work in either the European Assembly or in Dáil Eireann.  Rather will they spend most of their time, unfortunately, going from airport to hotel, back to airport, into aeroplanes, with a double stop from Strasbourg, back to Dublin and then back again.  They will not be able to function physically, mentally or make <Col N="352" /> any sort of meaningful contribution in either Parliament.  Those are the plain facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is very undersirable and sad that this sort of lead should be given to the Irish people at present, a lead which shows that the duties of the European Assembly and of Dáil Éireann are not being taken seriously by the movers of these motions. The business of the two respective institutions, Dáil Éireann and the European Assembly, are not being taken seriously. In addition, a very bad lead is being given to the country as a whole on the basic principle of two people being selected now to hold down two jobs, two jobs they will not be able to discharge effectively and in which they cannot function; two jobs, with two salaries and travelling expenses which will be incurred mainly in ferrying them from one deadline to another in Strasbourg and/or Dublin. They are the basic realities of the situation which cannot be disguised.</P>
    <P>It can be said by Deputies opposite: what alternative was there?  The Seanad is there; it is an obvious alternative.  The Labour Party have, I suppose, two of their outstanding spokesmen in this House now seeking election to Seanad Éireann, former Deputies Horgan and Quinn, two of the best minds the last Dáil experienced sitting in these benches, and I can say that as a person sitting over there answering their very pointed questions day in day out.  These two excellent Deputies, two excellent minds, are now seeking election to Seanad Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate I do not intend to bring the debate down to any level.  I meant very sincerely what I said in regard to Deputies Quinn and Horgan <Col N="353" /> and anybody who sat in these benches, either there or here, would, I am certain, have to agree with me, as I am certain our commentator friends would have to agree with me.  These two gentlemen are available.  They would make excellent European parliamentarians, excellent members of the European Assembly, would be available very shortly to the Labour Party, presuming their election to the Seanad &mdash; as I hope they will both be &mdash; would have made a considerable, real contribution to the affairs of the European Assembly and would not have had the sort of workload or pressure that is involved in membership of this House now, would not have had the same workload or pressure as Members of Seanad Éireann, as we all know, where neither the pressure of business nor of voting is anything like the same as bears comparison with the sort of pressure of business and voting that will operate in terms of the affairs of this current Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there was an &ldquo;out&rdquo; for a sensible Party that wanted to make a sensible contribution to the nation's affairs and to mobilise and deploy their talents in the best possible manner.  That step was not taken.  We are now in a position here where legalistically, and legalistically only, in accordance with section 15 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, the Government can do what they are doing.  But on every other ground, moral, political, social and practical, they are wrong.  I think the Taoiseach knows in his heart of hearts that it is a wrong decision.  I am certain that the Tánaiste knows in his heart of hearts that it is a wrong decision.  Deputy B. Desmond knows it is a wrong decision because he agreed with me, during our joint participation in the affairs of this committee which made its report on direct elections back in 1974.  However, so be it.  What I have said was said on the basis of principle, that this is a wrong step judged by any of the principles I have advanced already.  I want to say again it is in no way intended as a personal reflection on Deputies Treacy or Pattison, no reflection whatever on the personal worth of the Deputies concerned, no reflection on the legal right of this to be <Col N="354" /> introduced; but is altogether wrong on the various bases of principle I have just adumbrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Deputy's remarks.  I think he exaggerated certain points; but basically, of course, we will be moving, and are moving gradually towards the position where the dual mandate will phase itself out. That is happening already.  It has happened more rapidly on the Opposition side of the House by the hazard or chance that at the time when the first European election came they were in Government and we were in Opposition and the choice of candidates influenced by that led to a somewhat different balance or rate of approach to this problem.  It is something that will have to be faced up to fully in due course when the next Parliament is elected under a uniform system if that obligation is adhered to.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks though would have carried more conviction if in Government he and his colleagues had implemented the recommendations of the report to which he referred about the right of audience in this House of people who are not Members of this House but who are members of the European Parliament. That was the correct way to proceed, to introduce that provision, and thus facilitate the gradual phasing out of the dual mandate with the strain it imposes on those concerned.  But that was not done and one wonders why it was not done.  The recommendation is there, the Government had the power, there would certainly have been no objection from our side of the House, on the contrary. I do not think the Deputy's speech carries a lot of credibility when he failed to implement that provision which would have facilitated this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that we would introduce such a provision and that we would have the co-operation of the Opposition in that so that the members of the European Parliament who are not Members of this House would have right of audience here. The main beneficiaries from that as of now would be the Opposition but I see no difficulty about that.  It is a matter we should discuss with each other and try to <Col N="355" /> come to some arrangement.  Unfortunately, as we are more than willing to do that, apparently to facilitate the Opposition party, in Government the present Opposition did nothing about it and we have not got that provision at present, which would have been a step in the direction in which we must gradually move.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much more to be said on the subject.  We will all have to review the position in the light of the development towards a uniform system and whatever may come from that and the problems it will pose for us.  We will all have to follow very closely the debates in the European Parliament on the procedure for the election of the next Parliament. One of the things which concerns me about that is that it may raise a question as to the form of election.  We have a form of election which is unique in the European Community although it exists in a couple of other countries elsewhere in the world.  We are very attached to it. Our people have shown their attachment in two referenda.  It will not be very easy to persuade nine other countries to adopt our system because we think it is the best but there are other systems which we would regard as objectionable.  All that will have to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope our Deputies in the European Parliament will do their best to ensure that we do not have imposed on us the kind of list system which operates in so many of our member countries, which places all power in the hands of the parties as to who is chosen and deprives the people of the free choice of personnel, which is the great characteristic of the Irish political system with all the problems it creates for particular parties.  We all know that there are serious problems. The process of moving towards a new electoral system is one we will have to watch very carefully.  I am sure our representatives in the European Parliament, be they with or without dual mandate, will be unitedly concerned to secure that <Col N="356" /> the electoral system adopted is one compatible with the principle of free choice of individuals, which is the chartacteristic mark of our democracy in this country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of the strain imposed on people who carry the dual mandate.  There is no doubt that there is such a strain and the Deputy is perfectly right in that.  One does not need much imagination, much less experience of being one, to know what is involved. Those who take it on certainly take on a heavy burden but, given that we have not yet introduced any arrangement for right of audience in this House, to break completely the link between this House and the European Parliament, as the Deputy is proposing, would, I believe, be premature. It is important that that link be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the present situation where there is not the kind of liaison between this House and the Parliament which I believe there ought to be.  I am willing to discuss with the Opposition how that is to be done but until it is done I do not think we can contemplate a situation where all the members of the European Parliament would be non-Members of this House, excluded from this House and its committees and divorced completely from the reality of the Departments of this country as they show themselves in the debates in this House and in the committees of this House.  I am afraid the Deputy is being less than honest in this.  His Government failed to take the step necessary to enable this particular gordian knot to be cut in a manner that would not be damaging to the country, through completely breaking off the relationship between our parliamentary system and the European Parliament. Having failed to do that, to suggest that it should be done by a process of eliminating any contact at all and by having only as members of the European Parliament people who are not Members of this House is, I believe, unjustified.  The Deputy is in a very weak position to make that case as a member of a Government which failed to implement the report of that committee as part of a general failure to do anything very <Col N="357" /> much in their period in office in other spheres as well.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of the pressures on members of the European Parliament being pulled back for votes in this House and so on.  I hope that this situation will not arise and that the normal courtesies will be extended by the Opposition to enable this country to be represented adequately abroad and that there will be no attempt to abuse their position by venting the attendance of the members at the European Parliament&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure that will not happen and that goodwill will prevail in this matter and that where it is necessary for official pairings for Ministers who are members of the Council of Europe in committee or the European Parliament that the Opposition will continue to cooperate so that, pending the adjustment of the rules of this House and the subsequent movement away from dual mandate, we will be able to secure that our interests are adequately represented in Europe and the linkage with this House maintained.  There is nothing more to be said on the matter but I look forward to entering into discussions as soon as possible with the Opposition on the question of facilitating the right of audience for non-members of this House who are members of the European Parliament so that that particular obstacle may be overcome. That would certainly make it easier for us to move away from a dual mandate.  That is something which we have to face and which all parties have begun to face in varying degrees, the Deputy's party more rapidly than ours because of the particular moment at which this question originated and the type of choice of candidates which that brought about in the case of what were then the Government and what were then the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The second national understanding provides for a Government contribution to a new Employment Guarantee Fund, and the previous Government were committed to making £10 million available for that purpose.  This Government are prepared to fulfil that commitment.</P>
      <P>While the text of the second national understanding speaks of a new Employment Guarantee Fund, no practical purpose would be served by setting up an entirely new fund, rather than extending the existing fund, and there would be considerable administrative complications in doing this.  I am satisfied, there-fore, that the best way of fulfilling the commitment under the second national understanding is to provide further resources for the existing fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill then, is to amend the Employment Guarantee Fund <Col N="359" /> Act, 1980, so as to permit a further Exchequer contribution of £10 million to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the second national understanding.  It is proposed to amend section 4 of the 1980 Act so as to increase the limit on the amount which may be paid into the Employment Guarantee Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas from £10 million to £20 million.  Amendments to section 7 of the 1980 Act are also required so as to provide for:</P>
    <P>(i)  an increase of the limit on aggregate payments out of the Employment Guarantee Fund from £20 million to £30 million;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the winding-up of the Employment Guarantee Fund when the aggregate expenditure from the fund reaches £30 million, instead of £20 million as provided for in the 1980 Act.</P>
    <P>The Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding comprised a Government contribution of £10 million and an employer contribution &mdash;also of £10 million.  This latter contribution was collected by means of a 0.35 per cent surcharge on the employer social security contribution for the period 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981.</P>
    <P>The £20 million which accrued to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding has all been allocated for a very wide variety of job-creating projects.  Some of the more important of these were the following:</P>
    <P>Five million pounds was allocated for the employers' temporary subvention scheme for the textiles, clothing and footwear sectors.  This replaced the employment maintenance scheme, which had been terminated following objections to the scheme on the grounds that it represented a distortion of competition contrary to the Treaty of Rome.  It operated from April to December 1980 and both employer and labour interests have testified to its importance in securing employment in sensitive and vulnerable sectors.  It <Col N="360" /> has been succeeded by the employers' employment contribution scheme, which I will further comment on shortly.</P>
    <P>£3.5 million was allocated for the national programme for the provision of sports and recreational facilities throughout the country.  In recent years there has been an increasing awareness of the value of physical recreation in our daily lives and the response to the national programme at local level has been extremely enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>£2 million was allocated towards an exchange risk guarantee scheme operated by the Industrial Credit Company in respect of borrowing in foreign currencies to provide additional working capital for small-to-medium sized firms in manufacturing industry.  This scheme had the purpose of facilitating the creation and maintenance of employment in small manufacturing concerns and in labour intensive industries and was adopted in response to repeated demands for such a scheme from the Confederation of Irish Industry and other bodies.</P>
    <P>£2.3 million was made available for the environment improvement scheme which provided valuable employment opportunities for young people on work designed to improve local environmental amenities thus making Ireland a cleaner and more attractive place in which to live and, equally important, to visit.</P>
    <P>£1 million was made available as supplementary finance for the temporary grant scheme for youth employment which is administered by the Department of Education and was introduced in early 1977.  This money was distributed through the national governing bodies of youth and sports organisations for the employment of young people on desirable small scale projects in youth and sports clubs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Almost £1 million was given to Bord Fáilte for the creation of employment <Col N="361" /> through the provision of a wide range of tourist and recreational facilities. The most important of the projects being undertaken under this heading is the development of a caravan and camping park in Curraghchase Forest Park, some ten miles south of Limerick city.  This development is sponsored by Shannonside Tourism and will provide a focus for visitors to that part of the country, especially young visitors.</P>
    <P>A total of almost £1 million was made available for the development of airport facilities in Sligo and Waterford. Both of these new regional airports will be operational by the end of this year and will enhance the attractions of Sligo and Waterford as centres for industrial development and for tourism.</P>
    <P>There is a total of 33 projects aided from the original provision of £20 million in the Employment Guarantee Fund.  Those which I have mentioned are the most important and they show, I believe, the positive contribution which the Employment Guarantee Fund has made and will continue to make.</P>
    <P>Employment created as a result of expending the original £20 million accruing to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding will amount to 2,800 man-years of employment approximately.  Of these, 1,800 man-years arose in 1980 and 1,000 in 1981.  Employment arising from the further Exchequer contribution to the fund of £10 million will be additional to this.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the uses to which the further sum of £10 million for the fund provided for under this Bill, the Government will consult with employer and trade union representatives.  The close involvement of the social partners in the allocation of the original £20 million accruing to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the first national understanding partly arose because, as previously mentioned, the employers were contributing 50 per cent of the available moneys. There will be no employer contribution to the Employment Guarantee Fund under the second national understanding; <Col N="362" /> the Government will alone contribute. However, employers will contribute voluntarily 0.2 per cent of payroll towards financing a further new scheme of aid to sensitive and vulnerable sectors. This scheme, which will be known as the employers' employment contribution scheme, replaces the employers' temporary subvention scheme funded from the Employment Guarantee Fund.  It received the approval of this House before the dissolution.  It operates independently of the Employment Guarantee Fund and is administered by the employer organisations themselves.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that this Government look forward to fruitful dialogue with the social partners.  There are many features of the common programme agreed by the two parties represented in this Government which meet concerns felt by either or both employers and workers.  The appointment of my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, as Minister for Labour and Minister for the Public Service is further evidence of this Government's determination to approach our dealings with the social partners in a realistic and constructive manner.  I would hope that, given the seriousness of our economic problems, we will meet with a similar response.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see Deputy Fitzgerald in the House this morning.  I appreciate the enormous pressures he must have been under in relation to previous disbursements from the fund.  On behalf of the Minister for Finance I must say that at the moment we are not entering into an absolute commitment in regard to the £10 million disbursement.  We must have a look at the situation.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who brought great pressure to bear on the previous Minister. I was chairman of Dublin County Council and we were screaming for additional moneys from the Department of Finance.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation were also looking for money, temporary subventions.  Now there is a new situation because there is an additional £10 million. The Minister will have to assess any outstanding demands and any new claims and we will endeavour to put forward in the near future a complete list of proposals <Col N="363" /> for the expenditure of that money.  I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for his understanding, and for his work when he was faced with a similar situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, I support the Bill but before going on to speak on it, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish you success in an office which is at all times difficult, but probably more so on this occasion with a hung and uncertain Government.  I wish you every success in that exalted seat.  Likewise I congratulate Deputy Desmond, the Minister of State.  For a number of years we spoke to each other across the House and although we may have crossed swords I do not think we ever sank them too deeply. Some within the House, and outside, are probably disappointed that Deputy Desmond did not get a higher posting because his contribution here over the years no doubt appeared to have entitled him to a senior Cabinet post.  I wish him well in his new role as a Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this Bill, one could say the Employment Guarantee Fund has been the baby of the national understanding. The first one which was negotiated in 1979 produced the Employment Guarantee Fund and, as the Minister says, a different concept of joint funding by Government on one hand and the employers to a contribution of .35 per cent from the other side.  In the second national understanding, which I had the honour of negotiating, a further commitment was made in the Employment Guarantee Fund.  I agree with the concept of this Bill, being an amendment of the 1980 Act, to add an additional £10 million.  It is an extremely important aspect of funding today.  I have described how it was introduced and I would ask the Minister of State to convey to the new Minister for Finance the view that it is a method of funding that could be described as a strategic arrangement. There is a reference in the original Bill, in section 3, that the Minister should apply the moneys to the credit of the fund for the purpose of defraying expenditure on projects or schemes which in his opinion would result in the creation of additional <Col N="364" /> employment or maintenance of existing employment.  That is why I say that one could describe it as a strategic fund, not funding in the normal way.  It has been used well already and I sincerely hope it will be used just as well in the future.  On this side of the House we shall be acting as watchdogs to ensure that the Government have meaningful consultations with both sides of industry in regard to initiatives of this nature.  I have no doubt about the commitment of the Minister here in that regard and I hope that all his Cabinet colleagues subscribe to the same idea to the same extent as I know he does.  Time will tell if this is so.  We shall keep a very close eye on the disbursement of this fund, on consultations regarding it and other aspects of the national understanding itself since this fund was born of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should refer to some points mentioned by the Minister in his introductory speech.  He said that in last year's fund £5 million was provided for the temporary subvention scheme for employers in the clothing, footwear and textile industries.  I say with pride and claim credit for the fact that in 1978 we in Government introduced a scheme of this nature.  We had some difficulty with it on the ground of its acceptability to Brussels. After a period of operation subsequently with the co-operation of trade unions and employers we succeeded last year in having acceptance again in Brussels of the employers' temporary subvention scheme.</P>
    <P>This year another difficulty arose because specifically the allocation under this fund and the acceptance of it in Brussels had come to an end and could not be renewed.  Many hours of difficult and delicate negotiations took place, here with the employer organisations and in Brussels with the Community.  I thank all concerned there for eventually reaching an arrangement whereby £6.5 million is being provided through employers' contributions to a separate employers' fund to aid ailing industries.  Having experienced the effort put in by those people I want to pay a very sincere tribute to all concerned because we had many difficulties <Col N="365" /> to overcome and many delicate situations to negotiate, involving many hours of effort.  I compliment and thank all concerned for their help and co-operation in the introduction and implementation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a voluntary contribution of .2 per cent.  The .35 per cent we spoke about died with the expiration of the original guarantee fund.  I wonder how much more we shall hear in the coming weeks about contributions because we have had a number of manifestos and we had talk of a 1 per cent employment contribution&mdash;I am not sure by whom or whether it is to be confined to the PAYE sector or will it include others&mdash;a health contribution charge of 1.5 per cent and a contribution of 3.75 per cent on earnings over £8,500.  The public and this House are very interested in all these and want to know what will be the likely outcome in the coming weeks.  Concern is being expressed.  We all agree about the necessity for job creation and maintaining employment.  Our young, growing population need it.  But because of confusion existing from two manifestos, one presented by each party in Government to the electorate and another which was never voted on by the people prepared at the Gaiety Theatre, it is time that the House and the public were made aware of all that is meant by these charges.</P>
    <P>There was another very valuable contribution from last year's fund to sports facilities and youth amenities so badly needed in urban and rural Ireland.  I got acceptance and agreement for it and I do not think the Minister opposite can avoid it.  I made a commitment that money would again be available this year for such facilities because I believe they are a top priority.  It is extremely important that we provide as far as possible for our young and growing population and support particularly communities that are doing something themselves.  We should provide all the facilities we can for all groups in our society but particularly for the young.  A happier and healthier society can prevent the type of development we have seen in places such as Liverpool recently.</P>
    <P>I gave my blessing in other areas such <Col N="366" /> as that involving Córas Tráchtála.  The Minister will have seen how our exports have grown this year and how much more potential for export growth there is and the contibution this can make towards employment as it is making and has been making.  In my time as Minister for Labour there was another institution I respected because of its type of administration and its governing body drawn from trade unions and employers.  I refer to the Irish Productivity Centre which have been doing and continue to do valuable work in many different areas.  They act in an advisory capacity to small and medium companies and engage in exploratory work, advisory work and in worker participation schemes.  Other projects were assisted also.</P>
    <P>I believe the concept was a good one. It formed part of the national understanding and it is important that this year meaningful consultations take place with the participants in the national understanding.  We need not have a tripartite committee operating the fund as we had in the past because of the new arrangement with a Government contribution only but that does not mean that worthwhile and meaningful consultations should not take place.  The disbursement of the fund to date has been wise and I should like to take the opportunity of thanking both bodies for their assistance and co-operation in the disbursement of the fund to certain projects.  I have no doubt that pressures will be brought to bear on the Minister, as happened in the past.  How does one advise the Minister in this regard?  He should use his expertise and experience to see how best the most deserving and productive project from an employment and maintenance point of view can be supported.</P>
    <P>That is the best advice I can give the Minister and I should like to remind him that in regard to such matters he will find us, as always, constructive in our approach.  We may be critical at times but we will not be critical for the sake of being critical.  I should like to repeat the words used by our Leader on the opening of the Dáil, &ldquo;without personal rancour&rdquo;. We saw too much of that from those now <Col N="367" /> in Government when they were in Opposition. We will never sink to such depths and the Minister can rest assured of our support for any worth-while projects.  We will criticise those we consider not worth while but we will tell him how they can be improved.  Above all, we will adopt a watchdog role to ensure and insist that efforts are made to assist in the creation of employment at all levels and for all age groups but in particular for our young and growing population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which seeks to provide necessary finance.  There is a need to ensure that the finance when made available is utilised in conjunction with the National Manpower Service. That body should play a greater role in ensuring that young people who have not yet drawn a wage packet&mdash;I am referring to those between the ages of 17 and 21&mdash;are employed on environmental schemes or other schemes operated by local authorities from this fund.  The National Manpower Service should have a say in placing young people who are deprived of work in employment for a period.  If that is one of the results of the establishment of the fund I will accept that it is worth while.  The National Manpower Service is engaged in a cosmetic exercise rather than being in a position to place people in employment.  The service should have a say in the placing of people in employment when money is made available by the State to create jobs.  I do not agree with the system we have whereby employers advise applicants that they must register with the National Manpower Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in congratulating the new Minister on his appointment.  I assure him that we will be constructively critical as he was when he was a very active Member in Opposition. I was following his script in the course of his delivery and I noted that he said, &ldquo;Finally, I should like to say that this Government look forward to continued fruitful dialogue with the social partners&rdquo; but the word &ldquo;continued&rdquo; was not in the script.  It is a great tribute to the Fianna <Col N="368" /> Fáil Government that they had excellent working relations with the social partners, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers and the farming organisations.  We held regular meetings with those groups and discussed all the problems of the economy. I have no doubt that the Minister will ensure that such dialogue will continue because unless there is a proper working relationship between the Government and the social partners the Government cannot work properly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure before the House.  Each year approximately 64,000 young people come on to the labour market and when we realise that at the other end of the scale the number of people who retire, leave employment or die is not sufficient to cater for the number coming on to the labour market, we must admit that we have a social problem.  It was for that reason that Fianna Fáil in Government introduced various programmes to create employment for young people.  One of the reasons why the number of unemployed is so great today is because of a growing population. Even though the number of new jobs created by Fianna Fáil in the last four years was the highest since the foundation of the State, it did not take up the rapid growth in our population.  While in office Fianna Fáil introduced five special schemes which I should like to refer to, the Community Youth Training Programme under AnCO, the Temporary Grant Scheme for Youth Employment, operated by the Department of Education, the environmental improvement schemes, the work experience programme of the Department of Labour and the employers' employment contribution scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AnCO training programme was established to give extra training opportunities to young people.  It was designed specifically to supplement AnCO's existing training programme by offering opportunities to young unemployed people up to 20 years of age with no previous work experience.  When they took full-time employment they had experience of work.  In 1980, 2,071 people availed of that programme and most <Col N="369" /> of those remained in employment after the period of training.  The temporary grant scheme for youth employment operated by the Department of Education provided for the payment of grants to youth and sports organisations.  I do not think anybody knows more about that scheme than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I should like to pay tribute to him for the wonderful work he did in that field.  In 1981, 1,850 people participated in that scheme.</P>
    <P>The other schemes implemented by local authorities are well known to the Members of this House.  We also had the work experience programme administered by the National Manpower Service. That programme was designed to help unemployed young people under 25 years of age but particularly those in the 18 to 20 age group, who were experiencing difficulty in securing suitable permanent employment to gain practical experience of working life which is a valuable asset to them when seeking full-time employment. The throughput in that field in 1980 was 7,258.  I do not want to go into any further detail in connection with the most recent scheme introduced where employers will provide a total of approximately £8 million towards funding employment and preventing redundancies in what we call the sensitive industries such as textiles, footwear, leather and so on except to put on the record our appreciation of the fact that they are providing that fund. We know that the net figure will be £6.5 million because a portion of that must be paid by way of tax to comply with the community regulations.  But we on this side of the House appreciate the wonderful co-operation we got from the Federated Union of Employers in preventing further redundancies and a further number of people going on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>Recently of course the OECD have been carrying out a survey in connection with the problems of youth unemployment. Indeed they are doing it in several countries.  It was one of my last functions as Minister for Labour to have the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Shirley Williams with her team of advisers to discuss in general the problems in relation to youth unemployment. <Col N="370" /> I will be looking forward, and I am sure the Minister will, to the report of the OECD when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>Ní mór dom ar dtús comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leat as ucht gur toghadh thú mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle ar an Dáil seo.  Déanaim comhghairdeas chomh maith leis an Aire Stáit.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé sár-obair san Roinn sin.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few observations on the relevance of the Bill before us now. It is welcome for a number of reasons but principally for its ongoing commitment to activity that was provided for by the previous administration.  Many aspects of the Bill commend themselves.  I am glad the new administration is honouring the increased commitment of £10 million made by the Fianna Fáil administration. The amount of activity and work created by this Employment Guarantee Fund and the input by the social partners to it must be one of the best things that has happened to this country for a number of years.  National understandings, as negotiated by the social partners, were so effective and so beneficial to so many people that I certainly hope that we will be able to continue to have these agreements and understandings for the economic benefit of all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the young people in our society of which there are growing numbers year by year.  In making reference to national resources I contend that one of the best national resources we have here is our young population.  I believe that other nations around the world, though they may not say so, are envious of that national asset that we have.  But it is incumbent on the Oireachtas to provide for the future of those young people.  The Employment Guarantee Fund of which we are speaking today, and the activity of the Department of Labour, will have to be watched very carefully and constructively criticised where necessary to ensure that all of its activities are designed and are followed through to help these young people.  As one associated with young people for many years through sporting activities, I truly realise the need to provide an outlet <Col N="371" /> for their energies and also an outlet for their education.  Many of them now have access to these at third level.  My generation did not have free access to these.  It is a good thing that we can now have available free second level education for our young people.  It would be a pity if with the expense incurred in the provision of that, the employment structure did not adequately and sufficiently cater for these young people, whether they leave school at second level or pursue third level education.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and totally desirable that the trend of graduates leaving the country to seek employment in other countries would be stopped and that we, beyond the economic sense, would have the benefit of the education that we have provided for them and that they too would have a bit of national pride in a nation that was well prepared and is being prepared for them.  It will be up to us to see to it that they are properly provided for and cared for.</P>
    <P>It must be said that in the past few years, with the changing style of technology here and around the world, the efforts of the Department of Labour through the National Manpower Service and the AnCO Training Service, have filled a void in technical training.  Technology that was needed had not, perhaps been provided for before then.  In this respect the Department have done tremendous work in recent years.</P>
    <P>In talking about young people.  I am convinced that there was a loss to the programming for the development of our nation because of the inability of the previous administration to take a census when it was due to be taken.  We have suffered in the calculations and the projections that would accrue from the taking of such census.  I hope we can recover from that unfortunate incident.  With such a rapidly changing shift of population and the increase in the number of young people, it is vital for Departments of State to have the relevant data available to them in order to plan ahead.  The fact that the census was not taken at that time was damaging to the economy.  I hope we will never again refuse to have <Col N="372" /> a census of population conducted just for the sake of £1 million.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the allocation of £1 million in respect of the temporary grants scheme for youth employment administered by the Department of Education.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle had responsibility previously for that scheme and the money was well spent. Getting young people to involve themselves in the provision of their own community centres and recreational facilities is of tremendous value of them.  I am glad to see that the scheme is being continued. With regard to money from the scheme that was given to local authorities &mdash; I am speaking of a local authority of which I am a member &mdash; they failed to spend all of the money.  I was disappointed that happened and the necessary steps will be taken at local level to ensure it does not recur.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthy of our support.  It is a continuation of the work of the previous administration.  That good work was started by the two former Ministers in the Department of Labour with the assistance of the former Minister for Finance who gave the money.  We will pay special attention to ensure that work on the various schemes is continued.  I hope the money guarantees will be kept and that the Employment Guarantee Fund is extended and developed.</P>
    <P>Money has been provided to help the textile industry.  As far as I know the relevant scheme was introduced in 1979 and, if I may be permitted to be a little parochial, I am sorry it was not introduced earlier.  In the area I represent a textile industry that had existed for 250 years of trading went to the wall in the mid-1970s.  If a scheme such as the Employment Guarantee Fund had been in existence at that time some 500 jobs could have been saved.  However, that is history.  I wish the Minister of State every success.  I assure him of our support and of our constructive criticism when it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Fitzgerald and my colleagues in the House for their good <Col N="373" /> wishes in my future work.  They were much appreciated.  I should like to make some general observations on the overall operation of the scheme to date.  With regard to future disbursement of the £10 million, there is a serious need to re-examine the general criteria under which disbursements are made.  It might be argued that in regard to the maintenance of employment at local authority level the appropriate disbursement would be through the Department of the Environment and that the Estimate for that Department would be the most appropriate budgetary method of meeting shortfalls in employment targets within local authorities or in dealing with major dangers of loss of employment in local government.  It might be argued that where major job maintenance crises arise within industries the disbursements and assistance should be administered by State agencies.  With regard to the provisions of sports and recreational facilities, it may be that the allocations concerned would be most effectively dealt with through the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I say this because it is inevitable that, where a fund of this nature is established, where it is administered by a tripartite standing committee of Government, employers and trade unions and where the Minister for Finance is subjected to enormous pressures from a range of interests and when he has a limited amount of money available, inevitably political criteria and pressures build up to such an extent that the fundamental purpose of such a scheme which should relate to job creation and particular aspects of job maintenance is changed. There is need to re-evaluate the criteria of disbursement.  In relation to previous commitments entered into by the former Government which did not necessarily have formal sanction for payment these will have to be examined by the Minister. He asked me to make that point and it is important that I should so stress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to various State agencies seeking money, whether CTT, or Bord Fáilte, the appropriate method of disbursement is through their respective <Col N="374" /> Departments and departmental Estimate. I speak as one who has recently examined the situation.  I was one of the culprits in seeking support from that fund as chairman of Dublin County Council. We could have a situation where the real purpose of departmental Estimates, disbursements and assistance to State agencies in the work of job maintenance and protection could become so diffused that one would literally have Ministers sitting around trying to get a few bob for their areas.  That is not the way to do it.  Perhaps there are areas where there is no other recourse available except through the fund and then the fund could usefully come into play.  We must distinguish between the areas of job creation, which are unique in themselves, job protection which is different and job maintenance which is again different.</P>
    <P>If we are caught up in a situation where we spend some money on building an airport, a few bob in helping one industry to maintain employment and some money to build a sporting complex, the original purpose of the fund as set out under the national understanding, to meet shortfalls in employment targets, becomes diffused and subjected to political criteria rather than objective criteria for the development of job creation.  I make these points in a general response to the overall position.  I am speaking in a rather <i>ex tempore</i> fashion.  That kind of fund, the operation of the national understanding, the £20 million which is disbursed and the additional £10 million, is purely an <i>ad hoc</i> measure unless it is integrated into a national planning strategy.</P>
    <P>I can say, without any political rancour, to the former Minister for Finance that I was very taken aback and rather appalled that on going to the Department I found that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, had dismembered and scattered to the four winds the economic planning functions of the Department.</P>

      <P>I repeat what I said earlier.  Section 1 in this Act, the Act of 1980, means the Employment Guarantee Fund Act of 1980.  I believe the disbursement of the fund was done in a wise way.  I remember Deputy Desmond and others made representations to all three parties associated with that fund. Despite the Minister's comments, it was a wise decision to allocate some additional funds as they were allocated to Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation. Deputy Desmond said there would be a whole new look at this.  I made a commitment and I stand over it.  It is important in the context of the young <Col N="376" /> people because no Government prior to the last Fianna Fáil administration gave any worthwhile assistance to sporting facilities, community amenities or sporting complexes for young people.</P>
      <P>An adequate tribute was paid to you, Sir, by some of my colleagues that you, during your time in the Department of Education, stood as someone who did more for youth than any predecessor in any office simply because of various funds made available by the Fianna Fáil Government. I would hate to think that any new administration would now so soon depart from that very valuable contribution to young people.  That money should be provided again in consultation and by agreement with the social partners.</P>
      <P>I repeat points I made earlier about CTT and IPC.  I would hate to think there would be any watering down or standing back from the progress made during the last Government's term of office in the provision of facilities for young people. We have recently seen riots develop in other cities and we wonder why.  Perhaps policies might have contributed to them. It is not for me to say.  We have a responsibility to our young people.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide, in line with the announcement already made by the Government, a measure of protection for tenants who have been affected by the recent Supreme Court judgment on the constitutionality of parts of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  It is an emergency measure designed to deal with an immediate and acute social problem within the confines set by the Supreme Court decision. At the outset, I should say that I do not see the Bill as a final answer to the problems of the rent controlled sector.  The Bill is a temporary measure which is to run for a period of six months from the day that it is passed.  I intend to introduce a more substantive measure in due course to deal with the problems of this area. For the moment we are faced with the need to deal with particular and immediate problems arising out of the Supreme Court's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 June last the Supreme Court gave a judgment which declared unconstitutional Parts II and IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  These parts control rents and restrict the landlord's right to recover possession of controlled dwellings. They are at the very core of the <Col N="378" /> Rent Restrictions Code and provide the basic protection for an estimated 30,000 tenants of controlled dwellings.  In essence the Supreme Court held that rent control as set out in Part II of the 1960 Act was contrary to the provisions of Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  This Article requires the State in its laws &ldquo;to protect from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Part II of the 1960 Act was adjudged an unjust attack on these rights in that it restricted the rights of one group of citizens for the benefit of another, without compensation, with no process of review, without regard to the financial circumstances of the parties involved, with no limit on the period of restriction and allowing for no modification of the operation of the restriction.  This, the Supreme Court considered both arbitrary and unfair and in consequence an unjust attack on property rights.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the 1980 Act essentially fell because it was considered to be so closely connected with the rent control provisions as to have no independent life of its own.  Once Part II was declared unconstitutional it followed that Part IV should also be unconstitutional.  Apart from their comments on the Rent Restrictions Acts themselves the Supreme Court also referred to the need for new legislation which could be expected to provide for the determination of fair rents, for a degree of security of tenure and for other relevant social and economic factors.</P>
    <P>The effect of the decision is that these tenants occupying dwellings at relatively low rents will, in the absence of action by the Oireachtas, be faced with major increases in rents and in certain cases with demands from the landlord for possession of the dwelling.  Many of the tenants involved are elderly or otherwise among the poorer sections of the community and need additional legislative protection.  This was alluded to in the Supreme Court's judgment itself which spoke of a statutory void to deal with which it assumed new legislation would be speedily enacted.  In this context the Supreme Court recommended that the <Col N="379" /> courts in dealing with applications for a decree for possession arising out of the judgment should, in the reasonable expectation of new legislation, where justice so warrants, either adjourn the case or grant a decree for possession with such stays as appear proper in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill effectively puts the Supreme Court's recommendation on a statutory footing.  The Bill before the House is designed to ensure that for six months tenants will be secure in the possession of their dwellings and not have to pay increases in their rents.  The Bill achieves this object by reintroducing the restrictions on the landlord's right to recover possession of a dwelling which were contained in section 29 of the 1960 Act, and by making rent increases notified after 18 April 1980, the date of the High Court decision on the case, irrecoverable in law. The effect of the two sections will be to restore to tenants a substantial level of protection.</P>
    <P>The six-month period of the operation of this Bill will enable the Government to consider what future action in this area is called for and to prepare appropriate legislation.  In doing so, regard must be had to the terms of and reasoning behind the Supreme Court's decision.  In connection with future action, I think it appropriate at this point to refer to our Programme for Government in which we have put forward proposals on the rented sector of housing.  We have undertaken to ensure fixity of tenure for existing tenants in rent controlled accommodation and to provide a scheme to subsidise rents where they are beyond the means of existing tenants.</P>
    <P>In the wider context, it is the Government's intention to set up a mechanism to fix rents which will be fair to both landlord and tenant, to establish a tenant's right to a written lease and to provide a tax allowance for tenants of private rented accommodation.  While these are matters which do not arise out of this Bill, they are the considerations which will direct future Government action in this area.  Our immediate concern is with a major social problem which requires <Col N="380" /> immediate action.  I accordingly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment to the Department of the Environment.  I wish him well.  His experience as a member of a local authority and the way he represented the people of Dublin in his term as Lord Mayor augur well for his future behaviour in the Department of the Environment.  On a very personal basis I wish Deputy O'Brien well as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>He is very fortunate to have the advice of such a fine body of civil servants as are in the Department of the Environment. As Minister for the Environment until Tuesday of last week, I can say that in the eight months period I was there I never failed to be amazed at the courtesy, advice and loyalty of the civil service. They were superb.  I should like to take this opportunity to put on the record of the House my appreciation of the civil service in general.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It was prepared by our Government in anticipation of the Supreme Court decision which was handed down eventually on 29 June.  The decision of the court, which declared that Parts II and IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, are unconstitutional, has the potential of being the single biggest element of social distress ever arising from a court decision.  The Bill attempts to tackle this problem, albeit by way merely of a holding operation for six months.</P>
      <P>I should like to expand on why I consider that decision to have this potential for causing distress.  The Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 is entitled:</P>
      <P>An Act to make provision for restricting the increase of rent and the recovery of possession of premises in certain cases and to provide for other matters connected therewith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control effected by the Act is said, in the judgment of the Supreme Court, to extend to between 45,000 and 50,000 dwellings.  In the estimation of the Minister of State and of the Department, the <Col N="381" /> number is 30,000.  This represents a considerable gap between the two figures and it is something that I should like the Minister of State to refer to when he is replying.</P>
    <P>The problem arising from the court decision is that the vast majority of those dwellings affected by the decision are occupied by elderly people who are on fixed incomes, mainly pensions.  These people will not be in a position to meet the vastly increased rents likely to be demanded by the landlords.  In addition, these elderly people are the least well equipped, either mentally or legally, to handle the distress caused by the threat of eviction from their homes.  We must remember that the dwellings in question are mainly pre-1940 dwellings.  It is a source of major concern in this House that so many people in these circumstances should find themselves facing eviction or, if not, the payment of vastly increased rents.  I regret deeply that the court in its wisdom did not not accept the case of the Attorney General.  He made the case that the legislation which the Supreme Court was deciding on should be examined for invalidity under Article 43 of the Constitution. Section 2 of that article provides for the regulation and delimitation of property rights in accordance with the principles of social justice and the exigencies of the common good.  Section 1º of Article 43 reads:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, had the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
    <P>Section 2º of that Article reads:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
    <P>Section 2. 1º reads:</P>
    <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>The same Article at 2º provides that:</P>
    <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise <Col N="382" /> of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General said that this impugned legislation is justified by section 2º of Article 43 and accordingly no question of non-compliance with that Article arises.  He said that the power of regulation or of dealing with the rights of private property is vested in the Oireachtas by reason of Article 6 of the Constitution and that it is to be presumed that, in exercising that power in relation to Article 43, the Oireachtas in acting <i>intra vires</i> and with due regard to the direct principles of social justice as set out in Article 45 which are not cognisable by any court, and that the court's power to condemn this legislation under Article 43 cannot arise unless it is shown that it is not permitted by Article 43.2º.  The Attorney General said that what the Oireachtas had done is permitted by Article 43.2º and that no question of injustice requiring State action under that provision can arise.  He went on to say that Part II of the Act must be tested for constitutional validity and that it cannot be held to have lost that validity by the mere passage of time or by changes in economic circumstances, which is central to the whole judgment, and that even if the State had any duty to review rent control, it did so in 1967 and again in 1971.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Supreme Court did not agree with that submission but by rejecting the Attorney General's case and declaring both Parts II and IV of the Act to be unconstitutional, the court in its judgment, at least recognised the very special feature of this case and the particular social problems that it would cause.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the observations made by the Supreme Court in its judgment.  The judges said that in the particular instance of this case, because of the special features of it and because of the consequences involved, the court considered that some further observations were called for.  They observed that the removal from the affected tenants of the degree of security of possession and rent control which they have enjoyed up to now would leave a statutory void.  We <Col N="383" /> are attempting today, albeit on a very temporary basis to fill that void.  The court assumed that the situation created would receive immediate attention and that the relevant legislation could be expected to provide for the determination of fair rents, for a degree of security of tenure and for other relevant social and economic factors.</P>
    <P>That section of the court's judgment vindicates totally the decision of the previous Government to introduce a Bill. That decision was announced on 29 June. It also vindicates the decision of this Government to bring this Bill before the House.  As the Minister of State has said, this temporary measure awaits the consideration of both the implication of the judgment and the long-term measures that are to be taken.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to inform the House as to the type of measures he intends taking.  He refers to the Gaiety Theatre document in which he says is an undertaking to ensure fixity of tenure for tenants in rent-controlled accommodation. This party will be seeking and demanding that such measures will be provided because this whole question is basic to the social structure of so many of our cities and towns.  We will be fighting hard for the implementation of these measures when the new Bill is before us.</P>
    <P>It would be nonsensical to provide a section which would guarantee fixity of tenure without introducing also a section which would provide for a scheme of fair and reasonable rents and which would provide a scheme to subsidise rents in the event of the less well off not being able to meet their rent demands.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister of State spell out exactly what he has in mind for the legislation which will be brought in, rather than merely referring to the Gaiety Theatre document when he says it will provide a scheme to subsidise rents beyond the means of existing tenants? How does he see this operating?  Does he intend that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will be used or is there to be a special fund set up?  How is this to <Col N="384" /> be financed?  It is difficult to see, although I admit that at the time of drafting this legislation we in Government had in mind using the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as a system of subsidisation of the excessive rents which were envisaged.  The Minister should spell this out, not just for the benefit of the House but for the 45,000 to 50,000 people involved, who are suffering mental torture arising from the Supreme Court decision.  Many of them are old people who are not used to dealing with the courts and the laws of the land and with this threat of eviction.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to a mechanism to fix rents which would be fair both to the landlord and to the tenant. I compliment the Minister on the idea of the mechanism.  It is something we will be seeking in the further Bill which the Minister's Government will have to introduce.  We will be looking for uncomplicated but effective machinery, uncomplicated to the extent that it will not create mental or legal difficulties for the tenants; uncomplicated in the sense that the tenant who has a disagreement with the landlord, or <i>vice versa</i>, can have it settled satisfactorily in a non-legalistic way to bring to a conclusion any disagreements between tenants and landlords. I envisage that this mechanism would be extended, not only to deal with the problems of rent but also to deal with the problems of repairs to property and any other matters which cause difficulties between the landlord and tenant.  The whole relationship between the landlord and tenant should be directed by this mechanism to be set up.  Would the Minister of State expand on the section of his speech which referred to the mechanism? He also referred to the Gaiety Theatre document and the tax allowance for tenants of privately rented accommodation. I have a question about that on the Order Paper for later on.  I will wait for the reply from the Minister for Finance to that question.</P>
    <P>There is also a reference in the Gaiety Theatre document to a fair rents tribunal. Would the Minister of State give the details so far worked out on this fair rents tribunal?  When does he envisage it being <Col N="385" /> brought into operation?  Is it intended to use it for tenants caught up by this court decision?  Does he intend to extend the operation of the tribunal to previously decontrolled tenancies?</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming legislation we will be seeking a proper system of registration for all landlords.  This register will be of major benefit to the community and to tenants for the future in their properties. Whether the register will be run at a national or local level is a matter for the Minister to decide but it must be fully comprehensive and list all landlords in the country.  With regard to the Bill itself, section 4 refers to the increase in rent being unenforceable for six months.  I admit this was a problem when I was involved in the drafting of the legislation as to how it was going to operate.  The fact that it is unenforceable is one thing but it does not say in the legislation that rents cannot be increased.  It will mean that the follow-up legislation will have to come much faster than the six months envisaged in the legislation before us today.  I hope the Minister of State will expand on the operation of section 4, from the point of view of both the landlord and the tenant.</P>
    <P>Have the Government given consideration to the submission that is reported to have been made by a spokesman on behalf of the landlords who, I understand, has requested the President to refuse to sign this Bill, pending either a meeting of the Council of State or its referral to the Supreme Court as to its constitutionality?  It would be in the interests of the tenants, those people I referred to earlier, who are suffering such distress at this stage because this legislation has not yet been passed and because all the publicity that the spokesman on behalf of the landlords has received with regard to his submission to the President, if the Minister of State spelled out the course of action which his Government intend taking if the President decides to send this to the Supreme Court and if the Supreme Court gives an immediate ruling that the Bill is unconstitutional.  I am not a lawyer but I do not think the Bill is unconstitutional.  I think the Supreme Court have requested Parliament to fill <Col N="386" /> the statutory void that is left as a result of the decision of declaring Parts II and IV unconstitutional.  I hope the Minister of State will spell out for tenants who are suffering mental torture at present not knowing if they are going to be evicted or what exorbitant rents they are going to have to pay as a result of the Supreme Court decision, what immediate course of action this Government have in mind to protect this less well-off section of our society which is not in a position to defend itself from so many of our landlords.</P>
    <P>Once again, I welcome the Bill.  I am glad that the Government followed the line being taken by the previous administration. What we have before us today is the Fianna Fail Government's Bill which was announced on 29 June, in response to the Supreme Court decision. I ask the Minister of State, in reply, to respond to the questions which I have put to him.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is very important at this time, in view of the terrible plight of a great number of people who a while ago had security under the controlled dwellings section of the Act.  They now find they have no security.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court heard the case in December and it is regrettable that a draft Bill should be only a holding action now to ensure the rights of poor tenants. The various amendments to the Acts throughout the years are most incomprehensible. They have whittled away the rights of tenants under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  Ground has been covered but any new law should give protection to all tenants, to ensure that it is not unconstitutional.  One of the biggest problems with which one is confronted nowadays is tenants whose landlords continue to have access to courts and eventually get a court order.  One is not always happy that the presentation of such cases in court is satisfactory.  From my experience of these cases, a lot is left to be desired.  The new law should provide security for all tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most urgent need is the Fair Rents Tribunal.  It has been stated, and I agree, <Col N="387" /> that it should be simple and easy for people, if necessary, to bring their cases before the tribunal.  We should have on that tribunal democratic organisations such as trade unions and the tenants organisations.  The tribunal should have power to fix and enforce fair rents, grant reasonable security of tenure and arbitrate on landlord and tenant disputes on the application of either party.  Finally, any new Act must make illegal eviction a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to subsidising by way of a supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  The House is aware that the amount which can be paid is very limited indeed.  This is a totally unsatisfactory method of dealing with cases of people who cannot afford to pay and in the case of persons on fixed incomes, are depending on an allowance from the Department of Social Welfare. The mechanism for the local authority health board to pay a supplementary welfare allowance to assist in the payment of rent is something which needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I ask that the points which I have made be taken into consideration and hope that, with the passing of the Bill, tenants will have security and fair rents.  This is a big problem at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Mervyn Taylor Mr. Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mervyn Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few comments to make on the Bill now before the House.  The fact that this situation has arisen at all highlights the need for a constant review of legislation which is on the Statute Book.  Legislation many years old, and in many cases out of date, obsolete and inadequate for the needs of modern society, is allowed to remain there for want of attention by the Oireachtas, year after year, in many cases running into decades.  That phenomenon is not confined to the field of rent restriction.  It has been brought to the fore because of the action taken by a person or group of persons in bringing the matter before the Supreme Court.  Had that action not been taken, the <i>status quo</i> no doubt could very well have continued on for many decades more.  In my view, successive Governments should not wait the promptings of private individuals to bring matters of <Col N="388" /> this nature to the fore.  The Government of the day should constantly review legislation on its own account and implement the necessary modernisation in the field of law reform.</P>
      <P>A Minister of State has now been appointed who is responsible for law reform.  I hope and expect that the very many fields urgently requiring the attention of that Department will come before the Oireachtas in the coming sessions.</P>
      <P>The field of rent restriction, of course, has been notorious for its neglect by the Oireachtas.  The House will recall that the first of the Acts was passed in 1923, the Increase of Rent Act, 1923.  The matter lay virtually unattended until the Rent Act of 1946.  After that it lay virtually dormant, apart from minor adjustments, until the 1960 Act and then lay dormant until the Supreme Court decision of 1981. That should not have been permitted to happen by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>I want now to draw attention to the fact that very many of the dwellings under Rent Act legislation are very old.  Very many are in need of quite extensive modernisation and repair.  I have grave doubts whether it may be possible for those dwellings to be maintained as usable and habitable dwellings so long as they continue to be within the private sector.  The question of making funds available for many of these houses to be compulsorily acquired by the local authorities may have to be looked at in many cases. Where very heavy expenditure on repairs would be necessary, the only adequate way of having those buildings preserved for some decades ahead would be to make funds available, have them taken over by the local authorities, put into repair and maintained henceforth as local authority dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, I would ask the Minister of State to consider a couple of points in his summing up.  The latter part of section 4 deals with the agreement that may have been reached between the landlord and tenant before or after the passing of the Act.  It deals first with the question of an agreement reached after 18 April 1980 to date.  It says &ldquo;or agreed to by the tenant on or after that date and before such passing <Col N="389" /> shall not be enforceable while this Act is in force&rdquo;.  I take it from that that if an agreement between the landlord and tenant is reached after the passing of the Act such an agreement would be fully binding and enforceable.  I am a little concerned about that because the position will still be rather uncertain.</P>
    <P>Landlords and tenants, even after this Bill is passed, will not be sure what the eventual outcome will be, what the new legislation will provide, what security of tenure they will have or what rents they will be required to pay.  Under the threat of that uncertainty the tenants may enter into an agreement with the landlord which, when the legislation comes into force, they might have reason to regret. Therefore they should not be bound by an agreement entered into under the threat of that uncertainty.  The Minister of State might consider an amendment which would ensure that an agreement entered into and falling within that category would give the tenant the option to void that agreement and to rely, if he wishes, on such rights as he might be granted under new permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>Agreements entered into before the passing of the Act are deemed not to be enforceable while the Act is in force.  I do not know if that means that when the six month period runs out such an agreement would become enforceable.  The wording of the Bill seems to provide a stay on that agreement for the six month period. Some clarification is required because if an agreement is entered into before this Bill is passed it is very likely that is was entered into under severe pressure and threat of a removal of security of tenure and could be balanced against the tenant. An amendment would be required to provide that, even after the expiration of the six month period an agreement between landlord and tenant entered into before the passing of this Bill would be voidable at his option.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by the last speaker.  In my few years in this House I have noticed that a number of legislative measures, fire brigade actions, were introduced.  Because of the nature of these measures it is not always possible for Members of this House to find all the faults in such legislation and it is only when they are pointed out in our courts that we have to bring in amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it will rectify a situation which needs to be remedied. If this legislation had not been introduced the tenants of those dwellings would find themselves in a very difficult situation.  As has been pointed out, the people who occupy most of these dwellings pay very low rent and are in the lower income bracket.  Because of the Supreme Court decision their security of tenure and the amount of rent to be paid can now be called into question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the new Government propose in their manifesto to look at the whole question of rents.  When they do I suggest that they look at the whole area of landlord and tenant legislation.  The last Government brought in a number of Landlord and Tenant Acts.  The whole field of landlord and tenant legislation is so <Col N="391" /> complex that I suggest this Government introduce a Consolidation Bill.  This area is so complicated at present that even for solicitors it can be a minefield.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a temporary measure.  Since April 1980 it was expected that the Supreme Court would take the same line as that taken in the High Court.  I am surprised the then Fianna Fáil Government did not anticipate that decision.  I hope this House will not continue introducing temporary measures every six months.  I understand that the Rent Restrictions Acts were introduced as temporary measures, and if we continue introducing temporary measures we will not have very good law.  I hope in six months time a new Bill will be introduced which will set out the situation as it should be.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is very little rent restriction but I am amazed that nobody ever thought of bringing this matter before the High Court.  I am not suprised that rent restrictions were found to be unconstitutional.  Landlords are getting out of the business of providing rented accommodation.  It may be popular always to speak on behalf of the tenants because there are more tenants than landlords and more votes can thus be gained.  Legislation on this subject has now made it quite impossible for landlords to get tenants out of houses and to do many other things and there has been a lessening of interest in the provision of rented accommodation.  The law has gone from the extreme of being always on the side of the landlords to being excessively on the side of tenants.  It may be politically popular to speak about protecting the rights of tenants but we have now reached a situation where people are not prepared to let out their property for rent because the law favours the tenant to such a great extent.</P>
    <P>If the new Government intend to provide a mechanism for the fixing of rents they should examine the whole question and should not be obsessed with the protection of the tenant to the detriment of the rights of the landlords.  The Supreme Court decision clearly illustrates that under the Constitution landlords also <Col N="392" /> have rights.  If tenants are over-protected landlords will not be interested in the provision of rented accommodation.  The Bill before us is a temporary measure to cover the situation arising while a major Bill is being drafted.  I hope that the second Bill will embody the principles I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 I am not quite clear if after the passing of this Bill a new tenancy will be valid.  My reading of it is that this will be the case but I should like the point clarified.  I hope that the legislation to be introduced within six months will be comprehensive because we cannot put off this problem indefinitely.  It will be difficult to frame a Bill to take account of the judgment of the Supreme Court and to protect the rights of tenants.  I do not envy the task of the Minister and his officials in drafting such a Bill.  The Supreme Court judgment clearly spells out the lines over which we cannot pass.  If we do not devise a system which will be equitable to tenants while taking account of the court's decision it is likely that the landlords will take action again.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will have a speedy passage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken with some of the things Deputy McCreevy said.  It may not be the most appropriate context in which to say it but he is quite right that one of the reasons why housing is so desperately short and dear is that, so far from its being the preserve of the free-wheeling capitalist who can do what he likes &mdash; although that is certainly true to a limited extent &mdash; the more substantial and important truth is that there are not enough capitalists in the business.  The reason housing is so scarce and dear is the ordinary law of supply and demand. If it were more attractive for people to invest in property there would be a reduction over a period of time in the cost of rented accommodation and a reduction in the burden on the State of having to take up the slack in housing people who cannot afford privately supplied accommodation.</P>
      <P>I am very far from excusing all the sins of private landlords who exploit tenants and I hope the coming legislation will apply some restraints on landlords of all kinds of accommodation and make sure that they give their tenants a decent deal. There is a great deal to be said for Deputy McCreevy's point.  It may not be popular because it conflicts with this or that ideology but experience here will go a great distance to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy's point about section 4 because it is not entirely clear to me either.  The drafting of the section might be improved because it is not clear whether the notified increase which the section mentions is never to be enforceable or whether its recovery is <Col N="394" /> merely temporarily postponed until the Act goes out of force.  If that is Deputy McCreevy's point of view, I share it.  The section could be more clearly expressed.</P>
    <P>I agree even more strongly with his third point where he expressed doubts about whether six months is an adequate period for the currency of this legislation. It is not simply a matter of drafting a substantive permanent measure; it will have to pass through both these Houses in that period.  It will be a long and difficult Bill which will not flash through on the nod.  Only an optimist would suggest that it would pass through this House in less than several weeks, whatever about the Seanad.  On the whole it might have been more sensible to provide a slightly longer life for this Bill when it becomes law than six months.  That is something which the Minister and the Department might look at.  There is no constitutional infirmity in the Bill before us.  We have a duty under Article 15 not to enact anything which is repugnant to the Constitution, and that imposes on the House a duty, which is not just a nominal duty, to take seriously the question of whether or not what we are doing is constitutionally offensive.  I think it said in the papers that one or more of the plaintiffs in this case proposed to challenge the entire Act on the grounds that even this temporary measure would breach constitutional rights.  That imposes on us a duty to pause over that question and consider what we are at.</P>
    <P>As it is a strictly temporary measure and as it is the consequence of what the Supreme Court called a statutory void having been torn in the legal system by its own judgment, the Oireachtas must be entitled to a certain period of grace to try to put things right.  It could be said that it is the duty of the Oireachtas to give itself a breathing space not just for neglect but so as to give itself space within which a reasonable measure can be devised.  The Supreme Court in its judgment more or less anticipated this point being raised both in an earlier part of its judgment and more particularly in the concluding page or so.  The court went out of its way to envisage healing legislation which it hoped would be speedily <Col N="395" /> enacted.  The court said that such legislation may be expected to provide for the determination of fair rents.  The courts consist of experienced lawyers who know that any question of providing a statutory scheme for such a subjective and disputable matter as what is a fair rent is something which cannot be done overnight or without long thought and careful drafting and without taking into account the representations of interested parties and associations.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for us to impute to the Supreme Court an understanding of the difficulties which the enactment of such a Bill will place in the way of the Minister's Department, the Parliamentary draftsman and the staff of this House.  I did not hear the Minister's speech so I do not know whether this point was made for the last Government had this measure reached the House in time, but the court did another unusual thing in the concluding part of its judgment where it more or less pointed out to inferior courts who might administer the rent restrictions legislation that they ought to apply a stay of execution for the purpose of enabling persons' rights to be adjusted.  They believed that the inferior courts should not attach to an order for possession a date which would frustrate the healing effect of whatever this House or the other House might enact later this year or early in 1982.</P>
    <P>The point that this Bill is built around is one which the Supreme Court specifically envisaged and expressed.  The Supreme Court also said, on page 28 of the typed transcript, in condemning the existing legislation referred to as being an element in which there was no mitigation of the rigours of the old law, that because the legislation was not limited in duration the court implicitly recognised that an Act which is limited in duration might have a different constitutional status than one which is expressed to be permanent.  The court said that the old law was not associated with a temporary or emergency situation.  Implicitly, had it been associated with a temporary situation it might have been entitled to more respect or indulgence from a constitutional <Col N="396" /> aspect than a permanent law.  On these grounds I am satisfied that we are doing nothing wrong in enacting this law. I have expressed misgivings as to whether six months will be long enough but the Bill as it stands is not objectionable and I hope it will turn out to be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. G. Bermingham Mr. G. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. I served alongside him in Dublin Corporation and I am aware that he is well fitted to take charge of housing.</P>
      <P>This has been referred to as fire brigade legislation.  For many years the whole area of rent control has been seen as being unsatisfactory.  It is universally recognised as an area of anomalies that have sometimes been bizarre.  But no action was taken.  As Deputy McCreevy feels, the reason no action was taken is that this is an area of political sensivity and there is a danger that any action would stand on the toes of one or other of the interested groups involved, more specifically the tenants.  That hesitancy to introduce legislation can be seen in other areas which are sources of continuing political controversy.  Action was only forthcoming in some of these areas when the High Court on appeal to the Supreme Court gave a ruling that demanded action from this House.  It is sad that areas that are in need of political judgment should in the first instance be decided on by the courts and that only when the courts have expressed a view does the Oireachtas respond because it has an obligation at that stage.  If one looks at the situation prior to the challenge to the constitutionality of the code, the crying need for legislative action was obvious.  The whole question of what dwellings are controlled and what dwellings are uncontrolled is extremely curious.  There is no logical reason for drawing an arbitrary distinction, for saying that pre-1941 buildings should be regarded as being different from post-1941 buildings.  In this day and age any regard to the question of rateable valuation must be extremely suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the quite extraordinary situation that someone who is fortunate enough to find themselves in a dwelling that was controlled enjoyed a most elaborate <Col N="397" /> protection while the unfortunate across the road was effectively and substantially at the whim of the landlord. The divergence in their positions had nothing whatever to do with their economic strength, their ability to negotiate for themselves or any other factors one might feel reasonably justified such a divergence.  That divergence related solely to historical factors.  That was a situation which, it seemed to me, had long cried out for reform.  Yet nothing happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy commented that he many years ago had pondered the thought: why does somebody not challenge this legislation?  But it is very widely recognised that there was a feeling abroad that the rent restrictions code was constitutionally infirm and might not stand up to challenge.  Notwithstanding that feeling there was no eagerness on the part of the Legislature to intervene and to respond to what was clearly an area of injustice.</P>
    <P>The situation obtaining is that the Supreme Court has spoken for us and obliged this House and the Government to act.  In that sense I congratulate the Government for the speed with which they have moved.  In saying that I am not unaware that the party opposite were also anxious to move at the appropriate time. But I share the hesitancy of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism as to whether six months will be adequate for all of this.  I am perfectly satisfied that if the plantiffs in the original action were to proceed to challenge this Bill they would be told by the Supreme Court that the Bill, then an Act, was entirely in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court and in fact was responding to a very broad, judicial hint from the Supreme Court.  I am quite satisfied that that is what they would be told in relation to this six months Bill.</P>
    <P>But if it became necessary in six months' time to introduce another six months Bill, a challenge at that stage would stand on substantially firmer ground.  I think the courts would certainly look with considerable disfavour on a situation in which a series of allegedly temporary measures appeared to be <Col N="398" /> about to be introduced and, if asked to condemn, might very well feel that they had no option but to uphold their authority and condemn any second temporary measure.  For that reason I join the Minister in urging the Minister of State to consider whether at this stage it might not be wiser to extend the period of six months to 12 months.  I feel very strongly that any challenge to this Bill, designed and stated to be a temporary measure, would certainly fail.  I feel equally strongly that the attitude of the Supreme Court might well be that the Oireachtas is, in a sense, given one bite of the cherry, that certainly they can have one stay to get their house in order but, if they start looking for more than that, there might indeed be very little sympathy.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me somewhat is an implication that I deduce from the long title of the Bill, which reads:</P>
    <P>An Act to make temporary provision, in consequence of the decision of the Supreme Court declaring certain provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, to be invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, for a measure of protection, in conformity with that decision and with the provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, Article 40.3 and Article 43 thereof, for persons deprived of the protection theretofore provided by that enactment in order to enable legislation to be prepared and to be initiated in, considered and, if thought proper, enacted by the Oireachtas to provide due safeguards for such persons in accordance with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is there an implication that the substantive legislation to be brought into force will continue in effect the contrast between those people who were controlled and those who previously were not controlled, that even when the substantive legislation is brought into force those who prior to the court case had the good fortune to be in controlled accommodation will continue to enjoy rights greater that those who are not in controlled accommodation.  If I am correct about that it worries me, because <Col N="399" /> I see absolutely no logic in that situation. As I said earlier, there never was any logical distinction between the occupiers of dwellings that were controlled and those that were not.  If the original line, when drawn, was illogical, it would seem to me to be quite wrong that the illogical division should for any reason be carried over into the new legislation.  I would ask the Minister of State when replying to indicate whether I am being unduly alarmist about that or whether it would be the intention that people who fortuitously found themselves in controlled dwellings would continue to enjoy rights substantially greater than the people across the road.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details of the Bill at this stage but a number of speakers have commented on section 4. Again, like the Minister, I am somewhat uncertain as to its interpretation.  There is one other matter that concerns me. The section refers to 18 April which if my recollection is correct, was the date of the judgment in the High Court.  While that is in a sense a logical cut-off point, it should be borne in mind that the initiation of these proceedings received very substantial publicity, that there was quite a well-orchestrated publicity campaign attended on the progress of this case through the courts, that many of the people in controlled accommodation substantially before 18 April would have been alarmed and worried that their position was under threat.  Certainly I heard of instances of landlords approaching their tenants on the basis: All right, you are in a strong position today, but you know there is this court case coming up.  Once the court case is decided, the boot will be on the other foot.  On the strength of that anticipation landlords managed to negotiate for themselves terms that certainly would not have been available had the litigation not been before the courts.  If that is the case then it would seem to me there would be some merit in considering the possibility of backdating from 18 April, in fact going back to the date on which the proceedings were launched in the Supreme Court with all their attendant publicity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> I do not want to detain the House or to repeat what has been said by other speakers but I share Deputy McCreevy's view that there is need for an overhaul of the entire landlord and tenant code.  The last Dáil looked at the area of commerical lettings and the relationship between the business landlord and business tenant.  I believe there is a similar obligation on us to carry out an examination of the area of private accommodation.  That is an area that has been substantially neglected, apparently partly because of the belief that the Rent Restrictions Acts were dying out and that in every year there were fewer and fewer dwellings to be controlled and that if one turned one's back on the problem it was one that would eventually go away.  In fact the anomalies and injustices that occurred over the last few years have been such as to reduce substantially the amount of rented accommodation available in this city.  I venture to suggest they were also in part responsible for much of the decline and blight we have seen in the inner city.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, and against a background of neglect, I believe the time is now ripe, if not substantially overdue for a very comprehensive examination of the whole relationship of landlord and tenant.  Even at this stage I venture to suggest that, if distinctions are to be drawn between various tenants and the degrees of rights that will attach to them, an attempt&mdash;and I do not doubt for one moment that it would be a very difficult one&mdash;should be made to make that distinction on the basis of their financial strength, their ability to bargain, their ability to look after themselves and not on the basis of the entirely fortuitous circumstances that they happen to be controlled or uncontrolled under legislation that was subsequently found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The point has already been made that, while the fears and apprehension that now exist among tenants in response to the Supreme Court decision are being taken account of by this Bill, for many years we had the situation of real injustice being done to landlords by the operations <Col N="401" /> of the Rent Restrictions Act.  While the popular image of the landlord is some kind of latter-day Victorian gentleman, eager to toss everybody on to the street, I am sure every Member in the House can produce cases of landlords in very poor circumstances unable to derive any income because their property was controlled. Some of them were in the situation where the controlled dwelling was occupied by people who were substantially better off than the landlord who was living in straitened circumstances. I believe, whatever the political risks involved, that there is an obligation to bring a degree of fresh thinking to this whole area, to start off, at the very least, by saying that the question of where the line is to be drawn between the rights of the landlord and the tenant must be looked at in the light of the existing economic situation in 1981 and should not be unduly governed by historical factors which have long outlived their usefulness. I warmly welcome this Bill but I again ask the Minister of State to consider if six months will be long enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make four very brief points.  I have every confidence that the Bill before the House today is the precursor of comprehensive and fundamental reforms in landlord and tenant legislation and that it heralds a new era of legislative, economic and social change for people presently in the category of tenant or landlord in this area.  The reforms which the Government have agreed to undertake will be undertaken. They are long overdue because we have had virtual stagnation in terms of progress in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill seeks to provide us with a breathing space whereby the Government will be able to undertake changes which will carry out the full implications of the Supreme Court decision.  I am slightly uneasy about aspects of that general approach.  There is, apparently, an increasing reliance on the courts to do our thinking for us in certain regards when it is clear that legislative proposals and legislative changes are necessary.  It is an unhappy thing when the courts are <Col N="402" /> asked to do more things than they have been designed for and act as an instrument for bringing about change in social or political policies.  That is not primarily the role of the courts and it would be undesirable if too much dependence were to be thrust on the courts for insisting on this House and Governments of the day bringing in enlightened reforms where they are necessary and clearly evident, as they have been in this regard.</P>
    <P>My second area of unease is that there need have been no undue delay about bringing in the comprehensive measures which are necessary in the light of the Supreme Court decision because the previous Government had ample notice that it was very likely that the decision might go the way it did.  They should have, if they had been engaged in genuine concern in this area, arranged for sufficient preparatory work to have been done, which would have ensured that only the minimum holding measure, if any, would have been necessary.  I raised this matter in the House about 12 months ago and was given an assurance that legislation was in draft form.  The context of the discussion would give anybody the belief that such legislation that was being drafted was designed to carry out the implications of the court decision. Apparently, it was simply no more than a stopgap to allow for full examination of the court's decision and make the necessary alterations, improvements and amendments arising therefrom. Obviously the court decision needs that kind of examination.  I suggest, however, that the work of preparing for the eventuality which was likely should have been much further advanced than it appears to have been and the spirit of the Supreme Court decision, which is that certain Acts presently in our statute are unconstitutional &mdash; that spirit cannot be honoured for a period of time.  There is a degree of tension between the decision of the court and the capacity of any Government to respond overnight to such a directive.  That is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the expressed concern of Deputy Burke when he spoke about the kind of standards and criteria he will be seeking from <Col N="403" /> legislation to be introduced by the Government, in terms of comprehensive and fundamental reform in this area.  I would like to remind him of the many days in this House over the last four years when we attempted to convince the then Government not only that reform was needed, but that promises undertaken over four years ago for implementation were not implemented.  I specifically refer to the one relating to a tribunal to oversee rent and possibly other conditions, which was the basis of a very specific letter in June 1977 to the National Flat Dwellers Association.  That pledge has never been implemented.  It will be implemented in the next four years because we have given our word.</P>
    <P>I, like many other Deputies in the House, have on my files many letters from the former chairman of the National Flatdwellers Association, Mr. John Power, recently deceased.  His death, which was caused by a drowning accident in the last few weeks, is a singular loss not just to the tenants of the country but to all of us who rely to a significant degree on voluntary contributions from interested groups in our society in urging us to greater efforts to bring about change in our laws and our attitudes.  His efforts should not go unrewarded.  I believe I speak for every Member of the House when I say we are deeply grateful to him as, I am sure, are the 300,000 to 400,000 tenants of rented accommodation for the trojan work he did while he was chairman of the Flatdwellers Association.  I would like to think that his dedication and his work in that area will help us to be more dedicated in the future to reform in this area than we have been.  His passing is deeply regretted.</P>
    <P>The reforms now necessary should be undertaken on the simple principle of justice for tenants and for landlords.  The private rented sector is very valuable from the point of view of housing, one that has not been given adequate consideration, adequate resources and adequate policy attention.  In that category large numbers of people are being housed with little consideration for necessary reforms in regard to maintenance of <Col N="404" /> standards for both landlords and tenants. There has not been access to impartial arbitration in times of dispute.  It has been a very haphazard situation heretofore.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the Bill before us will act as a spur to our imagination and to our efforts in the challenge that lies ahead.  I hope it will also serve as a token that we will begin to do the things that we know to be necessary in the matter of landlord and tenant reform. If at times we lag in our efforts in this area we should refer to our files which contain letters in John Power's handwriting and see there evidence of his concern for the people he represented.  It should represent a catalyst to all of us so that we will not break our word to introduce reforms in this vital area of social legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some brief comments on this legislation. In the past few years we have had the phenomenon of this House failing to come to terms with or recognise the need for legislation of a social nature.  We have had a considerable number of judgments delivered by the courts which in effect forced the legislators to come to terms with the realities of life in the 20th century. They have forced legislators to enact laws.  Here today we have legislation in this area of rent restriction which has been forced on the Legislature by the courts.</P>
      <P>I find the Bill disappointing.  It was informative to hear the former Minister for the Environment say that what we have is essentially a Fianna Fáil Bill.  That is indicative of a total legislative abdication of responsibility of that party.  It is clear that the former Minister had no notion, and his party have no notion, of the type of legislation they should have been thinking about to deal with this whole problem of landlords and tenants, and in particular to try to provide the necessary protection required for both tenants and landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area is so complex that a Bill to deal with it could not be drafted in a week or two.  Such a Bill must be comprehensive in the long term.  The ultimate Bill will have to deal with the whole area of <Col N="405" /> landlord and tenant law and not simply distinguish between tenants and landlords depending on the dates when houses were leased, when families moved in or when landlords acquired the premises. There is need for comprehensive legislation, but the Bill we have before us, prepared by the previous Government, is a clear indication of the total inability of that Government to deal with this area, of their total failure to introduce comprehensive law reform.</P>
    <P>As a lawyer, I was not surprised that the Supreme Court confirmed the High Court decision.  That was done approximately a year-and-a-half after the High Court judgment was delivered.  That means there was a year-and-a-half in which to prepare comprehensive legislation, but no such legislation was prepared. I welcome this Bill in so far as to some extent, it will give peace of mind to people who feel threatened in their homes and feel in danger of being put out of their homes.  I welcome it in so far as it will provide temporary peace of mind, but the problem now is the same problem that arises on every occasion when the courts essentially have to step into the legislative area, when they have to turn to the Oireachtas and say: &ldquo;What is on the Statute Book is out of date and discriminatory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The problem is that every constitutional judgment of this nature creates uncertainty and stress and renders it impossible for people to become aware of their rights, so they cannot make long term plans for their well being.  This Bill may relieve anxiety temporarily, but until we have comprehensive legislation to deal with the whole of this area that anxiety will continue to exist.  I share the worry of previous speakers in relation to this.  There has been a suggestion from people outside the House that this Bill, too, might be unconstitutional.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, dealt with that aspect.  It appears the Supreme Court envisaged enactment by the Oireachtas of legislation to fill the gap, but I am not clear that the gap which the Supreme Court envisaged being filled is being filled by this Bill which maintains the <i>status quo</i><Col N="406" /> in order to give the House an opportunity to bring in comprehensive legislation to determine in a fair way how rents and other obligations between landlords and tenants should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Supreme Court necessarily envisaged the type of Bill we have in front of us.  Nevertheless, I think the courts would uphold this Bill as a temporary measure.  I share the concern that if it does not become possible to enact comprehensive legislation within six months &mdash; I do not think it is possible to enact such legislation in such a period because it will require debate of a very involved nature &mdash; there is doubt as to how the courts would deal with another Bill of a temporary nature.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider extending the life of this Bill to perhaps nine months or 12 months, something more than the six months, because we are talking about the House sitting for a period later in July, then going into summer recess and coming back in October. Therefore, the type of Bill required could not be prepared and enacted in six months.  Therefore, I seriously ask the Minister to have another look at the time schedule set down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like to voice concern about section 4 &mdash; of course this will be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage &mdash; but I would make the general point that the section is ambiguous not merely in the manner referred to by previous speakers in the matter of regulating agreements signed, but as the section is framed it is totally unclear as to whether it is intended merely to postpone the effects of these agreements, whether it is intended to render them void, whether after the six months period a landlord or a tenant will be able to rely on the agreements to enforce rights.  It is the most ambiguous section in the Bill.  I believe it would create problems and could give rise to litigation.  We should, as far as possible, try to remove some of the ambiguity and uncertainty that exist in the present situation.  I ask the Minister, before the Committee Stage, to look at that section of the Bill to see what we can do to provide the necessary amendments before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> There is not much else I wish to say at this stage about the Bill except to come back to what Deputy Keating was saying. I find it ironic to hear Members on the opposite side laying down stipulations and criteria as to what they want to see in whatever Bill is to be produced ultimately. That is a cynical and hypocritical political exercise when Members opposite had a four-year period to introduce comprehensive reforming legislation in this area and it appears that the whole of that four years was devoted to preparing a Bill of approximately five sections which is before us today and which must be passed, due to the court decision, to provide temporary relief.  I find it ironic to have Members opposite laying down criteria now.  If they were so sure as to what was required in these areas, if they knew the detailed provisions that should be enacted, why were they not enacted at some time in the past four years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Burke and other Members for their congratulations and good wishes to me in my new office. I am sure I shall find my new responsibilities in the Department of the Environment both interesting and challenging. This is the first piece of legislation I am putting through the House and I should again like to thank all the Deputies who spoke for their very informative and constructive contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised a number of points, as did other Deputies, which I will deal with.  In my introductory speech I mentioned the figure of 30,000 tenants who could be affected in the figure of 45,000 to 50,000.  We have no set pattern to determine the actual number.  We can only make estimates and my Department believe 30,000 is reasonably accurate. The 1971 census showed that there were 65,000 unfurnished lettings.  A large number of those were controlled but since 1971 there has been a decline in this type of accommodation.  A large number of people in controlled accommodation have bought as landlords decided to sell. Also, under the 1960 Rent Act there were changes; a number of dwellings were <Col N="408" /> demolished.  We believe a reasonable figure would be 30,000.  If it is more than that we shall deal with it on the basis of it being more than 30,000.  In my view it is about 30,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised the matter of future policy.  As I indicated in introducing the Bill we shall bring in substantive legislation which will be comprehensive and will deal with all aspects of lettings. First, we must consider the Supreme Court judgment which raises fundamental questions which will have a bearing on any future action we take.  Our programme for Government lays down very clearly a number of measures which we feel are vital in the interests of landlords and tenants.  I spoke of these in my opening remarks and I do not propose to dwell unduly on them again.  The action we are taking in regard to controlled dwellings in this Bill and in the announcement by the Minister last week is entirely consistent with what our programme of government proposed.  In it we undertook that in the event of the rent restriction code being found unconstitutional the Government would introduce legislation to provide fixity of tenure for existing tenants and would provide rent subsidies for existing tenants who might be faced with having to pay rents beyond their means. This Bill is a first step in the course of action we propose.</P>
    <P>The Government are very concerned that legislation would be brought in quickly.  A number of Deputies raised the matter of the six months and wondered if we would get this comprehensive legislation through in six months.  We shall certainly try and I shall push the Department to ensure that the legislation is before the House as soon as possible. Deputies asked if we should extend the period.  It is our advice and our view that the term should not at this stage be extended beyond six months.  We think that is reasonable and on the basis of people questioning the constitutionality of it I believe we are well advised to stay within the six months' limit.  A number of Deputies raised this point, Deputy Birmingham, Deputy Shatter and others saying they feared we would not have legislation through in six months.  We shall work on it in the coming months <Col N="409" /> and it is my wish to have it before the House and I shall be asking the House to deal with it speedily.</P>
    <P>The question of constitutionality was again raised.  The view of the Government is that the action we are taking is correct and is constitutional.  The Supreme Court in its judgment adverted to the statutory void to which the terms of the judgment would give rise.  Indeed the judgment went further and spoke of what amounts to a moratorium by the courts on ejectment proceedings in expectation of a legislative response to the judgment.  It is clear that such pernament legislation would take some time to produce and enact and this is precisely the reason why the Supreme Court thought it proper to advise lower courts that in the expectation of new substantive legislation, cases brought before the courts should be adjourned or a stay of execution put on any orders granted.  In effect what the present Bill does is to put the recommendation of the Supreme Court on a statutory footing.  The Bill is founded on important principles enshrined in the Constitution as is amply demonstrated by the Long Title of the Bill.  Paragraph (2) of the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill goes into the constitutional principles in some detail.</P>

      <P>As regards the restriction of imports from non-EEC countries this is a matter for resolution by the Community as a whole.  I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to press at EEC level for adequate protection mechanisms for the Community market against low cost imports.  Discussions are proceeding on the EEC Commission's proposal for a new regulation reviewing the common organisation of the market in fishery products including the provisions governing trade arrangements with third countries. It will be my Department's objective to ensure that appropriate adjustments will be made to the Community's import regime which will guarantee in the long-term that fishery products will not be imported in a manner likely to disturb the balance of the Community market.  In the short-term I will avail of every opportunity to press for stronger import controls under the existing regulations.</P>

      <P>The figures involved are quite simple and I am surprised the Minister has found it necessary to circulate them in a tabular statement.  Will the Minister not agree that the present yield in the health charges is approximately £50 million per annum and that the plans put forward by the Coalition Government involve an increase of a further £89 million?  I am not surprised the Minister wants to circulate that figure in a tabular statement.  Will he confirm from the figures he has before him that this is the case?</P>

      <P>I have not the information sought by the Deputy.  However, I can confirm that the estimated total yield <Col N="422" /> from health contributions at present rates and conditions for the calendar year 1981 is £48.6 million which is comprised as follows: employees and others whose health contributions are collected under the PAYE system such as non-salaried company directors, occupational pensioners and so on, £42.7 million; self-employed, that is those whose health contributions are assessed in connection with assessment for income tax under Schedule D, including excepted farmers, £2.9 million; farmers, other than excepted farmers, who are billed directly by the health board £3 million.  I have no further information before me but if the Deputy puts down a question after he reads the tabular statement I shall be happy to supply it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that the Minister took two questions together. The Minister has highlighted the fact that in the present situation employees will pay £42.7 million, the self-employed will pay £2.9 million and farmers will pay £3 million.  I ask the Minister to let us know what increase will arise in each of the sectors.  The figures I have worked on are £44 million, £3 million and £3 million which are very close to the information given by the Minister.  I ask him to confirm that the gross income will be £110 million, £7.5 million and £7.5 million. This means that the extra for the PAYE employees will be £66 million, for the self-employed, £4.5 million, and for farmers £4.5 million.  There will also be further increases, due to the raising of the limit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in the House on 24 March 1981 &mdash; Official Report, Vol. 327, column 2110 &mdash; that there would be no change in the farming multiplier in the present year.  No review of this decision is now proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <P>I am asking the Minister if any part of this extra tax which has been imposed by the Coalition Government will be collected from the farming sector or if all of it will fall on employees.  With regard to the PRSI and health charges proposed, is it the situation that a PAYE employee under £8,500 will pay an additional 1.5 per cent while a PAYE employee over £8,500 will pay an additional 6.25 per cent?

      <P>It is a matter of history that the computers were first introduced in the Department in 1973 for the payment of disability and related benefits.  I confirm that I have been informed that a plan exists for modernisation of that computer but that at this stage it is essentially a plan.  A great deal of further action will be necessary before it can be implemented. One of the problems in its implementation will be the quality and standard of the telephone system.  Without an adequate development of that it will be impossible to extend the services as we would wish.  Before the use of computers can be extended there would have to be telephone lines available to connect the visual display terminals.  At present arrangements for decentralisation have commenced, in two centres.  The programme for Government 1981 to 1986 commits us to decentralisation and to establishing offices not only in those two centres but in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Castlebar, Cavan, Tullamore and Kilkenny.  Obviously this will be a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters have to be determined in relation to the method of application of this scheme. Until they are determined it would be premature to give any estimate of the cost.

That was the difficulty in endeavouring to segregate for the Deputy the difference as between the higher and lower rates of grants.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the prisoners in question are held in punishment block conditions.  It happens that, for reasons I shall explain, both they and some others, amounting at the present time to a total of ten, are kept in a portion of the prison which is also used to keep any prisoners who are temporarily undergoing what is called deprivation of privileges, but the conditions applicable to them are different from those applicable to prisoners deprived of privileges.  They have in fact the same general facilities as the general body of prisoners.</P>
      <P>The prisoners to which the question relates have been convicted of serious crimes and it is common knowledge that they are associated with an outside organisation. Against that background, both for reasons of their own personal safety and for security reasons, they have to be segregated, in the way I have indicated, from the general body of prisoners.  The section of the prison where they are kept is the only section available and is not as suitable as I would wish, in that it is what might be called a semi-basement.  However, its windows are above ground level and provide direct natural light and fresh air.  Furthermore, there is no problem of dampness or anything of that kind.  I think it right to say also that recreation facilities available to those prisoners include craftwork and colour TV, the value of which is extended by the availability of video recordings.  Educational facilities are also available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normal prison entitlement is to one visit per week of one half-hour duration but the Governor has discretion to extend <Col N="444" /> the time, and, because of distance from home, he generally allows double that time to relatives of the particular prisoners referred to in the question.</P>
    <P>Since these prisoners are, through force of circumstances, more isolated than the general body of prisoners, I am having a special review carried out to see whether, in the matter of visits for instance, some further concession could be allowed without creating a situation in which other prisoners might have grounds for complaint about discrimination and without jeopardising security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time we were discussing the constitutionality of the Bill and there were some fears raised on that matter. I think we are all satisfied that the Bill is constitutional.  Taking into account what the Supreme Court said, the principles on which the Bill is founded and its temporary nature, I am confident that its provisions are not in conflict with the Constitution.  This, too, was evidently the view of the former Government as implied in their statement of 29 June that they had authorised the introduction of legislation on the same lines as the present Bill.  Both sides of the House appear to agree that it is constitutional.  If one examines the Supreme Court decision, it is quite clear that it would interpret what we are doing as correct and proper.</P>
      <P>Deputy G. Birmingham asked whether we were going to have two standards, one for controlled tenants and one for uncontrolled tenants.  This Bill deals with controlled tenants only.  Anything else will be dealt with in legislation which will be coming before the House at a later stage. There is no need to worry about double standards because we are only dealing with the controlled section.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock raised the question of assistance in payment of rents and was concerned about the supplementary welfare allowance.  He felt it might not be sufficient to meet the difference between the new increase and what tenants could afford to pay.  That is a matter which will be dealt with when we are bringing major legislation before the House.  Where hardship is involved it will be met in a just way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating said that the Bill should be concerned with justice.  We are proposing to do that.  Given that we are operating within the constraints of a <Col N="452" /> Supreme Court decision, it will be just and will be seen to be just.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor was concerned about section 4.  If two people agree on payment of a particular rent, there is very little we can do about legislating for that. I know he was making the point that there could be an element of fear or threat at the time.  We will be informing people that they are not required to pay an increase but if they decide, for whatever reason, to have a mutual agreement, there is very little we can do about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy asked if it was an on-going six months and if it was a ploy to procrastinate.  That is not the case because we are operating on the basis of a constitutional issue.  The Supreme Court deemed the present structures unconstitutional and it is on this basis that we have made it a six months extension. Other Deputies were seeking a longer period but I do not think we would get away with that.  It is not a question of getting it in for six months and then coming back and getting it in for another six months and so on.  We could not do that even if we wanted to.  I hope that allays any fears the Deputy may have on that issue.  Any fears expressed by the Deputies will be taken into consideration in preparing the new legislation.  There is no question of legislation coming before this House without taking into account every aspect of the Deputies' views.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Deputies for their contributions in this matter.  Temporary legislation is always unsatisfactory.  However, given that this decision was taken only a little over a week ago, I had no choice but to bring this Bill before the House as quickly as possible, to allay the fears of many people who are, and will be, affected by the decision of the Supreme Court.  Given that the Supreme Court has made its ruling basically in their favour and that the Supreme Court held that legislation was necessary to fill the void, it is only prudent, right and fair that landlords await the substantive legislation and do not bring pressure, or seem to be bringing pressure, in seeking increases.  As the Bill stands, they will not get these increases.</P>
    <P>To request the President not to sign <Col N="453" /> the Bill is not right or proper.  Everyone must be aware that a time must pass before my Department can examine all aspects of the matter and bring in the necessary legislation which will take into account the decision of the Supreme Court and be seen to be fair and equitable to everybody.  I assure all sides that there will be no delay in bringing in this legislation. It will be complicated and will take some time to prepare and it is necessary that we have this moratorium of six months.  I would ask the people involved to take no further action, in the best interests of everybody.  People who are vulnerable, for example the elderly, will be protected in every way.  Fixity of tenure is very important, as far as I am concerned, in ensuring that the rights of tenants are protected.</P>
    <P>Regarding decisions of the tribunal, supplementary welfare allowances will be paid to meet the difference between the rents charged.  It is important that people know that and that they do not feel themselves in a limbo position while awaiting substantive legislation.  This Bill is in accordance with the Supreme Court decision and we are asking only for a reasonable time stay.  There is nothing unconstitutional about that, or in conflict with the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>I thank again the Deputies for their constructive views.  I would ask that all Stages be completed as quickly as possible. We will thus allay the fears of many of the 30,000 tenants who may be affected, particularly those who are elderly or in poor circumstances.</P>

      <P>Might it be considered necessary to put in a separate definition of the expression used throughout this Bill of &ldquo;controlled dwelling&rdquo;? The Bill refers, in section 5 and in other sections, to a controlled dwelling.  The effect of the Supreme Court decision is that there are no longer any controlled dwellings, as the position stands at the moment, except perhaps such control as still exists in respect of small dwellings under Part III of the 1960 Act, which was not affected by the Supreme Court decision. I am aware of the definition in the 1960 Act of a controlled dwelling as including all premises.  Nevertheless, the reference here to controlled dwellings might possibly give rise to some confusion and needless disputation.  To avoid that, it might be advisable to include a new definition in this Bill of a controlled dwelling being a premises which was controlled before the Supreme Court decision.</P>

      <P>Section 4 provides that increases of rents of controlled dwellings notified after 18 April 1980 &mdash; the date of the High Court decision &mdash; shall not be enforceable in law for the six months that this Act is in force.  This applies even if the tenant agreed to a rent increase before the passing of this Bill, although, where the tenant agrees to a rent increase after the Bill is passed, the section shall not affect such an increase.  I do not think there are any great fears about section 4. Tenants will have to pay an increase only where they mutually agree.  A landlord cannot impose an increase.  If he seeks an ejectment order under section 5 he cannot get one.  This Bill takes this clearly into account.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister is correct in his last comment. When the court deems the Act to be unconstitutional, it means it is, and always was, unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I am not completely happy about section 4 which purports to draw a distinction between agreements entered into before and after the passing of this Bill, and I do not think that distinction is warranted. The section deems unenforceable agreements entered into before the passing of the Bill.  In my view there should be a qualification: it should be unenforceable at the option of the tenant.  Agreements entered into after the passing of the Act are considered to be in force and I am not happy that that should be, because the same considerations apply to all.</P>
      <P>The whole basis of rendering agreements unenforceable is the uncertainty that existed in the mind of the tenant as to what his position would be when the Supreme Court decision was made, but that uncertainty is not, and will not be, cleared up by this Bill.  He will be uncertain of his position until the new legislation is adopted and because of that uncertainty he may be constrained to enter into an agreement after the passing of this Bill.  His uncertainty arises in the same way as the uncertainty of the tenant who entered into an agreement before the passing of this Bill.  Why should he be treated differently because he entered into an agreement after the passing of the Bill rather than before it?  He should be given the option to stand over the agreement or to avail of such rights as he will be given under the new Bill when it is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister was to agree to that line of reasoning the wording of the last sentence would be: instead of the words &ldquo;before the passing&rdquo; we would have &ldquo;during the currency of the Act&rdquo; interspersing &ldquo;and at the option of the tenant&rdquo;. <Col N="457" /> I ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>

      <P>I do not want to labour the point unduly, but it is wrong to say that the passing of this Bill will give peace of mind to any of the affected tenants.  All this Bill will do is freeze their position for six months.  These people are worried about their long-term situation, what their security of tenure will be over a number of years, and not over the next six months.  They are primarily concerned about their long-term prospects.  This Bill will not allay their fears but might induce them to enter into a commitment they would regret when the new legislation is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be excessively legalistic about this section, but I think we should get it right because too often in the past legislation which was not right gave rise to many court cases.  The last six words of the section are not needed and give rise to ambiguity.  I propose therefore that the works &ldquo;while this Act is in force&rdquo; be deleted from the section.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to prevent an increase in rent communicated between the time when the High Court proceedings were instituted and the date of the passing of this Bill, whether it be communicated by the landlord or agreed. The intent is to ensure that the tenant is not bound by that increase in rent and is not required to pay the increase.  That, I presume, is the intention.  In the long term whatever new rent is to be determined will be determined under the new and comprehensive legislation to be introduced.  As section 4 is at present drafted it appears that, if the landlord has communicated an increase in rent after April 1980 or if the tenant has agreed to pay the increase after that date, before the passing of this legislation, the tenant would be bound by that agreement but the landlord would be unable to enforce it before the courts while this Act is in force.  The correct legal interpretation would appear to be that after the six months have expired the landlord could bring proceedings to seek all the arrears due.</P>
      <P>There is no logical reason for the words &ldquo;while this Act is in force&rdquo; in the section. Their deletion would copperfasten the intent of the section and remove an ambiguity which could cause concern to tenants who may have previously agreed an increase and may feel they have to save money in case the landlord brings proceedings against them in six months' time seeking that increase.  The Minister should seriously consider amending the section by removing those words.  They have no great relevance and serve only to create ambiguity.</P>

It would appear that tenants could enter into agreements which would be more beneficial to them than agreements made under the new legislation.  If it is not enforceable, that applies to the tenant and also to the landlord.  Some tenants who entered into agreements since 18 April may end up in a far worse position under the new substantive legislation. Possibly the section could be redrafted.</P>

      <P>The limit of the powers of the court under this section runs up to any time before the execution of an order for possession.  If the point were reached when an order for possession were actually executed, that would be the end of the tenancy for all time and the tenant, once ejected, would lose all his rights which could have been built up over many years.  I would ask the Minister to consider giving for a fixed period a tenant who had been ejected the right of reinstatement to the premises.  That is by no means unusual.  Such a provision was granted in the case of certain ejectments under the 1860 Act, many of the provisions of which are still law in this country. It would be quite a shame if by reason of being quick off the mark a landlord not <Col N="460" /> only got an order for possession but succeeded in putting it into effect, a statutory tenant thus losing all his rights for all time.  The Minister might consider providing for the right of re-instatement for a month or two.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>State Guarantees Act 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order 1981</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>This Resolution arises from the recent restructuring of the particle-board firm at Scarriff, County Clare.  On 26 March 1981 the House approved a Supplementary Forestry Estimate of £1,293,000 in this context.</P>
      <P>The difficulties experienced by the chipboard industry in Ireland over the past decade resulted in the closure of three of the country's four mills, the exception being Chipboard Ltd, Scarriff, which was in receivership since April, 1980, and which remained in production through State assistance to the receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package for restructuring this firm involved the setting up of a new company, <Col N="461" /> namely Chipboard Products Limited, in which the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry became the major shareholder. Very briefly, the restructuring arrangements, which were completed on 13 May 1981, involved an agreement between the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and a local consortium to purchase the assets of Chipboard Ltd, in receivership, and form a new company to carry on the business of particle-board manufacture at Scarriff.  The board of the new company consists of four State directors and three directors representing the private investors.  The company have an ordinary share capital of £527,000, of which the State subscribed £334,000 and private shareholders provided £193,000. There is provision for a share option scheme which, if taken up, would increase the private share capital to £231,000.  The State also subscribed at par for £200,000 15 per cent redeemable cumulative preference shares.</P>
    <P>A loan of £466,000 for a period of 12 years was provided by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and there is provision for capital grants, totalling £1,012,000 over a three-year period, of which £293,000 was included in the Supplementary Estimate.  The package also incorporates a timber supply agreement with the new company whereby the Forest and Wildlife Service will continue, for a period of three years, an arrangement whereby the existing firm were paid to harvest a proportion of their wood requirements from State forests and allowed to remove the wood free of charge.</P>
    <P>Apart from the direct financial investment and timber supply agreement referred to, the State agreed to guarantee £400,000 of a bank loan of £750,000 to the company.  This guarantee necessitates an appropriate amendment of the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and it is specifically in this context that the Resolution now before the House arises.  Before any moneys from the loan can be disbursed approval of this amendment is necessary in order to legalise the guarantee.  There is an urgency about the matter inasmuch as it is envisaged that <Col N="462" /> the company will require to draw down on the bank loan in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this order before the House and I wish him well in his new ministry. I know the Minister realises the importance and urgency of this order.  It is a move to preserve a lot of jobs in Scarriff chipboard factory along with jobs in the harvesting, extraction, haulage and transportation of timber.  The timber processing industry has faced tough times all over the world.  Unfortunately the past few years have seen the loss of the Athy wallboard factory, the Munster chipboard factory, and portion of the Clondalkin Mills ceasing operations.  These were all very heavy users of timber thinnings and waste.  The loss of Scarriff would have seen the demise of the last timber processing mill here.</P>
      <P>The situation there was very worrying not just because of the loss of jobs but because it would also have meant the importation of our chipboard needs and the loss of the expertise we have in this industry.  Also we would have had no outlet for forestry thinnings.  For some years before this move was taken, there was a scheme of subsidisation of timber thinnings to Scarriff and Clondalkin. Despite this move Scarriff had difficulties and were about to close.  At that stage the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and other State bodies had washed their hands of the project and could not see much hope for its future.  The Government decided to assist Scarriff, and local business people and ordinary people who were interested and were prepared to raise funds revamped the mill.  With substantial State aid and the continuation of the timber subsidisation, Scarriff was saved.  The new board of directors and the division and percentage we have come up with secured the investment of the private sector but particularly the State investment in this mill, which is considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was responsible for appointing two of the directors and Deputy O'Malley appointed two others.  I now refute the statement which was made previously that this move to save Scarriff involved party hacks.  I challenge anyone including <Col N="463" /> the present Minister to provide two more qualified people than the two directors I appointed.  I did not ask them about their political affiliations but I know and admire their qualities of honesty, trustworthiness, experience and commonsense. On 26 March when this was first introduced in the Forestry Estimate, Deputy E. Collins objected strenuously and referred to party hacks and political patronage.  When a move was made to save Scarriff Deputy E. Collins displayed a truculence that would be very much in keeping with the dog in the manger and referred to the Munster Chipboard factory. Others referred to the close of the Athy wallboard factory.  I lay the blame for those closures particularly on our Government and I note the remarks by mouthpieces of certain unions and of certain lunatic fringe political parties who were prone to refer to this matter.  In relation to Waterford the unions have the greatest sin to answer for with regard to the closure of the Munster Chipboard factory having regard to the sit-in. Actions whether they were official or unofficial frightened away prospective buyers and they effectively closed the gate and locked the door on Waterford. In relation to the wallboard factory in Athy the management must take a certain amount of blame, as must the dumping of Swedish imports.  The attitude of the management, the workers and the unions must be looked into.  For years there were 50 too many working in that factory and they virtually got appearance money.  The unions must be culpable on that account.  Representatives of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union who would accuse politicians of playing on the emotions of people would be as well to cast the mote out of their own eye before they deal with anyone else.  I refer particularly to a recent remark made by them.</P>
    <P>When I say the unions I do not mean the ordinary working members, who have very little to say, I am talking about the Dublin-based people who pull the puppet strings in the background, the faceless people who dodge the blame but who are all smiles when it comes to taking <Col N="464" /> the credit.  They play with the lives of people also.  But in this case the jobs and the future of Scarriff were saved.  It is well to remark that for the period the State took on the responsibility of the mill &mdash; before the new company took office &mdash; it did remarkably well and paid its way.  I am confident that in the future it will pay its way and stand on its own feet.  The decision to improve the plant, to improve the product, giving it uniform quality in order to provide for our future needs at home, was the right one.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that move in Scarriff there was also the introduction into this country of a firm from Oregon, the Medford Corporation, manufacturing medium-density fibre board.  When the future of Scarriff was in doubt there was a degree of concern that Medford in Clonmel would harm Scarriff.  I should say that they are not in the least incompatible. Scarriff make a chipboard; Medford make a medium-density fibre board which will be used in furniture.  They will both look for different markets.  The Medford product has already got a toehold for 20 per cent of its output even in Europe.  Its output in America has now obtained 20 per cent of the trade in the EEC.  This decision will utilise the supply of timber thinnings we will have for the next ten years &mdash; there will be enough for all &mdash; and the agreement with the Forestry and Wildlife Service to provide a subsidised supply will run for three years only.  That is necessary and will give both industries an opportunity to find their feet.  After that, hopefully, the market will decide the price.  At that stage there could perhaps be an energy value to the thinnings that will be used that could help to decide the market price of the product.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulties of the timber processing industry, in which we had 300,000 tons of thinnings to spare every year with no market for them, as Minister at that time, I did a deal to the effect that we would export timber to Sweden for a three year period because nobody at home wanted it.  The person concerned did manage to export 24,000 tons.  I should say we have nothing whatsoever to hide in regard to this.  The timber was there, nobody wanted it.  It would be <Col N="465" /> comparable to the sales of our calves at one time to Italy and to Europe generally, when nobody wanted them here at home.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember the time when calves were available for £1, or could not even be given away.  At that stage I am sure people would have been glad to export them.  This decision of the Government also had the effect of keeping our harvesting people in employment, training more people, getting them ready for the large volume of harvesting and extraction and on road-making and machinery usage that will become necessary in two years time when the project gets under way.</P>
    <P>I consider this decision in regard to the future of our forestry as a fine example of a Government that were not single-minded, who had no hang-up about socialism or capitalism but who were prepared to act to solve the problems of the day.  I would see the State involvement in Scarriff and the private enterprise in Clonmel providing the complete answer to our needs through the utilisation of our forest products, as having been a very good decision and one that will ensure that our sawmills are geared to maximum capacity in providing the 1,000 new jobs for which the IDA recently claimed credit.  I would view it also as forming part of a programme for which the Department of Fisheries and Forestry can claim some of the credit.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and I wish Scarriff well.  I am sure it will thrive and prosper, serving our needs in the remaining decades of this century and beyond. When the decision was taken earlier this year it was considered a brave one.  I consider it still to have been the proper decision and that it will so prove in the future.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the motion. As the Minister has outlined, it will ensure that the Scarriff factory will be saved, which is vital for many reasons. The primary reason is that it is the only timber processing industry remaining in this country giving valuable employment in a remote part of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Power said, it is obvious <Col N="466" /> that we have a problem with regard to the disposal of our forestry thinnings, a real problem for this Government, as it was for the previous one.  Probably it will be the greatest difficulty with which the Minister will have to deal in the years ahead.  We must find ways of getting rid of our vast surplus of forest thinnings which, as Deputy Power stated, amounted to 300,000 tons in the past year.  These will increase and probably will be a multiple of 300,000 by the time we reach the nineties.</P>
    <P>I made the point in this House before that at this stage we should be examining seriously the provision of a chemical pulp mill.  For Members who do not understand this technical expression, it is the ultimate in the processing of timber, when one ends up with a product called wood pulp and eventually newsprint. That mill is badly needed and the Minister might bear in mind the necessity to have a study carried out to ascertain if we are justified at this stage in going ahead with its provision.  I anticipate that it would cost several hundred million pounds to construct.  But the time has arrived when the provision of such a mill is justified.  The closest such mill to us is one in Fortwilliam in Scotland.  I believe it has experienced considerable teething troubles, most of which have now been overcome.</P>
    <P>It is indeed a sad state of affairs to see us exporting vast quantities of timber at a price of £1 per tonne.  The irony of the situation is that we are exporting that timber to Sweden.  Indeed, it is because of the dumping by Sweden of finished timber products that three industries in this country have closed down over the past three or four years &mdash; there were four, including Scarriff which we are discussing here today.  The remaining three have had to close.  They were not viable because of the dumping by Sweden of finished timber products in other European countries.  Now we are exporting our timber at a give-away price to the very country responsible for those closures.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could give us some further details of the announcement made last Tuesday morning that we <Col N="467" /> hoped to save annually £25 million by increased processing of our timber products. I do not see how that saving can be made and I should be glad if we could have some further explanation.  The Minister may say it is a question more for the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry Commerce and Tourism.  To me the prospect is over-optimistic.  I think it will take a considerable number of years and we shall have to await the construction of the Medford timber processing factory in Clonmel, plus some other timber processing factories, before we can hope to effect such a saving.  Ultimately we should be planning for the chemical pulp mill which will utilise all our excess forestry thinnings.  As I pointed out before it is an ideal subject for a joint venture between this State and the six north-eastern counties because they too have surplus timber products.  Together we could pool our resources, making the chemical pulp mill a viable proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this motion which is, I suppose, a minor, technical completion of the arrangements that were made in regard to Scarriff.  I notice that the guarantee is regarded as urgently necessary in respect of the £500,000 of a bank loan of £750,000.  I have had occasion to say before in this House &mdash; from both sides of it I think &mdash; that certainly the Irish banks are not tremendous risktakers when one takes into account the fact that this loan of £750,000 is backed by assets of perhaps several million pounds.  Nonetheless, a State guarantee of more than half the loan has to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that Deputy Power and I argued with the banks on the occasion concerned but with only limited success. At least we got the level of the guarantee from the State down to £400,000 from the figure which was originally requested.  I saw in the newspapers the other day a statement by the IDA, to which Deputy Deasy referred, in relation to the timber industry generally.  I wondered why they found it necessary to issue it because I would have thought that everything in it <Col N="468" /> had been said by me as well as themselves <i>ad nauseam</i> over the past year.  One of the more curious parts of the statement was their expression of confidence in the future of Chipboard, Scarriff.  That amused me because there is no IDA money in Chipboard, Scarriff.  All the money that has been put up by this State &mdash; unfortunately it had to be a large amount of money &mdash; came from the Department of Forestry and Fisheries. Deputy Power has already referred to this.  I wonder why the IDA felt it necessary to make the statement they did the other day in view of those circumstances and in view of the fact that they are not in any way involved in this project.</P>
    <P>Although the IDA and a number of other State agencies felt unable to help in regard to this project, it is an important one in terms of what was done and how it was done.  It promises to be one of the more fruitful partnerships between the State and private enterprise in this country. There have not been many such partnerships and most of those there have been have not succeeded.  There is a certain spirit about Scarriff which I observed in the course of very prolonged negotiations which went on over about a year.  I do not just mean the factory; I mean the people of the locality as well.  It is worth noting here that a lot of small people who could ill afford it subscribed quite substantial sums of money to enable this partnership to be worked out and to enable this new company to be formed and take over the assets of the old company from the receiver.  Many of those people are taking substantial risks with most of whatever assets they have.  It shows a level of commitment which is not usual in many parts of the country where the State is expected to step in and shoulder the entire risk when a situation like this is encountered.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment Mr. McInerney and particularly the local people in Scarriff for the enterprise they have shown and the courage they have shown in relation to this project.  I express the hope with some confidence that the whole operation will work out to the satisfaction of everybody and that gradually over the next few years this old-fashioned <Col N="469" /> chipboard factory can be refurbished and brought up to modern standards with the money being provided from public and private sources.  I trust it will become an efficient and profitable organisation in the near future and will ensure that the Irish market for chipboard will be met from our own sources and that any increase in imports can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Deasy had to say about a chemical pulp mill.  This is certainly one of the options which has been looked at recently, but I have considerable doubt if we now have sufficient raw material for such a mill.  I believe when the Scarriff mill and the Medford plant at Clonmel are fully operational they will use up all the thinnings and other forms of waste timber that are likely to become available over the next five to ten years.  I am not sure what level of availability is likely to be there in the nineties and if there will be an increase that would warrant the consideration of a further large processing plant.  If the raw materials were available in the nineties the type of plant which Deputy Deasy speaks about might well be the optimum utilisation of those resources.  On the other hand, one has to bear in mind that the capital required is enormous and the employment given negligible, and this project might not be possible if raw materials were scarce or limited.  I believe this was the best utilisation in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am happy that, as of now, all timber that becomes available in this country from 1983 onwards, whether sawlog timber or waste timber, will be fully utilised or fully processed in this country.  The sawlog timber industry has undergone quite a transformation over the past number of years and is now a modern and efficient industry by comparison with the state it was in four or five years ago.  With the coming into full production of Scarriff and Medford there is no doubt that all our waste timber and thinnings that will begin to become available from 1983 onwards can be fully processed in this country.  That is a satisfactory situation about which we are entitled to express our pleasure.  I hope it will remain that way.  The rescusitation of Scarriff in the <Col N="470" /> form in which it has been achieved is important, not just in the context of timber alone but in a broader context, because it has shown people in a real way what can be done by local enterprise and initiative and the willingness of people to put their money where their mouths are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to wish the new company, Chipboard Products Limited, every success in the future.  I would like also to compliment and pay tribute to the previous Minister for Forestry and Fisheries, Deputy Power, and also the previous Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, who were very much involved and helped considerably to get this company under way. I feel we have here an ideal formula for successful business enterprise, where the Government, the local people and the workers in the Scarriff area can operate and manage a very successful chipboard business.  I would like to take this opportunity of wishing it every success and hope that it will go from strength to strength.  The people in east Clare realise how difficult it is to attract industry there. In that rural area there has been a successful enterprise for many years.  Many of the workers there also had small farms and they invested their earnings to improve and develop their farms.  I should like to thank Messrs McInerney who invested their money and who in difficult circumstances kept the industry going.  The workers are grateful to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick Cavan-Monaghan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I thank my predecessor, Deputy Power, for the special welcome he extended to me and for his good wishes.  The Deputy took credit for the agreement which gives rise to this motion and I would be less than candid if I were to take any credit for it.  The Act was put together sometime before the change of Government. Indeed the agreement I referred to was entered into by my predecessor and a consortium of Clare people on 13 May 1981, with a view to saving the Scarriff chipboard factory and preserving a number of jobs there.  I understand there were 200 jobs in the old factory which perished <Col N="471" /> and that there will be about 150 jobs in the new undertaking.  Therefore, about 75 per cent of the jobs have been saved, and I am glad that has been done.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about other State enterprises such as the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, and it struck me when I came to the Department and was given this file that a more orthodox way to save the undertaking would have been to ask either of those bodies to do it.  There is no doubt that the agreement referred to provides a lot of help to the undertaking, equity of £534,000, with a Department loan of £406,000, grants during three years of £1.112 million, the loans we are now guaranteeing of £400,000 and a loan of £750,000.  Deputy O'Malley spoke of the bank requiring the State guarantee urgently.  The explanation is that the State-guaranteed part of the £400,000 is being drawn on before the £350,000.  As well, the agreement provides for subsidising the raw material, the timber, during the next three years.  It provides that the company will be entitled to the timber, which constitutes thinnings, for three years free of charge and there will be a subsidy this year of £6 or £7 a ton. This figure will be revised next year.</P>
      <P>I wish the undertaking well and I sincerely hope that the jobs which this agreement set out to save will be firmly established and that in the years to come the undertaking will provide a purchasing agency for State timber, which is maturing in ever greater quantities.  The motion before the House provides simply the machinery, by amending the State Guarantees Act, 1954, to enable one of the conditions in the May 1981 agreement to be implemented.  Time does not permit me to go into great detail or to deal with matters raised by Deputy Deasy and others.</P>

      <P>I have given permission to Deputy Woods to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Questions Nos. 8 and 9 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to raise this matter on the Adjournment but I was so dissatisfied with the answer &mdash;<Col N="489" /> which was not in fact given to me &mdash; this afternoon that I asked permission to raise it on the Adjournment.  The Minister refrained from giving a reply to the basic question which I asked in No. 8, which was what the extra yield in a full year is expected to be from the 150 per cent increase in health contributions which the Government are committed to in their Coalition programme.  In Question No. 9 I asked what the expected yield in a full year would be from this increase in health contributions for each of the following groups, employees, the self-employed and farmers.  The Minister gave both answers together and said they would be circulated later.  On being questioned he would not disclose any of the figures.  In fact the Leader of the Opposition joined in asking him to give the figures.</P>
      <P>On my own calculations and without exact information I estimated that this additional charge would amount to approximately £89 million.  The Minister mentioned that the current level for employees was £42.6 million.  I was taking that figure at £44 million in my round estimate.  Coming back then to my own estimate I reach a figure marginally under £87 million.  A few minutes ago I received a copy of the answer to the question which the Minister had in his possession at the time and I am particularly disappointed that the Minister did not give us the figures because they are exceptionally clear in the answer to the question.  I shall read the answer which is particularly interesting for me because the total figure here in the answer I now have is £87 million.  Why could the Minister not give us that figure at the time?  Why does he want to hide it?  Why did he not want to give it when the press were here?  These are questions I have to ask myself and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only four figures involved <i>in toto.</i>  According to the reply, the estimated extra yield in a full calendar year on the basis of the proposed new contribution rate and no upper income ceiling and income levels on which the estimate for 1981 was based breaks down into four heads, the PAYE system, mainly <Col N="490" /> employees; the self-employed, including excepted farmers and the total figure.</P>
    <P>The contribution from the PAYE system, mainly employees, the additional money which will come through the Coalition package and which will be charged on the Health Estimate is £76.4 million, this is very much the kind of figure I felt it had to be and my crude calculations were very close to that.  The figure for the self-employed is £5.2 million and the figure for farmers is £5.4 million, giving a total of £87 million.  This brings out very clearly the point I was trying to get at in the questions I asked. First, the size of the increase which is greater than 150 per cent because it also includes income above £8,500 which was not covered before is £87 million, is an enormous sum taken from the Health Estimates to pay for a whole range of other things outside the health area.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the matter of the way in which the tax will be imposed. There are difficulties in collecting these moneys everywhere except in the PAYE sector.  We know in relation to tax generally and to health charges particularly that the PAYE sector is a fairly easy one to collect from.  The current charge is 1 per cent and the new charge 2.5 per cent. One can take it that the figure for collection there is valid because the amount of £76.4 million will be accurate to within a very small degree.  The collection in the case of the self-employed is somewhat different; it depends on what profits are shown at the end of the day and will probably take somewhat longer to collect. In the case of the farmers the Minister has said that he does not anticipate, certainly in the next year, an increase in the multiplier for farmers.  I agree with him.  In fact, the multiplier was held at the same level this year because the farming community have had such a difficult period that their ability to pay additional charges became questionable.  So, I agree with the Minister in the desirability of maintaining the multiplier as it is.  But if you do that you will scarcely get any extra income at this time so that the income will come for the most part from the PAYE sector.  Of course there will be <Col N="491" /> people in that sector who cannot afford to pay it but they have no means of expressing their inability to pay.</P>
    <P>We have the figures now and I thank the Minister for making them available so clearly at this stage.  I can see that they are quite accurate; they are what I would expect.  They indicate very clearly that this is, in effect, a bad tax.  It is inequitable in its application as the burden will obviously fall principally on employees for a variety of reasons.  It is a tax made without a benefit in that sector; there will be no improvement in health services; it is put down in the programme as being intended to offset various other things the Coalition plan to do.  It is a very severe tax on the public generally and on the health sector particularly.  It is a tax of more than 150 per cent because not only does it apply to incomes up to £8,500 but in addition it applies to incomes above that figure.  I have no way of indicating what that additional amount will be without the benefit of time to work it out but it is certainly more than 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>I object to the health services being the scapegoat for this Coalition package. From my own experience I know there is great need in the health services for improvement.  There is need to improve community-based services, to improve hospital out-patient departments, to improve further psychiatric services and a whole range of other services.  Services for the elderly particularly need improvement. There is need for additional funds, large as the funds are that are going into the health services.  I agree that they absorb a considerable amount of funds. To impose a tax of this order which in a full year will take an additional £87 million and contribute none of it to the health services themselves I think is a very great mistake.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed that the Minister did not make the figures available at Question Time.  It would have avoided us coming back at this stage, because there are just four simple figures and we specifically asked him to give us even one of these figures.  I indicated, by way of question, what I felt that figure was.  I guessed <Col N="492" /> it was about £89 million but on revision and as a result of another figure which he gave me, I was able to come nearer to the correct figure which is £87 million.  That is an extraordinary amount of money to take from the PAYE sector principally. It is an extraordinary amount of money to take for the Coalition package and not to apply any of it to the improvement of the health services.  I should like to thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to bring this matter before the House.  I regret I had to do as but following a specific request the Minister was not prepared to give us the figure I sought.  It was because of that that I was disappointed.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my dismay that the Minister on his first day answering parliamentary questions has not shown any sign of the ordination day zeal one would expect from someone who was put here to answer questions.  He appeared reluctant at all stages to impart information.  In fact, I got the distinct feeling that the Minister went out of his way to suppress information.  At some stage during the putting of supplementary questions he was prepared to undertake the work of the Chair and to make interjections that should have come from the Chair rather than from the Minister. I have looked at the document which was circulated to Deputies and the figure we asked the Minister to disclose is easily discernible at £87 million.  That figure was available and easily understood.  It showed up clearly on the tabular statement circulated by the Minister but he refused to disclose it despite the well educated shot in the dark by Deputy Woods &mdash; he underestimated a little what the total would be rather than overestimated it &mdash; and despite a request from the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be only two excuses for this, that the Minister knew the answer but did not wish to give it or that he did not understand his brief.  Those excuses do not hold good.  The Minister's approach to Question Time has not been helpful to this side of the House and that is why we have raised this matter on the Adjournment. Had the Minister given the information <Col N="493" /> required this matter would not have been raised and if the Minister persists in his attitude this will happen again. The other day Deputy Flanagan exhorted us all &mdash; particularly the Chair &mdash; to preserve the democratic weapon we have in the parliamentary question and it would be wrong of the Minister to try to disarm us and remove this wonderful weapon from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know how Deputy Woods succeeded in raising this matter on the Adjournment. Was it to revenge his mind on me because I gave him a reply to his questions Nos. 8 and 9 to the effect that I would circulate the information in the Official Report? The Deputy is seeking to bring before the House on the Adjournment a matter to which he has not received a reply.  At Question Time I stated that it was my objective as long as I am responsible for answering questions in regard to any problem to give as much information as possible to Deputies from whatever side of the House they come from.  I hope to see that through.  There was no intention on my part to suppress information but I got the impression that once the information being sought was circulated in the Official Report &mdash; it was detailed information in relation to the questions &mdash; the Deputy, if dissatisfied, would under the rules of the House raise the matter on the Adjournment when we could have a clear-cut debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Power meant when he said I was using the Chair. I have always obeyed the Chair and I understand from the procedure of the House &mdash; Deputies Power and Woods should be aware of this &mdash; that when the Chair calls the next question it is the duty of the Minister concerned to proceed to the next question or, alternatively, disobey the Chair.  I do not know what Deputy Power has in mind.  I should like to ask those Deputies to bear in mind that the Coalition package on this matter was an agreed programme and that the increase in health contributions is linked with an overall taxation package involving <Col N="494" /> reductions in other aspects of taxation such as income tax.  We cannot quote a figure out of context because it does not give a true picture.  This programme was introduced by the Coalition but Deputy Woods carefully selected out of context a figure without taking the full package into consideration.  There are problems in relation to quoting a specific figure. There are problems in relation to the level of employment and under our youth development programme we hope more employment will be created.  There are problems in relation to the financial year and the calendar year.  The discrepancy in the figures referred to by Deputy Woods could arise from certain factors but I can assure the Deputy that once the information is available in the Official Report he will have an opportunity of debating the matter fully on the Adjournment. I do not wish to deprive any Member of that opportunity, even if it inconveniences me.  Like other Ministers I do not mind coming back to the House if Deputies are dissatisfied with the information that was given to them.  I was amazed that Deputies accused me of the suppression of information because that would not be in accordance with the proceedings of the House.  When the detailed information is available in the Official Report Deputies may, if they wish, question me about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give such figures in future so that supplementaries may be put at the appropriate time.  If that is not done Deputies are denied the opportunity of asking questions.  I look forward to the Minister giving the full information in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <P>It is my understanding of the procedure that once a Minister informs a Deputy he is circulating the information in the Official Report he is not in possession of all the facts.  A Minister is not briefed to any great extent when that occurs and Deputy Woods should be aware of that.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 July 1981.</P>
