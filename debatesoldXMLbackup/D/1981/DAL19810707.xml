      <P>This scheme which is to serve 50 households is estimated to cost £275,000 and allowing for grants and the personal contributions of the members the deficit on the scheme would be £186,000.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council were asked to give favourable consideration to the making of a special contribution of £186,000 to the group, towards the cost of headworks but the council have indicated that they are not in a position to consider the proposed subvention because of the financial commitments already made in the current year for special contributions to group water schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know that it is not correct to accept everything which may be reported in regard to disputes of this nature.  I can assure the Deputy that my colleague, the Minister for Labour, has been in close touch with the situation since the beginning of the dispute.  The Deputy is also aware, from his knowledge of this particular industrial scene, that it is a very delicate industrial scene and that the approaches which have to be made to the individual parties have to be carefully ordered.  I assure the Deputy and the House that everything that should have been done from the beginning of this dispute has been done and will continue to be done until it is brought to a resolution, hopefully in the near future.</P>

It is because of this that I put down this Private Notice Question here today, to try to extract from the Minister for <Col N="66" /> Transport, and indeed the Government, what steps have been taken.  It appears that no steps whatsoever have been taken.  Will the Minister meet the CIE groups of unions today and if not, why not?  I want a straight answer, yes or no. This demands immediate action and I understand the Minister for Labour said he would not take any fire brigade action.

It is for the Minister for Labour to negotiate a settlement in this dispute and I can assure the Deputy and the House that he is in active and delicate negotiation with the people involved, and we have to be careful that nothing is said in this House which would exacerbate the situation and make his task more difficult.</P>

    <P>On the Order of Business, I was informed at 12.15 p.m. that the Opposition had withdrawn agreement which had been reached on the taking of Estimates without debate.

I hope this problem will be settled equitably and amicably in due course and I am willing to meet the Leader of the Opposition to discuss it, if he should wish to do so.  In these circumstances, the Order of Business will be as follows: Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 11, 2, 3, 12, and 13 with the Estimates in the following order: Nos. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, in the Education group.</P>
      <P>No. 42, Labour, Nos 18, 19, 20 and 21 in the Public Service group; Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22 and 53 being the Finance Bill with Supplementary Estimates on Nos. 12 and 22; No. 52, Energy, with Supplementary Estimate; Nos. 46 and 47, Defence and Army Pensions; No. 43, Industry, Commerce and Tourism; No. 44 Transport with Supplementary Estimate; No. 45, Posts and Telegraphs; Nos. 37 and 38 Fisheries and Forestry; No. 39, Gaeltacht; Nos. 3 and 5, the Department of the Taoiseach and An Comhairle Ealaíon with Supplementary Estimate on No. 3; No. 29, Environment; Nos. 40 and 41, Agriculture, with Supplementary Estimate on No. 40; Nos. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28, being the Justice group; No. 51, Health; No. 50, Social Welfare, with Supplementary Estimate; Nos. 48 and 49, Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this is the most extraordinary behaviour by a Government for many a long day.  As yet we have no written notice of this Order of Business.  Will it be customary for the Government to let the Opposition Whip have the Order of Business in writing at some stage before the Dáil assembles <Col N="73" /> and, if so, why has this practice not been adhered to today?  We were supplied with a note very late today of the items read out, namely, Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 11, 2, 3, 12 and 13.  The Taoiseach has now read out a list of Estimates but we have not received a written list of these Estimates.  Are we to get it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Leader of the Opposition's injured innocence ill becomes him.  The Order of Business was notified to the Opposition in respect of the items on the Order of Business.  They had agreed to the Estimates being taken without debate.  That agreement was withdrawn without notice at 12.15 today which made it necessary for the Government to decide in what order the Estimates would be taken and to sort out the availability of Ministers to move the Estimates and to deal with any points raised.  In the short time available we have managed to do that and to give the House full information on the order in which the Estimates will be taken.  That work was completed immediately before the House sat.  There was no discourtesy involved, although I cannot say that much courtesy was shown on the other side.  Despite that, as I said in my earlier remarks interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition, I would be anxious to settle this accommodation problem, which was the reason given at 12.15 for the change in what had been agreed.  I would wish to settle the matter as rapidly and as amicably as possible and would be happy to meet Deputy Haughey to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not make any agreement about taking Estimates or Supplementary Estimates because we have not seen the Supplementary Estimates. My understanding is that until we reach No. 8 on the Order of Business leave will not be given to introduce these Supplementary Estimates.  I do not see how they could be ordered before No. 8 is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were given verbal notice this morning of some of the items on the Order of Business and only very late this morning did we receive the typewritten notice of the Order of Business.  That notice did <Col N="74" /> not include the list of Estimates which the Taoiseach has now read.  In future will the Opposition receive the Order of Business the evening before or the morning the Dáil assembles or when is it the Taoiseach's intention that we should be furnished with written notice of the Order of Business?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedures will be followed in future.  They have broken down on this occasion because of the withdrawal of an agreement which, contrary to what the Deputy says, was reached on the Order of Business.  It is, of course, correct that this agreement did not extend to the Supplementary Estimates. Simply as a matter of courtesy to the House, I mentioned, in listing the Estimates in the order in which they will be taken, those in respect of which Supplementary Estimates will arise.  I felt it might be useful to the Opposition to be aware of this.  So far today each courtesy I have extended has been met with interruption, rejection or criticism.  However, that is a matter for the Opposition.</P>

The preparation of that legislation and the analysis of which aspects require legislation and which can be done by order is something which will be completed shortly.  I intend to convey to the Leader of the Opposition as soon as possible, in as much detail as possible, the legislative programme so that the Whips may enter into consultations about the scheduling of it and so that the House may adjourn at the earliest possible date for the convenience of Members having completed its business.</P>

It is the sorting out of this to ascertain the minimum legislation necessary for the sake of the country to get the economy moving again which is nearing completion and the Opposition will be notified as soon as possible.</P>

I recall that difficulties arose on the last occasion about this, even though we did not have the same problem of numbers, and it took quite a while to sort it out.  My party found themselves substantially in exile for a few months. That should not be allowed to happen again.  Arrangements for accommodation in this House within the limits imposed by the present accommodation should be sorted out on an equitable basis with an allocation of space proportionate to the non office holders in the different groups and to the Independents.  I would like to meet not merely the Leader of the Opposition but also the Independents to discuss this allocation of space.  The sooner that is done the better because it is very unsatisfactory for Deputies of all parties, particularly the Opposition to be left in the present situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The motion before us deals with the hours the Dáil will sit. It is necessary that we look at this in some detail because we are starting off now on a new Dáil and what suited the Members of the last Dáil and what they found appropriate may not be so for this Dáil. I do not think we should just rubberstamp this change without asking the different Members of the House to give their views on it.  If we do not accept this motion we go back to the old hours of sitting, which are those in Standing Orders.  Of course Standing Orders have never been reprinted.  But it is worthwhile spending a little time looking at the changes proposed to see whether in the changed circumstances of the House everybody would be satisfied with the sitting hours now proposed.</P>
      <P>I am particularly interested in hearing the views of the Independent Members because I understand from the Independent Members that they wish to be fully taken into account in all discussions and consultations, that they would like to have their circumstances and convenience fully considered, and that these matters should not simply be left to the larger parties to decide between them.  I should like the Independents to understand fully what exactly is being proposed in this motion, the hours of sitting we propose to adopt.  I should like to have their views on whether or not these hours of sitting would be in accordance with their wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is now proposed is that the Dáil should meet on Tuesdays at 2.30 p.m., Wednesdays at 10.30 a.m. and Thursdays at 10.30 a.m. and that the sittings should conclude normally at 8.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. on Thursdays, with a sos between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Wednesdays. <Col N="82" /> I think most Members would agree that, by and large, these sittings have met the convenience of most Deputies and have been regarded as reasonably satisfactory. But it is true that what is suitable and convenient from the point of view of Dublin city Deputies, for instance, may not be equally convenient for Deputies who have to travel from far distant parts of our country.  Therefore before we rubberstamp this change, it is worthwhile our getting the views of those Deputies who are interested in the matter and who would like to have a say as to what particular hours we should adhere to in this new Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain briefly, for the benefit of the Independents who were not Members of the House when this change was made and also for the benefit of the new Members on all sides and in response to the invitation just given by the Leader of the Opposition, why this change was made in 1975, in the first instance on an experimental basis, subsequently continued on a year to year basis, then for the remainder of the Dáil, and then throughout the duration of the 21st Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old hours and the new hours add up to the very same number of sitting hours weekly, exactly the same amount of sitting time.  The Thursday hours were unchanged.  In other words, what is in Standing Orders and what we have been doing for the last six years is exactly the same so far as concerns Thursdays.  If I may be allowed to put it in a nutshell, the only difference is that, whereas the House used to sit until 10.30 p.m. in the evening in Tuesdays and Wednesdays and did not sit at all on Wednesday mornings, the new arrangement for the last six years has been that the House rises two hours earlier in the evening at 8.30 p.m. and catches up with the time thus missed by sitting on Wednesday mornings as well, whereas formerly Wednesday mornings were free.  We also standardised Question Time at 2.30 in the afternoon. On Wednesdays entirely out of consideration for the reporting staff &mdash; perhaps other staff benefit from it as well <Col N="83" /> but particularly the reporting staff when the Seanad is sitting on a Wednesday also &mdash; we introduced a sos from 1.30 to 2.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>That was the reason for the change.  It was opposed at the time it was first made. But I think I can say &mdash; I would have said until now at any rate &mdash; that most Deputies found the new hours more convenient than the old ones.  Wednesday mornings did not go to waste for Dáil purposes. It also had the advantage, which will be recognised by both sides of the House, whichever party occupies either side, that one had a better chance of having one's remarks reported and noticed under the new arrangement.  Due to press time constraints anything said in this House after 8.30 p.m., or even earlier, just cannot get into the papers.  It is lucky if it gets into any news bulletin, let alone the nine o'clock evening one.  I would have thought these hours &mdash; and I never heard any question raised about them until now &mdash; suited most Deputies, though I recognise that there were a few that they would not have suited for reasons of their own.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that we should look at these arrangements again and scrutinise our arrangements all the time to ascertain whether they can be improved.  But I think that those new arrangements did appear more convenient to most people. Certainly when we arranged to have Private Members' Time at the end of the day it meant that on Tuesday evenings anybody not engaged on Private Members' Time could get away at seven o'clock, go to his constituency, a function, or simply rest himself as the humour took him.  Those were the advantages of the system we introduced in 1975.  I personally think it would be a pity to abandon them but I accept that there may be other points of view.</P>

      <P>May I assist Deputy Haughey and Deputy Colley in this regard? It was during the course of Deputy Colley's term of office as Tánaiste that this proposition arose.  It arose in relation to Bills where there were protracted debates on Committee Stage and money was frequently very short and was urgently required time and again by successive Governments in that regard.  It was from the Fianna Fáil Party that the proposition emanated and was unanimously agreed by the then Whips, as were the changes of hours at that time. We were all involved in it.  I have been Whip in my party since 1973.  The purport of the motion is self-evident, is well-known to Deputy Haughey and was exercised on many occasions in the House.  If the Deputy is now trying to suggest that there is something particularly unique about it then I suggest it must have allowed the previous Government to obtain moneys time and time again even when people did not know what their parliamentary subjects were about.</P>

      <P>I am very distressed that the wealth of experience of the Minister of State was not better recognised in the recent turn-up.  The aspect of the financial business, to which the Minister of State refers, is not involved here at all. The procedure of the Departments running out of money is catered for otherwise. Any Department of State can in any year spend a certain proportion of their departmental Estimate related to their previous year's departmental Estimate. It is only when it exceeds that that some special arrangements have to be made.  We are here talking about Bills.</P>

    <P>It seems to me that that involves circulating Bills imposing a financial charge on the people.  This side of the House are very distrusting of the Government at this stage because we hear all sorts of rumours of the imposition of an extra 1½ per cent health charge, an additional 3.75 per cent on all incomes over £8,500 and a 2½ per cent on all incomes for some employment fund purposes.  With all these indications, rumours and disclosures in the air we are naturally suspicious of what may happen in regard to the imposition of charges, particularly charges being imposed during the summer recess when the House is not in session and in a position to scrutinise and, if possible, reject them.  I want to know from the Government what precisely is the reason for the motion before us at the moment.</P>

      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to address myself to Members of the House of long standing but particularly to newly elected Members. The motion relates to the subject of parliamentary questions and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the parliamentary question is the greatest democratic weapon which individual Members possess and it is the duty of every Member to safeguard and cherish this right if we are anxious to see a democratic Parliament function freely and without hindrance.  The opportunity arises particularly on the occasion of a new Dáil and new Government for every Member of the House to consider his rights as an elected representative to table parliamentary questions.  The parliamentary question is the greatest democratic weapon possessed by any member. Members new or old should cherish that right and hold on to it no matter what the difficulties or obstacles may be because it is a right they receive from the electorate to take to task and question any Minister on any item of national, international or local importance.  The function of a Deputy depends on his freedom in a democratic parliament to ask questions in relation to his constituents, his country and its international standing. Unless the parliamentary question can be tabled without hindrance, without the influence of Ministers of any Government and without the undue interference of the Ceann Comhairle or his staff, Parliament is not free and democracy becomes a farce.</P>
      <P>I appeal to every member of Fine Gael and Labour, to each of the Independents and to every Member of Fianna Fáil to ensure that the right to ask parliamentary questions is never tampered with.  Unless Parliament can work freely the whole process becomes completely paralysed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning Deputy Byrne raised a question.  I shall not question the right of the Ceann Comhairle to adjudicate on whether that question was right or wrong. There was a conflict of opinion.  Deputy Byrne maintained he was within his rights <Col N="94" /> to put down a question in regard to the Ballymun flats.  The Chair ruled otherwise. I want to know &mdash; and here I shall expect to hear in detail from the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; what is the machinery behind the Chair for disallowing parliamentary questions.  We can put this question to the Chair today but we cannot put it again until this matter arises on the occasion of the election of the next Dáil. The free working of Parliament depends on the rights of Members and Parliament can only function as freely as we allow it to function.  If Parliament dies a slow death and if democracy is blotted out of Irish society only the Members occupying their seats here today have responsibility.</P>

      <P>I hope the Chair will take into consideration my experience which is longer than that of any other Member of the House and I have seen the manner in which the parliamentary question is frustrated.  I have seen how it has been side-stepped by occupants of the Chair in the past and by those occupying Ministerial posts.  Deputies have a right in regard to the parliamentary question and I cannot see how I am out of order in speaking on this Item No. 6&mdash;I am aware of standing order No. 35 which I have read as often as I have read the headlines of the morning papers &mdash;which clearly states that paragraph (1) of Standing Order 35 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business shall not be implemented where the Ceann Comhairle is of opinion&mdash;this is the important part of it&mdash;that its application would prejudice the answering of another question put down earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has an opportunity now of <Col N="95" /> safeguarding the Parliamentary Question and of reinforcing it and of stressing the importance of the right of any Deputy to question any Minister across the floor of the House and require him to answer for the acts or omissions of any civil servant in his Department or the conduct or misconduct of any Minister.  If the parliamentary question is in any way interfered with or is likely to be, or if there is a misapplication of a misdirected opinion to the Ceann Comhairle, it can mean a miscarriage of justice in Parliament.  If Deputies were muzzled or prevented from asking questions or if the Ceann Comhairle's office were such as would prevent a question from being asked, freedom and democracy as we know them would not exist and we would expedite a state of anarchy in which Parliament would not and could not function. A Parliament without teeth is useless and the teeth in Parliament are the rights of Deputies to ask what questions they like when and how they like provided it is within the rules of order.</P>
    <P>In the past, parliamentary questions have been disallowed and in future such questions are likely to be disallowed and this is where I want Members to be alert because there is machinery available to prevent the ordinary Deputy from exercising his rights as a Member of a free, democratic Parliament.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this motion is to prevent a Deputy taking an advantage over a fellow Deputy to put down an oral question.  We should confine the debate to that but I should like to assure the Deputy and every Member of the House that while I am in the Chair there will be no attempt to muzzle any Deputy who wishes to ask a parliamentary question.  Here, however, Deputy Flanagan is discussing another subject.  I think every Member will agree this motion is very important in the interest of every Member of the House.</P>

      <P>I do not desire to embarrass the newly elected Ceann Comhairle; rather do I extend to him my congratulations and good wishes on his <Col N="96" /> election but I am pleased and proud to hear that he will exercise his own judgment as a parliamentarian in relation to questions which are placed before him by his officials.  If the Ceann Comhairle gives the House that undertaking, if he gives an undertaking that he will not, and cannot, be influenced by anybody in his office or by anybody holding ministerial office, either junior or senior, I will accept it.  That undertaking should be given in the interests of the free democratic running of this Parliament.  The Ceann Comhairle had evidence when sitting on these benches that parliamentary democracy is dying a slow death in Ireland because of silence or the prevention of free speech.  It is because of that that tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets, farmers and taxpayers.  We should remember that the day people take to the streets is a day of anarchy. The place to do the talking is in this House, the supreme authority in the Republic of Ireland.  This is where the talking must be done and that is why I want the Ceann Comhairle to guarantee the rights and privileges of the elected Members, young and old.  I want the Ceann Comhairle to be the custodian of the rights of all Members in seeing that their privilege of tabling parliamentry questions and asking supplementaries does not prevent them exercising the right, the privilege, the trust and the confidence placed in them by their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Chair has most generously stated, that the Chair will not yield to any influence.  Let this be the first new real ray of hope that democracy in Ireland will live on and that democracy in the Parliament will prevail.  I express that hope because I have seen grave injustices and grave steps taken to hinder and discourage the right which Deputies have to exercise their parliamentary functions. If the Chair agrees to give that undertaking I will accept it gladly.  However, there is nothing like giving notice to all and sundry, to both sides of the House, that we have equal rights and none of us is better or more superior than others.  We all want to cherish our right <Col N="97" /> to ask questions when, how and where we like, provided they conform to the rules of procedure.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition knows well what is involved. Under the system that existed up to 1973 a Minister might be called on to answer all questions on the Order Paper put to him but under the system introduced in 1973 Ministers were taken in rotation.  A certain rotation has already been agreed. A Minister answers the questions put to him and then Ministers are taken in rotation. When the system was introduced in 1973 Fianna Fáil agreed to it.  It seemed to work well since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we support this motion which arose out of a report of an informal Committee on the Reform of Dáil Procedure.  It is designed to deal with the situation where a Deputy, the sort of Deputy about whom the father of the House, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, has just waxed so eloquently, might have a question which would be of importance and urgent for his constituents but, because of the volume of questions on the Order Paper, might not be reached <Col N="98" /> for a considerable time.  The purpose of the recommendation which is enshrined in the motion is to endeavour to ensure that different Departments come up for scrutiny at Question Time at reasonably regular intervals and that an overburden, as it were, of questions to a certain Minister or Department does not act unfairly in regard to a number of other Deputies. I agree with the Minister of State that the change introduced did act reasonably well and, therefore, we are in agreement with the proposal that we should continue along these lines, for the moment at any rate.  It is important that the House, especially new Members, should fully understand what is at stake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. J. Flanagan Mr. O. J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had experience of membership of the House before this procedure was adopted and while it was in operation.  For that reason I support the motion.  The terms of it should continue for a further period.  However, the Government, in consultation with the Chair, should consider the case of a Deputy who has a parliamentary question to table which he considers of extreme importance and urgency to his constituents. That question may not come before the House for three weeks or one month but by that time the value and the sting of the content of the question will have gone.  As the custodian of the rights of members would the Ceann Comhairle consider allowing questions of urgency and importance?  The Chair only permits questions to be asked relating to an extremely urgent matter and in many cases that must be of national or international importance.  While matters of national or international importance may not be at stake, in many parts of rural Ireland those affected by the question will consider the matter to be as important as an international item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a Deputy in the course of tabling a question states that in the interests of his constituents he desires to obtain information quickly, special provision should be made to permit the tabling of it on the Wednesday after it is handed in.  The system whereby a parliamentary question does not come up for discussion for three weeks after it is tabled takes the teeth out <Col N="99" /> of the content of that question.  I am not saying that any Minister is anxious to avoid replying to a parliamentary question: all Ministers delight in being able to give the true facts so as to safeguard those who have supplied them with the information, because the Minister is responsible for the actions of all people within and connected with his Department.  For example, a question to the Minister for the Environment about a local authority matter would not be of any importance to most Members but would be of great importance to those connected with that local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in the Taoiseach's Office and those responsible for parliamentary questions in the Ceann Comhairle's office should get together with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and give some serious thought to how an ordinary rural Deputy can put down a question which in his opinion is of vital importance but which, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, is of no importance at all, and which the Minister being asked the question might give the back of his hand to.  As the custodian of our rights I would ask the Government to see that our rights in relation to what we feel is an urgent question will get consideration.  There is a grave possibility that a parliamentary question may be put on the long finger because any Minister can exchange with another Minister.  I hope I will be forgiven for commenting thus, but during the past four years we have seen Ministers side-step parliamentary questions by sending in somebody else to answer them.  There should be some procedure whereby parliamentary questions from rural Deputies are given some degree of importance and priority and can be heard within three or four days of being tabled if the Deputy wishes.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle appreciates the problems of rural Deputies in this matter.  The new Deputies in the House probably do not see the point of all this but when they come to put down a parliamentary question in relation to some important topic in their constituency they will see the importance of the <Col N="100" /> discussion we are having now.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle to seriously consider giving important questions from rural Deputies some form of priority.</P>

      <P>Up to the time that this agreement was come to, questions were put down to Ministers in order of seniority with the result that questions to junior Ministers were piling up and might not be called for a few months.  Fianna Fáil proposed, at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, a reform which we all believed was a good one and which we agreed to.  Deputy Flanagan has made certain suggestions.  I would like to assure him that we will bear them all in mind.  I would also like to inform the Deputy that we intend to initiate as soon as possible certain reforms of the Dáil and Dáil procedure and the Taoiseach will be in touch with the Leader of the Opposition.  The idea is to improve procedure.  Deputy Flanagan can take it that we will safeguard the rights of all Deputies whether rural or urban.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimates will be circulated immediately.  It was understood that these Supplementary Estimates would be taken today.  It is worth recalling that they arise in their entirely from decisions taken by the outgoing Government.  We have decided to introduce them and as they are matters also with which the Opposition front bench at least will be very familiar, they are hardly subjects on which the House will wish to have very lenghty notice before considering.  Indeed, the precise details of these Estimates would have been seen by the outgoing Government and I would prefer if we could deal with these today in order to have the maximum expedition of public business and also to ensure that funds which are necessary for certain very worthy purposes can be made available today rather than delayed unnecessarily by the failure of the House to agree to take them today. In view of the fact that they have already been approved by the outgoing Government who are fully familiar with their contents they should be dealt with today. However, I would stress that should any member of the outgoing Government who has forgotten the contents of the Estimate which he agreed to wish to ask further questions about the decision he took and the reasons he took it we will, <Col N="102" /> of course, be delighted to provide that information.  As to the decisions taken by the previous Government in this matter, we will answer any questions which members of the Opposition back benches may wish to ask about the decisions taken by the then Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, and I am telling the House what is in them.  They are decisions taken by the previous Government and nothing else.  However, as the leader of the Opposition is anxious to defer the implementation of these decisions of his, I will certainly agree to defer them until tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any urgency in Vote 22 and Vote 23 in relation to agricultural grants and agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be most regrettable even for the sake of one day if grants were to be delayed or if any further inconvenience were to be caused to farmers because such Supplementary Estimates could not be passed hastily and with all speed to assist the agricultural community which we are all extremely anxious to do.  But now there may be a long delay caused by discussions which may not serve any useful purpose but may be the means of delaying important grants because the money will not be readily available.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to <Col N="103" /> exercise all prudence in having the Supplementary Estimates presented with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to facilitate the Government in the speedy passage of the Estimates having regard to the serious financial circumstances of those engaged in agriculture and particularly those who are awaiting the payment of agricultural grants.  Both during the election campaign and since then I have been closely in touch with the farming community in regard to these problems.  They have placed their confidence strongly in me.  I am asking the Minister for Finance to use his good offices to ensure that whatever money he requires to facilitate the agricultural community, especially in relation to grants, will be made available without delay.  The people concerned are depending on these moneys.  They are in position now of not knowing where the next penny is coming from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the concern expressed by Deputy Flanagan that these moneys should be made available immediately and it was for those reasons that I proposed to the House originally that we take the Estimates today.  However, I regret that, having given my word to the Leader of the Opposition not to take the Estimates until tomorrow, I am not in a position to go back on that agreement. I would point out that it is merely Vote 22 which relates to agriculture. There is no Supplementary Estimate on Vote 23 and the grants in question relate to the rates support for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no problem whatever caused for anyone by taking these Supplementary Estimates tomorrow.  To some extent they arise from the budgetary provisions and no single individual anywhere will be in any way disadvantaged by our adhering to proper procedures in this House.  We are just asking that financial business be dealt with here in a proper way and the normal and proper procedure for dealing with these matters is to ask leave to introduce a Supplementary Estimate, then to circulate <Col N="104" /> it to Deputies so that they are aware of what they are voting on and then to take the Supplementary Estimate on the day for which it is ordered.</P>
      <P>In view of the impassioned plea which Deputy Flanagan made earlier on behalf of Deputies I should hope that he would support me in what I am proposing, that is, that we adhere to proper financial procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. J. Flanagan Mr. O. J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Vote 50, can the Minister indicate whether this Vote is being regarded as one of extreme urgency in so far as it relates to the weaker sections of our community&mdash;the sick, the unemployed, the widowed and all others who are depending on the financial strength of the Department of Social Welfare?  For those who are in need of a meal, 24 hours is a long time to have to wait.  If, as the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have said, there is no change in the Supplementary Estimates to come before us now and those which were ready when the Leader of the Opposition was Taoiseach, why is Deputy Haughey so keen on this delay? He must know what is in these Supplementary Estimates.  The members of his Cabinet had consultations with the secretaries of the various Departments in regard to them.  In view of the urgency associated with payments to social welfare recipients, why can the Opposition not agree to take these Supplementary Estimates immediately?  The people concerned are not in a position to get credit facilities in any shop.  They are depending totally on social welfare for their next meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement to take the Supplementary Estimates was altered at 12.15 p.m. today when the Opposition withdrew their agreement that the Supplementary Estimates be taken with this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the position is that I have agreed with the Leader of the Opposition not to take the Supplementary Estimates until tomorrow but in fairness <Col N="105" /> I should say that the delay of one day will not present any serious problem. Since the Leader of the Opposition is anxious that there be a more open and extensive debate than what might perhaps have taken place today had we been able to go ahead with the Supplementary Estimates, I am happy to agree to his request that we leave them over until to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that we did not at any time make any agreement that these Estimates, supplementary or otherwise, would be taken today.  I do not know how this misunderstanding arose but it was not on our part.  Deputy Flanagan should understand that this Supplementary Estimate, if we are correct in our assumption of what it covers, is simply to provide money for the increases that we announced in the budget.  In other words, these increased rates are already in full payment and there is no question of anyone being injured or delayed in any way as a result of taking the Supplementary Estimates tomorrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing Deputy Harte as Leas-Cheann <Col N="106" /> Comhairle I would remind Members that he is a long standing Member of the House, he is approaching the 20th anniversary of his first election to this House.  Deputy Harte has had considerable relevant experience, having been Chairman of the All-Party Committee on Irish Relations in 1973 and in 1977 and having been Vice Chairman of the Inter-Party Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity as well as being a Member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  His experience, his service and his personal qualities which have endeared him, I think to every Member of the House, render him especially fitted for the office for which I propose him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go dtoghfar Séamus Ó Tonnaí mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>In proposing Deputy Tunney as Leas-Cheann Comhairle I do not wish to reflect in any way on Deputy Harte or on his suitability for the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We are proposing Deputy Tunney for a number of reasons, first, because of his personal qualities and his status in the House.  We believe that he is a Deputy who has the respect of Members on all sides, that he is held in high regard by Members in general and that he will make an excellent Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out also, that Deputy Tunney is fluent Irish speaker.  It is important that a certain volume of the business of this House be transacted from time to time in Irish and it is in support of that wish of ours also that we are putting forward Deputy Tunney for this position.  We believe he is competent to conduct every aspect of business in this House in Irish and that he will do everything in his power to encourage the use of Irish in our discussions and debates. Finally, I wish to tell the House that we are putting him forward on the basis of what we see as a need for balance in our affairs in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time there was a tradition in this House that one side supplied the Ceann Comhairle and the other side supplied the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am <Col N="107" /> not going to go into the circumstances in which that tradition was broken because I am quite certain that if we were to argue from our side that it was a Coalition Government who broke that tradition somebody from the other side would argue equally forcibly that Fianna Fáil were responsible for the first break with that tradition.  Parliamentary historians can decide who was responsible.</P>
    <P>At this stage I believe that this Dáil should restore that balance.  The Ceann Comhairle is an Independent Member of the House but he was the nominee for the Chair of the Coalition parties.  It was their right to put you, Sir, there and it was your right to accept it.  It is our view that, in order that a reasonably fair balance should obtain in our affairs, we should have the opportunity on this occasion to put forward our nominee as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>That is especially so in the new type of Dáil we have here.  There is a very unusual spread of membership.  I do not know if a similar composition of membership has obtained in any Dáil for a long time.  We have a Coalition Government, two parties who have a bare majority over our party, with a number of Independent Deputies who apparently reserve to themselves the right to vote from time to time in any way they wish. We have an unusual combination of forces and membership in the Dáil.  We believe it would be fair and reasonable that, if the Coalition Government parties have their nominee in the Chair as Ceann Comhairle, this side of the House is entitled to have their nominee as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>On the basis of Deputy Tunney's personal qualities, acceptability and suitability, because of his great love for and competence in the Irish language and because of our wish to see a reasonable balance obtain in the House, I have the honour to propose Deputy Jim Tunney as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Again, I wish to reiterate that I do not want to reflect in any way on the capacity of Deputy Harte as a Deputy of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the Independent <Col N="108" /> Deputies who has to make a decision once again, one that may be important, I should like to deal briefly with the question of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This Parliament is certainly not going to be one of soft options for anybody.  Deputies Tunney and Harte are probably two of the most popular Deputies in the House. Both of them are very experienced Deputies who have been Members of this House for a long time and both are highly competent to carry out the job for which they have been nominated.  It will be a very difficult decision for me to vote for one rather than the other but, as has been said before, this is not a popularity contest. It is a political matter and, as such, I am going to treat it without any implied imputation on the merits of either of the Deputies concerned.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been that the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have been assimilated into the spoils system of winner take all. As in so many other matters in swimming against the tide, I do not particularly favour that idea.  To that extent I think I should take a truly independent position in resisting what has been a recent trend and try to move it back to the position that obtained, and which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, where the Ceann Comhairle was nominated by the Government and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was nominated by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach spelled out briefly but cogently and impressively the list of Deputy Harte's qualifications.  Deputy Harte is an experienced Deputy and many of us have listened to him on many occasions with considerable interest on various issues.  He knows the procedure of the House extremely well.  As the Taoiseach said, he has many personal qualities that have endeared him to every Member of the House but with the exception, it appears, of the most important Member&mdash;the Taoiseach.  Many of us believe that Deputy Harte should not be competing for the very important post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle but one that in the minds of most of us is a lesser post to that of being a member of the Cabinet or even a Minister of State.  Personally I am <Col N="109" /> surprised that Deputy Harte is not a member of the Cabinet or a Minister of State.  However, I do not feel it is part of my job or the job of this House for us to appear to be making amends to Deputy Harte for something the Taoiseach has not done for him by giving him this kind of consolation prize.</P>
    <P>Both components of the Coalition Cabinet seem to be dominated by repaying old scores or paying off old debts rather than a preoccupation with what I consider to be the first responsibility of a Taoiseach and Tánaiste and that is trying to get the best possible Cabinet in the national interest.  In all the circumstances I deeply regret that I cannot support the nomination of Deputy Harte.  I found Deputy Tunney to be a most energetic Minister.  In his Ministry he was very courteous at all times and very helpful if one wrote to him and wanted things done.  He has always behaved, and I am sure he will behave in this job, with total impartiality.  I propose to vote against Deputy Harte and in favour of Deputy Tunney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Browne I have been placed in a most invidious position regarding the appointment of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I indict both sides of the House for not being able to reach a civilised agreement on this matter. A winner take all approach was mentioned by Deputy Browne and also in the press during the week.  That is a cruel approach.  My instincts would be on the side of fair play and democracy.  In the last two Governments there has been a winner take all approach in regard to the appointment of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I deplore this attitude.  Unless we have some kind of civilised attitude in our approach to these appointments, which are non-contentious offices, we cannot point a finger at the North and talk about power sharing. We are very good at that and saying they should do this, that and the other.  Our example is not very good.  Perhaps we can learn something from what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in a difficult and delicate position.  On the one hand I favour fair <Col N="110" /> play and democracy, and on the other it has been presented to me by the Coalition that a vote on the appointment of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle could be represented as a vote of no confidence in the Government at an early stage.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  I am not naive enough to take heed of everything that is said to me in that regard.  I do not want to be used or exploited by anyone.  I am sure both Deputies would make very good Leas-Cheann Comhairles and I have nothing against either Deputy.  The job should be filled by someone who, above all, is intelligent, dignified and has a sense of fair play in dealing with all sides.  My decision on how to vote has been a difficult one to make.  It would be inconsistent for me, having voted with Deputy FitzGerald and the Coalition on a previous occasion, to cast my vote in the other direction today. It could be misrepresented.  While I deplore the fact that both sides are not big enough to come together and work out some formula regarding this appointment, unfortunately I must go the opposite way to Deputy Browne and cast my vote in favour of Deputy Harte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard this morning on the radio that people were wondering how the independents would vote today, as if when we vote on one side or the other we are on that side.  I should like to state that as an independent I am voting on every issue on the basis of an informed conscience and what I consider to be the national interest.  I do not consider that I should be placed in the invidious position that because of the way I vote today I am in the hands of one side or the other. I will never be bought as long as I live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe in a winner take all approach.  We have seen this in the city council.  I was elected as a community politician in City Hall and saw the position there.  Fine Gael and Labour had a majority over Fianna Fáil and Community and, therefore kept the office of Lord Mayor.  The office of Lord Mayor is not worth very much anyway in this regard. Instead of rotating it they kept the office themselves.  I do not like to see that happening. <Col N="111" /> I believe in consensus politics and fair balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there be any misapprehension I should like to clarify the issue so that we may know exactly what is involved.  In relation to this Dáil, when the question arose about the appointment of a Ceann Comhairle I spoke to the then Taoiseach.  I gave him my personal view and what I thought would be the view of my party, though I did not have a chance to consult them, that the practice under which the outgoing Ceann Comhairle continued in office was a procedure which, although it had been breached on a number of ocasions, was the most appropriate one.  I regretted that it had been departed from.  We did not go into the question of who and when because that is history.  However, I indicated to him that if the outgoing Ceann Comhairle was a candidate I would ask my Party to accord him support.  Even if the position in the Dáil was not as delicately balanced as it was, my conviction that this was the correct procedure would remain the same.  The decision was taken however for reasons which can be appreciated and it was perfectly within the entitlement of the Opposition to withdraw the name of Deputy Faulkner despite the fact that the then Taoiseach was aware that I was willing to vote support for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in those circumstances, Sir, that your name came forward for election.  It is only fair, in view of what has been said, that it should be known that that is the position I held and expressed.  That having happened and you, Sir, having been elected, and there being no proposition forthcoming in respect of a Member from the opposite side of the House, I put forward the name of Deputy Harte as someone well qualified to hold the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I do not think it is good that the post of Ceann Comhairle and that of Leas-Cheann Comhairle be dealt with in the way they have come to be dealt with.  It lay outside my powers on this occasion and perhaps <Col N="112" /> we can discuss in the future some convention which would apply which would get us back on course again.  We have got off course.  I have no desire to go into the question of who is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>Independent Deputies should be aware of the position and know the manner in which I approached this matter and the spirit in which I approached it before passing their vote.  If I understood Deputy Kemmy correctly, he felt that the issue at stake was one of confidence in the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell him that this is not a vote of confidence in the Government in any sense, although naturally, in the circumstances that exist, the Government having put forward a candidate for the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, following the failure of the previous Government to maintain the nomination of Deputy Faulkner as Ceann Comhairle, we would seek support for our candidate and hope that he would be supported.</P>
      <P>It is not a matter of confidence.  I feel I must say that lest Deputy Kemmy's vote be cast under a misapprehension which would be unfair to him.  I hope these explanations of mine will be taken into account by the House in deciding how to vote.  This is a matter which each Member of the House must decide according to his own view or, in the case of people who are members of parties, in accordance with the view of their party.  It would have been wrong for me to allow the debate to conclude without clarifying these two points, either of which could lead to people voting under a misapprehension as to the true position.</P>

If Deputy Tunney has all the <Col N="113" /> qualifications necessary for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; and I have no doubt that he has &mdash; why did Deputy Haughey not nominate him for the position of Ceann Comhairle last week when Deputy Faulkner declined that position? Can Deputy Haughey explain when the Ceannn Comhairle refused to seek reelection, was he invited to stand down, or did he stand down himself and, if he did, having regard to Deputy Tunney's qualifications for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, why was his nomination not put before the Dáil last week? That question is extremely worrying to me.  I should like the Leader of the Opposition to enlighten me on this matter.</P>

Exactly the same arguments apply to Deputy Tunney not going for the position of Ceann Comhairle as apply to Deputy Harte not going for that position.  It is important that the matter has now been cleared up of the prominent Member of Fine Gael who approached Deputy Kemmy and suggested to him that if he were to vote against Deputy Harte he would be voting no confidence in the Government.  Now that that has been cleared up and Deputy Kemmy has been freed to vote in accordance with his independent and well informed conscience, I want to reiterate our position to him and to the House in case I did not make it clear at the earlier stage.  We believe that, with the peculiar composition of this House, it is fair, reasonable, logical and sensible that, as the Coalition parties have installed their nominee in the Chair, to keep the balance in the administration of the House we should be entitled to hold the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I want to repeat to Deputy Kemmy that for a long time that was the tradition in this House. Unfortunately that tradition was broken. I agree with the Taoiseach that there is no point in either of us arguing specifically as to who broke it or why it was broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, having regard to the particular composition of this new Dáil, <Col N="114" /> the Independent Deputies should consider seriously re-instituting that tradition. To have a Ceann Comhairle who has the confidence and support of the Government side, and a Leas-Cheann Comhairle who has the confidence, understanding and support of the Opposition side, is a very reasonable approach to our affairs.  I recommend it strongly to all the Independent Deputies.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that, if our nominee is not accepted, no matter what their protestations are and no matter what honest face they put on it, the Government will have all the Ministers, all the Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I suggest that, in a very finely balanced Dáil such as we have, that does not reflect the wishes of the people and is not a fair, reasonable and balanced way for us to conduct our affairs in the weeks and months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be the first to congratulate Deputy Tunney.  I assure the House that it has not been very pleasant to be the centre of controversy.  However, from the bottom of my heart I congratulate Deputy Tunney and wish him well in the task which lies ahead.  I was looking forward to the challenge of the position and naturally, am disappointed that it did not come my way.  I offer my very sincere congratulations to Deputy Tunney and will co-operate with him as a Member of the House in the duties which he will perform.</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition for their kind remarks. I wondered whether, in fact, they were talking about me, or not.  The only remark I take offence at&mdash;and I know it was off the cuff&mdash;was the remark of the Ceann Comhairle when he said that he was casting his vote in order to ensure fair play in the House.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on a personal level possibly better than any Member of the House.  I wish to put it on record that, had I been successful, there would have been no unfair play on my part.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Noel Browne I have had one of the closest relationships&mdash;a peculiar relationship which perhaps many people did not understand.  We have a close bond of friendship and he had a difficult task to perform.  The same applies to Deputy Kemmy.  I thank Deputy Kemmy for voting for me and understand why Deputy Browne, and indeed Deputy Loftus, voted against me.</P>
      <P>On the general position, I believe that the House should recognise that the office of Ceann Comhairle should be above politics.  It has not been above politics, let us be honest about it.  Indeed, the party most responsible for bringing it into the political arena is the present Opposition.</P>

I hope that this cliffhanger will make us realise our obligations and that we will fulfil them in a fair way.  The decision of the Ceann Comhairle to cast his vote against me was very courageous, but in the long term possibly it was the right one.  While it is not very pleasant to thank the Ceann <Col N="123" /> Comhairle for voting against me, I recognise the decision he had to make and know that it was made in the best interests of the House.  I accept it as such.  I wish Deputy Tunney every success in the job which he has been selected to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is threefold: firstly, to extend the limit on CIE's borrowing powers for capital purposes, secondly, to extend the limit on the board's temporary borrowing powers and, thirdly, to extend the powers of guarantee of the Minister for Finance in relation to borrowings or contract arrangements for the provision of goods and services entered into by CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE's capital expenditure is financed from the board's internal resources, mainly depreciation provisions, and from borrowings either from the Exchequer or from such outside sources as may be found attractive.  At present the aggregate amount of CIE's capital borrowings at any one time may not exceed £55 million. CIE have now reached the limit of their capital borrowing powers, most of the outstanding borrowings being represented by Exchequer capital advances on which interest is paid by CIE.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, essential to extend CIE's capital borrowing authority to enable the board to proceed with a number of capital projects and to undertake any new projects which may be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major projects which the board have in hands at the present time are the <Col N="124" /> electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban rail service, the acquisition of 124 mainline carriage units and the renewal of the board's urban and provincial bus fleets.  There is also, of course, the provision of commuter rail services linking Maynooth and intermediate points with Connolly Station, but the provision of this service, which is scheduled to commence operations in a few months, does not require large scale capital investment at this stage.</P>
    <P>The electrification of the Howth/Bray suburban service, which was approved by the Government in May 1979, will, on its introduction in 1983, represent a major improvement in public transport services for people on the eastern side of the city. Since the late 1960's passenger demand on the Dublin suburban rail services has been increasing&mdash;daily carryings on the Howth-Bray section have increased from about 12,500 in 1970 to 34,500 in 1980. The services are at present operated with diesel-hauled refurbished carriages which are due for replacement.  In the consideration of the CIE proposal for electrification account was taken of the need to upgrade the existing service in order to attract as many passengers as possible and so make the maximum contribution to the relief of traffic congestion. Considerations which favoured electrification were the desirability of achieving a reduction in dependence on oil, and the environmental benefits offered by an electric system which is pollution free and less noisy than a diesel system.</P>
    <P>The electrification project, on which over 200 people are at present employed, is now nearing the halfway stage.  It involves the provision of an electrical supply along the line, the provision of new signalling and depot facilities, the opening of two new stations at Sandymount and Salthill and the acquisition of new rolling stock specially designed for commuter needs.  The new service will bring about a substantial improvement in the existing service in terms of frequency, speed and passenger comfort.  Day-long services will be provided, serving 25 stations on the line, with trains operating at five minute intervals during peak periods <Col N="125" /> reducing to 15 minutes off peak.  It is intended also to extend the catchment area of the railway line by the provision of feeder bus services to selected stations. CIE estimate that by 1985 passenger numbers will have increased from the current average of 34,500 per day to about 80,000 per day.</P>
    <P>Major improvements of this nature cannot be made without substantial capital investment and in the case of the Howth-Bray electrification scheme the latest estimate of capital cost, largely based on contracts already placed, now stands at £66.4 million at April 1981 prices.  This represents a substantial increase on the estimate available at the time the project was approved, which amounted to £46 million approximately at early 1979 prices.  While there have been, of course, inevitable variations between actual contract prices and the indicative pre-contract estimates on which the original costings were based, the increase in the capital cost is very substantially attributable to the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations.  I should add that it is proposed, in accordance with normal practice, to capitalise interest charges until the project is completed, after which interest will be charged to the revenue account.  The total amount of capitalised interest charges is estimated at £16 million at current prices.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to ensure that with this project every effort is made to maximise the Irish input of components and services.  So far, I am glad to say, it has proved possible to ensure that, apart from the rolling stock, over 50 per cent of the remaining requirements for materials and services is coming from Irish sources.</P>
    <P>The second major railway project at present on hands is the provision of new carriages for mainline passenger services. Approval was given earlier this year for the acquisition of 124 mainline carriage units, comprising 94 standard carriages, 15 catering cars and 15 generator vans, to be assembled at the Inchicore works in Dublin.  These carriages are needed to enable CIE to provide mainline rail facilities of an acceptable standard of comfort and convenience for all rail passengers. <Col N="126" /> It is expected that over the life of the project employment will be provided at the Inchicore works for an average of 165 men.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the maximum possible use will be made of Irish sub-contractors for the supply of goods and services and that the Irish input generally will be maximised. Planning work on the project has commenced and it is hoped that the first carriages will be available to be put into service in 1983.  The capital cost of the project is estimated at about £36 million, exclusive of VAT.</P>
    <P>The third major item in CIE's capital programme at the present time is the renewal of the board's city and provincial bus fleets.  The renewal programme had earlier fallen into arrear because of the time lag between the termination in 1977 of CIE's arrangements for the supply of buses with Van Hool McArdle and the establishment of the new Bombardier bus building factory at Shannon.  The new factory, at which production commenced last August, is now giving valuable employment to some 300 people.  CIE have already taken delivery of 20 singledeck buses for use on the provincial services, 30 coaches for the board's tour operations and the first of the 135 double-deck buses to be delivered this year for use in the Dublin city area. There have been some initial teething problems with the new buses but I understand that these are relatively minor and are being quickly resolved.  Because of the backlog in CIE's bus replacement programme the board's requirement for new buses for a few years will be unusually high.  The total capital allocation for new buses in CIE's capital programme for 1981 is £18.5 million and CIE's forecasts for the years immediately ahead envisage expenditure continuing at a high level.</P>
    <P>The three projects which I have mentioned combined with the board's normal capital programme clearly require a substantial revision of the limit applicable to CIE's capital borrowing as the board's depreciation provisions would fall far short of the expenditure involved.  It has, therefore, been decided to set a new limit of £180 million in respect of capital borrowings, <Col N="127" /> that is, an increase of £125 million on the existing limit.  In addition the Bill provides for an increase in the limit on the guarantees which can be given by the Minister for Finance under the State Guarantees (Transport) Acts in respect of contracts for the provision of goods and services entered into by CIE.  This will allow greater scope for exploring alternative arrangements for the financing of CIE's programme &mdash; for instance, leasing of equipment, which might provide worthwhile opportunities for financing investment in transport.  The increased borrowing and guarantee arrangements provided for in the Bill will enable CIE to proceed with the projects I have mentioned in the years immediately ahead and to undertake any new projects which may be approved.  Additional finance may have to be authorised in a few year's time and the introduction of the necessary legislation will provide an opportunity for further review of CIE's capital programme by Dáil Éi-reann. Furthermore, the intervening period will give time within which consideration of the McKinsey Report on CIE can be completed and a start made on implementing whatever decisions arise from that consideration.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the Government are very conscious of the necessity for adequate and efficient public transport services for economic and social purposes. It is, of course, essential that these services should be provided in the most cost effective manner possible, taking account of the social and economic needs of the community as a whole.  It is on this basis that the Government will be considering how public transport services can best be organised.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, the present Bill also provides for an increase in CIE's temporary borrowing powers which at present are limited to £5 million under the Transport Act, 1974.  This figure is now insufficient in the light of the inflation which has occurred since the 1974 Act was passed.  CIE's expenditure on operating account has increased from £65 million in 1973-74 to £200 million in 1980, while the Exchequer subvention <Col N="128" /> increased from £10.75 million to £70 million in the same period.  It is proposed, therefore, to increase CIE's temporary borrowing powers to £20 million so as to provide a safeguard to tide the board over any shor-term cash difficulties such as unforeseen losses in revenue or increases in expenditure.  The inadequacy of the figure of £5 million was evident in 1979 when, because of increased labour and oil costs and the effects of industrial disputes, a Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced for CIE at short notice before the summer recess to ensure that the board would have sufficient cash to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your elevation to such a high office.  I have known you since I became a Member of this House to be a man of honour and fair play and I have no doubt that you will discharge your duties honourably in dealing with Members from all sides of this House.</P>
      <P>I also take the opportunity to express good wishes to my constituency colleague, Deputy Cooney, on his appointment as Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I extend to him good wishes for his success in those very onerous duties.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It was prepared during my last days in office and I recognise the necessity for introducing it at this time.  I fully subscribe to the view that CIE need an extension of their borrowing powers for capital purposes if they are to proceed in the fastest possible manner in the development of major projects in hand.  I also recognise the need for increasing temporary borrowing for CIE and am fully aware of the reasons behind the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party have always recognised the need to invest in transport infrastructure and in my short term as Minister for Transport I fully subscribed to that view and did everything possible to advance the situation.  Our investment plan and our development programme for the eighties underline the vital necessity for the development of our total infrastructure <Col N="129" /> and particularly the transport infrastructure. CIE have embarked on three major projects to develop this transport infrastructure.  The electrification of the Howth-Bray line approved in 1979 and expected to be completed early in 1983 will certainly make a very significant contribution to the alleviation of some of the congestion on those routes.  I fully support the electrification project.  It is a much cleaner and faster system and I have no doubt that following the introduction of this service in 1983 there will be demand for more electrification.  The completion of this project, together with the proposed feeder services into that line, will demonstrate the beneficial effect of an efficient commuter line in the development of Dublin city and county. When feeder buses are in operation I have no doubt that commuters will avail of the opportunity of leaving their cars at home and using the excellent public transport system which will be provided. It is forecast that the frequency of services will be sufficient to cater for the increasing number of passengers which CIE expect to carry.</P>
    <P>A second major project on which CIE have embarked is the replacement of their bus fleet and the re-engining of the existing fleet.  I have had very personal experience of the teething problems which occurred on the introduction of the first new buses.  Nevertheless those who have used the new buses have praised the very comfortable design.  Let us hope we will see more of the double-deckers which have recently come on the Dublin streets.</P>
    <P>In our investment programme and development plan for the eighties we laid stress on the need to provide this new fleet of buses, the electrification of the Howth-Bray line and many other projects. We all recognise the need for new buses in the Dublin area but we must examine the contribution which poor buses have made to the morale within CIE which, I am sure the Minister will agree, is on the floor.  We must consider how to lift that morale because this must be done if CIE are to make the contribution which is desired by every Member <Col N="130" /> of this House.  I am not pointing the finger of blame but we know that CIE have not had any new buses since the collapse of the Van Hool McArdle project.  Can anyone here imagine the frustration of a bus driver attempting to drive a vehicle which is in poor condition through the chaotic traffic of Dublin?  What will be his mental attitude to the job and what reaction will he have to those of us who have responsibility in these matters?  These are some of the reasons for CIE's industrial problems. It is vital for us to examine every area that contributes to this sort of situation including the mental attitude of workers, city bus drivers and conductors to the job.</P>
    <P>I was glad to be on the streets of Dublin on the first morning on which bus lanes were introduced to note the satisfaction of the CIE workers at being able to get a free run through the traffic chaos.  If we continue to implement this programme of bus lanes we will see a vast improvement in the service.  Against all the odds and the critics we have been successful so far in the introduction of bus lanes in the city.  The critics pointed back to the Fairview bus lane of 1970 and to the disaster that was and said that it would be impossible to introduce bus lanes successfully. The opposite is the case and I salute everybody involved in the introduction of bus lanes.  The introduction of bus lanes will contribute to better industrial relations in CIE as will the provision of more new buses.  The fact that a man will have the right tool for the job and the proper environment in which to work will make him much happier and more efficient and will provide him with job satisfaction. A more reliable bus service would encourage people who bring their cars, because they have no choice, to leave them at home and this will relieve the traffic congestion in the city.  We cannot ask men to do a job without the proper tools and without the proper environment in which to operate.  That has been my philosophy during my short term as Minister.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for a Minister, especially one who was there only for a short time, to see all his plans come to fruition. But I am satisfied that the objectives we <Col N="131" /> set out to achieve have been started along the road and I look forward to the Minister ensuring progress with these objectives.</P>
    <P>When we talk about increasing the borrowing powers of CIE for capital purposes and about increasing their borrowing powers in relation to temporary borrowings we are basically talking about how the money will be spent.  The view in this House is unanimous on the need to provide adequate capital for the development of transport infrastructure, but we as public representatives and custodians of the public purse have to be satisfied that we are getting the best value for money.  We must keep a critical eye on how money is being spent.</P>
    <P>About 50 per cent of the money being spent on the electrification of the Howth-Bray line is being spent in the State on products produced here.  That is a healthy development.  I realise that we must go abroad for equipment such as rolling stock that is not available here, but that will only be a once-off expenditure with the development of coach building at Inchicore.  When this new rolling stock comes into service CIE can study the technology that will have to be available to repair it and they can develop the technology to provide additional rolling stock as the years go by.</P>
    <P>We all agree that the maximum amount of the money spent by CIE should be spent here.  For far too long we have bought foreign goods which could be made at home.  We should not export jobs that we could have at home.  As Minister I had the privilege and honour of opening an exhibition of CIE's stores requirements in Dublin in recent weeks. I was amazed at the interest taken by various people, entrepreneurs, would-be manufacturers and existing manufacturers, who saw there an opportunity either to expand their present range of products or to engage in new undertakings to ensure that the requirements of CIE are produced as far as possible from the resources of the State.</P>
    <P>We have a fine workforce, people with ideas and the technical skills, and we only need to avail of those opportunities.  It is <Col N="132" /> the duty and responsibility of every State body to afford Irish people the opportunity to supply home produced products so that money spent in the development of transport infrastructure or whatever is spent at home.  In that way we can make a decent contribution to our job requirements because the jobs situation will become even more critical as the years go by.  As a Minister in another Department I saw the benefits that can accrue to small outlying places when they get the opportunity to make products for big boards such as CIE.  I am glad that the CIE exhibition will be put on at various major centres to ensure that everybody has an opportunity to see it.</P>
    <P>When public money is being spent on CIE the cynics say that it is money down the drain.  We have a responsibility to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to avail of the resources and to keep them in circulation here so as to make a worthwhile contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the re-establishment of coach building in Inchicore.  As Minister I visited the coachbuilding plant and was impressed by the skills and crafts available there which had been left untapped for a long time.  Those skills should be further harnessed so as to make a better contribution to CIE.  The apprentice school there is one of our finest schools and we can use that to make a bigger contribution towards providing skills that are scarce on the Irish scene. I am glad that this Bill will enable money to be provided for the mainline rolling stock that is required.  Criticisms about the deteriorating condition of the mainline carriages were levelled at the Department when I was Minister.</P>
    <P>We must recognise also that until the full examination being carried out has been completed it would be foolhardy of anybody to say we are going along with a specific project until it is known what will be the actual requirements.  I am not saying that the requirement for which moneys will be provided in Inchicore is the full requirement.  But at least it is the present requirement and the sooner it goes onto the mainline trains the better. We know that going south they have the advantage of better carriages than we <Col N="133" /> have going west, or those going north-west either.  Indeed the sooner we see rolling stock out of that area the better for all of us and indeed the better will be the picture of CIE in that area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the buses and the situation about buses in Dublin, I believe that CIE are judged by and large by their Dublin city services, good or bad.  Rarely do we hear complaints of any great substance about CIE's operations through-out the country in relation to the railways or other aspects of their business.  I believe that the railwayman has always enjoyed a tradition of his own.  People in authority should recognise that the railwayman has this tradition, that he has this commitment to the railway, part and parcel of what he, his father and perhaps his grandfather worked at.  Undoubtedly, this tradition exists in the railway section of CIE.  Families carried on this tradition, something which should be fostered.</P>
    <P>Looking at the total operations of CIE in relation to the McKinsey Report, I would ask the Minister to bear in mind these different traditions within CIE which I would hope would guide him in the right direction.  What he and the Government may decide is their business.  But from my short experience as Minister and indeed during my time working as an employee with CIE I believe that the commitment to and tradition obtaining in the railway section can be fostered and put to better use in the future.  That is why I believe that the railway component of CIE should be a separate one, when a better performance would be shown, given the proper tools for the job.</P>
    <P>In regard to the buses, I believe a different commitment and tradition exists. How could anybody reasonably attack a busman in Dublin for his attitude to the job, forced on him through existing circumstances and under which he is expected to work, furthermore bearing in mind the tools with which he is supplied? We hear complaints and letters in the paper to the effect that the Dublin bus drivers or conductors are not what they were years ago.  We must remember that we in this House over the years have had the responsibility of creating the conditions <Col N="134" /> that have made those men what they are today.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of sitting around the table for a very long meeting with the group of unions involved in CIE.  It was the greatest insight for me in regard to how those people think, work and what they expect from the Minister, his Department and the Government of the day.  They have a full appreciation of the problems involved.  They also have a full appreciation of the yardstick by which CIE in total are judged, which is basically the standard of their Dublin city services. I was very impressed by many things I learned at that meeting.</P>
    <P>That is why I said in the House earlier that I believe those people should be involved in discussions with the Minister for Transport, if necessary accompanied by the Minister for Labour, when he will learn much more in relation to those people and their problems.  They too have problems, which can be recognised.  They are prepared to listen to the other side of the story, because to every story there are two sides.  Until somebody sits down and listens to both sides no rational judgment can be taken.  I was amazed to detect, in the course of a three-and-a-half hour meeting with them, a fair amount of distrust between management and the trade union movement within CIE.  That is a terrible state of affairs.  If that is the real case, I say this, recognise it for what it is.  There is no point in leaving the problem there to fester.  It will not solve itself. Strikes will not go away.  They will have to be solved and there is no point in standing back from them.  Somebody should go in there and listen, as I listened, and learn what I learned, which was a great help to me in the way I approached various aspects of the operations of CIE.</P>
    <P>We are today talking about increasing the borrowing powers of CIE in two areas.  Yet the people, the customers &mdash; I call them customers &mdash; of the national transport company must either walk to and from work or take taxis.  These customers are fellow workers, people not in a position financially to take taxis to and from their employment.  If they are late for work or must take taxis and are short of money at the end of the week, who are <Col N="135" /> they to blame?  Yet we here are charged with the duty and responsibility of using public money to provide Dublin city and county services.  The public looking in here today must be asking themselves these questions.  What are they doing about it?  When can we expect service to be restored?  On what are they spending more and more money?  Is it pouring more and more good money down the drain?  What can we expect to get in return?</P>
    <P>We cannot get away from the fact that the taxpayers are paying money for a service they are not receiving &mdash; a service to which they are entitled &mdash; and they are further entitled to tell us that it is our duty and responsibility to so provide. When such people listen to the reports of the proceedings of this House today, can they go to bed happy in the knowledge that we even care about their problems, care about how they will get into work tomorrow, care if they ever get to work again, or if this city is to be deprived?  Do we care about the drop in business in the city centre?  Do we care that business is down 50 per cent?  They must also ask if we care that, at this time of the year when extra staff are engaged, young school-leavers' jobs may be in jeopardy? If we do care, are we really demonstrating to the public that we do care and are prepared to do something about it? Those are the realities as they see them. They are paying their money and getting nothing for it.  If this is allowed to continue, young people's jobs will be endangered.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the complex industrial relations problems and situations that are part and parcel of CIE to-day my fear would be, not that the situation would not be resolved this evening but that it would escalate, when we could encounter an even larger problem next week when we come to talk about it again.  I have always firmly believed in the philosophy that if one nips a problem in the bud one can then deal with people before they get into entrenched positions. It is much more difficult to take people out of entrenched positions, especially if they feel, perhaps incorrectly, they are being deprived of their wages <Col N="136" /> and being pushed around.  I can assure the House that when one comes to review such a situation in two or three weeks' time it will be ten times more difficult to find a solution.</P>
    <P>I am not playing politics with this situation. It is one which should be examined closely, grappled with and, if the Minister feels he should be accompanied by his colleague, the Minister for Labour, in discussions with the Congress of Trade Unions, who have a most responsible approach to existing problems, he should so arrange.  They fully recognise the Minister's problems also, realise that the pressure is on the Minister and the Government of the day to ensure that something is done.  They fully appreciate also that every time there is a strike or threat-ened strike in CIE public confidence is further eroded.  They too want to make a constructive contribution.  At a recent meeting with them I went into the various ways that could be achieved.  I know many discussions have taken place in relation to what I would term a peace concordat for CIE, which I believe is badly needed.  It is needed now more than it was ever needed before.</P>
    <P>The public have a contribution to make if they want a good bus service to enable them to travel to work, to do their business or for any other reason. The Dáil has a contribution to make and the Government of the day also have a contribution to make.  We need that peace concordat.  I believe we were well down the road towards that in recent times.  There will always be some awkward people along the way who take a little more convincing that this is the right thing to do.  I believe it is the right thing to do and I also believe there are many in the trade union movement who believe it is the right thing to do.  I believe only a small number do not want this.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to get a peace concordat and to ensure that workers cannot switch off the service to the public.  The customers will eventually get sick and tired of not having a service. Dáil Éireann and the Government will eventually get tired of paying out money because we cannot go along in a blank cheque situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I was accused of fiddling around with figures when a certain deficit was set this year.  Everybody should realise that many things contributed to that deficit.  It is within the power of many parts of that organisation to reduce that deficit and it was my responsibility as Minister to point out those areas to them.  The Minister will have information available to show what industrial strife has cost that organisation in any particular year he wants to look at.  He will see the extra subvention which was necessary.  The Minister should do everything possible to get a peace concordat and a full commitment from all the members that they will not tolerate a few people messing up the entire organisation and leaving their fellow workers without a way of coming to work.  They should realise at this particular time of the year the damage they are doing to our tourist industry.  We need a bus strike in Dublin in the midst of the tourist season like we need a hole in the head.  It is time we did something about it and it is time the workers in that organisation got the message.</P>
    <P>When one detects a breakdown in trust between management and unions in an organisation one is on the road to a very dangerous situation.  I detected that in this organisation at a few meetings which I attended.  I tested it out privately with workers outside the organisation.  If something is not done about that mistrust we are heading for trouble.  That organisation must show to the people that they can do the job.  A new way forward in industrial relations must be found or the Government will have to decide where this organisation goes in the future.</P>
    <P>I am sure that organisation will be considering the McKinsey Report when all the submissions from the various interested parties are received.  They should look very closely at that report.  The best day's work that could be done would be to break up that monolithic organisation into small units and give identity to the workers who are down below so that they will know who they are working for and can identify with their bosses.  Morale would then improve in that organisation. If that monolithic organisation is broken up commitment to the job will be <Col N="138" /> restored.  The railway man will have commitment to the railway and the busman will have commitment to the bus, particularly when he has bus lanes in which he can freely operate.  I believe they will all want to do their jobs better when they get the opportunity.  This is a very challenging job.  It is no accident that when McKinsey wrote the report on this organisation they called it the transport challenge opportunities of the eighties.  The opportunities and the challenges are there.  I know the challenges are not easy but the right thing to do is always hard. I believe the challenges must be taken up.  I hope this House will have the opportunity of debating where this large organisation should go.</P>
    <P>We should not stand back from the challenge of creating a better environment for industrial relations, which is of paramount importance to the success of that organisation and the jobs in that organisation.  We are providing the resources to develop the other parts of the transport infrastructures which are badly needed.  Money is being provided for the electrification of the Howth-Bray line, the mainline carriages and the commuter services which I introduced some months ago.  I hope those will be brought on stream as soon as possible.  Those who travel to Dublin from the west know the volume of traffic there is on that road with people driving their cars in and out to work.  We know that those people would be only too glad to use a commuter rail service.  I hope we will reach the stage when people who drive their cars or vans from Maynooth through Leixlip, Lucan, on to Blanchardstown and into Connolly Station will be able to use the commuter rail service.  This would make a significant contribution to the relief of traffic congestion on that road.</P>
    <P>Bus lanes are a great way forward in relation to giving the man on the bus a greater satisfaction and giving the customer the opportunity of trying out public transport in ideal conditions.  There is an incredible amount of illegal parking going on in the city but I believe, with the increased number of traffic wardens and the effective action they are taking, a good start has been made.  The effort <Col N="139" /> must be kept up and intensified.  We badly need more car parks in this city.  I am glad to see that the one in Mary Street will soon be on stream.  I hope the Minister will push his colleague in the Department of the Environment to ensure that the corporation car parks, two of which have already been designated, are pushed forward as soon as possible.  The people who bring their cars into the city are entitled to find a place to park them.</P>
    <P>Many decisions have been taken in regard to the development of this city.  I believe the one which will prove to be the best in the long run is the decision of the previous Government to set up a Dublin Transportation Authority.  We all know that responsibility in relation to traffic congestion in the city, the implementation of the law in relation to parking and to commercial vehicles is spread between various authorities, the Department of Justice, the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation and the Department of the Environment.  Everybody looked to the Department of Transport to sort out the various problems.</P>
    <P>A very important decision was taken to establish a Dublin Transportation Authority to bring together all those duties and functions within a single body. This is a milestone along the right road. I know that the officials in the Department of Transport are pushing ahead with that legislation.  The sooner we have it in the House the better.</P>
    <P>Another report is due on the Minister's desk soon, this month or next, on the future role of road freight transport.  The body responsible for that report, under the chairmanship of Professor Michael McCormick, are to be complimented on the excellent work they have done.  The report will be vital to the whole discussion that will have to be engaged in in relation to public transport policy in the eighties. When he has received that report I hope the Minister will ensure that there will be a full discussion in the House on the various reports, including McKinsey, because it is only after all the data has been assembled that we will be able to decide on the right road forward.  I hope <Col N="140" /> the Minister will give every Member of the House an opportunity to put views on the record.  Naturally, we do not expect the Minister to agree with all of them but their contributions can be of value.</P>
    <P>I spoke of Dublin city traffic problems and possible solutions and I suggest that when these solutions have been tried out here they can be applied to other urban areas like Cork and Limerick where there is traffic chaos at peak times.  Solutions tried out here can be of benefit to other cities.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his deliberations on these matters.  When I say I welcome the Bill I can assure the Minister that I and other Members on this side support the Bill fully.  However, though we realise the importance of the Bill and that the money must be provided, we must be vigilant to ensure that we will get the best value for the money, that we will get the best possible service for the public, many of whom have been driven away from public transport.  We want to see the pride returning to public transport.  If we provide the money we are entitled to demand value for that money by way of efficient services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I congratulate you on your election to that position.  Knowing you for a number of years I believe that you will carry out your duties fairly and efficiently. I am sure you appreciate why I did not vote for you.  I hope you will occupy the position for at least four and a half years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He has a much more difficult task ahead than you, Sir, a very onerous one, but we know Deputy Cooney's ability as a Minister.  I hope he, too will occupy that position for at least four and a half or possibly five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important that CIE should be put on a proper basis, that they should have a much better public image than they have had in the recent past.  I do not travel much now by CIE but in my early years in the city I used the Dublin bus service many times daily. In the forties and fifties the public image of CIE was far better than it is today. <Col N="141" /> Many of us here and outside have put forward many reasons for this deterioration.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Howth-Bray line electrification is being kept on programme. Strikes can occur to delay progress but I hope the Minister will do everything in his power to ensure that that programme will be completed as soon as possible because it will be of tremendous benefit to the public using that line.</P>
    <P>I have another reason for hoping that this work will be completed speedily and that it will be the success people expect it to be.  I hope some day soon to see the areas I represent, Tallaght, Clondalkin and Lucan, being connected to the city by a line which, I hope, will be an electrified line.  I am sure the Minister will examine closely the problems to be faced in connection with such a project.  It involves extending the Lucan line through Clondalkin to Tallaght.  The local authority have made a land reservation order to faciliate this extension and I regret that we did not make some progress and come up with some definite proposals on it in the past five or six years.  This proposed line will facilitate extensive residential areas in Tallaght and Clondalkin and I plead with the Minister to have a look at it as soon as possible. I hope he will ensure that any problems in this connection will be resolved speedily and that an early decision will be made.</P>
    <P>There are a few more points I should like to make on this Bill, although the Minister would like to get it and other legislation through the House tonight and tomorrow.  Part of the constituency I represent basically concerns the entire County Dublin area.  While similar areas in other counties are adequately served &mdash; and the Chair had a hand in providing school buses to transport children in remote areas to schools three or more miles from their homes &mdash; I find in County Dublin that there is a vast expanse of mountainous and rural areas which cannot be served by the school bus service.  It is frowned upon if one looks for a school bus service in the Dublin area.  The service was intended for areas outside Dublin but in fact there are people <Col N="142" /> living in remote areas in County Dublin who are far worse off than many who can avail of a bus service to schools.  Very many children live in the glens of Glencullen, Glenasmole, Ballinascorney and such areas.  The Chair is aware of these areas because I had occasion to make representations regarding them to him in his capacity as Minister some time ago. I ask the new Minister to look at this matter and see if he can relieve the pressure and hardship that people concerned undergo.</P>
    <P>A year or so ago one person put it to me that if they were to send their children to a school in Wicklow &mdash; they live close to the Wicklow border &mdash; they would be entitled to a free bus service but sending the children to County Dublin schools meant they were not entitled to the service. Many of them do not seek a free service but simply transportation from the home to the school.  I ask the Minister to see if he can persuade CIE to extend their regular service to take in as many of these areas as possible.  I did my best during the term of office as Minister of the present Leas-Cheann Comhairle and during his predecessor's time and I have failed but so long as I am in the House each time there is a new Minister in a position to do something about this problem I shall feel obliged to mention it.  I hope this is the last time I shall have to mention it.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of families now being transferred &mdash; transplanted would scarcely be the right word to use &mdash; from centre city areas to County Dublin suffer the first few years in their new homes.  Most of them have lived, deprived of much of the normal facilities most of us have, in the city for many years in expectation of being allocated a house removed from the city.  Many of them travel to see where these homes are being built.  They view the houses and look forward with great anticipation to getting one, thinking that when they get their new home their lives will be transformed.  They overlook the fact that there will be no transportation for them to and from work or to schools for their children.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister &mdash; I know it <Col N="143" /> will involve consultation with other Departments and bodies &mdash; to ensure as far as possible that CIE extend the service to such people.  In one instance many of them live one and a half miles from the nearest shop; hundreds of families were transferred there in a matter of a month or two.  They have to live in deplorable conditions in beautiful houses.  They make every effort to make their homes comfortable with furnishing and carpets but once they leave home they must travel one and a half miles to the nearest shop.  In one instance in Tallaght, in my constituency, they have to travel one mile to the nearest public transport.  This has caused great hardship because many a breadwinner left his employment in the city because of not having regular public transport to and from work.  CIE should not ignore this fact.</P>
    <P>Many other bodies and Government Departments are brought together to ensure that development of an area is properly regulated and mostly things move smoothly but when it comes to public transport many families have had to approach me to ask if I could possibly get them a transfer back to the city because they have no public transport.  I think the Chair is well aware of this, as perhaps the Minister may also be, but I ask the Minister on the first available opportunity to make a tour of the areas of County Dublin with, perhaps, the district manager of CIE, and see where bus services are available, the extent of them and the extent of development outside CIE services.</P>
    <P>Conditions in CIE which caused much trouble in the past have been mentioned by Deputy Reynolds and I agree with him to a great extent that much of the trouble is caused by frustration &mdash; the frustration of bus crews in getting through the terrible traffic conditions in Dublin city &mdash; but not all of it.  I should like the Minister to interest himself in the time it now takes a bus to get from outlying areas of Santry or Terenure into the city and the time it took five or ten years ago for the same journey.  If he looks at the figures on those lines he will realise the amount of frustration there is for bus crews and <Col N="144" /> passengers.  This drives many a person away from public transport and makes the position much worse because people are using cars to come into the city and are being allowed to park indiscriminately &mdash; another point mentioned by Deputy Reynolds.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this matter has been adequately handled.  We have been told of the appointment of additional traffic wardens but I am not sure that this is proving as effective as expected.  For instance, coming here at lunch time there were three cars illegally parked as one enters Grafton Street.  Cars are constantly parked in that area holding up traffic.  This is only one small area of the city but it is happening hundreds of times daily throughout the city during business hours.  Such illegal parking holds up the buses and the traffic and frustrates bus crews and passengers.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Reynolds refer to the mistrust that exists between management and staff of CIE but I do not think he went far enough to trace the reasons for this mistrust.  There may be several reasons but from discussions I have had with CIE employees over the years I have learned of their concern because the upper levels in the company were used for political reasons and political pay-offs.  That is to be regretted.  I am not suggesting that that is so today but certainly it was the position in the past. A lot of the trouble in CIE stems from that.  It is widely known, and generally accepted, that 20 or 30 years ago jobs were created in CIE as political pay-offs. That caused mistrust among the staff. When promotions arose they were filled on a political basis.  I hope that comes to an end.  I am not suggesting that many of those appointments, whether they were made on a political basis or not, were not good ones but if the political aspect was the main criteria for appointment within CIE it is doubtful if the best qualified people were duly rewarded.  I hope that system of appointment has come to an end and that the Minister will make every effort to put CIE on a sound basis and improve their public image.</P>
    <P>Lastly I should like to make a plea to the Minister to take action to relieve the <Col N="145" /> hardship being experienced by those living in Clondalkin, Tallaght, Templeogue and Firhouse because of the absence of the public transport service.  Today two people told me that they were unable to get to their place of employment because the buses were not running.  I am aware that the Minister is under pressure and is continuously monitoring the situation and for that reason I do not wish to say too much about the present dispute.  I am sure the Minister realises the hardship being endured by the people in my constituency. Many of those people cannot get to their places of employment in the city.  The Minister is also aware that the city centre traders made a case yesterday for an early solution to the dispute but my concern is for those living in outlying areas who are finding it almost impossible to get to their employment.  I would be slow to suggest to the Minister &mdash; certainly publicly &mdash; the steps he should take but I have no doubt that he is in close touch with the situation.  If the strike continues much longer I hope the Minister will take action to ensure that those living in areas like Clondalkin, Tallaght and other outlying areas will have some means of transport to their places of employment in the city centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDLoftus" hpid="Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alderman Dublin Bay-Rockall Loftus</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election. Why would I not vote for him?  Was he not a colleague of mine on the city council for many years?  I have been involved in the Northern Ireland question since 1960 and I only met Deputy Harte on my first day in the Dáil.  I know he has been involved in that matter also.  We all seem to be giving advice to the new Minister for Transport and I am sure he will listen to what we have to say.  I have been involved in issues relating to CIE for many years and as Members are aware I do not pay any increase in fares.  My dispute is with the management of CIE because they do not manage the land resources of the company properly.  I should like to compliment Deputy Reynolds on his contribution.  The fact that he brought his entrepreneurial skills into CIE meant a great awakening of the <Col N="146" /> potential the company have as a public transport authority for Dublin.  He made one point which was very relevant when he stressed that CIE's requirements should be met, as far as possible, from their own resources.  CIE have railway stations in Dublin and throughout the country that are economically under-utilised land resources.  The only time they come to light is when the train stops at them.  There should be a policy by CIE management, in partnership with the planning authority, to comprehensively develop those railway stations throughout the country.  If there was a planning policy the land value of the stations would increase ten fold compared with land value in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>In Toronto they made a conscious decision to develop comprehensively the land resources at railway stations, and future stations.  The result was that when they wanted a rapid rail system they did not have to wonder where they would get the money.  They were able to use the land resources they had as collateral with the financial institutions who provided the money to build an underground system which cost in excess of £1,000 million for that city which is twice the size of Dublin.  At Connolly Station there is a 28 acre site controlled by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The board are anxious to develop on that site and CIE have land beside it.  The board negotiated with CIE management stating that they wanted the CIE ramp as part of their development but all the management in the company could say was, &ldquo;Be sure we have access into Connolly Station in this development&rdquo;. The management, if it was running a private enterprise corporation, would have pointed out that the ramp and the site at Connolly Station were very important with great potential for development. The management should have suggested that the site be developed jointly for the benefit of those who avail of CIE services and employees of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management in CIE seem to think that the taxpayer in the end will pay the price.  A similar situation exists in other areas.  In Galway the developers want to take over Eyre Square.  CIE have land <Col N="147" /> overlooking Galway Bay and it would be nice to have a comprehensive office block overlooking that bay leaving Eyre Square alone.  In Ballina the urban district council wanted an office block and they decided to erect it adjacent to the town square.  There were objections to that. CIE wanted to develop their railway station for the Asahi Plant but the company did not think of asking the local authority to erect the office block at the railway station.  The land associated with railway stations throughout the country is economically under-utilised.  That land could be used as collateral with the financial institutions to give CIE the wherewithal to expand their services to the public.  In talking about the various capital projects we must not forget that employees of the company must at all times feel that there is job security for themselves, their children and grandchildren.  If there was such a commitment to public transport we might get a better service from CIE.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a number of points about the bus lanes and the design of the new buses.  I should like to know why the bus lanes were not put on the other side of the road running <i>contra</i> to the flow of traffic in the mornings.  That would involve a different design of bus but it would mean that there would be three lanes of traffic with a bus lane free of traffic going to the city and vice versa in the evening.  That would help in terms of management of traffic.</P>
    <P>Taxis should also have the right to go into these bus lanes, particularly when they are not full of buses, because they are providing an essential public service. It would also help if car owners carrying three other passengers had the right to drive in bus lanes.  The object of the exercise is to try to get more people to leave their cars at home and to get more people to use a few cars and public transport. That is just an idea on the bus lanes.</P>
    <P>In relation to persons using CIE and person entitled to free travel, particularly old age pensioners and others, it is not right that such people, having lived their lives and paid their taxes, should at <Col N="148" /> this stage be faced with time schedules and asked for fares if they get on a bus five minutes before the scheduled times for free transport.  These people should be entitled to their free travel.  CIE should provide enough buses and they could afford to do this if they developed their land resources at railway stations as part of the overall approach towards giving us efficient public transport.</P>
    <P>In relation to electrification of railway lines this could be done right through the country to Galway, Cork and Kerry, Limerick, Sligo, Ballina and the like.  In relation to the electrification of the Howth railway line I would like to remind the CIE management that it is not good enough to come in and start developing the railway stations there because they are going to electrify the railway line. They must remember that they are interfering with the local people who live in the area of the station.  For instance, there are problems at Donaghmede.  CIE seem to get on with the job, literally creating havoc for the local people without consulting with them.  They should consult with the local people and explain that there may be some problems but that they will clear them up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Those are just some thoughts I have at the moment.  I understand we will be debating CIE and its problems later on.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to join with my colleague Deputy Reynolds in welcoming the Bill placed before us this evening by the new Minister for Transport.  I would also like to be recorded as wishing Deputy Cooney every success with his new portfolio as Minister for Transport.  He is a man of considerable experience in parliamentary matters and it is expected that he will give his very keen attention to all matters concerning transport and that the transport system and the country at large will benefit from that experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad indeed to be able to support the Second Stage of this Transport Bill.  I believe it is a result of the commitment of the previous administration to improving the transport system generally.  It is important to recognise right away that there was a very strong commitment in the last Government to bringing about a transport system that would be as good if not better than anything that might be available in this part of western Europe. I have said before &mdash; and it is rather pleasant to get the opportunity again this evening to put it on the record &mdash; that I am convinced that we need a strategic transport system and that the existing rail network forms an integral part of that strategic system.  It would be very improper, and would be resisted nationally with all the resources available to local communities and indeed to this party, if there was any plan to further restrict or to further chop up the existing railway network.  Indeed there are suggestions by various authorities and interested parties that this might be a suitable time to consider the reopening of some of the unused or under-utilised parts of the railway network in various parts of the country.  It can be fairly stated now that decisions taken in the past to reduce the effective railway network and decisions taken to close railway stations in the past have proved unwise.  So in the new programming and planning of the transport network care must be taken not to move again towards closure for the sake of expediency or for the sake of short-term saving on the public purse. <Col N="150" /> This has proved faulty in the past and in my opinion would prove faulty again.</P>
    <P>There has been a very strong commitment to the improvement of the infrastructure as far as public transport is concerned over the past four years typified by the action of the previous Minister for Transport and the Department of Transport. I would nearly go so far as to suggest that the Department of Transport has taken on a new role in the politics and administration of this country in the recent past.  It is hoped that that new impetus which was so evident in the past 18 months to two years will continue to be the responsibility of the new administration. I have always felt that the Department of Transport should be one of the premier Departments in that it affects all citizens in one way or another. For a number of years it was a quiet, backwater Department.  That should not be so.  If it is necessary to change rules or regulations or to give that Department new responsibilities to enable it to live up to what it should be &mdash; a real, dynamic administration of transport &mdash; those decisions should be taken and hopefully the start that was made will be improved upon by this new administration.</P>
    <P>People like to talk about the transport system as though they never had any relation to it.  But it must be remembered that it is our transport system and that CIE is our organisation charged with the responsibility under Statute of running the system on our behalf.  With the coming of the various reports before the Government that Deputy Reynolds referred to earlier, perhaps it might be the time to have a new and enlightened reappraisal of all the responsibilities of the Department of Transport.  Maybe the time is opportune to look at what new responsibilities should be given to the Department to make it the effective vehicle it should be in promoting the infrastructure of both rail and road services and other related transport services here.  When one refers to the global term of transport matters one should be concerned with the whole operation of transport at all levels &mdash; rail, road, sea and air.  There is a marked omission in the responsibilities of the Department.  Perhaps now is the <Col N="151" /> time to make the necessary readjustments to bring under the umbrella of the Department of Transport all the various responsibilities attached to public transport generally.  Until that pattern of events takes place, until that nettle is grasped by the Government of the day, there will be no real global, worthwhile effort to improve the total transport system. A start has been made in that area and I would expect the new Minister to continue on those lines.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years CIE bashing has been a popular pastime in Ireland &mdash; I noted a certain amount of this here again this evening &mdash; as if CIE were some organisation that one should knock at every available opportunity while ignoring the fact that the company act on our behalf, spend our money and are supposed to provide for us the best services possible.  This favourite pastime both on the part of politicians and of other sectional interests has a demoralising effect on the whole organisation and has been counterproductive in the past in terms of improving the transport network and services.</P>
    <P>We like to think that all the blame should fall first on management as if in some way they were divorced from the whole organisation and operation of CIE and that all the wrongs and evils should be visited first on their heads as if they were people without an interest in or a commitment to the responsibility vested in them.  I am confident that there is as much management expertise in CIE as there is in any other semi-State operation or in any major public company.  It is not only unfair, but counterproductive, to harp continually on supposed mismanagement in CIE.  That is not the way to ensure the best performance from management and neither has it worked well in the interest of providing good services.</P>
    <P>The employees of the company are the next group in terms of the pastime of CIE bashing.  One might be led to believe on many occasions that these workers are in some way different from employees in other semi-State companies, that these 16,500 people are hellbent on doing down the transport services.  That is something <Col N="152" /> I could not accept because these 16,500 people are ordinary individuals doing their daily job of work as best they can in the circumstances that prevail in their places of work.</P>
    <P>All too often we tend to blame the workers in CIE for some of the ills that have befallen our transport system in the recent past.  Apart altogether from the contribution the employees of this huge company make to the Exchequer in terms of income tax payment, in many cases they are making enormous contributions to the communities in which they live, especially in areas outside the immediate Dublin area, through their involvement in voluntary organisations.  I know of many voluntary organisations in which CIE workers are very much involved. Therefore, I am not prepared to accept the accusation often levelled at them of being a group of people whose only aim is to down tools and take to the streets carrying placards at every available opportunity.</P>
    <P>Another group who are under the umbrella of CIE and who are the cause of some concern are the unions who represent the workers.  Perhaps there are too many of those unions in terms of dealing with the workforce that exists within the company, but we must deal with what-ever number of unions is involved.  Having said that, I suggest that those unions, at this time in particular, must know that it is not in their best interests to have a large section of the workforce out on the street.  When I raised this matter today by way of supplementary question it was not my intention in any way to add to an already unhappy situation, such as the one being experienced now.  The unions, I understand, are ready, willing and available to do what they can to bring about a solution to the current problem.  Once again I appeal to the Minister to pay due attention to the remarks at Question Time today by both Deputy Reynolds and myself.  Surely, it is worthwhile for the Minister, together with the Minister for Labour, to have joint consultations with the unions concerned in the hope of bringing about a solution to the problem. In this way it might at least be said that <Col N="153" /> every effort was made to resolve the situation.</P>
    <P>It is forgotten sometimes that a unique step was taken by the last administration in relation to CIE management in that we introduced worker directors to the board.  It was felt at that time that these worker directors would act as go-betweens between the large number of employees they represent and the management and that they would be available to all and sundry in respect of the details of any situation at any time.  Unfortunately, this innovation would not appear to have worked out well; but must not the experiment be followed through to a greater degree?  Not enough emphasis has been placed on the fact that these worker directors should be availed of more so that they might play an important part in acting as mediators in dealing with these seemingly endless disputes that arise, sometimes arising suddenly so far as the company are concerned.  I am hoping that a greater role can be played by the worker directors.  The idea was very good and it would be unfortunate if it should go by the board merely because of a lack of confidence and a lack of support on the part of the various groups within the company.</P>
    <P>A factor which brings about an unhappy situation so far as the workers are concerned is the lack of confidence in their future.  This can be exemplified in some areas where the best possible productivity may not be forthcoming.  The problem is that the workers never know from one year to another whether they are to be the subject of some in-depth negotiations, surveys or commissions resulting in their being the next to get the chop.  That sort of situation leaves workers suspicious and lacking in confidence for their future.  It is something that can lead to aggravated situations and to frustrations that bring about altercations and street situations of the kind we have had in the past few years.  If one takes that lack of confidence on the part of the workers together with the lack of equipment that they suffer, one cannot blame these people for being suspicious that they are the next to be forced on to the unemployment queue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> Regarding the current dispute it must be borne in mind that considerable sums of money are being lost every day by the centre-city traders and that this must have a very debilitating effect on business at this time, a time which should be one of the busiest for them.  These traders are justified in some of the statements they have made.  They are justified in asking for ministerial action to help to resolve their problems.  There are alternatives the Minister could recommend to the Cabinet to deal with this matter but some of them are quite drastic.  I do not think the long-term benefit of a transport network would be enhanced by taking some of these drastic measures.  Before the Minister recommends any measures to the Cabinet every effort should be made to deal with the matter at first hand.  I repeat there is an onus of responsibility on the Minister to set himself up in the position of mediator or negotiator and certainly as someone who will consult with all involved with a view to securing a happier situation than exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with three areas of activity. It extends the limit of borrowing for CIE, it extends the temporary borrowing powers of the organisation and it gives a Government guarantee on certain matters. It is only when one considers the enormous increase asked for here that one realises the cost of public transport and what it will cost in the future.  The House is being asked to accept an increase of £125 million on the existing limit.  This is an enormous sum and there should be public accountability for it.</P>
    <P>One of the major areas of expenditure is the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban rail service.  I am pleased to see that this is progressing and that it will be coming on stream in the not too distant future.  This service will improve to an enormous extent transport services to certain areas.  When it is joined with the commuter services that are being contemplated and the re-opening of some railway stations that have been closed for a number of years, we will have taken the first step to deal with some of the major traffic difficulties experienced in this city in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> I hope that the carriages being purchased for the new Howth-Bray railway service will be a little better than the minimum standards sometimes one gets in other transportation systems in Europe &mdash; I refer to plastic seats and the minimum of facilities.  I hope we will not adopt a penny pinching attitude with regard to the carriages.  We should purchase good quality materials so that we will have long-lasting vehicles available.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in the number of passengers in the past ten years.  The 34,500 passengers recorded for 1980 will be a small figure only compared with those who will use the new service when it is available.  I am glad to note that the new service will have attractions other than a speedy five-minute service from one area to another.  It has a great advantage with regard to control of pollution and this aspect should be considered in respect of any new extensions in the next few years.  There is a major pollution problem with regard to car exhausts in this city and in other areas where there is heavy traffic congestion. The electrification system will go a long way towards reducing the pollution level. In addition, the service will reduce considerably our dependence on oil.  When one considers that every traffic jam in this city results in the loss of approximately 1,500 gallons of petrol one appreciates the enormous wastage that occurs every year.  I am happy that our dependence on oil will be reduced considerably by the far-sighted policy of providing this new electrified system on one side of the city.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that there are other savings to be had by the introduction of the service.  One must mention the frustration experienced by individuals who are unfortunate enough to have to drive through the city at certain times of the day.  I do not know if a survey was ever carried out on hypertension levels attributable to traffic jams but it is my opinion that from the medical and social points of view the situation cannot be regarded as desirable.  We hope the Minister will take further enlightened initiatives to deal with the matter of traffic congestion in the next few years.  In other <Col N="156" /> words, we hope he will continue the good work carried out by Deputy Reynolds and others in the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion in the city must have an enormous impact on productivity in certain industries located in the centre of the city and other areas.  Serious concern should be given to this aspect.  It must result in unemployment, in a considerable amount of absenteeism and in frustration between management and staff. Perhaps some of the bad traffic conditions that have existed in the past few years have contributed to the tensions that build up suddenly and which are brought out on to the streets.</P>
    <P>One of the major efforts made by the former Minister for Transport to deal with this matter was the introduction of bus priority routes.  It is only right that I put on record the fact that a debt of gratitude is owed to the administration and the task force that undertook measures with regard to the bus priority routes.  Their efforts got off to the good start and they have been successful. These efforts must be continued until the maximum number of measures that can be adopted are undertaken.  A Deputy spoke of the need for contra-flow and so on.  These matters were carefully considered in every area where the introduction of bus priority routes was contemplated. We should develop in the short term the maximum number of bus priority lanes at peak traffic times so as fully to utilise public transport vehicles and at the same time reduce the frustrations of people who rely on them.</P>
    <P>Not enough use has been made of flexi-time as a means of dealing with congestion.  Industries, shopping centres and certain types of schools and institutions could have been better mobilised in having flexi-time and so remove the enormous workload on our roads and services at certain times in the morning and evening. The Minister should give attention to this whole area.</P>
    <P>I refer to the specially commissioned and designed rolling stock for commuter needs.  Normally I do not like that kind of phraseology because when one specially designs something for commuter <Col N="157" /> needs one brings oneself to the baseline requirement.  If we spend enormous amounts of money on these and people have to sit for longer in these newly designed vehicles it might be in the best interests of the powers that be to have a reasonable level of comfort in the design. Otherwise there will be moaning and groaning about sitting on hard seats which might lead to further delays and intrusions in the service.  This might be a small matter but, if attended to, letters may not have to be written to the Minister complaining about accommodation on these specially commissioned commuter vehicles.</P>
    <P>There will be a good service on the electric system between Howth and Bray. I pay tribute to those who suggested that the trains will run at five minute intervals and that this will be extended to 15 minutes at off-peak periods.  It is an appropriate time now to say that I sincerely hope that the best technology and skills have been employed and the best training has been given to the technicians involved in the installation and running of this system.  When trains run at high speeds and at the frequencies suggested in the Minister's speech the chances of something going wrong are increased. When one regards other countries with high speed inter-city commuter trains and other rapid systems one can understand the need for vigilance in all aspects of safety attached to the system.  While I am not raising any alarms in this regard at the same time I expect that no money has been spared in the electrification of the system.</P>
    <P>Parking space should be fully utilised in the city.  Sometimes we develop systems and forget the downstream areas and often these represent the best value for money as time goes on.  Parking areas should be provided at certain locations so that the maximum number of people possible can be enticed on to these new systems.  I do not mean open areas but ones properly fenced and regulated.  The only way to ensure that the best use will be made of the new services is if we can guarantee commuters that their vehicles will be safe and secure until they return. I hope the CIE management have given <Col N="158" /> attention to providing the best parking possible close to their outer destination points.  They may not have been as active in this area as they should have been in the city centre.  They should not have left it entirely to the corporation and other statutory authorities to deal with parking. If they had in mind attracting commuters to their services they should have been first in providing parking facilities both at the outer rim of the city and in the centre. They have unutilised space attached to some of their installations and properties and this should be used for high-rise or underground parking units.  If they adopt such a policy they would provide people with an opportunity to come into town, park their cars and utilise the public services. I hope this matter will get some hearing in the future development of CIE.</P>
    <P>A decision will be taken on rapid rail by the new administration in the not too distant future.  Until such time as the benefits of the electrified Howth-Bray line and the new commuter services together with the feeder bus services, better parking facilities and the stricter enforcement of regulations in the cities are seen at first hand it would be inappropriate to take a decision on rapid rail. We should analyse the effects of the new system before taking the major decision of going rapid rail.  While on paper there are enormous benefits to be got from taking these decisions, in the short-term we should be reluctant to go into the heavy expenditure that would be involved.  The amount required, £66.4 million, as total capital cost for the rapid rail system is not unduly expensive by today's standards.  When it was initially suggested £46 million was given as the overall cost.</P>
    <P>When the effects have been seen in increased numbers, increased revenue to CIE, improvements as far as pollution levels are concerned and lack of frustration it might be time to consider similar operations for other areas in the city. Forward planning should be done now. It is unfortunate about planning that here we have plans and no planners and if we have planners we have no plans.  We are never geared in advance to deal with <Col N="159" /> eventualities that will take place.  Planners must have seen 20 years ago what would happen in Dublin city and suburbs with the escalation of building, improvement in economic life and better social standards &mdash; that there would be a problem as far as public transport was concerned. Instead of forward planning the opportunity was taken to close down some existing facilities.</P>
    <P>There should be no further talk about closures.  This is an expanding economy. We will have better services.  We should be talking not only about improving the existing services but planning better and newer services.  Such transport systems can be seen working.  I recommend to the Minister that he should take a trip and see some of the newer systems in operation which work so efficiently and so well in other cities and in other countries.  It would be well worth his while to take such a trip.</P>
    <P>We should not be so niggardly when we talk about the money which has to be provided for CIE.  We seem to be continually bashing CIE and saying we should give them nothing.  You cannot produce a worthwhile transport network without planning long-term expenditure.  If the general public knew what was involved, and knew they would get a good, fast, efficient service in return, they would be generous.  That service can be provided by instilling a new sense of confidence in the management, the unions and the workforce in CIE.  We have to pay for the service in retrospect anyway.  I would be much happier if the money was earmarked, and if we had a programme planned in advance over a ten-year period.  That planning would have the type of support we are giving the Minister tonight for this necessary extension on the limits of expenditure and capital borrowing and he would also get the support of this House if he introduced a programme to continue and improve upon the plans which were well laid by his predecessor in office.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased at the Minister's reference to maximising the purchase of Irish goods in the development of these services.  When people purchase <Col N="160" /> small items on our trains they are not pleased to find that they were produced elsewhere.  When the general public realise that they provide substantial sums of money each year to support their transport services and find that some of the items in use on those services are foreign made, they find that disquieting.  I will not specify the items.  Everybody knows what I am talking about.  It should be brought to the notice of CIE that more is expected of them than from any other service if only because of the fact that the general public paid £70 million last year and will have to pay a heftier sum this year.  Every single opportunity should be taken to maximise the use of Irish products on these services.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with my colleague in suggesting that the Minister might take the initiative in involving the small industries division of the IDA.  He should encourage his Cabinet colleague to have another look at the downstream institutions and little projects which could be started up.  Any company who expend in excess of £200 million per year could be a generator of job opportunities.  They should take the initiative and bring to the notice of entrepreneurs and people involved in small industries the enormous opportunities which are available in CIE, Aer Lingus and the other huge companies and corporations which are supported by the taxpayers.  It is fundamental that every single component used by these companies should be the product of Irish industry and Irish expertise.  If some items are not available here, the people involved should be asked to take a closer look at their specifications.</P>
    <P>I understand that, apart from the rolling stock, 50 per cent of the requirements are coming from Irish sources.  That is not a percentage of which we can be proud.  The Minister would improve his position if he brought it home forcibly to all the major operations under his control that he will be looking for a progress report as to their involvement in making the best use of Irish-made products and expertise.</P>
    <P>We waited a long time for the announcement that the new carriages would be built by CIE for CIE to improve <Col N="161" /> their rail network service.  I am glad to see that increased sums of money are being asked for by way of increased borrowing capacity for the provision of the 124 main line carriage units coming out of Inchicore.  They are necessary and there is a general public demand to have these carriages brought into operation at the earliest possible time.  The Minister should not allow any decision to be taken by his colleagues in Government which would in any way endanger or slow down the provision of this new rolling stock.</P>
    <P>Some of us are fortunate enough to live west of the Shannon.  We have enormous advantages down there which are not available here.  We have not got the fierce congestion there is in this city and which frustrates country Deputies.  I invite all Deputies to transfer to west of the Shannon.  I hope the policy of decentralisation started by Fianna Fáil will be where it should be at this time.  Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the west would like to see a much improved service with mainline rolling stock.  We have a one-day super train service to one destination at the weekend in the west through the good offices of the former Minister, but it is not too much to ask CIE and the Minister for a minimum standard coach on all services throughout the whole country.  No area should be prefered above another by way of getting better class coaches, or air-conditioned coaches, or AC sets, or whatever you like to call them.</P>
    <P>That is not fair.  It must be remembered that the people in the west pay their just taxes too.  They provide a considerable amount of the revenue that goes to pay the deficit in CIE and to provide the extra capital necessary for all these services. They should not be discriminated against in any way by means of rolling stock.  I would like a commitment from the Minister that when these new carriages come from Inchicore a fair share of them will be made available initially on the western runs, Sligo, Westport, Galway and Limerick. That is not too much to expect for <Col N="162" /> the people of the west.  I know well that the present Taoiseach did not look too favourably on the Deputies who come from the west in that he could not find it possible to provide them with a voice in the corridors of power which is usually associated with a Mercedes State car.  The west has been stripped of its traditional input at Cabinet and middle Cabinet level.  Be that as it may, I hope sincerely, despite the fact that the new Taoiseach has seen fit to denude the west of its State car participation in Government, that that will not be used by the administration as a follow-up to deal similarly with the services in the west.  Due notice will have to be given now to the Minister and the Government on that score, that if the same kind of treatment is applied as has been applied to the back-benchers of Fine Gael as far as their participation in Government is concerned, it will be resisted with all the force that we can command.  I say that on behalf of both sides of this House.  Let nobody think that the west is going to be treated in any niggardly way as far as development is concerned or that we are going to be passed over because we have no voice in the corridors of power.  In regard to the provision of services and improved services we will be making the best use here of our vocal cords to see to it that our problems are highlighted and that the best available is provided for us.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the carriages that are proposed to become available in 1983 might be moved up.  It would be a feather in the Minister's cap if he could make an announcement at an early date that this new rolling stock was being given top priority by him and that he can improve on that date.  I recommend that strongly to him because I know it can be achieved.  The production line can be got into operation more speedily than was suggested by him here today.  Not only would he have the support of the users, the commuters who would be using these services, but they would regard it as a major victory for the Minister personally. We have been waiting too long for these coaches and now that the decision has been taken and we are providing the money for him today, he can give it considerably <Col N="163" /> more attention than 1983 suggests.</P>
    <P>I would like to think also that we might develop a more open attitude to new systems on both road and rail.  As far as rail is concerned, there are new types of coaches currently being experimented with and used in other countries.  The Minister might very well experiment here in a more enlightened way in dealing with some of the lighter gauge coaches that can run at reasonably high speeds with good comfort and less fuel consumption than normally associated with the big power packs with which we pull our sets. A whole range of new concepts is being experimented with right around the world.  The Minister should take the opportunity afforded to him now to have a look at some of those new systems and suggest them to CIE.  Perhaps he could lead the field in this area of experimentation. We are only a small country but we have a nice, tidy network now which cannot be chopped any further.  We should utilise the rail to its maximum advantage, and to date we have not done so.  It is hoped that the new commuter services and new systems will be experimented with to provide a better service. If new lines have to be built and new links and equipment provided, then I suggest that the Minister should feel quite free to come in here and ask and he will have our support in providing them.</P>
    <P>As far as road services are concerned we have been stagnant in our attitude towards the type of vehicles we use.  New type vehicles and a new type construction are being used but they never appear on the roads of Ireland.  This is not, as sometimes suggested, because the roads are not capable of carrying these new types of vehicles.  I talk about concertina-type vehicles and all kinds of arrangements for ticket-purchasing which involve greater productivity.  Maybe there is less manning in certain areas, but let that not cause CIE employees to believe that they are going suddenly to find themselves unemployed.  That is the kind of thing that has killed the confidence in security of tenure of a lot of the employees of CIE.  If these services improve and if we <Col N="164" /> provide new services, we will be going on the recruitment campaign again.  Nothing would instil greater confidence among workers in CIE management than to see themselves diversifying into a new area of operation with new techniques, skills and equipment.  It would entice the best productivity from the work force and we would go into a job creation situation.  Is that not what it is all about?  We are paying the piper anyway so let us have the best available and if money is needed to provide it then let us provide it. Nobody would turn his back on that so long as an improved service is the return.</P>
    <P>I see the new Bombardier buses on our streets and roads and I am happy to say that there has not been a continuation of the teething problems that were a source of some minor embarrassment to my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, on one or two occasions.  Those troubles are over now. There should not be reluctance to deal with this new technology and I am quite convinced that the work force of CIE are quite prepared to utilise their skills, techniques and ability in dealing with this new technology if somebody would discuss it with them properly.  The cause of the unfortunate dispute and the disruption of services here is a minor issue that has escalated due to the intransigence of whoever is responsible for not dealing with it.  Surely it was not too much to expect that this teething trouble that is costing us so dearly today would have been foreseen.  This new experiment with the Bombardier buses is innovative and to be welcomed.  People generally&mdash;I mean the vast majority&mdash;have given an open welcome to these new buses, and so do I here this evening.  I would be happy to know that they will form the basis for a new type bus fleet with better service and better comfort than we have been accustomed to.</P>
    <P>As it is necessary to replace buses on a planned basis I would like to think that the new system that was started by Deputy Reynolds in providing the necessary finance and infrastructure to build these buses will be kept up on a planned basis so that we will have a totally new fleet in the shortest possible time with the necessary <Col N="165" /> spares and expertise which will provide the comfort and service levels which the people who are paying this enormous deficit demand.  We should not always be negative in our attitudes to providing alternative means in the short-term and at certain peak periods.</P>
    <P>I do not think CIE should be reluctant to take on other buses on a hiring or leasing basis.  When buses are needed for a job of work and companies make themselves available to provide a service, why do we always say it is going to hurt somebody? It never hurts anybody except the poor people who have to pay and who are given a bad service.  If CIE are reluctant or do not have the expertise, equipment or plant to provide the service which is demanded by a section of the community in a particular part of the country, they should be magnanimous enough to say that their work is on behalf of the electorate, who are paying the money&mdash;by and large by way of deficit&mdash;to provide the best service they can and if that requires hiring or leasing fleets in the short-term let them do it.  They should plan to provide the services themselves on the next occasion.  That is the best way to maximise the goodwill on behalf of the people who require the service throughout the country.  We should not be niggardly in dealing with those who can provide the extras needed on the occasions when CIE cannot provide them.</P>
    <P>I note also that permission is being granted to provide CIE with the necessary means of alternative financing.  I presume this will also include the leasing of equipment.  I am not a great promoter of this type of financial arrangement.  I see my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, smiling. Even among the best of friends there are differences of opinion on financial matters. I am not a supporter of this type of financing for which the general public pay by way of taxes.  If there are good alternatives available and if they can reduce the burden on the taxpayer, without interfering with the overall ownership and control of the asset, it is worthy of some study.  We should tread carefully and move slowly in the area of financing <Col N="166" /> because it can have a debilitating effect on the whole structure of administration and Government.</P>
    <P>The McKinsey Report has not, in my opinion, got anything like the attention it deserved.  I hope the reason for that is not that people do not regard it as a worthy document.  I have some reservations about its usefulness.  It was very short on solutions to CIE's problems but was very long on the history of their problems.  It was also very long on the closure options which it suggested as a means of dealing with the problems.  It would have been preferable if it had been stronger on the solutions and the options for solutions that might be made available to the Government of the day and to the Minister for Transport who would be making recommendations in that regard to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Public debate is not sufficiently elevated to deal effectively with this matter of general public interest.  I cannot see why we have had such sporadic recommendations from the sectional interests involved in public transport development. I would have thought that everybody was eagerly awaiting the production of the McKinsey Report.  In the debate we had one side tore it asunder and the other side said we should scrap the whole system.  There was no real debate in support of the development of a good public transport system for the country.  I hope the Minister will take the initiative in this regard by inviting, and naming if necessary, the various organisations which he would like to get involved in this public debate launched by his predecessor. There must be an enormous number of organisations and institutions who have a valuable contribution to make.  I thought there would have been seminars and weekend consultations and negotiations by various sectional interests in dealing with the McKinsey Report so that the Minister would have available to him a good cross section of attitudes in so far as the provision of a good transport system is concerned.  That has not happened. Perhaps some of the fault is in the McKinsey Report itself.  Before the Minister makes recommendations to his colleagues in Government for a final decision <Col N="167" /> concerning the new system of public transport he should again invite all concerned to apply themselves, perhaps in the autumn, to dealing in a more specific way with what they would like to recommend as the best means of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Members who have an interest in public transport&mdash;all Members have some interest in dealing with transport matters &mdash; will have an opportunity of dealing at length with the McKinsey Report when it comes before the House for final consideration and recommendations.  The Minister is at a crossroads in dealing with public transport for the eighties.  I am sorry my friend and colleague, Deputy Reynolds, is not in office to proceed on the lines he started because he had a very clear, incisive view on the promotion of public transport and the way it should progress in the eighties.  The Minister would be well advised to pay attention to some of the debates to which he contributed in so far as public transport is concerned. In his recommendations and in the promotion of certain activities under the aegis of public transport companies he had in mind a worthwhile and workmanlike attitude towards the provisions of a first-class public transport system.  I hope what he started will be given due recognition and that the promotion of a good transport service will be continued by the present administration.  His promotion of the Dublin Transport Authority was a major step forward in dealing with what has become a crisis situation daily in our city.  The programme he set out and the time scale he allowed himself and the Department for the introduction of the necessary legislation to give effect to this recommendation should be reiterated by the Minister.  I regret the Minister did not make reference to that in his speech.  I hope the omission was not deliberate because if that was the Minister's intention it would amount to a backward step.  I hope the Minister will proceed with all haste with the promotion of that legislation to give the necessary technical and legislative teeth to the Dublin Transportation Authority because it provides the best opportunity to deal effectively <Col N="168" /> with what has become a continuing daily problem.</P>
    <P>The task force has been doing admirable work although it is somewhat restricted because it does not have responsibility to deal with all matters concerned with public transport.  Now might be a good time, at the start of a new administration, to have a fresh look at the need to isolate certain further responsibilities to the Department of Transport, subsequently to the task force and subsequently to the Dublin Transportation Authority, to have the full effect of implementing the recommendations so absolutely necessary on all fronts concerned with public transport in this city and country.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity of making a further remark regarding some of the suggestions concerning carriages which I neglected to mention when dealing with rolling stock.  This concerns what I understand to be the request to have the vast majority of the 124 coaches of the air conditioned type.  This would place an enormous financial burden on the overall cost of provision of rolling stock.  Some of us are not as convinced as we would like to be that there is an absolute need for fully air conditioned sets running on our railway network.  We do not normally have here the extremes of temperature which would apply to latitudes in other areas of the world.  Considerably more rolling stock could be made available from the existing resources being provided through this legislation if there was a rethink about the need to install this very expensive equipment in the proposed new rolling stock.  That would in no way hold up the provision of the carriages themselves.  The flats and super-structures have to be built, anyway.  This suggested added comfort might be looked at again as not being necessary for all the rolling stock.  This would provide the new Minister with money more needed to provide extra carriages from the same financial allocation.  The Minister might consider this at his convenience.</P>
    <P>We would also like to think that the assets attached to CIE would be fully utilised.  It comes to mind on occasion <Col N="169" /> that there are reasonably large tracts of land&mdash;certainly there are some locations &mdash; which could be better utilised.  A survery should be done of all the properties available to CIE at present and whatever is not needed for their immediate requirements or their planned programmes should either be disposed of or utilised, preferably by CIE, in the provision of other services which might very well be a means of considerable economic resource to CIE by way of extra revenue. I am not one of those people who think that CIE should confine themselves totally and exclusively to providing bus and rail services and nothing else.  If they have an opportunity to maximise their assets or locations by providing a service for other people, or in conjunction with other authorities, they should do so.  By doing that, they are making the best possible use of the money made available to them by the taxpayer for the purpose of providing the best possible services.  That is what we expect from them.  If they do that, they will have welcome support from me and, I am quite sure, from the taxpayer who invariably has to pay the piper, anyway.  Mar a deir an sean fhocal tús maith leath na hoibre, agus is é mo thuairim go bhfuil tús sár-mhaith déanta ag an iar-Aire Iompair atá ina shuí cóngarach dom anocht.  Cuid des na deacrachtaí a bhí sa Roinn Iompair, tá réiteach faighte orthu ag an iar-Aire.  Tá fadhbanna ann go fóill, ar ndóigh, agus níl sé thar cumas an Rialtais na fadhbanna sin a réiteach, agus beimid ag fanacht ar na coiscéimeanna a luaigh an tAire Iompair anocht chun deileáil leis na fadhbanna sin.  Táimid ag iarraidh freisin air mion-scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na tuairimí atá nochtaithe agamsa agus ag an Teachta Reynolds anseo anocht.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we expect that the good job of work started by Deputy Reynolds will be brought to a happy conclusion and that, as we say down where I come from, the present Minister will be able to harrow as much of the ground as has been ploughed by Deputy Reynolds.  It will then go well for the future of public transport.</P>

      <P>May I begin my first <Col N="170" /> speech in this 22nd Dáil by congratulating the Ceann Comhairle on his election to the Chair and wishing him a pleasant time in it.  I hope that he will not have too many troubles.  I also congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cooney, on once again resuming as a member of the Government. I hope he will recall that any time I ever spoke here when he was Minister for Justice, I always spoke in a constructive manner.  I intend to continue behaving in that manner.  I wish him well in what is a very tough Department which calls for a large amount of capital to be spent and which is very much a decision-making Department.  For that reason, I pay tribute to the former holder of that office, Deputy Reynolds, for his massive input into that Department during the very short while that he held office as Minister for Transport.</P>
      <P>Before getting to the actual content of the Bill, it would be remiss of me not to mention the most unfortunate strike which has been referred to by other speakers and which has virtually brought Dublin to a standstill.  There is not one part of Dublin where people have not been wholly inconvenienced by this strike and I must, in truth, warn the Minister that there is particular anxiety among CIE employees that this strike may go on as long as another CIE strike when a Coalition Government was in power, which lasted for ten weeks.  I hope that the Minister will meet the necessary people to try to get the buses moving again.</P>
      <P>Industrial relations have changed very considerably from a few years ago.  Government intervention in certain instances has been seen by the public to be effective and in many types of disputes very necessary. I would alert the Minister to the feedback I am getting from people which is that the Government, so far, seem unaware that there is a CIE strike taking place in Dublin city.  I know that that is not so, that they are indeed so aware, but the fact is that they are not coming across to the people as being aware or in any way interested in seeing this strike settled as quickly as possible.  I urge the Minister to use his utmost efforts, with his colleague, the Minister for Labour, to try to get this strike settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I welcome this Bill and all the measures contained in it.  Not long ago I visited the Inchicore works which are like a little world in themselves.  I suggest that the Minister lose no time in visiting Inchicore. I am sure he would be very surprised at the size, scope and the thousands of people who depend on the Inchicore works for their livelihood. There are families who go back generations still working there.</P>
    <P>I visited those works for the first time many years ago, but recently I paid two visits, the first on my own and the second with the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds, when we were taken on a tour of the works.  The reason for my first visit was that statements had been made by members of the present Government parties about Fianna Fáil's intentions towards the Inchicore works and the possibility of closure.  I made it my business to reassure the workers that there was no truth in that.  They accepted my assurance and I circulated many copies of the then Minister's speech, which he had made on the Adjournment Debate on a question raised by Deputy Mitchell, now Minister for Justice.  The awful thing was that these people felt insecure because of the rumours being fed to them by the then Deputy Mitchell that the future of the Inchicore works was not secure.  They realise now, and realised then, by the actions of Fianna Fáil, that their future is secure.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see in the Minister's speech today confirmation that many buses will be built in those works over the next few years.  The workers can be satisfied that as long as Fianna Fáil have any say in the matter the Inchicore Works will never close down.  At present work is starting on the provision of new carriages for the mainline passenger service. This is the type of evidence the workers want to see.</P>
    <P>With the electrification of the Howth-Bray line in progress, it is very important that the Government accept as positive policy the electrification of other lines.  I am particularly anxious to see this happen in the Dublin suburbs.  I am thinking specifically of the Hazelhatch-Clondalkin <Col N="172" /> and Blanchardstown lines into the city. The cost would be small in relation to the enormous saving that could be made in the use of imported fuel.</P>
    <P>Our roads are totally inadequate for the amount of traffic they have to carry. One has only to go through Dublin today while there is a bus strike to see that this is true.  Because of the strike many more people are using their cars.  This helps one to realise that many people use public transport.  It is only when public transport is not available that one can make such a comparison.  I hope it will be the policy of this Government to encourage more people to use public transport and leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the proposed new bus roads &mdash; I am not talking about the present busways which are operating in the city &mdash; from Tallaght to Dublin.  I am totally against that proposal because I do not believe it is necessary.  To build special bus roads would be wasteful and would not be beneficial.  I believe the future for suburban travel is by way of rapid rail.  This is the area the Government should look at.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new office and hope he will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on their appointments and know we will get fair play from both.  I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of talk in the west that we do not have a member of the Government to look after our business but this Minister and the previous Minister came from the same constituency, which is not too far away.  The previous Minister made decisions and implemented them. That was to his credit.  The same can be said of his Minister of State, Deputy Flynn, who has already made many of the points I wanted to make about transport in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  CIE is a company we cannot expect to pay its way.  There are certain public services which can never be expected to pay their way, because they provide a social service and CIE is one such company.  At present we <Col N="173" /> have a high standard of living and an affluent society.  There are more cars on our roads and fewer people are availing of the services provided by CIE.  In my opinion CIE should take another look at the transport system and reconsider their decision to close certain lines.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the west. Our roads were not built to take the heavy traffic using them at present.  With the high price of petrol and diesel oil CIE should be able to provide a service which would make it more economic for businesses to send the goods by rail rather than by road.</P>
    <P>CIE have closed many lines.  They have a habit of putting very poor carriages, some without even heating, on all but the main lines with the result that very few people will travel on them.  The next step is the closing of these lines.  I was against the closing of the canal from Dublin to Galway.  I have always maintained we should never close anything because we never know when we will need it.  CIE closed a number of lines in the west which could be very beneficially used in future if costs continue to increase.  I would ask the Minister to take a very serious look at this.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the amount of money being provided in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will carry on the work which was done by the previous Minister and his Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, Sir, to congratulate you on your appointment as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and wish you every success.  I have already complimented the Minister on his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised this matter because the Minister has not been given the reply to the question which was asked.  It is not a reflection on him.  Some weeks ago in my <Col N="174" /> capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I made an order concerning this telephone kiosk as well as several others.  I wish to clarify whether the orders made by me after due consideration will be put into effect.</P>
    <P>Inishmacatreer is a small island community of about 20 houses.  They have pier facilities and are linked by road to the mainland.  It is a small island in the middle of Lough Corrib and is a place which should be provided with a telephone kiosk.  During my term of office I received many requests for such facilities and I never hesitated in making an order for such a place.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he does not consider that a telephone kiosk is required because the necessary criteria have not been met.  It is not a matter of criteria &mdash; it is a matter of courtesy, of policy, of necessity.  Such places should be given priority in the provision of this facility.  I have a proud record in the Department in that the first automatic exchange which I opened was in the Aran Islands.  All parts of the country should be equally served by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the Minister will do about these orders.  I have a note of them and I will insist on an answer in this House if there is any change.  I do not say this in any threatening way but I intend to watch developments.  I made an order for a postbox on Arranmore.  It is an absolute necessity and I made my decision as a result of representations from all sides of the House.  It is my hope that the Minister will back my decision.  I did nothing in making those orders which would embarrass any Minister and the reasons for my decisions can be seen.</P>
    <P>The Minister should state categorically whether my order stands or is to be revoked.  I took particular pride in sanctioning a telephone kiosk for Inishmacatreer. I look forward to its installation and the continuation of the policy I followed in the Department.  I gave a very reasonable service to every Deputy on every side.  If a proposal did not meet the criteria laid down by the Department but there were extenuating circumstances, I <Col N="175" /> made the order.  I do not apologise to anyone for so doing, especially in regard to the provision of island facilities.  I hope the Minister will stand over the order for the telephone kiosk in Inishmacatreer as well as all the other orders.  They were made in the light of the human element and not for any political reason.  Two of the orders relate to Arranmore in County Donegal and Inishmacatreer and there are 14 or 15 other orders, each of which was justified.</P>
    <P>I want to establish whether the orders I made are to be revoked or not.  The Minister has a difficult task and I hope that he will endorse decisions which we have made.  I felt very proud when I went into that Department, but I felt even more so on the day I left it.</P>

      <P>I must first echo the good wishes of the Deputy to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your accession to that office and also express my good wishes to your colleague, the Ceann Comhairle.  I have no doubt that your term of office will be free from undue controversy and this will be due to the high regard in which both of you are held in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea raises what is patently a very awkward matter for me in so far as he is asking me to give a categoric &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; as to my attitude towards directions given by him.  Obviously any Minister succeeding a colleague would want to uphold the directives given by his colleague and he would start from the base that such directives were properly given in accordance with normal procedure and practice.  Certainly where that is the case I will be only too glad to uphold and insist that any directives given be confirmed and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain criteria laid down in the Department which have been observed by successive Ministers for determining whether or not a telephone kiosk is to be provided in a particular area.  I understand it is the practice that when a request comes from a Deputy or from the Minister or a Minister of another Department for the provision of a kiosk it is examined in accordance with <Col N="176" /> relevant criteria.  If it conforms to the criteria the Minister is so informed and the directive can then be implemented without difficulty.  If it does not conform to the criteria the Minister is so informed and then a new situation arises.  A further decision must be made by the Minister as to whether he wishes to pursue the directive, notwithstanding the fact that it may be in conflict with long-established criteria. These criteria are founded principally on reasons of economy, but social considerations have to be taken into account. Essentially they are reasons of economy and reasons of priority of demand.  As Deputy Killilea knows better than most people here, there is a lot of pressure on the telephone service for new installations and an order of priorities must be established in order to ensure that where they are most urgently required telephones will be provided first.  It can throw the whole planning process out of gear if this order of priorities is frequently or unduly interfered with.  There may be occasional cases where for compassionate or other reasons it may have to be interfered with but by and large it is right that it should be observed.  There is an order of priority with regard to telephone kiosks and the priority is determined by the criteria that have been established so that a person can know if a particular application meets the criteria.  Consequently when an application that does not meet the criteria comes for consideration it is only right that the person making that application should be aware of it.  As the Deputy has said, he gave a direction in a considerable number of cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; which is a considerable number of cases &mdash; where he wanted a telephone kiosk to be installed but I am sure the Deputy would not want his will to be enforced if that meant ignoring in that substantial number of cases long established criteria, and would necessitiate interfering with other areas that might qualify within the criteria so that they would be deprived of their telephone. I do not know if the Deputy was <Col N="177" /> aware that in the case in question the normal criteria would not be satisfied.  If the Deputy was unaware of that he might, because of his experience in the Department, have been aware that it was unlikely to satisfy the criteria.  The examination of that directive and the others had not been completed in time to report to the Deputy so that he could confirm his directive or otherwise.  It is not a clear and simple question of saying yes or no. In the normal way I am bound, on succeeding to the office, by the obligations of that office, to examine the criteria that had not come to the Deputy before then and to decide now that I am faced with the responsibility whether I will change the tentative decision in the light of the criteria furnished to me.</P>
      <P>In regard to this case I sympathise with the Deputy because of its location.  It is an island situation and I sympathise with people who by accident of geography or birth have to live in a less favourable environment than the rest of us take for behoves the community to give them little facilities that the rest of us take for granted.  I understand that there may be a question about this being a popular fishing area where there are landing facilities availed of by visiting anglers.  These are circumstances outside the normal criteria which might enable me to look at the matter again, perhaps with a more favourable mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another alternative that the Deputy and I could discuss would be if the local authority might be prepared to subsidise a kiosk.  Before we discard that option the Deputy and myself might talk to the local authority and the Deputy could consult his colleagues in Galway County Council to see if they would be prepared to come to the assistance of their countrymen in Inishmacatreer in what is <Col N="178" /> essentially a social exercise.  From his time in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the Deputy knows that having regard to the demands on the Exechequer, they are primarily an economic Department who must apply economic criteria in implementing their programmes. The Deputy and I could have a look at this again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Sympathy towards people living in such an area is of very little use. The Minister should assess the criteria.  I can assure the Minister that a telephone kiosk in Inishmacatreer would give more financial return to the Department in one year than would a telephone kiosk in a major city street which is being constantly vandalised.  If the Minister wishes I can give him details of certain kiosks in the city which will prove my point that the criteria is a peculiar criteria.  The people on the island of Inishmacatreer like the people on Arranmore are just as entitled to essential services as are people who do not appreciate the service either in this city or in the city of Galway.</P>
      <P>To ask the county council is a total waste of time as they are not interested. We either make a decision to help those people or we do not.  When an application for Inishmacatreer was refused I made the order.  I want the Minister either to stand over that order or to revoke it.  If the Minister revokes it it will not be my fault.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  Since this was a devolved scheme any difficulties which arise in relation to the contract for the scheme are matters for settlement between the local authority, in this case Donegal County Council, and the contractor involved.  However, in view of the serious implications raised by the Deputy's question I have asked Donegal County Council to submit a report in the matter.  When this has been received in my Department I will communicate directly with the Deputy.</P>
