      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to institute an Honours List so that citizens might be honoured for their work for the nation or for other worthy efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the enormous service which Lord Killanin has given to the Olympic Games and to the <Col N="2" /> cause of unity in sport throughout the world, would the Taoiseach not consider a special award recognising his services to the Olyimpic Games and to world unity and peace, and in the context of Ireland as a nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can think of few people to whom an award would be more appropriate than Lord Killanin, but there is no provision for such an award and the matter is not under consideration at present. It has been raised in the past with successive Governments and twice in the <Col N="3" /> lifetime of the previous Government.  No action was then taken on it.  It is not something at which we are looking at present.  If it is a matter which the Opposition wish to raise in depth I would be happy to discuss it with the Leader of the Opposition in due course.  However, in view of the negative attitude of the previous Government on the subject I am not sure that it will be pressed a great deal.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline all the proposals for the amendment of the Constitution which will be brought before the Dáil in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have requested the Attorney General to undertake a review of the Constitution. It is envisaged that this review will involve consideration, Article by Article, of the provisions of the Constitution as it stands.  It will indicate areas where inadequacies in the Constitution are perceived. In such areas options will be presented to the Government as to the approach which might be most desirable. Such options might include necessary amendments to the existing Constitution or indeed the need for an entirely new Constitution.  The Attorney General has not been fettered in advance of the commencement of the review as to the approach which he might take to it, but he will be inspired by the concept that our Constitution should as far as possible contain the kind of provisions that the Constitution of a United Ireland might at this stage have contained, had the political division of Ireland not been made, rather than reflecting the impact on our island, and specifically on this part of it, of this division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this review, I would like to draw the attention of this House in particular to that part of my speech in the other House in which I drew attention to the position of previous leaders of the <Col N="4" /> Fianna Fáil Party on this matter.  As I pointed out in that speech, both Mr. de Valera and his colleague, Mr. MacEntee, subsequently explained why Mr. de Valera, clearly against his own instincts, had felt constrained for tactical reasons to introduce into the Constitution provisions reflecting the majority ethos in the State at that time.  His successor, Mr. Seán Lemass, later described the Constitution as &ldquo;a strait jacket&rdquo; adding that changes were necessary in it and that it should be changed every 25 years.  In turn, Mr. Lemass's successor, Mr. Jack Lynch, referring to the existing context rather than to any hypothetical bargaining table, said in 1970 and repeated at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1971:</P>
    <P>In so far as there are constitutional difficulties which are legitimately seen by people to be infringements of their civil rights, then their views are worthy of intensive examination and we should try to accommodate them in our Constitution and in our laws.</P>
    <P>It is in the spirit of the approach and attitude of these previous leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, a spirit which I and those of us in this side of the House share, that I propose this review and I appeal to the present leader of that party and his colleagues in the national interest to adhere to the open approach of his predecessors to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach reply specifically to my question, which is whether or not there will be any amendments to the Constitution brought before the Dáil in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The time scale of this review is something which has not been determined and, in fact, perhaps cannot be precisely determined.  In view of the magnitude and importance of the task, it would certainly take a period of six months or thereabouts, at a minimum. That is, I believe, the view of the Attorney General.  It will be then a matter for the Government to consider the report of the Attorney General and consider what action should be taken on it.  On that time scale, it would seem difficult to <Col N="5" /> bring provisions for amendment before the Dáil during this session.  I am simply speculating as best I can in advance of something about which the time scale is necessarily somewhat in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is indulging in a great deal of speculation these days.  However, does he recall very specific assurances he gave to members of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign to introduce, as soon as possible, an amendment to the Constitution, or rather legislation which would enable the Constitution to be amended, to prevent the legalisation of abortion?  Does he intend to honour the commitment made by him before and since the election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is under consideration by the Attorney General at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Taoiseach does not intend that there will be any such legislation in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General is considering the matter.  We will not take any decision on this until we hear from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach gave a specific assurance to these people before and subsequent to the election that there would be no delay whatever in the introduction of such an amendment.  Is he now reneging on that assurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reneging on any assurance.  The question of how such a provision should be formulated is of some complexity and the question of whether it and any other changes in legislation should be undertaken separately or together is something which the Government will have to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that there was no question in the assurance which he gave to the members of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign about any other matter.  The assurance was specific in regards to this particular change in the Constitution.  In view of <Col N="6" /> that, am I to take it that he will not proceed, as he promised these people, with legislation in this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be proceeding on that matter.  As to when and in what terms the amendment will be formulated, that is something the Government will have to decide in the light of what will be submitted to them by the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that, among other things, he told members of the pro-life campaign that he did not even have to consult his party about this.  In view of the reply he has now given that in the general context there will not be any proposals coming before the Dáil in this session for constitutional amendment, will he now bring the divisive party political campaign on which he embarked to an end and so enable both the Dáil and the Seanad, and all of us engaged in the political process, to concentrate on the very real economic and social problems which confront us and to which the policies of this Government are contributing in no uncertain measure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that a public debate on these issues at the present time is not only helpful but essential if all of us, politicians and electorate alike, are to face up to the challenge and the possibilities that now exist in the context of the higher plane to which my predecessor raised the whole issue of Northern Ireland by the initiation of Anglo-Irish talks.  It would be unforgivable if we were not to prepare ourselves to play our part in whatever constructive moves may emerge from these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clear up, for the benefit of the House and the general public the particular purpose to which this party's political divisive campaign is directed because on separate occasions he has given three different reasons for indulging in this campaign? <Col N="7" /> On the day he first mentioned it &mdash; in the famous or infamous Radio Telefís Éireann interview &mdash; he indicated that we should make these changes to make ourselves more pleasing to Northern Unionists. Subsequently he indicated that these changes should be made because of their inherent merits.  On another occasion he indicated that these changes should be made as something we could throw into a bargaining situation with the British Government.  On which of these reasons does he now base his campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made clear in my initial statement my deep commitment to the whole question of relations between North and South.  The fundamental consideration in raising this issue was because of the conviction I have held for a very long time that unless we, in this part of Ireland, are prepared to play our part and show some generosity and imagination in respect of the preoccupations and concerns of the majority in Northern Ireland, we shall never get anybody from Northern Ireland to any serious negotiating table.  It was because of that motivation that I raised the matter.  I should have thought that would have been clear to Deputies opposite and to anybody else who heard me speak on that occasion or who heard or read my speech in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not be prepared to admit at this stage that this campaign was launched by him purely as a device to divert the attention of the general public from the disastrous economic situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I would like to reject that suggestion flatly <Col N="8" /> and to stress the hope that no one on the benches opposite or in the country would be in any doubt as to the depth of my personal commitment on this matter or the determination of our Government to make all possible preparations for this State to play its part in any future developments in North/South relations that may become possible in the period ahead.  I have already paid tribute to my predecessor's work in preparing the way and I propose to follow in the path he set.</P>
      <P>No action of mine in this or any other area could throw a smokescreen over the economic situation which now faces us after four years of Government by the party at present in Opposition.  The gravity of the situation left to us has been emphasised recently by the preliminary conclusions of the IMF team which commented on the failure of our economy to adjust to a steep fall in the terms of trade which took place in 1979 and which threatens to undermine seriously the prospects for expansion in output and employment over the medium-term.  The House may recall that they went on to say that foreign borrowing of the present magnitude &mdash; the levels the previous Government set &mdash; cannot in their view be sustained for long and if the present build up of foreign debt as undertaken by the previous Government was continued unabated, Ireland's credit rating overseas might be downgraded and we might then have to restrain domestic activity abruptly in a way which would have important repercussions on employment. As Deputies will be aware, and in answer to Deputy Haughey's question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The House will also be aware of the EEC Commission's draft annual economic report which states that a reversal of the trend to increase deficits, especially those on account of current items, is overdue and that the corrective package introduced in July by the incoming Government after only one month in <Col N="9" /> office, to prevent a further deterioration in the 1981 situation is an important step in this direction which should be reinforced in 1982.  I trust that answers fully the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy whether he has taken any decision in regard to revoking prospecting licences for uranium exploration in County Donegal in view of the public alarm in regard to resulting health hazards there; and whether, in view of our neutrality, he is satisfied that such exploration work is justified in view of the fact that we cannot ensure that potential future exports of uranium ore from Ireland would not find their way into the manufacture of nuclear armaments.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm and consistent advice of the Nuclear Energy Board, the statutory body concerned with radiation safety, is that there is no evidence that prospecting operations associated with exploration for uranium lead to any radiation hazard. In the circumstances I do not consider that the revocation of prospecting licences for uranium prospecting in County Donegal would be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an economically workable deposit of uranium were discovered in Ireland it would be my intention to ensure that any uranium that might be exported would be used for peaceful purposes.  Certain legal powers already exist to control the <Col N="16" /> movement of uranium and, if there were uranium exports at any stage in the future, the adequacy of these powers would be kept under close scrutiny; if any extension of these powers were judged to be desirable, the necessary measures would be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the progress that has been made to date in the development of new energy sources as an alternative to the growing cost of oil imports, particularly in regard to experimental work on biomass, wind-power and small hydro schemes; and whether he will arrange to speed up these development programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Industry and Energy, through the Alternative Energy Committee established under their aegis, have been actively involved in the promotion of native sources of energy of the kind specified in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The National Windpower Programme is now well advanced and it is expected that nine wind machines will be in operation before the end of the year.  Two machines are already in operation and a third has been erected.</P>
      <P>The hydro programme of the Department of Industry and Energy includes plans for grant-aiding a selected number of small hydro schemes of up to approximately 250KW as part of the assessment of hydro power for future development. Also a national hydro resource survey spanning two years is being considered. These programmes are likely to be introduced in the near future.  Already a comprehensive register of existing small hydro installations has been compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A forest biomass demonstration programme commenced in 1979.  Bord na Mona are growing 400 hectares of coppicing hardwood species on cutaway bogs at Clonsast, County Offaly and Oweninny, County Mayo.  The Forest and Wildlife Service are growing 200 hectares of short rotation single stem conifers on virgin bog at Bangor Erris and Sheskin, <Col N="17" /> County Mayo.  The coppiced species can be harvested four or five years after planting and the single stem wood after six to ten years.  The ESB are modifying one of their peat burning units at Screebe in Connemara to handle the timber.  The first crop should be available in 1984, but it will be towards the end of the decade before the demonstration programme is complete.</P>
    <P>As I said, these programmes are of an exploratory and demonstration nature and their benefits may not accrue for some time to come.  They are proceeding, however, as quickly as resources at my disposal will allow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a five-year programme. At this point only two machines are in operation but by the end of the year there will be nine wind machines operating.  The five-year programme was initiated in 1980 so the results in full will not be available until 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the prospects for wave power are promising in the long term.  The ESB have been involved in a recently-completed IEA study in the Sea of Japan and the NBST are co-ordinating research at home.  The exploitation of this resource may take <Col N="18" /> some time.  Tidal wave power, however, is unlikely for geographical reasons to be of much interest at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a partial evaluation of the short rotation single stem conifers on virgin bog at Bangor Erris and Sheskin.  The coppiced species can be harvested four or five years after planting.  The first crop which the ESB have planted should be available in 1984.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy whether any progress has been made on the proposals to import extra supplies of American coal as a substitute for oil in power production; and whether he considers that the setting up of a national buying agency, as has been done in the case of imported oil, would enable bulk purchases to be made with cost savings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board are planning to import large quantities of coal to cover their fuel requirements for the coal-burning electricity generating station being constructed at Moneypoint.  A substantial part of this will be American.  I am also aware that a number of large industrial and other concerns are considering conversion from oil to coal as their principal fuel.</P>
      <P>Given the current position and the outlook for coal supplies and prices worldwide and taking account of views expressed by various interests which I have consulted, I am not at this stage satisfied that there would be substantial advantages to be gained on both counts through the setting up of a centralised purchasing agency.  The Deputy may, however, be assured that I will be keeping this matter under frequent review and if it becomes evident that the overall national supply situation would be made more secure or considerably more competitive prices could be realised through the introduction of centralised coal purchasing arrangements, I will be prepared to bring forward proposals to achieve this.</P>

The Minister said he was leaving it in effect to the ESB to decide whether or not there would be Irish ships <Col N="21" /> used in the import of coal.  I have great admiration for the ESB and the work they are doing but their terms of reference do not include shipping.  I should like to ask the Minister of State to consider the fact that it will be necessary for him and his Department to ensure a coordination of effort between the ESB and Irish Shipping Limited or whatever other body will be involved to see to it that this happens.  As the Minister is aware, there have been discussions about this but it is not one of the terms of reference of the ESB to provide shipping and, therefore, the Government have to provide the input.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that he is aware of that and will see that it is given.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the percentage of native fuels, e.g., turf, coal and timber at present being used as a source of (a) domestic and (b) non-domestic energy; and the percentage which experts in his Department estimate could eventually be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Native fuels such as turf, turf products, natural gas and coal accounted for about 38 per cent of domestic energy use in 1980.</P>
      <P>In the use of these fuels as a source of non-domestic energy the same fuels accounted for about 19.5 per cent of total energy consumed in the non-domestic sector including all forms of transportation and electricity generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980 native fuels accounted for 23 per cent of total national primary energy input and it is estimated that by 1990, which is the latest date for which meaningful <Col N="23" /> forecasts are available, the corresponding figure will be of the order of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The estimate of 30 per cent does not, of course, take into account any further native hydrocarbon fuels that may be discovered and brought into production by 1990.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will give a commitment to supply Limerick city with natural gas from the Kinsale gas field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While my first priority in regard to natural gas must be the bringing of the gas to Dublin, my overall aim is to extend supply and expand the natural gas grid to as many of the premium markets outside the Dublin area as quickly as possible.  I intend, in due course, to have plans drawn up on the feasibility of laying on natural gas to Limerick, also the south-east and other centres outside Dublin, provided of course that this can be achieved on an economic basis.</P>
      <P>Limerick Gas have already, at the specific request of my Department, engaged consultants to see what needs to be done by the company to make it a safe and efficient distributor of natural gas.  Provided any necessary measures are accomplished, Limerick, because of its density of population, potential for a premium gas market and in order to alleviate the serious situation of the existing gas enterprise there, will clearly merit early consideration for connection to the main pipeline.</P>
      <P>I must stress that, while I am anxious to proceed as quickly as possible with the lay on of natural gas to premium markets in various parts of the country, I have no intention of allowing this valuable natural resource to be used as a cushion for inefficiencies in the gas industry.  An essential prerequisite for an allocation of natural gas for distribution will be a demonstration by the distributor that he has taken the necessary measures to achieve a commercially efficient operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> I must also emphasise again that for the immediate future my priority concern will be to ensure the successful completion of the main Cork-Dublin pipeline since decisions on further extension of the system will be strongly influenced by the technical and financial outcome of this major project.  While study and preplanning of the problems and economics of connecting other areas to the main pipeline may &mdash; and indeed should &mdash; proceed, I would not wish to create the impression that firm decisions on such proposals are an immediate prospect.</P>

I am quite satisfied that when we have the necessary consultants' report available and the necessary action is taken by Limerick Corporation we can look forward to the early laying on of gas to Limerick.  The Deputy will appreciate that much planning has to be done before the pipeline can be laid. There is also the question of the acquisition of wayleaves on the route.  Now that the main route for the Cork to Dublin pipeline has been established the forward planning with regard to the supply to Limerick can commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to ask a different question, but in view of what we have heard perhaps the Minister of State would tell the House whether or not he accepts as accurate the statement made by Deputy Kemmy that, without any consultants' report or any examination of the factors involved, a commitment has already been given by the Minister for Industry and Energy to supply natural gas to Limerick at or about the same time as the pipeline is being built from Cork to Dublin.  That is the statement made by Deputy Kemmy.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether or not that is correct.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Tánaiste and the Government are fully committed to giving natural gas to Limerick and to other gas utilities near the pipeline which can be supplied in an economic fashion.  We are also giving a commitment that major industrial concerns and major co-operatives, factories and so on will also be supplied on condition that the supply can be laid on in an efficient manner and that it can be laid safely so far as the public are concerned. We are very anxious to develop a national gas grid that will bring the benefits of natural gas to all cities and towns, to <Col N="27" /> industrial and agricultural concerns, in order that the nation as a whole may benefit from natural gas.</P>

      <P>The difference is because my Department and An Bord Gáis Éireann have finally tackled the question of the laying of the Cork-Dublin <Col N="28" /> gas line in an efficient and constructive manner.

      <P>Deputies will have learned of the death during the recess of Deputy Kieran Doherty who had been on hunger strike at the Maze Prison. Deputy Doherty was returned as a Member of the Dáil for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan in this year's general election.  He was a native of Belfast and had been in prison, on remand and following sentence, since August 1976.</P>
      <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to the parents and the family of the late Deputy the sympathy of the House in their loss, which has added to the burden of sorrow that violence has brought to so many people in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since we last met there has been also the tragic death of former Deputy Joe Fox, who was very recently a Member of this House, as well as the assassination of President Sadat of Egypt, whose courage and statesmanship won widespread acclaim.  I have already conveyed the sympathy of the Government, and I am sure the House will wish to convey its sympathy to the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I should like to express my deep regret at the death of Mr. Kieran Doherty, TD, on hunger strike and to convey my sympathy to his parents and family.  I support the proposal of the Taoiseach that you, a Cheann Comhairle, be asked to convey the sympathy of Dáil Éireann to the parents and family of the late Deputy Doherty.  Like so many others, Deputy Doherty was a victim of the tragic circumstances of the North and we cannot but recognise the lonely courage of his sacrifice, whatever view any of us may take of events in Northern Ireland.  It is a cause of deep and lasting regret to me that although, as Taoiseach, I did everything that lay within my power to avert these tragic deaths, I did not succeed in doing so.  I believe that if action of the sort that I hope is being taken now had come earlier things might well have been different.  Let us hope that at least in this one aspect of the Northern tragedy we <Col N="107" /> can turn over a new chapter and that the sacrifice and suffering that have been borne on all sides of the community in Northern Ireland will be diminished greatly.</P>
      <P>I wish to join with the Taoiseach in expressing our sadness and sorrow at the death of Joe Fox.  He was a very dedicated and committed Member of this House and he was a very good friend and companion to people on all sides of the political divide.  All of us will miss him very much.  I join with the Taoiseach in asking you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his widow and family our deepest and most profound sympathy.</P>
      <P>I subscribe also to the wish of the Taoiseach that this House should express its deep regret at the death of President Sadat and ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey our sympathy to his widow and family and to the people of Egypt.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Senator James Dooge for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the motion on 30 June 1981 asking Dáil Éireann to approve my nominees for appointment as Members of the Government, I indicated that it was my intention to nominate Professor James Dooge to be a Member of Seanad Éireann with a view to his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I nominated Professor Dooge as a Member of the Seanad on 19 August 1981.  I am now asking the Dáil to approve his nomination for appointment to be a member of the Government.  Subject to the motion being approved, I propose to terminate the assignment to the Department of Foreign <Col N="112" /> Affairs of Deputy John Kelly, and to assign that Department to Senator Dooge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the motion by the Taoiseach.  I should like to make it clear at the outset that our opposition in Fianna Fáil to the appointment of Senator Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs in no way reflects on him personally as an individual or on his personal qualities but is based firmly and responsibly on political, legal and constitutional grounds.  In moving this motion the Taoiseach is asking the Dáil to condone a very unusual procedure.  He seeks to appoint someone who is not an elected member of the Dáil or, indeed, of the Seanad to a very sensitive and key post.</P>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State there is no precedent for a Minister for Foreign Affairs being appointed from outside Dáil Éireann.  Up to now, only two appointments have been made to the Government from the Seanad in the history of the State.  The first of these was Senator Joseph Connolly who held office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Lands away back in the thirties. It should be recalled that, when Senator Joseph Connolly was appointed as a Minister of the Government in the thirties, these appointments were made under the pre-1937 Free State Constitution, under which the Seanad was a somewhat more powerful body than it is under our present Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am certain that no-one would disagree with my contention that political life today is greatly different from what it was in the thirties, and that the demands now made upon and the degree of answerability expected from Ministers of the Government have changed radically since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second appointment was that of Seán Moylan in 1957 who was made Minister for Agriculture.  He held that appointment for a very short period of time before he died.  No comparison at all can be drawn between the appointment of Seán Moylan and the present proposed appointment.  For many years Seán Moylan had been a Member of Dáil Éireann and a Minister of the Government. <Col N="113" /> He had been narrowly beaten in the general election in 1957, unlike the person now proposed to us for confirmation who has stood for neither the Dáil nor the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is also important to understand that, from the point of view of the Seanad itself, there is no need whatever under our system to have Ministers appointed from that House, as all Ministers of the Government are available for Seanad debates as and when they are required. On the other hand, it is eminently desirable that all Ministers should be elected Members of Dáil Éireann with full answerability to the electorate in general and to their constituents in particular.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's proposal is not unconstitutional in itself, but it is certainly a departure from well settled constitutional practice, a departure which I believe should be of concern to every Member of this House.  The significance of this appointment must be seen in conjunction with the appointment by the Taoiseach of another non-elected person to a new extra constitutional post of special adviser to the Cabinet at the same time. the latter appointment, namely the appointment of Mr. Alexis FitzGerald, was clearly an attempt to circumvent the Constitution which limits Government membership to 15.</P>
    <P>Unmistakably the Taoiseach is setting a precedent whereby positions of influence within the Government are being given to personal appointees rather than to elected Deputies.  How casual the Taoiseach has been in his approach to governmental and constitutional procedures and requirements, how off-handed he has been in regard to the constitutional implications of his appointments, is made abundantly clear from newspaper reports indicating that he was greatly surprised to find he would have to wait four months before the Minister-designate could be confirmed in his appointment.</P>
    <P>This cavalier approach by the Taoiseach to constitutional requirements and government procedures has been further emphasised by the behaviour of the Minister-designate over recent months. For the first month or so&mdash;particularly in discussions with London&mdash;he was chaperoned <Col N="114" /> by the acting Minister for Foreign Affair, Deputy John Kelly.  Latterly, however, he has been acting as if he were in fact already Minister for Foreign Affairs, in contempt, I suggest, of Dáil Éireann which has not yet confirmed his appointment.  He gave Ireland's address to the United Nations and, as Deputy Lenihan will go into in more detail, he gave Ireland's assent to a very far-reaching agreement involving security.  He was in my view acting most improperly by purporting to approve, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, this far-reaching agreement not only before he became a Minister but without laying the agreement before the Dáil.  Was the signing of this agreement not another circumvention of the Constitution and of the Dáil in a matter of utmost importance to this country? In a different type of situation, where the confirmation by the Dáil of the appointment by the Taoiseach would be a formality only, there might be some excuse for the Minister-designate undertaking certain functions; it would be improper but understandable.  However, that was not the situation that prevailed in the time that has elapsed since the change of Government.  Senator Dooge exercised ministerial functions in a situation in which neither he nor the Government could be certain that Dáil Éireann would confirm his appointment. That was wrong; it was improper.</P>
    <P>These constitutional and procedural matters may not be of great concern to the general public but we parliamentarians should take a very serious view of them and be very vigilant in regard to them.  We are the upholders of the parliamentary process.  We have a solemn duty to be scrupulously correct in respect of constitutional and legal procedures.  If we are not, we cannot expect others to respect parliament and the laws it passes, or even the very democratic process itself.  This Government, in permitting Senator Dooge to exercise ministerial functions improperly before his appointment was confirmed by Dáil Éireann, have in my view failed to observe the standards of constitutional propriety which should be their first concern.  I believe this laxity should also be considered <Col N="115" /> by Deputies in relation to the action of the Taoiseach in disseminating disrespect for our Constitution by labelling it sectarian, outmoded and in need of revision. He should give serious thought to the dangers inherent in this approach of his.  He should, I suggest, think very carefully about these matters and their implications for law and order and social stability.</P>
    <P>I understand from reports &mdash; and indeed it has been confirmed here today by the Taoiseach in answer to a question &mdash; that a review of the Constitution is to be undertaken by the Attorney General, a review which will not be confined to Articles 2 and 3 and Article 41.  The question must be raised, in the minds of all Deputies in Dáil Éireann, whether this review will apply to the composition of the Government and the power of Dáil Éireann over the appointment of Ministers. Do the appointments I have mentioned herald the beginning of a move away from parliamentary Government, as we know it, towards some sort of presidential system where appointments to ministerial office will be made by the Head of the Government from outside the Legislature?  Is the Taoiseach finding the present constraints on his ability to appoint personal associates to high office becoming a little irksome?  I would be seriously concerned, as I believe many other Deputies on all sides of this House would be concerned, if we are starting any move in that direction.  I do not think any of us aspires to a type of democracy, prevalent in one or two western countries, where the Deputies the people elect are largely an irrelevance and, when thought fitting to do so, can be completely by-passed.</P>
    <P>While I do not challenge the constitutional basis of Senator Dooge's appointment I do challenge its appropriateness in present circumstances.  The Taoiseach can only justify putting forward Senator Dooge for appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs either on the basis that he is so pre-eminently qualified and experienced above all other persons available that there is no option but to appoint him or, alternatively, that inside <Col N="116" /> Dáil Éireann, on those Government benches, there was no other Deputy available who could discharge the duties and responsibilities of Foreign Minister. I believe it can be clearly established to the satisfaction of any reasonable, openminded Deputy that neither of those two reasons can be used to validate this appointment.</P>
    <P>On the question of qualifications and experience I believe it is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to claim simply that Senator Dooge is better than any available Deputy for this job.  He must prove that Senator Dooge is so infinitely better that this rare and unusual procedure, with all its implications, can be fully justified. Many of us remember Senator Dooge as a distinguished, courteous Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  From this side of the House we would not find any fault with his performance as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in any way.  But we must point out that he retired from politics in 1977 and subsequently sought election neither to the Dáil nor Seanad.  He has not had any previous experience in Government as a Minister which it could be claimed would make him especially fitted to take on the particularly sensitive job to which the Taoiseach wishes to appoint him. Although his function as Foreign Minister will be to represent the Irish people in a very special way abroad, unlike the Deputies of this House and most Senators he does not himself represent anyone. He will not have the obligation of the rest of us to keep in contact with our constituencies and to gauge popular opinion on different issues when representing Ireland abroad.  To go to constituency party meetings, to discuss, debate and argue with our constituents may be a demanding, indeed sometimes a tiring dimension to our work as public representatives but it is a discipline to which, more than any other Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be subjected.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Foreign Affairs, by the very nature of their duties, can easily become remote and detached from domestic, political reality.  Outside the country they must move in a rarefied, artificial and sometimes unreal world.  A <Col N="117" /> Foreign Minister in particular should be answerable not only to the Dáil and Seanad but also to the people of a constituency to whom, when the time comes, he will have to go back to seek re-election. A non-elected Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is entirely dependent on the Taoiseach of the day, cannot possibly carry the same weight with other Foreign Ministers as a well-established political figure, a political person, who has a firm political base at home on which to rely.</P>
    <P>When it comes to personal qualities and experience there is no doubt that any of us could pick out people outside of politics who might make good Ministers for this or that post, but it is important that the Taoiseach should realise that, for better or worse, our constitutional system of government is a democracy and not a meritocracy.  I do not know if the argument is seriously put forward that it would be difficult for a Minister for Foreign Affairs to effectively represent us abroad if he had to rush back every now and again to vote in Dáil Éireann.  Any such argument could be dismissed out of hand.  This Opposition, like all our predecessors, would in the national interest have to make whatever pairing arrangements were necessary for the Foreign Minister to absent himself when necessary. Perhaps the crucial question to which Members should address themselves in deciding for or against the Taoiseach's proposal is whether or not in the entire Fine Gael Party there is no other person capable of fulfilling the post of Foreign Minister.  This cannot be seriously contended.  I am conscious of the fact that in approaching this aspect of Senator Dooge's appointment I could be accused of attempting to exploit the difficulties which exist in the Fine Gael Party and of attempting to fuel the understandable personal animosities and disappointments which exist in certain sections of that party.  I am prepared to risk that criticism.</P>
    <P>There are two Fine Gael Deputies, not in the Cabinet at present, whom most reasonable Members would have to agree would make competent Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  If it were simply a case <Col N="118" /> of arguing the merits of these two Deputies against another Deputy of this House in whom the Taoiseach had placed his confidence and trust, I would not be entitled to ask the House to agree with me against the Taoiseach's selection of a member of his own party.  That is not the situation we are dealing with.  We are dealing with a situation where the Taoiseach has to convince the House that he is fully justified in undertaking this constitutional departure because he has no alternative but to do so.  I submit that he has at least two, if not more, suitable alternatives.  Deputy Richard Burke has now returned to Dáil Éireann having served Ireland well as our member of the European Commission for four years in Brussels.  There will be general recognition across the political divide that he served us well in Brussels and enhanced his reputation there.  He made many useful contacts not only in Europe but internationally and became familar with the personalities and mechanisms of the Community.  His experience would be of immense benefit to the Government at a time when crucial discussions are about to take place within the Community on a fundamental restructuring of Community mechanisms and institutions.  The Taoiseach will have a very difficult job to persuade any impartial observer that any talents Senator Dooge may have outweigh the demonstrated ability and, perhaps more important, the undoubted experience of Deputy Richard Burke.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richie Ryan must surely have been considered.  He was a very articulate and determined spokesman on Foreign Affairs for Fine Gael when they were in Opposition.  He has his experience as a member of the European Parliament to rely on and he had four years' experience as a member of an Irish Government. Was it perhaps his strong convictions on neutrality that ruled him out on this occasion?  Deputies Burke and Ryan are two men of experience and of not inconsiderable standing and reputation.  It is not for me to recommend them to the Taoiseach or force them on him.  The Taoiseach, by his non-selection of either of them, leaves himself open to the <Col N="119" /> charge of shortsighted favouritism, of gathering around him a clique of personal friends in a sort of elitist kitchen cabinet.</P>

      <P>Does the House favour a development of that kind or does it not regard this as basically unhealthy and dangerous?  The fundamental point I wish to make is that the appointment now proposed will amount to a diminishing, and potentially dangerous diminishing, of the functions of this House as the Chamber which directly represents the people.  Deputies of all parties should think long and hard whether they wish to set the seal on a precedent of this kind. It is not in the interests of parliamentary government and has some very undesirable and unacceptable overtones.  It can be seen as a move to concentrate the power of government in the hands of a small, select coterie of people who have very much the same educational, social and economic background.</P>
      <P>In this debate it is also relevant for us to examine the actual conduct of our foreign affairs and diplomacy since the Minister-designate, in my view wrongly, took up the reins of office in Iveagh House.  That there has been bungling and ineptitude is clear to everyone and the Minister-designate has singularly failed to impose any consistent pattern on Irish foreign policy.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs he has a very special responsibility and duty to protect and enhance our international standing and reputation, to maintain our good name and fly the national flag.  Senator Dooge, however, has failed to do this.  He has failed to restrain the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance from doing serious damage to our financial standing abroad and our economic prospects by damaging our reputation as a country attractive to outside investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must also take responsibility for that dreadful and humilating episode in the Irish Embassy in Washington when an ill-judged and ill-prepared <i>demarche</i><Col N="120" /> was made on President Reagan, an approach so gauche that it was damaging and counter productive.  Why in heavens name did he not stop the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism from committing this latest ludicrous proposal to supply free drinks, meals and accommodation to visitors from Northern Ireland, an insulting patronising gesture which I am certain the people of Northern Ireland will reject contemptuously?</P>
    <P>I ask the House to reject this proposal to confirm the appointment of Senator Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is contrary to settled constitutional practice and represents a dangerous precedent. There are many well-qualified candidates for the appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House and the uncertain, confused way in which foreign policy has been conducted over the past four months gives no grounds whatever on which we could with any confidence confirm the appointment of Senator Dooge.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that they have one clear honourable way of dealing with this situation.  The by-election which must be held in Cavan-Monaghan offers him the opportunity of securing for Senator Dooge a seat in Dáil Éireann.  This is the procedure which is frequently adopted in other democracies.  The Government should tomorrow morning agree with us in moving the writ for the Cavan-Monaghan by-election and put Senator Dooge forward to the people for their approval.  That is the kind of confirmation that would end all the argument. Everyone inside and outside the House would accept it and Senator Dooge would be able, in his own right as an elected Member of Dáil Éireann, to conduct our diplomacy and foreign affairs with authority and confidence &mdash; something he will never be able to do on the basis of the appointment we are now asked to confirm.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the points that have been made by Deputy Haughey in relation to the confirmation of the Minister-designate. <Col N="121" /> Deputy Haughey has raised some fundamental points on the general constitutional principle of appointing such a person in a situation in which there are no special circumstances and in view of the undoubted talent available to the Taoiseach for this post.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey has raised the basic point of the accountability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs which should exist in to-day's highly sensitive world and having regard in particular to the highly sensitive matters that concern us on this island.  In that type of national and international political situation it is almost inconceivable that the Taoiseach should make the choice of somebody who is not responsive to the people and not responsive in a special way to participate in debates here. However, the former Taoiseach has covered that whole area adequately and I should like to concentrate on some specific points relating to the conduct of foreign affairs in recent months.</P>
      <P>The first general point is that the whole conduct of this new Government since their election has been in the realm of chaos &mdash; chaotic because the Minister-designate did not have any constitutional or legal basis; secondly, because Deputy Kelly was sent to perform missions in his usual inconsequential manner on behalf of the Minister-designate and, thirdly, because the Taoiseach sometimes put his oar in without there being any great effect.  There has been no overall continuity or conceptual approach to running the Department of Foreign Affairs since the change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter that I regard as very serious.  I refer to the Minister-designate's speech to the UN on 30 September. In the course of a rather short speech on that occasion Senator Dooge dealt in an offhand manner with the fundamental problem on this island &mdash; the whole question of Northern Ireland, a matter which should concern any Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I was amazed at the perfunctory manner in which he dealt with that question, but apart from that there was the absence of any real depth in his contribution, the absence of any attempt to bring to the notice of the world statesmen assembled there the basic national policy <Col N="122" /> and attitude which obtains in regard to the Northern Ireland situation.</P>
    <P>It may astound this House and the Irish people to learn that not once in the course of his speech did Senator Dooge refer to Northern Ireland, that not once did he refer to the fundamental national aspirration towards a united Ireland.  There was no reference in that speech to the fact that all of us here, I hope, regard the achievement of Irish unity by peaceful means as the ultimate goal.  That may mean a long road but it represents the basic national goal.  It is written into our Constitution and has been held up to now by all Deputies to be the basic national goal.  That needs to be restated.  As I look through the pages of the script of the Minister-designate's speech to the UN, I find that he refers to the achieving of peace as being the central issue for all of us in Ireland today.  He refers to peace but not peace to be achieved in the context of the ultimate goal of national unity. He goes on to indicate the direction his Government will try to take and the principles they will try to follow.</P>
    <P>In his speech are listed the four principles which the Government will follow in the context of whatever direction they are taking regarding Northern Ireland.  I quote:</P>
    <P>First: As I said, our primary aim is peace, healing and reconciliation.  It follows that we utterly repudiate violence...</P>
    <P>Second: The claim by the men of violence to derive legitimacy from the past or from the future for acts of violence in Ireland today is a spurious one...</P>
    <P>Third: My Government is open in its outlook and approach.</P>
    <P>What a vacuous statement that is.</P>
    <P>The third point continues:</P>
    <P>It is ready to examine, to consider, and &mdash; if major change is needed &mdash; to propose to our electorate what may best advance our basic aim of healing and reconciliation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fourth point again is a vacuous and vaporous statement.  It says that the Government, to this end, will do what <Col N="123" /> they can to promote goodwill and understanding between the North and the South of the island.  These are four basic directions in which he suggests an Irish Government should proceed but he makes no reference whatever to the basic aspiration of unity.  By way of a fifth point he said that the Government would continue to develop the many close links between Ireland and Great Britain. There is no reference in that document either to the Anglo-Irish talks initiated by the previous Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and which, as the Taoiseach has admitted, have marked a very real milestone forward in progress between the two islands.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in that speech of the Minister-designate to what we have always regarded as the basic national aspiration, to the view that has always been held that, however rough the road and however long the time within which that aspiration might be accomplished eventually, we desire the establishment of political structures within which an evolution to Irish unity would be possible. I am glad to say that in the equivalent speech I made last year I specified the way forward in which we should be going.</P>

      <P>During the weekend I attended a conference concerning Northern Ireland and I was glad to hear the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee who is a member of the Conservative Party say that the most significant political move in Anglo-Irish affairs since the Second World War was the initiation of the Anglo-Irish talks and the joint studies as initiated between the former Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. I am very pleased to hear that the <Col N="124" /> Taoiseach intends following up that initiative and I hope that he will do so effectively.</P>
      <P>A matter which emerged during the speech of the Minister-designate to the UN is the fact that he said that we did not view the Northern Ireland problem as a colonial matter nor as a matter of disputed history.  He was apologising for it when speaking to an assembly composed largely of people with a colonial past and a colonial history who voted for us this time last year on the Security Council of the UN because we had a problem of colonialism in this island which they too had throughout Asia, Africa and South America.  On that occasion the Minister-designate showed a lamentable lack of appreciation of the people to whom he was talking who appreciated that this was a colonial problem. That was not the whole nature of the problem but certainly it was to some degree historically and it is so to some degree today.  In effect, the Minister-designate indicated to that world assembly that Ireland comprises only the Twenty-six Counties and that we can achieve reconciliation and peace with the other Six Counties along certain vague lines which make no reference whatever to the aspiration of unity.</P>

      <P>I wish to take up another matter which has emerged only very recently.  That is the whole subject of European political co-operation and the way in which we have been edged forward into a compromising position within EPC, into a situation where we will be participating in talks on security and ultimately, make no mistake about it, talks that will lead to talks on military and nuclear matters.  I emphasise this aspect because we have had here a long and honoured tradition of neutrality.  We have made it quite plain here when in Government that we have been always a neutral state from the military and security points of view.  We have not been ideologically neutral.  We believe in democracy and in human rights, but in <Col N="125" /> military and security matters we have maintained a consistent stance of neutrality which has been honoured by successive Governments and which was first seen fully to the greatest effect when the late Mr. Éamon de Valera, as Taoiseach, handled and ran this country's affairs during the last war with tremendous success and established in practical terms that basic principle which has been the cornerstone of Irish diplomatic policy since then.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is well aware that since we entered the Community in 1973 EPC has been essentially an <i>ad hoc</i> body of Community Foreign Ministers without any institutional or formal basis.  They have met in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  There has been no formalisation of decisions.  They have discussed the problems in a general way and as far as Ireland is concerned we have not taken part in any military or security talks under the umbrella of these matters.</P>
      <P>I emphasise these aspects because of something that is very fresh in my mind. As Minister for Foreign Affairs I attended the last meeting before the most recent one of the Foreign Affairs Ministers when they met in Venlo in the Netherlands on 9 and 10 May under the EPC framework.  At that meeting I was briefed fully by my officials and took a certain stance.  There was a very strong move on the part of the British Government particularly to strengthen the whole framework of European political co-operation so as to involve a greater degree of decision-making within it that would bring everybody within the Community closer under a security and eventually military umbrella.  To this extent the UK was supported by Germany and Italy in the strongest sense in this direction.  Both of them have gone public on it and their respective Foreign Ministers Genscher and Colombo have also gone public on their support of a greater strengthening of Europe in regard to foreign affairs and military and security matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four main options were before us at that meeting in Holland in May, and I am quoting from my briefing for that meeting which I have retained.  They were to maintain the present system as it is, to <Col N="126" /> make minor administrative modifications to the present system, to draw up a new report &mdash; which has happened &mdash; which retains the nature and expands the scope of political co-operation, and to draw up a formal treaty of political co-operation. The last is the final and ultimate and that is what they are aiming at.  We were in favour of the first two options, either to maintain the present system or make minor administrative or procedural changes.  At that meeting in May we were not in favour &mdash; I reiterate solemnly here &mdash; of drawing up a new report, which has happened and has formalised the whole matter.  Certainly we are not in favour of drawing up a formal treaty on European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>The comment in my briefing material on that occasion is that we should say &mdash; as I did &mdash; that generally we are happy with the present system of political co-operation which meets the needs of the Community at its present stage of development. I emphasise that.  Also in the briefing material which I received for the meeting of 9 and 10 May we have this explicit recognition of Ireland's vital interest in this area: &ldquo;We would see the explicit extension of EPC to include security questions as a major change to the present system.  Consequently, any proposal in this sense would be acceptable only in the context of a formal treaty or a new report on political co-operation and after careful and confidential consideration at official level.  For Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; they recognise it directly &mdash;&ldquo;any explicit inclusion of security among the areas to be covered by EPC is a very sensitive issue&rdquo;.  It goes on to advise me, very properly, of what my approach should be.  My approach last May was just that, but I was aware at that meeting in May and at previous meetings of EPC that the British in particular and to some extent the other two countries I have mentioned &mdash; two very strong NATO countries &mdash; were pushing very hard to have a strengthening of the decision-making process within the EPC framework that would enlarge foreign affairs to cover the whole military and security areas.  The British wanted a working and functioning directorate to be appointed.  That is not <Col N="127" /> included in that report but I am certain that it continues to be their objective.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may say in replying to this debate that the report that emerged from the recent meeting does not bring the matter very much further from the <i>ad hoc</i> area in which it resided.  This is the first time it has been formalised in any type of document.  For the first time we see from page 2 of the document which has been adopted, and I quote: &ldquo;The Foreign Ministers agree to maintain the flexible and pragmatic approach which has made it possible to discuss in political co-operation certain important foreign policy questions bearing on the political aspects of security&rdquo;.  I want to know from the Taoiseach what that means.  What does &ldquo;the political aspects of security&rdquo; mean?  That is a new phrase.  I see from this document that he emphasised not merely a common attitude but joint action, and &ldquo;joint action&rdquo; is the phrase I quote.  Further on one sees that, &ldquo;In future the political committee may wish to take a longer term approach to certain problems and to institute studies to that end and, furthermore, to intensify and broaden the Ten within the sphere of European political co-operation with a view to achieving a greater consensus and a greater degree of agreement and action on the political aspects of security&rdquo;.  In case anybody is under any illusion about what that means, there are certain people who have no illusions about what it means &mdash; the establishment media in London who, basically, always speak for Britain.  The British media speaks for the British Government, especially on an important matter like foreign affairs, military or security matters.  I quote from the <i>Financial Times</i> of 14 October 1981 which reports on this meeting under the heading &ldquo;EEC members endorse Security Charter&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>EEC member states yesterday took their foreign policy co-operation an important step forward by endorsing a &ldquo;charter&rdquo; which for the first time embodies a formal commitment to consult on security.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's agreement by Community <Col N="128" /> foreign ministers meeting in London is an achievement for the British Government which had been seeking a commitment of this kind on European political co-operation during its six-month term as President of the EEC Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The next part is lovely &mdash; it is typical British condescension&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>However, Lord Carrington, deliberately played down the significance of the joint commitment.</P>
    <P>To avoid upsetting the other NATO partners and Irish sensibilities, he very kindly decided to play down the projection. It is not just the <i>Financial Times</i> but the whole league of papers that support the establishment line in these matters in Britain.  <i>The Times</i> had an editorial entitled &ldquo;Towards a Common Foreign Policy&rdquo; which said a major aim had been achieved in getting this loose political co-operation into a more organised, formalised and institutionalised form.  On the same day <i>The Guardian</i> said:</P>
    <P>The EEC foreign Ministers have agreed to step up co-ordination of foreign policy, including &ldquo;the political aspects of security&rdquo;.  However, a statement issued by the Ten after a meeting in London yesterday, falls short of a commitment to include defence matters in EEC foreign policy co-operation which had been urged earlier by West Germany...</P>
    <P>Security issues have long been discussed informally at EEC meetings, but until now this has not been officially recognised for fear of upsetting Ireland, which is not a member of NATO and pursues a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Whatever the real decision was, the cosmetics were not to upset our sensibilities and it has been brought here by some of the Irish media, who seem to indicate that there is really nothing to fear.  However, the cosmetic job is done to ensure that, as far as Ireland was concerned, she should be kept happy for the time being.  As far as the <i>Financial Times, The Guardian</i> and <i>The Times</i>, three well <Col N="129" /> known establishment newspapers, are concerned, what they say is, in effect, the direct Foreign Office and British line.  As far as they are concerned, a very important and serious step has been taken in the direction of achieving agreement on political aspects of security and, whatever the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Minister-designate may say to the Irish media, the British media in expressing the views of the British Government, are quite clear in their minds what this is about &mdash; movement towards involvement as far as Ireland is concerned, in military matters within the western community.</P>
    <P>That is against our basic interest for many reasons.  We were in an excellent position when we took part in these <i>ad hoc</i> discussions on foreign policy and on political matters within a loose framework of European political co-operation. The exchange of information was very helpful.  There was no question of it becoming a decision-making body, nor is that envisaged at present within the Community framework or within any of the Community laws.  This is the first formalisation of the situation and the first step towards having a treaty on this basis which will involve us, not just in security matters but closer still in military matters. For several reasons, it is against our national interest.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months I have spent a lot of time conveying my view to European Foreign Ministers and I have heard the former Taoiseach also saying it at Summit meetings, that our main preoccupation within the Community has been the whole idea of achieving convergence in regard to our social and economic progress.  We regard that as being of paramount importance in relation to making progress within the Community.  We have always regarded foreign affairs co-operation, security co-operation and defence co-operation, general political co-operation of that nature, in an institutionalised way as the very end of the line, when we had achieved a degree of economic convergence and social harmonisation right through the whole Community.  At the end of the day, when we had a real regional and social policy working, when there was sufficient transfer of resources <Col N="130" /> towards the less well-off region of the Community, one could say we had a real Community which we do not have today because of the inequalities which exist in social, economic, financial and regional areas.  Britain is not even a member of the EMS.</P>
    <P>Over the whole range of the socio-economic regional financial currency areas, there are a host of problems which have to be solved before there is a degree of equalisation achieved, where one would even contemplate the sort of integration involved in political or foreign affairs, security or defence integration.  That has been Ireland's policy since we went into the Community.  I have advanced that consistently time and time again, that we would not move on these matters concerning security and defence until the end of the day, because then one had a real community, not just a community of nations or states bound together in some loose arrangement for defence and security purposes.</P>
    <P>The British conception is entirely different. I am not critical of it; it is in their self-interest.  Their attitude is that one can co-operate on political matters, on foreign affairs and on defence and security matters in advance of all this.  Britain does not really believe in social, economic, currency and financial integration within the Community.  Britain has as a priority the involvement of the Community and the participation by the Community, and the countries in the Community rather than the Community itself, in foreign policy matters for defence and military reasons.  These are the matters which predominate in the British establishment and Government thinking.  That tends also to be the thinking of other major countries within the Community &mdash; except France &mdash; such as Italy and Germany who are highly conscious of NATO.  It is entirely against Ireland's interest to bargain away an involvement in this whole foreign affairs, political, security, defence area or even to start on the slippery slope to bargaining it away. That is what this document does.  To start bargaining away one's stance in that respect does not make sense as far as our national interest is concerned.  I say <Col N="131" /> advisedly and unreservedly that we have thrown away a policy which was consistently followed within the Community since 1973.</P>
    <P>I remember being present with the former Taoiseach at a press conference in Bonn some months ago, when the Chancellor was asked this specific question in regard to Ireland's neutrality.  He was very forthcoming and immediate in his response, which was that in no way did Germany, within the Community, require Ireland's participation in any form of defence commitment.  He fully respected Ireland's neutrality and her stance with regard to it.  There was complete respect and backing for this stance. The reason for that is quite evident.  It is very useful, within the Community, to have one country such as ours neutral and sometimes Denmark, although Denmark is tied in with NATO.  However, Ireland has been easily the most neutral member of the Community in regard to her consistent policy up to now.  It is very useful for the Community to have a country like Ireland which has a voice and a status among the countries of the world that will not have anything to do with countries tied into a military alliance such as NATO.  Again, I am not being critical of NATO.  I fully understand why countries are tied into this organisation.  It is, however, a fact of political and diplomatic life among the nations of the world that a number of nations are very suspicious and do not want anything to do with NATO countries as such.  Ireland can easily be a bridge country from the Community to such countries.</P>
    <P>I shall give the House a practical example of this.  Last September twelve months, the CESC Conference in Madrid got off the ground and was not supposed to be getting off the ground at all.  This was the meeting on security co-operation so as to achieve a degree of détente within Europe.  The German Government asked me at the time &mdash; Herr Genscher in particular &mdash; to make the necessary contacts with other countries outside NATO, in eastern Europe in particular, and with neutral countries such as Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, in an attempt to get <Col N="132" /> talks going.  It was Ireland, with her special position, that was able to operate, as it were, on behalf of the EEC countries with these other countries to ensure that the European security co-operation talks got off the ground.  These countries would not talk to any of the other countries because they were all tied up, in one way or another, with NATO or with military attachments.</P>
    <P>We got the talks going, although they have not been very successful.  However, the countries have been talking since.  A very useful part was played by Ireland in détente, through these meetings, in achieving a reduction in armament and in tensions within the European continent. It is in this way that Ireland can play a very useful role in disarmament discussions and meetings, as we have done within the United Nations framework. This is a particular contribution which we can make because of our neutrality stance.  We are regarded as a country which is genuinely neutral, not being attached to any military bloc.  We are within the EEC, but not a member of any bloc.  We are not a large enough nation to be required, within the EEC, to participate for any defence purposes.</P>
    <P>This makes more silly the Government's inching in this direction at all.  I do not understand why the Government have behaved as they have.  There has never been any pressure on Ireland in this regard.  At no stage, at meetings on European political co-operation or <i>en marge,</i> as they say, at side meetings and talking to people has it ever been mentioned to me that we should become entangled in any security or military aspect.  I say that emphatically and in a straightforward fashion.  Our role in regard to neutrality has always been a respected role.  The particular advantages which we represent to the Community as a whole by preserving that role have always been respected.  We have never come under any pressure up to now to change that role.  That is why I do not understand why we are agreeing to it.</P>
    <P>I agree that one can go through this document, parse it and make the technical case that there is not a military commitment in it but, written down for the <Col N="133" /> first time, there is the question of the political aspects of security.  I want to know what that phrase means.  Does it mean that we are, straight away, into considerations of weaponry, types of weapons, nuclear placements, that whole area?  It means nothing else but that.  That is absolutely distinct from peaceful conferences in relation to détente and disarmament which are concerned with the positive side.  Discussion of the political aspect of security covers the whole area of weaponry and military and defence aspects in relation to political security.  In other words, it means defence matters.  It can now be denied, technically, that that is what is there.  The ugly word &ldquo;defence&rdquo; does not appear in this document.  What does appear is the phrase &ldquo;political aspects of security&rdquo;, which means drifting into defence by the back door.  Whatever may be said here by the Taoiseach, or by the Irish media, to dress up this situation, the British media and the British establishment newspapers have no doubt whatsoever as to what that phrase means. Knowing the background to the matter as I do, I am quite certain that this will entail military or defence involvement by the back door, by stealth.</P>
    <P>We should have a full and frank debate in this House on the whole matter and all the papers relating to the subject should be placed in the Library of the House.  If this document leads to any formal treaty within the Community which did not exist at the time of our entry into it, that represents a very serious matter having regard to the connotations of Article 29 of our Constitution and the necessity for this House to sanction an international treaty of any kind.</P>
    <P>I have said sufficient to show that these two very vital areas which are the two mainstays of Irish foreign policy, the two important aspects of Irish foreign policy &mdash; the question of Northern Ireland and the question of our neutrality and how we preserve our neutrality within the context of the European Community &mdash; have not been protected but have, in effect, been damaged in a few short months, caused by, without any reflection on the person involved, the whole nature and manner of Professor Dooge's appointment <Col N="134" /> and the fact that there was not a political person to go in there immediately and take over Foreign Affairs, left as it was in excellent shape, nobody to continue the work and grasp the matter immediately.  Instead, there was a policy of drift and Ireland has been grievously harmed in two very basic areas, on the stage of the United Nations and on the stage of European political co-operation within the Community.</P>

      <P>Dar ndóigh, bheadh sé úsáideach cúpla focal a rá ar na horáidí atáimid tar éis a chloisteáil faoin cheapachán den Ollamh Dooge bheith mar Aire.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer a few words on the comment we have just heard on the appropriateness of the appointment of Professor Dooge.  The last comment of Deputy Lenihan &mdash; probably his only comment with which I would agree &mdash; is that if there are implications that the recent development to which he made reference would constitute the status of a treaty, it would be appropriate that there be a full and well documented debate in this House.  In that I would support the Deputy.  However, as regards the first criticisms made about the appointment of Professor Dooge, I must confess to finding them singularly unconvincing. One cannot take very seriously the idea, given the problems which exist internationally and which require response from Ireland, that it is absolutely necessary that an Irish Foreign Minister should immerse himself in localism within an Irish constituency.  I find it hard to be convinced that Professor Dooge will be a less able Minister speaking on Ireland's behalf abroad because he is not listening to constituents who come to his clinics about medical cards, social welfare and the other inefficiencies of a modern bureaucratic and over-centralised State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be very useful to comment on the other suggestions that we should look at the appointment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in terms of the availability of alternative talent in the party from which the man comes.  I would like to defend the principle of the right <Col N="135" /> of the Taoiseach of the day to make appointments having regard to the necessities of the office rather than to the vagaries of geography, localism or whatever. We have had an appeal for modernity in foreign affairs and we might have an appeal for modernity in our domestic affairs if we were to have regard to the requirements of office as much as the requirements of geographical count.</P>
    <P>I found myself not being moved deeply either by the appeal to the theme of accountability, the idea that Senator Dooge will constitute some extraordinary deviant in an otherwise very accountable State.  There are few things this State and the public have debated in the last few months other than this theme of accountability, both in financial matters and in matters other than foreign affairs.  We had a debate on whether sums of money were voted by the Dáil and, when they were not, how they were spent.  I believe there is a popular movement to have some demonstrated accountability in public affairs and I would welcome such if it should come before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is very serious and responsible, if Members of the Opposition feel that important issues of Irish foreign policy have been endangered, that these views should be aired now while we are discussing the appointment of Senator Dooge, who will have the responsibility of representing Ireland abroad.  I do not believe the Taoiseach has endangered any traditional aspiration in his remarks on the Constitution.  In fact, I believe he might have opened the window to some realism in relation to the aspiration of people who want to live in peace and &mdash; may I say? &mdash; in modernity.</P>
    <P>There is another sense in which one can be divided from one's own people rather than North and South, which has caused loss of life &mdash; for example, when one is constricted by a Constitution to living in the past.  There are many people who welcomed the debate on the Constitution because we believe we are living in this century and the document which describes our problem should be of this century and not of the past.</P>
    <P>On the question of neutrality, there <Col N="136" /> are a few brief remarks I want to make. I do not believe Senator Dooge will endanger the well-known clear position of Irish neutrality because I do not believe it exists.  We heard the basis of the confusion in the two previous speeches.  It is said that we are not ideologically neutral but we are militarily neutral. We are not politically neutral but we are militarily neutral.  How does one ever abstract from these different assertions a coherent position in the event of there being an escalation in the tension that might exist internationally?  To that end it is appropriate that I make perfectly clear the position of the Labour Party in the concept of neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, the oldest party in the State, have from their foundation spoken about neutrality and the importance of world peace.  It was one of the themes most spoken about by Tom Johnson, for example.  At the opening of the Labour Party Conference in 1940 the then chairman of the Labour Party, my predecessor, stressed neutrality as the principal concern of that conference.  He opened his speech by saying that as a neutral country we had no war aims to declare.  We in the Labour Party today are in favour of an active policy of neutrality.  We see the great contribution that can be made by Ireland in, for example, developing closer relationships with the non-aligned movement.  We believe there are other ways in which we might give coherence to our policy of neutrality. I favour, in whatever form of constitutional revision we end up with, that there be put into the Constitution our commitment to neutrality.  This would be an important development.</P>
    <P>Let us think about the confusion that has arisen in the public mind that in voting for Senator Dooge, as I will, one is somehow endangering Irish neutrality. Few things endanger Irish neutrality as the confusion with which we have pursued this theme.  I have checked statements made by different administrations over the years and I will quote from one made on 14 February 1962.  The Taoiseach of the day had this to say:</P>
    <P>... I think it would be highly undesirable <Col N="137" /> that remarks made here should give the impression in Europe that there is a public opinion in this country which regards membership of NATO as something discreditable.  The view of the Government in that regard has been made clear.  We think the existence of NATO is necessary for the preservation of peace and for the defence of the countries of Western Europe, including this country. Although we are not members of NATO, we are in full agreement with its aims.</P>

      <P>The Official Report, volume 193, columns 6 and 7, 14 February 1962, when the late Deputy Seán Lemass was Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Not only is there some problem about what we mean by neutrality as I understand it but there is also the question: does anybody in the international community believe we are genuinely neutral? In different votes in the United Nations &mdash; a subject that has been studied by political scientists &mdash; we are somewhere near Panama in our enthusiastic support for positions taken on issues like the &ldquo;Cold War&rdquo; by the United State.  If one takes the figure 1 for the United States voting for itself, Ireland is .739.  This information was presented in a paper to the Royal Irish Academy last year.  In further surveys among the non-aligned nations, do a significant number of countries believe we are neutral?  The answer is, unfortunately, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we have been living with this concept of neutrality without giving any clear commitment to some bedrock principles that should be followed.  It has been said that, if the Community had finished their idealistic development, if they had had a regional policy and a social policy, if they had become a real Community, perhaps we would have changed the agenda and moved on to consider other things.  This, too, contributes to our confusion about the question of neutrality. Does this mean it is something that is not <Col N="138" /> to be discussed today, but under other conditions and at another time we might discuss it?</P>
    <P>This is not new because throughout the forties a former Member of this House, Mr. Seán MacBride, stressed in a number of speeches that we could not talk about abandoning neutrality until the partition of Ireland had been put on the agenda.</P>
    <P>Is it then a case that when the partition of Ireland is on the agenda we can discuss neutrality again?  In such an atmosphere we have convinced nobody in the international community and have confused ourselves and the public.  We have been indulging in semi-theological distinctions between ideological neutrality and military and political neutrality.  We have created a great confusion to which Senator Dooge may make the contribution of clarity.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge on Senator Dooge the view which my party take on neutrality.  We are in favour of neutrality and non-alignment.  We believe that through relations with the non-aligned nations we can make an important contribution to world peace and to the possibilities of creating harmony in the world and eroding the danger of confrontation. Through such an association we can make a small contribution to the question of the shameful arms race and the armaments industry.  That is what neutrality is all about.  Any new Constitution should have the principle of neutrality written into it.  Within our educational system we should emphasise what it means to take a position of independence and embrace the concept of neutrality between two very large power blocs.</P>
    <P>I find somewhat seedy the view we have taken that we are neither with them nor against them.  This has sometimes been called our &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; approach to foreign policy and this has been held to mean that we have been doing something practical and avoiding the great dilemmas into which bigger and greater nations hurl themselves.  We fool nobody but ourselves with these views.  My position and that of the Labour Party is that neutrality means having an impartial view on the two major blocs and being free to criticise <Col N="139" /> the eastern bloc when it crushes democracy and likewise the western bloc.  I would urge Senator Dooge to prepare a paper on neutrality in which these concepts could be developed.  I wish him well in salvaging, out of the mish-mash of confusion we have created over the years, a meaningful concept of neutrality with which our young people, who do not wish to line up behind the United States or the USSR, can identify.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which I would urge Senator Dooge to bear in mind. Regarding American assistance to the junta in El Salvador, if we had a clearly defined position of independence in foreign affairs we would have condemned more forcibly the supply of arms by an outside power to a regime which is perpetrating atrocities.  A genuine independence in our foreign policy will also enable us to make a worthwhile contribution in relation to a new world economic order. In the next ten years the world will not agitate itself about what Lord Carrington said or did not say to Senator Dooge on what <i>The Guardian</i> reported on the matter. In the new world circumstances in which we find ourselves a new relationship will be forged between that part of the world which was previously a producer of primary commodities and the industrial nations of the West.  In that atmosphere it will be important for Ireland to believe in certain principles which we might discuss.  I would welcome a discussion in the Dáil about the principles of foreign policy.  What is it that we are following by way of principle?  Do we subscribe to the idea of foreign policy being structured around peace, co-operation, forms of development, the rights of new countries to have shares of markets and freedom from hunger?  These are the real issues within foreign politics and the ones which will motivate the minds of concerned people in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I wish to make another minor point. One finds on reading Dáil and Seanad debates over the years on issues associated with foreign policy that there was a time in the forties when a Minister told the Dáil that foreign policy was not a <Col N="140" /> subject for the Dáil at all.  We may have made progress from that but in the past few years different Deputies have at various times sought to elicit the reasoning behind votes by Ireland at international conferences and at the UN.  Frequently the answers given have been unsatisfactory. Only two years ago Deputy Quinn sought to extract information on how Ireland had voted in relation to a number of issues and it was pointed out that this information was usually available to the Department concerned.  I offer the opinion that votes by Ireland on any issue at any conference abroad are matters for this House.  There should be a consistency between the principles debated and supported in this House and the votes which take place.  There is no such thing as a pragmatic foreign policy by which one can make up the basis of one's vote or abstention in relation to crucially important moral issues.  In those cases such votes should be justified in the Dáil. I urge on the new administration in Foreign Affairs that they arrange for the maximum accountability in the matter of Ireland's voting abroad.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a basis of certainty which will be shaken by the appointment of Senator Dooge.  There are matters of genuine public concern upon which it is most appropriate that the Taoiseach when replying to this debate should give an assurance.  I refer to matters such as neutrality.  It is important to suggest to Senator Dooge and his Department that from a basis of independence and a set of principles of a moral kind Ireland could carve out a position in which it would be recognised as slightly less enthusiastic than Panama in voting with the United States on just about every issue at the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear at the beginning, as did Deputy Haughey, that nothing I say on this motion is intended to or will imply any denigration of Senator Dooge personally. He is a man whom I have always found to be very courteous and able. From my knowledge of him in his activities in the past that would be a very fair description.  In saying that I am not imply- <Col N="141" /> ing that there are not Deputies in the Fine Gael Party who would not be equally courteous and able in the position for which he is proposed.</P>
      <P>I was interested in what Deputy Higgins said and his statement that he was mystified by the proposition that we are militarily neutral but not ideologically neutral because it seemed to me that that was a fairly clear statement.  On the other hand, I was quite mystified by his statement that he was about to expound the Labour Party's position and policy on neutrality.  It seemed to me that he was implying in what he said that the Labour Party's policy on neutrality was one thing but certainly it did not mean that that was the policy of the Leader of that party on neutrality or, indeed, of the other members of the Labour Party who are in Government, or indeed of the Government as a whole, or of all the Labour Party members.</P>
      <P>I am sure that when Deputy Higgins said he was going to set out the Labour Party's policy on neutrality he felt he was making a statement which was self-evidently clear but I am sure he will appreciate from what I have said that it is not perhaps quite as clear as it would have seemed.  There seemed to me to be various possible combinations and permutations, indeed, not just possible ones but actual ones, which come under the heading of &ldquo;Labour Party Policy on Neutrality&rdquo;. For instance, if it were being expounded by the Leader of the Labour Party it might not be quite what Deputy Higgins said and, in particular, if the Leader of the Labour Party were speaking as Tánaiste I imagine the position might be somewhat different.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was quite mystified also by a reference he made to geographical considerations. I do not think that anything was <Col N="142" /> said by previous speakers in regard to geographical considerations and in considering the appointment which is proposed to the House, and the possible alternatives which were referred to by Deputy Haughey, it does not seem to me that geographical considerations reared their ugly or other head, depending on one's point of view.  I am mystified, frankly, by Deputy Higgins' reference to the geographical considerations and if the Chair would allow him, and he wished to intervene briefly to explain it, I would not object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  That brings me to another point which I was about to make in regard to what Deputy Higgins said.  I want to tell him that I am quite certain he is wrong in one view he expressed.  When I say that, I am merely saying he was wrong because of inexperience. As one who has had some experience of Government I am absolutely positive that it is very salutary and, indeed, almost necessary that a Minister who spends any reasonable amount of time abroad engaged in activities which are not related to ordinary day to day considerations of his constituents needs to be in fairly regular touch through his clinics or whatever other way with what the ordinary people are thinking.  I am absolutely certain that that is an essential and vital part of democracy here.  I am not saying that if he does not do this he is going to make wrong decisions on general principles but I am saying that he is going to lose touch with what the people who send us all here are thinking.  It is very easy to do that and it is very easy to become totally engrossed in the kind of affairs which concern Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  They are very interesting on many occasions and are very high-flown. Sometimes they are very important but sometimes they have very little importance <Col N="143" /> despite what all those concerned with them think but whether they are important or unimportant I am absolutely certain that in order to express the kind of view on these topics which our people would wish to have expressed it is necessary for the Minister concerned to keep in close touch with his constituents and their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us to one of the real problems we are faced with in the proposition now before the House.  The proposal is to appoint Senator Dooge who has, in effect, no constituents to consult.  That is not to say that the man is totally cut off from the Irish people.  Of course he is not, but the necessary discipline that is involved for most of us in our contracts with our constituents will not apply to him.  I want to say without any ambiguity whatsoever that I am of the opinion that the view expressed by Deputy Higgins in this matter is a mistaken one.  It is realistic to suggest that in considering people for this appointment, the Taoiseach was, of course, considering members of his own party.  The division of the spoils resulted in that Department being allocated to a member of the Fine Gael Party.  In the normal way and following the precedent over the years, one would have expected the Taoiseach to have appointed a member of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party and, indeed, a member of the Fine Gael Party in Dáil Éireann.  We should not lightly dismiss the precedent involved. Deputy Haughey referred to the fact that there are only two precedents for an appointment of the kind before us.  The first one in the thirties is indeed, as he pointed out, really not relevant to the present discussion, in the sense that it was made under a totally different kind of Constitution and in particular a different kind of Seanad.  The one that is relevant is the second one, the appointment of the late Seán Moylan but, as Deputy Haughey pointed out, that appointment was so different from the one proposed here that it becomes irrelevant as a precedent.  In that case we were talking about a man with years of experience of membership of Dáil Éireann and long experience in government.  The kind of provision that <Col N="144" /> is in the Constitution in this regard would seem to be designed to cover an outside possibility of the kind that occurred in the case of the late Seán Moylan.</P>
    <P>It is within the letter of the Constitution to propose the kind of appointment that has been proposed today but I doubt if it is within the spirit to appoint somebody who is not, and never has been, a Member of this House and who is not offering himself for election to either House.  That would not seem to be within the spirit of the provision in the Constitution which itself limits the possibility of an appointment of this kind very much. It limits it to two and prohibits certain posts, such as that of Taoiseach and, I believe, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, from appointment from the Seanad.  We find that the Taoiseach in thinking of this appointment should have been constrained to a great extent by all the factors which have constrained previous Taoisigh in this matter so that they have avoided the kind of appointment proposed today.  One would have thought that he would have been looking around his own party in the Dáil for suitable appointees.  If he were, as Deputy Haughey pointed out, two names would immediately spring to mind.</P>
    <P>There are others who would certainly be suitable, who are so obvious that it is not possible for the Taoiseach to have overlooked them.  He must have considered them.  I would suggest that Deputy Richie Ryan would come to mind as somebody who had experience of Government, long experience in Fine Gael, was spokesman for foreign affairs for his party for a very long time, has a number of years of experience in the European Parliament and who, above all, was brought back to the Fine Gael front bench earlier this year.  Why?  I think, quite clearly, to give an appearance of weight and solidity which was very lacking in the Fine Gael front bench.  In all those circumstances it is not possible to say that Deputy Ryan was not considered for this appointment.</P>
    <P>But if there was some question of weighing merits or suitability for the <Col N="145" /> appointment then, of course, the ultimate decision and the responsibility for that decision lay with the Taoiseach and nobody else, and one could not quarrel with him if, in his judgment, he thought that, despite these qualities and experience which I have mentioned, the better appointment would be that of Deputy Richard Burke, because Deputy Burke also has experience in government and, of course, is a former European Commissioner with an intimate knowledge of the workings of the European community which is of vital importance to this country and, in particular, is of vital importance in a Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Burke is personally acquainted with all the key figures in Europe and many outside it.  Indeed he is friendly with a number of them.  So the Taoiseach was not exactly at his wits' end to find somebody suitable for appointment.</P>
    <P>To be able to dispense with such talents and such experience would be an enviable position to be in.  But I would suggest that one would only dispense with them because one was in a position to propose in their place somebody of very wide experience and of self-evident, outstanding capability superior to that of the people I have mentioned.  But, of course, that is not so.  Senator Dooge has no experience whatever of government.  He has no background in foreign affairs which might compensate for his lack of experience in government.  Yet he has been catapulted into this very important Ministry.  I say he has been because he has been acting in that position.  The whole procedure involved in appointing a Senator to the Government is difficult and these difficulties arise irrespective of the person concerned.  These difficulties arise irrespective of the Taoiseach appointing somebody to the Seanad and then appointing him to the Government or somebody being elected to the Seanad and being appointed to the Government because the actual composition of the Seanad does not take place until a considerable time after a new government has been formed.  So this procedure has built into it a number of difficulties which I would suggest, taken together with the <Col N="146" /> difficulties I have outlined in regard to the lack of experience and the lack of background in foreign affairs on the part of Senator Dooge as compared with the ready availability, immediately following the election, of the experience and talent of such people as Deputy Richie Ryan or Deputy Richard Burke, must surely have weighed very strongly with the Taoiseach.  Yet, instead of making an appointment of that kind he has chosen to go through the difficult procedure and the practical difficulties that have been involved, for him and for Senator Dooge, in proposing Senator Dooge as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one has to ask what is the motivating factor propelling the Taoiseach in this direction?  I do not know, nor do I want to know, the nature of the personal relationship between the Taoiseach and Deputy Ryan or the Taoiseach and Deputy Burke.  That is a matter between them.  They may be close friends or there may be a great antipathy between them&mdash;without denigrating either the Taoiseach or the Deputies concerned, there could be the latter.  Sometimes chemistry just does not work correctly between people.  That is not relevant to any of us.  What is relevant is the motivation of the Taoiseach.  I am afraid that all that has been left, considering the various factors operating, is for us to conclude that the motivation of the Taoiseach in disregarding both of these Deputies and choosing instead to go through the whole difficult rigmarole that we are going through is not the kind of motivation which should operate in the selection of a Government.  I suggest that this motion, rather than being related to the suitability or otherwise of Senator Dooge&mdash;it is of course related to that&mdash;is, in reality, related to the Taoiseach and his suitability in so far as he has chosen to follow this course involved in this proposal that is here before us today.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with and I do not know about the personal relationships between the people concerned.  But there are certain facts which are public knowledge. In the present circumstances they will have to be referred to.  First of all, in <Col N="147" /> regard to Deputy Ryan, I recall that when he was Minister for Finance he suffered a great deal of obloquy, in particular because of the proposals that he brought forward on capital taxation and specifically on the wealth tax.  I am not attempting to argue the merits or demerits of those matters.  That is in the past.  What I am suggesting is that it is a matter of public knowledge that the proposals in that regard did not emanate from Deputy Ryan or the Department of Finance but from the present Taoiseach.  I happen to believe&mdash;though this is not a matter of public knowledge&mdash;that Deputy Ryan was not entirely enthusiastic about them. But he did his job and when the pressure came on and when, in the colloquial phrase, the flak began, Deputy Ryan had to take it in this House&mdash;and I was one of those who was hurling it at him from where I am standing now.  But the Taoiseach disappeared from sight when that happened.  That whole episode&mdash;I am giving only a vignette of it and there is a lot more to it than that&mdash;must have been fairly traumatic for the people concerned. If as a result it produced antipathy between the Taoiseach and Deputy Ryan it is not something one would find difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Richard Burke, I regard as one of the more sordid episodes of politics in this country in recent years the campaign of vilification and denigration of Deputy Burke when he was Minister for Education, which was masterminded by his colleagues in Government, one of whom is now our Taoiseach. That campaign was directed at trying to ensure that Deputy Burke would not be appointed Commissioner in Europe.  I had many criticisms of Deputy Burke in relation to certain aspects of the way in which he carried out educational policy when he was Minister for Education but any criticisms I had to make I made them openly and they certainly would not in any way resemble the kind of campaign conducted against him by his colleagues in Government and in his party.</P>
    <P>The effect of that was much worse than what was happening here at home.  From <Col N="148" /> my observation I can say that Deputy Burke had to spend a very long time in Brussels simply counteracting the effect of that campaign which was conducted against him.  That operated against the interests of the country.  He was restricted for a considerable time in what he was able to do as a commissioner because of that campaign, which was conducted nationally and internationally and on a wide basis in the news media.  In due course, when he overcame those difficulties, he conducted his responsibilities in Europe satisfactorily and I have no complaints in that regard.</P>
    <P>The things I have been describing are public knowledge and I am not talking about things which are not known.  As it was public knowledge it is not unreasonable to speculate about the kind of relationship which existed as a result between Deputy Burke and the Taoiseach.  The only relevance in all this is whether those episodes and the relationships which they are likely to have produced between the Taoiseach and the two Deputies concerned are the motivating factors in having this motion before us today.  I have a strong suspicion that is where the motivation lies.  If that is the case it is a bad reason for having this motion before us. It is a very black mark against the Taoiseach if that is the basis on which he forms his Government.  As Deputy Haughey said, nobody could argue with the Taoiseach in regard to his choice if he were choosing within the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, but when he has gone to such enormous lengths to choose somebody totally out of politics the onus is very strong on him to justify that choice and to show that the person concerned is a person of such outstanding talent and experience that it would be virtually criminal of the Taoiseach to deprive the country of that experience and talent.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning and I say again that I do not wish in any way to denigrate Senator Dooge, for whom I have a high regard, but I do not think it would be realistic to say that his qualities are so outstanding as to far outweigh all others available to the Taoiseach, such as those I have mentioned, or others available within his own party.  I believe there are <Col N="149" /> Deputies in the House who probably think on rather similar lines to those I have been expressing, but perhaps they are not in a position to say that.  If there is any Deputy who believes that the Taoiseach is wrong in what he has done, that he is downgrading Dáil Éireann and its role in the formulation of a Government, that his motivation is suspect and that he ought to be chastened by Dáil Éireann. I want to remind such a Deputy that he or she can bring this about without precipitating a general election.  One can defeat this motion and it is open to the Taoiseach &mdash; that is precisely what he would do if the motion were defeated &mdash; to bring in a motion of confidence.  If, like me, some Deputies have a grave suspicion about the Taoiseach's motivation in bringing this motion before us, I suggest that they ought to defeat the motion and establish quite clearly that the ultimate authority lies in this House and is derived from the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few observations because my party are in agreement with this motion and, having served in the House for a number of years and being involved in a review of constitutional matters from time to time, I do not share the touching concern of the former Taoiseach or Tánaiste in this matter.  Our Constitution, as Deputy Haughey and Deputy Colley should know, and they have said enough about the Constitution in the past month, provides &mdash; Deputy Colley as former Tánaiste should be well aware of this &mdash; under Article 28 that:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the member of the Government who is in charge of the Department of Finance must be members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The next part of that Article clearly states:</P>
      <P>The other members of the Government must be members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, but not more than two may be members of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it hypocritical and opportunistic <Col N="150" /> on the part of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, notably Deputy Haughey, who is so hard up to get any kind of an issue after three-and-a-half months that he has to come in here to pick a particular issue and try to make political mileage out of it.  I should have thought that he could have picked a more major issue of economic and social importance, because he was rather preoccupied about those issues earlier today. He huffed and puffed about the Constitution which he reveres, the de Valera Constitution.  Because the Taoiseach availed of the Constitution which anticipated this eventuality, should the Taoiseach so wish, we had rhetoric today from a man who cannot even appoint his front bench.  That strains the credulity of Members of the House.  Deputy Haughey says he intends to re-appoint former front bench appointees during the summer recess.</P>

      <P>Indeed.  The making of this appointment is the prerogative of the Taoiseach.  The issue of whether he is entitled to make the appointment has been clearly established.  He is.  He is exercising that entitlement.  All the huffing and puffing by Deputy Haughey this afternoon underlines his lack of credibility and his failure to appoint his own front bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue is whether Senator James Dooge is a fit person to hold the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Irish Republic.  Time will tell.  I submit <Col N="152" /> that he is eminently qualified.  He is as qualified as, and in some respects even more qualified than, some of the previous holders of that office.  There is nothing in the documentation laid before the House by Deputy Lenihan on the issue of neutrality to prevent us endorsing this appointment.</P>
    <P>I have known Senator Dooge for 15 years.  I had many discussions with him when I served with him on the Irish Council of the European Movement.  I have known him in many other capacities. I am convinced that he agrees as strongly and as passionately as I do on the need to preserve the neutrality of the Irish nation in a political, military or Community context.  If I had any doubt about that I would oppose his appointment.</P>
    <P>I regard him as a distinguished parliamentarian. He is a former Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and a former long serving Member of that House.  He had lengthy experience in local government, which is more than some holders of office have had.  He has a distinguished national and international record.  He has represented us in many international fora.  I have no doubt about his competence.</P>
    <P>Today Fianna Fáil have attempted pre-appointment assassination.  That speaks ill for an Opposition who have not even appointed a spokesman on Foreign Affairs.  Last weekend if Deputy Séamus Brennan had been consistent in his views on the Constitution, he might have finished up as spokesman on Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The arguments adduced by the Opposition today are nakedly opportunistic.  They do not impress me.  When I heard the effusion of nonsense about the Constitution from Deputy Haughey, I was provoked to speak in this debate.  When I heard Deputy Lenihan attempting to advise us on the background to his brief as a former Minister, it struck me that the tenacity with which he followed his briefs in relation <Col N="153" /> to neutrality in this country could indeed be questioned on many an occasion whether in domestic or international negotiations.  I do not propose to indulge in that retrospective analysis.  Rather do I contend that the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil here today on this issue do not hold water.  We should vote on the issue, and certainly I shall vote on the basis that Senator Dooge will uphold the neutrality of this country.  Nothing that has happened to date has changed that fundamental policy of this Government which I would point out is enshrined in their joint programme more than was enshrined in Fianna Fáil policy in the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticism of the Fianna Fáil Party on this motion was not entirely unwarranted on their suggestion that it would have been desirable to have found a Member of the House to become the Foreign Minister.  But, as a series of Deputies have pointed out, the Taoiseach acted within his authority as Taoiseach and within his authority under the Constitution.  As many people know, I have been critical of a number of the Articles of the Constitution and this is one of them of which I would be critical. I do not think it is desirable that a non-elected person should be chosen in place of any of us here in the House &mdash; obviously, in this case, Members of his own party.  It is offensive to them, by implication, that they are not as talented as Senator Dooge for whom, in personal terms, we all have the highest regard.  It is also, by implication, offensive to the electorate which has been asked to make a decision about a Government suitable to govern the country.  Obviously this would include an individual suitable to be Minister for Foreign Affairs.  First of all the Taoiseach has had the extraordinary temerity and tactlessness, I would have thought, unless he has a very good case for Senator Dooge, of telling each of his colleagues what he thinks or does not think of them, that he knows best. Then he turns to the electorate and says: You also have made a mistake because you have not elected anyone who I believe is sufficiently talented to be Minister <Col N="154" /> for Foreign Affairs.  That is something which should not be tolerated, but it does happen to be permissible under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I recall the incident in, I think, 1957 when Senator Moylan was made a Minister by Deputy de Valera.  Therefore there are precedents.  I would imagine that Fianna Fáil would have considered them respectable precedents, even though I know Deputy Haughey attempted in many ways to exculpate Mr. de Valera.  But then Mr. de Valera was implementing his own Constitution and I suppose could be forgiven for that.  At the same time the Taoiseach has that right, has used that right and there is nothing very much we can do about it except try to ensure that this is one of the provisions of the Constitution which, when we get around to amending it, we will change.  I hope that the Fianna Fáil Party, when they get down to accepting the reality that the Constitution has a number of serious defects &mdash; even though it has a number of admirable provisions &mdash; and this is one of them, will help those of us who contribute to the debate on the Constitution to change this provision and forbid a Taoiseach to fill a Cabinet in presidential style with his nominees.  It was an undesirable decision by the present Taoiseach.  The point was made by Deputy Haughey that this is a bad precedent, that it could lead to the erosion of the general principle of answerability and the whole concept of effective democracy. We should seek to end it so that a future Taoiseach will not follow the present Taoiseach's precedent to an even greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the policy of Senator Dooge, the proposed Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the two separate issues of the constitutional amendment and on neutrality.  Probably there could not be two more important issues.  On the first, the constitutional issue, since the decision by the Taoiseach about the Constitution &mdash; and of course I completely approve of that decision, but I hasten to add that it had nothing to do with any intervention on my part as far as the Taoiseach is concerned &mdash; it is probably well known that for many years I have <Col N="155" /> hoped that somebody would have the courage to face the reality that there could be no question whatever of any serious <i>rapprochement</i> between the people of the North and South, particularly the minority in the North and the South, without major changes in the Constitution and, even more important, in the laws made under the Constitution.  I have advocated that for many years.  But in this discussion of the constitutional amendment I would dissent very strongly from the Taoiseach's approach to some extent, and the Opposition's approach totally, to the suggestion that this question of constitutional amendment should be deferred until we get around the conference table.  I shall not develop this point beyond saying that these changes should have been and should be made for, in the first instance, our own people, the majority of our own people but, in particular, for a minority within our society. They have these rights to certain attitudes to personal behaviour, social behaviour in society.  It would be for that reason in the first instance that I would recommend a review of the Constitution and then, I would hope, its subsequent amendment in respect of the different issues which have been dealt with from time to time, in particular the question of the right to divorce.</P>
    <P>I welcome that development.  Much of it will be the responsibility of Senator Dooge especially in relation to the foreign affairs aspect. I welcome the fact that he favours a review of the Constitution and that we will move away from the generally accepted belief that this is a confessional State and my belief that much of the legislation under this Constitution has been blatantly sectarian.  I do not wish to develop that point but clearly since the Taoiseach's statement, even if he never did anything else, to use a famous phrase, all is changed changed utterly. We can never go back to the position before the Taoiseach's undertaking in this regard and the undertaking that Senator Dooge will carry out, as far as he is responsible, changes which will be necessary in order to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> I presume that on another occasion we will have a full debate on the question of constitutional change.  I welcome the recent undertakings given about much of our legislation.  As regards neutrality, this is something with which I have been concerned for a long time, going back to the time of debates with Mr. Declan Costello and Mr. Liddel Hart on the idea of NATO.  I do not know how many years ago that was.  With people like ex-Deputy McQuillan we worked hard to try to preserve the country from any kind of military involvement which could lead to this country being used as a base for either side in any possible war.</P>
    <P>The Order Paper over the years has been littered with questions which I put down to successive Foreign Ministers both in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael trying to see whether they had departed from the public protestations that they were maintaining a neutral position in our society.  It has been difficult.  I have had serious suspicions about the Taoiseach's commitment to neutrality.  He is on record as having dismissed the possibility of neutrality.  This is very frightening.  His one time membership of the trilateral commission also creates suspicion that he would be pro-American and likely to favour some kind of move away from totally detached neutrality between the Western and Eastern powers.  I hope the Taoiseach will deal with this point in his conclusion and reassure us on the question of neutrality.  Senator Dooge made a number of statements, which were reassuring, on his approach to the idea of neutrality.  Rightly or wrongly I tend to hope he is serious in his commitment to non-involvement in the great debate between East and West.</P>
    <P>It does not seem that there has been a sufficiently substantial change in the approach of the Government, stemming from their involvement in the EEC.  I was one of the people who strongly opposed full membership of the EEC.  Although the Treaty of Rome did not mention any defence commitment there was an understanding that there might be some kind of gradual change in that rigid attitude towards neutrality.  Although I have had repeated reassurances from Deputy <Col N="157" /> Lenihan and others occupying that Ministry I have never felt completely happy that we were not in danger of losing our neutral position.  There was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 December 1980 which sums up very well why it is hard for us to be unduly moved by Deputy Lenihan's personal protestations of commitment to complete and genuine neutrality. In an article headed &ldquo;Haughey May Plan UK Defence Deal&rdquo; it is stated that:</P>
    <P>It is known that the Taoiseach has discussed the possibility of including defence in the Dublin-London package with his closest advisers.</P>
    <P>This was not controversial as far as I know.  Later in the article, which was written by Denis Kennedy, it states:</P>
    <P>Ireland's position on European defence was restated in the Dáil last week by Mr. Lenihan, using a formula that goes back to Dr. Hillery at the time of Ireland's accession to the EEC, and beyond that to Mr. Lemass.  This is that in the event of European unity Ireland as a part of that united Europe would be prepared to participate in the defence if required.</P>
    <P>I have heard that statement made by successive Taoiseachs and Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  That is probably a realistic assessment of the present situation. I am sorry about that.  I would prefer if we were to make a serious contribution to draw the attention of the two great powers to the awful horror of nuclear war which is nuclear annihilation and refuse to go along with and join the great pressures which I have no doubt were on this Government and on the Fianna Fáil one to enter some kind of alliance or to part company with our strictly neutral position. The kind of double talk&mdash;politically committed to the West but militarily no involvement with the West, cannot win any kind of credibility in Europe.  There is something cowardly about it.  If one believes in a cause one should take up one or other position.  Happily, as Independent Deputies we find ourselves in a position of extraordinary power in this Dáil.  We can exercise that power in one <Col N="158" /> of three ways.  We can vote with the Opposition, we can vote with the Government or we can abstain.  There will be occasions when the Taoiseach will be praying that we will abstain rather than to vote either way because by abstaining we can determine the life or the death of the Government.</P>
    <P>Equally there is this position of the non-aligned countries.  There are now more than 100 of them and that would appear to be a much more honest stance to take.  There is no defence in nuclear war.  The Soviets know that and the Americans know it, except that the Americans have the idea that there could be a pre-emptive strike, that we could take out Shannon, Dublin and Belfast and that would teach the Soviets not to take out Boston, New York or Washington. There is that dreadful possibility in a possible nuclear war.  We have the famous phrase of the American General who said that his country fought World War I in Europe, that they fought World War II in Europe and that, please God, they would fight World War III in Europe.  They are far enough away for that to be a credible approach.  Their generals are hard-headed people.  There is the possibility of the third position, that is the position of the non-aligned countries. Then there would be no power and the only sanction would be the disapproval of the dreadful prospects of the wanton waste of billions in terms of armaments by both sides.</P>
    <P>For the first time in my life perhaps, or it may be for the second time, I speak as a Deputy who has a certain amount of power.  Should we make serious attempts to desert out neutral position and go into NATO?  That will be one issue on which I shall have no hesitation in voting against the Government and in doing all in my power to bring them down.  In the meantime I intend to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have sat through part of a show which undoubtedly will be a feature of this Dáil, that is, the struggle between the seats and the consciences and, as always, the seats are winning.  I am sure that that will continue to be the position for some time.  This situation <Col N="159" /> does not surprise me so far as some of the Members are concerned in Fine Gael Mark II along the centre aisle, but I would have expected better from Deputy Browne.  I am rather disappointed at the manner in which he justifies support for the Government in this and in other matters. He says he has three alternatives &mdash; to vote with the Opposition, to vote with the Government or to abstain.  However, he has a fourth option and it is one that I would have expected to appeal to him and to every other socialist or person with a fairly public conscience, that is, he can make up his mind on the individual merits of every question coming before the House and vote accordingly or abstain, as the case may be.  But the position which appears to have been taken up by what I can only refer to collectively as Fine Gael, Mark II, is that as of now they are with the Government but with the utterances of some vague warnings that, if there is any attempt to join NATO or to bring in another budget like the last one, these Members will have to change their stance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that such an attitude does not display the degree of independence one might have hoped for from some quarters over there.  It is noticeable that throughout this debate there has been no personal criticism of Senator Dooge.  We had, of course, the burlesque interlude of Deputy Desmond, in which he fulfilled what I might call the John Kelly role of not abusing anybody and of not engaging in any personal criticism. As each of the speakers on this side of the House has made clear, we have no criticism to offer so far as Senator Dooge as an individual is concerned.  There is no question of his personal qualities being under examination, but there is a fundamental question of principle involved in his proposed appointment.  Nobody on this side of the House has suggested that the Constitution is being breached in the letter by this proposal.  Indeed the Taoiseach could go further and appoint a second such non-elected person to the Cabinet without there being any question of the Constitution being breached.  But there is a big difference between observing <Col N="160" /> the letter of the Constitution and observing the spirit of it.  I submit that the spirit of the Constitution is not being observed in this case.  The Constitution contains provisions for this sort of appointment in circumstances in which there is no other suitable appointee to a particular post; but, as has been demonstrated amply, that is not the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>A Constitution contains this right of bringing in non-elected people and it does so for the reason that the whole underlying basis of our Constitution is representative and responsible parliamentary democracy and that those who exercise power are answerable here on a daily or weekly basis to the other elected representatives of the people.  There are other constitutions which do not have any such requirements.  They approach the whole matter of Cabinet and Government in a totally different way.  There are some Constitutions which require an elected representative to resign his seat in the parliament on taking up office in the Government of the country.  That, for example, is the position in France where if somebody was a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate and was appointed to the Cabinet he would have to resign.  It is quite the opposite here, and we have chosen for better or for worse the system of answerability based on the British system of parliamentary democracy and until such time as the Constitution is changed to bring about the American, French or some other system we have to operate our own system. I suggest that we have to operate it not just in the letter but also in the spirit.</P>
    <P>One has to look at this proposed appointment of Senator Dooge and the non-appointment of a large number of Members of this House in the Fine Gael Party who obviously are quite suitable for the position, in the context of another appointment that has been alluded to in passing already here today but has not been dealt with in any detail.  That is the appointment of Mr. Alexis FitzGerald to a post described as Advisor to the Cabinet which in effect, as far as one can gather from what the Taoiseach has said, is virtually a ministerial post in all but <Col N="161" /> name with all the perks and advantages, and with all the resources of the public service at his disposal&mdash;because of the nature of the post perhaps with far more resources from the public service at his disposal than would be the case with an ordinary Minister who normally has his own Department only available to him or, by arrangement through some other Minister, advice or help from another Department.  Here apparently the entire resources of the public service are available to Mr. FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>In saying that there is something sinister about the combination of these two appointments in the same Government at the same time, neither of them being answerable, I want to make it clear that there is nothing sinister about either of the individuals.  If two un-elected, non-responsible people have to be appointed to major positions of power within the Cabinet, I would be happier to see the two who are there rather than almost anybody else because I am confident that neither of them would abuse that situation. Therefore, I am in no way critical of either of them personally, but I am very critical of the principle that two extremely important political posts, not public service posts, are held by two people who are not Members of this House, who are not answerable to this electorate.  If we want a presidential system whereby everyone stands or falls with the Leader&mdash;the Taoiseach in this country or the President in the US&mdash;we can adopt it.  We are told that we are in the middle of a debate about constitutional reform and perhaps that is one of the aspects that might well be looked at if we have to have this debate, but until such time as we adopt it we are not free to operate a presidential system of Government in this country under our present Constitution, and to appoint two people at the same time to political positions of considerable power and influence is not in keeping with the spirit of the Constitution of 1937 or any similar Constitution founded on parliamentary democracy of the kind that originally was developed at Westminster.  That is not to criticise in any personal way the individuals concerned, <Col N="162" /> but it is very much to criticise what has been done.  There is something sinister about it.  Perhaps the real decision makers in the present administration are not men who sit in those benches there and answer the elected representatives of the people and account to the elected representatives of the people for decisions which they make or the policies which they implement.  They may say that they are doing it by having Ministers of State here or something of that kind.  I can say from my own experience in Government, which is not inconsiderable, that that is a very poor substitute indeed and does not fulfil the spirit of a constitutional requirement of answerability.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go in any detail at all into what has happened on the foreign affairs scene over the past three-and-a-half months because I think Deputy Lenihan has dealt quite adequately with that.  It leaves one somewhat disturbed at what has been happening but one might say charitably that since there was a Minister for Foreign Affairs and what was described as a Minister-designate for Foreign Affairs&mdash;although neither the Constitution nor the law recognises such office &mdash;the two of them were seeking to operate at the same time and obviously doing so to some cross-purposes.  Since we are on the whole question of foreign affairs it is no harm to make the observation that some of the things that happened over the last three-and-a-half months will not, it is hoped, happen in the future whether Senator Dooge is appointed by this House or not.</P>
    <P>I have had reason to experience at first hand the embarrassment caused by the present holder of the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs outside this country in the not too distant past, but I suppose it is part of the price that the country pays for having a man who, in so far as he thinks at all, tends to think on his feet. Whatever may have happened abroad, it was crowned to some extent by the incident which happened in the Seanad last Friday which Deputy Haughey referred to as this latest gimmick in terms of foreign affairs, free drinks for our brethren from the North.  I have not been able to get the Official Report of the Seanad of <Col N="163" /> last Friday because it is not yet out and I am relying on <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Saturday which I assume is accurate.  It says, referring to the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and Minister for Foreign Affairs as he is currently, that he announced four incentives to encourage Northerners to come here as a gesture of friendship.  He stressed that they were not being introduced to boost the tourist industry, therefore this announcement was clearly made in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and not in his capacity as Minister for Tourism.  He said that Bord Fáilte would be introducing free accommodation vouchers of limited value based on a minimum stay in approved accommodation as a token towards the cost of their stay.  It was a gesture of welcome "which might cover their first meal or their first round of drinks".  All I can say in relation to that is that if it is tourism policy it is no wonder that Mr. Joe Malone felt it incumbent on him to resign.  If it is Northern Ireland policy, if this is foreign affairs, did that marvellous thing emanate from Iveagh House or Kildare Street, or where did it come from?  It is pretty embarrassing, to put it mildly, and the reaction in Northern Ireland to such trivial nonsense from a Minister of this or any Irish Government is one of total derision, as well it might be.  We are given to believe that the Government have approved the package in principle but administrative details have yet to be worked out.  I can only make the suggestion that if, as a result of his support from Fine Gael Mark II, Senator Dooge is appointed to be Minister for Foreign Affairs, the first action he might take is to stop the administration of this harebrained and rather childish scheme being worked out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan made it clear here this afternoon that, however far he went, Senator Dooge certainly went further than any previous Minister for Foreign Affairs in formalising this, up to now, informal contact which apparently takes place at a political level on the periphery of the EEC.  At least it was on the periphery; we are now given to believe by various commentators that we have gone a <Col N="164" /> further stage in this regard.  That is why I was interested in hearing what the socialists in the House might have had to say on this proposed appointment because I thought it was one of the matters they would have honed in on.  Happily for those who have spoken so far, in the struggle between their seats and their consciences, their seats have prevailed. It is very difficult to listen without a feeling of nausea to the hypocrisy that is involved in somebody like Deputy Higgins discussing his idea of neutrality.  The one area of conflict in the world today which was brought out by him was this unfortunate country, El Salvador, in central America.  Many of the arguments and emotions that we read daily have been rehashed.  It is difficult to believe, listening to this debate, that a country like Afghanistan exists in the situation in which it finds itself today, a free, independent people, interfering with nobody outside their borders, now crushed by the occupation of several hundred thousand armed soldiers of the Soviet army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is typical, unfortunately, that while great concern is expressed about the situation in El Salvador today, Kampuchea is never mentioned by those who seek to promote neutrality and our holding a middle ground between the two power blocs. That fact that most unhappy country, Kampuchea, has been rent apart by wars over the past ten or 15 years and is today occupied by the surrogates of the Russians as an occupying power and that they have no say in their own affairs seems to matter very little in spite of the deaths of tens of thousands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today it is fashionable to cry about E1 Salvador.  A couple of years ago it was Nicaragua, but one side prevailed in Nicaragua so there is no longer a problem there.  American arms or money are not welcome there although help from other areas is readily accepted.  How is it that we who profess to be neutral seem to worry only about the excesses that allegedly <Col N="165" /> occur on one side only?  We hear nothing of Kampuchea today but when the Americans were allegedly bombing it in the course of the Vietnamese war, we heard a great deal about it.</P>
    <P>If people can bring themselves to vote in support of this motion, given the whole general background to it, equally they are in a position to make their consciences accommodate a fairly selective view of the situation as it exists worldwide at present.</P>

      <P>Normally people from the west would not be here expressing views on the appointments of Ministers or concerned about appointments which we are being asked to vote on today.  In the very sensitive area of foreign affairs.  I am prompted to make a few remarks concerning this proposed appointment.  It is generally thought by people in the west that politicians should run political affairs.  In that sense, great disappointment has been expressed in the west, not only as far as this appointment is concerned, but also at the way in which representatives from the west have been debarred from any say as far as Cabinet procedures are concerned.  This, of course, is not an unusual practice as far as the Coalition Government are concerned. In the past, this kind of treatment was perpetrated against the people in the west and I suppose there will be a continuation of that policy in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>From a political point of view it is to our advantage because it maintains and stabilises support for the majority party, Fianna Fáil.  As soon as the electorate get a suitable opportunity of removing this Government from office there will be a return to happier times for the electorate of the various constituencies along the west coast.  By tradition, we have always had under successive Fianna Fáil Governments a fair representation of Cabinet Ministers and junior Ministers and other portfolios and responsibilities.  This practice is always brutally put aside when the Coalition are in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has caused great distress to the people of the west that they no longer have a voice in the corridors of power, <Col N="166" /> who could provide the necessary developments and infrastructures to keep the west in a position where it could gain from Government action.  We now have increased unemployment, due to lack of Government action, and the Government's only concern as far as the west is concerned, is to do all in their power to deny us the necessary infrastructural developments which were agreed and approved by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  We are satisfied that when the present administration is finally put out of its misery we will return to a situation of continued development and growth for the people of the west.</P>
    <P>The Government took this stand to deny us our proper representation at the Cabinet table because they are short on policies which would bring about the necessary development for a guaranteed future in the west.  The most recent outbursts of some junior Ministers and others is just a further indication of the non-caring attitude of the present administration for all things west of the Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is purely a smokescreen to divert attention from economic matters which should be the concern of the administration at present.  We have galloping inflation, lengthy unemployment queues and other distressing elements in the community.  That is why a smokescreen will be put up now and then to divert attention from what the Government should really be concerned about.  However, we in the west of Ireland have a way of dealing with that kind of thing.  As soon as the relevant opportunity comes along, we will give the usual answer to the Coalition by way of removing still further their representatives, if they should have any at that time in the west of Ireland.  Of course, we should also be concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that one reason for <Col N="167" /> these smokescreens being put up on a regular basis by the Coalition Government is in an effort to divert attention from the tax gaffe of the Tánaiste and other matters of like nature.  This only leads people, particularly in the west of Ireland, to recognise that if this Government have any useful ideas for dealing with any of our problems, be they social or economic at this time, this operation which we are asked to participate in this evening of voting a certain gentleman into an office to which he has not been elected is just another way of downgrading the people selected, and subsequently elected, by the electorate of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Parties go before the electorate at election time and offer a full range of candidates with all the various skills and educational backgrounds which would surely suggest that they were offering our people a worthwhile political party, endowed with the necessary qualifications and expertise to run a government on their behalf.  Surely it is a backhand slap to say that they can elect whom they like at the polls from the people put forward, but once elected, the Taoiseach reserves the right to place people in positions of responsibility for reasons best known to himself, taking no cognisance of the wishes of the electorate in the various constituencies.  That, by and large, is the essential element which must be considered here this evening when people are asked to cast their votes one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates went forward, some eminent, some with long traditions in politics, others with a long list of credentials, from all walks of life, from all areas of the country and from all social backgrounds. We were promising the electorate that we could do, on their behalf, anything necessary by way of running the country.  Consequently, certain people were elected and now, in the heel of the hunt, it has been decided that some of the people elected had not the competence, ingenuity, skills or expertise necessary to do the job for which they were elected.  Surely this is not a way in which we would like to continue in dealing with the Irish electorate.  The question must <Col N="168" /> be raised, not just in Ireland but abroad, that people are being elected to Dáil Éireann, getting their salaries and are not competent to deal with the matters for which they are asked to be responsible.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt at all that the good Professor Dooge is an eminent person, highly qualified in his own right, an honest, skilful man and, from perusal of some of his statements to date he appears as well to be a sincere man.  However, sincerity has scarcely anything to do with the issue which we are discussing here.  If we were being really sincere, we would tell the Irish electorate that from the group of persons whom they chose to elect we would find suitable persons to run the administration on their behalf and would offer ourselves at the next general election and have our track record put to the test.  How can you put a track record to the test when the person being put forward has never gone before the electorate to get permission to represent them in this House or, indeed, in the Seanad?</P>
    <P>I never could understand the practice of bringing people forward from outside to take over responsibilities.  Certainly, as I understand it, the constitutional right exists for a Taoiseach to undertake this type of action, but surely he must understand that this action has caused great concern to the ordinary people of Ireland.  He is placing in the hands of an individual, whom the electorate do not know and of whom they have no experience, and no way of challenging in discussion, probably one of the highest offices in the land, that of Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Perhaps, if the office were one concerned with activities within the State I could understand it, but when one is expected to represent the views, aspirations and ideals of our people in foreign parts as well as on home ground, our suspicions must be further deepened. There are certain areas of activity in which the Professor has already taken stands which are causing considerable concern, not just to Irish nationals at home but to Irish people throughout the world.  I refer, in particular, to the question of Irish neutrality which is one of the basic and fundamental issues which concern <Col N="169" /> our people.  The tradition has grown up and it has come to be accepted by one and all that our position of neutrality must be clearly stated at all times and that in no way has anybody been given the right, nor has anybody asked for the right, to change that attitude and to promote another.</P>
    <P>We do not know what precisely the good professor is about as far as Irish neutrality is concerned.  When one considers that he is also concerning himself with nuclear disarmament talks, one begins to get the idea that the good professor is having very deep discussions indeed with all kinds of people about traditional stands taken by Ireland.  Perhaps he is about to lead us astray, or down an avenue which we do not want to traverse.  As I understand it, all other members of the EEC are members of NATO and, of course, have an interest in armaments and military matters, which, by and large, are no concern of ours.  The Minister-designate has been having very detailed discussions concerning disarmament and the possible location of certain kinds of military equipment in certain areas of the European Community territory.  This is a most alarming situation.  It brings home to the people that, perhaps in some dark corner or at some caucus meeting attached to these discussions, the good professor might be suggesting that Ireland might, at some future date, be a suitable location for these silos which carry death in their waters.  The good professor should be coming in here to tell us about what he is doing.</P>

      <P>The one advantage in having a Chamber like this and of having the Taoiseach present is that one can meet <Col N="170" /> him face to face, look him straight in the eye and tease out with him what he might be about.  That is no indication, however, of what he might be about when he leaves the Chamber.  The good professor has this advantage over the rest of us here. He does not have to come under public scrutiny.  Obviously he has the confidence of the Taoiseach.  The people feel the Taoiseach had the right idea at the start but he has gone astray and lost the ordinary people, not only because he did not recognise there was any talent west of the Shannon but because he could not find any talent east of the Shannon to provide a suitable applicant for this job.</P>
      <P>Ireland's stand on disarmament should be totally different from that taken by other EEC countries.  In the past we were very vocal about the proposed nuclear free zones in Europe and we were very concerned about the promotion of the non-proliferation treaty.  Because the Senator will be involved in these discussions in future, there is the possibility that we will lack the credibility we had in the recent past.  This will lead to a lessening of our credibility in the international area and will bring about a lessening of the tradition that Ireland is a netural country.  In my view this is not the right way for this Administration to move and I do not think that giving this kind of responsibility to a person such as Senator Dooge, who will not be responsible to the electorate, is the action of an administration who care for the electorate or who have the best interests of the country at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neutrality is the subject which concerns me most.  It is time somebody on behalf of Senator Dooge told us, in unambiguous terms, that the question of neutrality is not an issue at this time, that it is not being discussed with any third party, and that at no time in the future will Senator Dooge be given freedom by the Cabinet to deal with or discuss the changing of our neutral position in any other forum.  While the good Senator might be a sincere man wishing to do the right thing, there are no constraints on him.  He does not have to answer to the electorate, nor does he have to answer to the Members of this House for any action <Col N="171" /> he might take on a day-to-day basis, despite the fact that because of its international aspects this portfolio is involved in making known our position on a whole range of topics in many different fora throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Senator is an eminent person and no doubt would be suitable if he had taken the opportunity afforded him to seek a nomination and subsequent election to this House.  It is not over-stating the case to reiterate what the former Taoiseach said this afternoon &mdash; that there is available a suitable opportunity to the Senator and the Fine Gael Party which would afford them the opportunity of not only putting Senator Dooge before the electorate but also of placing the Government's policies, international and national, on the line before the electorate in the immediate future, that is if they have the courage to move the writ for the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.  If they do not have that courage we will move it for them tomorrow.  I have no doubt but that they have done a deal with the Independents to get the Senator elected to the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I am not as convinced that they will have extended that scheme to cover voting down the writ tomorrow.  However, that is another day's work and we look forward to seeing how the Independents will vote.  Will it be possible to dream up another set of circumstances so that they will not have to meet the electorate and put this gentleman, as well as their policies, national and international, social or economic, before the electorate of Cavan-Monaghan?</P>
    <P>We have no fear of going before the people of Cavan-Monaghan.  We have a very suitable candidate and are prepared to place the good Jim Leonard in political combat with Senator Dooge.  If he is as sincere, as well qualified and suitable for the job as the Government parties suggest, the people of Cavan-Monaghan will recognise those fine qualities of Ministerial ability and will give him their endorsement by way of an electoral win.  If that is the case I will be the first to congratulate the Senator on his election and on <Col N="172" /> being given the portfolio for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The word is out that the white feather is about to be shown.  For the first time in many moons a political party will be running away from a test on a national scale that must be taken in the not too distant future.  When it is suggested that the Coalition are not prepared to move the writ because they have a very big legislative programme in front of them and they must get on with the job, then I can only say that whatever programme they have they should get on with it very quickly.  It is our intention to see that programme will not be put through because we will have them out of office before very long.  If we have a general election the people will say what they think of the Coalition's policies, their record and the disastrous situation they created for ordinary people who have plummeted to the depths of near despair.</P>
    <P>The Coalition should take their courage in their hands, do the decent thing tomorrow and allow the writ to be moved so that we can go to Cavan-Monaghan and thrash out the economic and social issues that are so pressing on ordinary individuals.  Senator Dooge, as the most suitable and eligible person the Taoiseach could find to fill this portfolio of Foreign Affairs, could leads the campaign. We would then find out what the people thought of the Taoiseach and his proposal to fill this senior responsible job.  We could hear Senator Dooge express in unambiguous terms what he proposes to do if and when he is elected. This would be a very enlightening exercise, not only for the people of Cavan-Monaghan but for the country at large. We would hear the Senator express his opinion on such matters as neutrality, disarmament and on other matters relating to Foreign Affairs.  That is the kind of action we would like to see the Taoiseach and this Cabinet take.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is as convinced as he said that Senator Dooge is the most suitable person to hold this portfolio and that the policies he is following are the right ones, here is a suitable opportunity for him to put them to the test.  That is <Col N="173" /> the only way to get the views of the electorate.  The opportunity will be offered to the Coalition tomorrow to let the people vote on it.  Showing the white feather at this time in Irish polities is not what was expected of the Taoiseach when he took office.  I expect that he will reconsider his position.  Seeing that he has not found a formula whereby he can buy the votes of the Independents for tomorrow's test, perhaps he will change his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That having regard to the deeply serious social and economic repercussions for the West of Ireland which would follow the close of the Tuam sugar factory, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain sugar beet processing operations and ancillary activities in Tuam and in particular to promote actively beet growing in neighbouring farming areas in order to ensure adequate future supplies for the sugar factory.</P>
      <P>I wish to say at the outset that the amendment which has been put down to the motion by the Minister is disappointing because we had hoped that this debate would lead to his considering further the overall question.  The amendment proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann endorses the Government's decision that Exchequer resources be provided for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. to enable it to continue sugar production at Tuam for the 1982/83 beet campaign and that absolute priority would be given to securing new industry in the Tuam area with a view to providing alternative employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies concerned with this area on all <Col N="174" /> sides will see the futility of that amendment and will, I feel, support our motion.</P>
    <P>I propose to refer to five different aspects of this matter, namely, the social and economic repercussions, the steps the Government should take to maintain beet processing operations and ancillary activities in Tuam, the promotion of beet growing, the workers' contribution to this exercise and, finally, the handling of the situation by the Minister and the Government. Anybody who knows this area realises the dire social and economic implications if this closure goes ahead. There are 2,200 people unemployed there and the closure of the Sugar Company operations would add substantially to that figure.</P>
    <P>The sugar factory was set up in Tuam not solely to make profit but to promote regional development and employment in the west, which is recognised even by the EEC as an under-developed region. The late Seán Lemass said that in no way is sugar beet an economic proposition if we look at it purely from an accountancy point of view but there are other points of view besides that of an accountant.  He said that by giving a measure of protection necessary to put the beet industry into existence employment would be provided. It was never intended to be fully economic and there were very important social implications.  The unemployment figures in this area are already very serious.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the figures given by the Government and the Sugar Company regarding the cost of this closure have been refuted by a number of people.  The net saving would be roughly £1.8 million but the net loss to the Exchequer by this closure would be of the order of £2.4 million.  Instead of saving money the cost of the closure would be of the order of £585,000.  The Government cannot have considered their decision carefully enough.  As well as the 263 permanent jobs which would be lost there are also 220 temporary, part-time jobs, giving a total of 483 jobs.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account the other operations of the Sugar Company in Tuam and it is very doubtful it any of them can survive.  The engineering works <Col N="175" /> employing 73 people would be likely to close, as would the turf-cutting operations of the Sugar Company in that area. The value of these jobs, together with the value of the beet crop to growers in the area, is enormous.  The economic repercussions cannot be quantified in money terms.  The livelihood of small farmers in the area who grow beet is dependent on the part-time work they obtain in the factory and no replacement industry can have the same impact.  The very existence of these small farmers is in question because of this decision and the Government must reconsider.</P>
    <P>The Tuam factory does not affect only those who work inside it; it affects the entire community in the province.  Many facilities there will be affected by the closure of the factory.  There will be repercussions on the rail services and for other businesses.  I do not believe that these factors have been considered by the Minister and the Government.  They must take steps to maintain the beet processing operations and other ancillary activities in Tuam.</P>
    <P>I understand from a statement by the Minister that the viability of the entire Sugar Company operation is to be examined by a team of consultants because his Department have not sufficient personnel to examine the proposals made by the Sugar Company.  Having spent some time in the Department I doubt very much that the necessary personnel are not available because there are many well qualified people in there who could give an opinion on any proposal from the Sugar Company.  If the Government have decided &mdash; according to the statements issued they have &mdash; that the consultants will examine the future viability of the Sugar Company's operations then they should, and must, include the Tuam operation.  They also should consider, if they have not already done so, the proposals &mdash; I do not have them to hand, but I am sure the Government do &mdash; from the Sugar Company regarding a subsidy towards the maintenance of the Tuam operation.  Have the Government considered those proposals?  If not, why not?  If the Government have considered those <Col N="176" /> proposals on what grounds did they reach the decision announced recently?  Has the Minister considered, as I submitted in December last, submitting proposals to the EEC for financial assistance for the Sugar Company operation?  Has the Minister considered re-submitting those proposals which would enable the Sugar Company to obtain finance from EEC sources?  The Minister is aware that there are many projects in Italy and French overseas countries being financed by the EEC.  Why did the Minister not put such a case to the EEC?</P>
    <P>I understand that although there are other discussions in progress in the EEC with regard to the overall finances of the agricultural part of the budget, there are, for various reasons, a number of savings in this year's budget.  Would the Minister, even at this late stage, consider, because of the availability of some resources in this year's budget, asking the EEC for assistance?  Would the Minister be prepared to put forward some ideas for their consideration with a view to maintaining the Tuam factory?  I should like to ask the Government to use the Minister of State they appointed for western development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know where he is at present but I am aware that while this controversy has gone on for a number of months the Minister of State for western development has not, as yet, to my knowledge, made any statement regarding the Tuam closure.  God knows I pity him if he has to be tagged as Minister of State for western development in a Government that in its first weeks in office closes one of the main agricultural developments in the west of Ireland, the Tuam factory.  The Government must examine all these possibilities to ensure that the operations of the Sugar Company are continued in the Tuam area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put forward ideas regarding the promotion of the grow-more-beet campaign in western counties. Arising from the decision taken by the Government, with a number of Deputies from Connacht I met the BGA and the <Col N="177" /> workers action committee which represents all sections of the community in the Tuam area.  Both organisations undertook, and gave a solid commitment, to promote the growing of beet in the western counties. The Government must use whatever resources are at their disposal, particularly ACOT, if they are to succeed.  The BGA, who are representative of the farmers of the area, are very anxious to support a grow-more-beet campaign in the area but, naturally, such a body, and rightly so, would need a commitment from the Government to continue the operations of the factory in Tuam.  They also need a recognition from the Government of the difficulties of growing beet in that area, at the same time recognising that tillage and sheep producing in Connacht are the most attractive projects for small farmers there.  Everybody now realises that dairying and beef enterprises are becoming more costly and that the option for many small farmers, particularly in the west of Ireland, is more tillage and sheep production.</P>
    <P>The BGA and the workers action committee in the discussions we had with them, and the action they have taken since, have shown that they have a tremendous commitment to helping in whatever way possible to promote the grow-more-beet campaign.  I shall quote from a document issued by the workers' action committee later about the contribution the workers are prepared to make in relation to this matter.  The Minister, and the Government, should recognise the commitment and dedication there is there to the maintenance of the operations of the Sugar Company in Tuam. The meeting I had with the various groups in Tuam, resulted in the preparation of certain proposals.  I do not propose to delay the proceedings tonight by reading them all but I want to refer to some to give an idea of the contribution they can make towards the viability of the Tuam operation.  The first proposals is to increase the acreage growth west of the Shannon to between 8,000 and 10,000 acres over a three-year period and to maintain the acreage growth east of the Shannon at the existing level of 3,000 to 5,000 acres.  The present machinery <Col N="178" /> development policy within the Sugar Company is to develop beet harvesters with an in-built facility to make silage from beet tops.  Every grower who grows an acre of beet has not alone a valuable cash crop &mdash; the crop with the highest gross margin per acre consistently proven in the Agriculture Institute's Farm Management Survey year after year &mdash; but is also providing by way of beet tops the equivalent of an acre of the best grass silage in terms of quantity and quality. With machinery developed to efficiently ensile these beet tops with such a value what farmer in the west of Ireland would not be anxious to grow sugar beet where his land was suitable?  That is a suggestion that should be seriously considered by the Sugar Company and the Minister.</P>
    <P>ACOT, in the annual report of their County Galway Committee stated, when referring to the increased 1,000 acres of beet grown in the area over 1980 to 1981 stated:</P>
    <P>We believe that we could grow another 5,000 acres of sugar beet without having an adverse effect on livestock production.  In reality this has been proven true in other countries where beef and dairy production increased with an increase in beet acreage.  This came about because of the extra income generated by the beet, the improved fertility of the land and the increase in the available winter feed for stock.</P>
    <P>A Government agency such as ACOT putting forward such a proposal or suggestion at this time proves the potential for that area with an increased acreage of beet.  It is also important to recall that the other three factory areas, Thurles, Mallow and Carlow, will not be capable of growing enough sugar beet in the immediate future to meet our EEC sugar quota of 182,000 tonnes.  We need all the sugar beet that can be procured in the Tuam area to do this and we need the sugar factory in Tuam to process it.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years we fought hard enough to maintain our sugar quota and we succeeded in doing that. However, we will not reach this quota this year and we will continue to come <Col N="179" /> under pressure from the EEC if we do not do that.  I do not think the way to go about it is to close down one of the operations, as has been suggested by the Government. Another suggestion made by the workers and farming organisations is that a capital investment of £500,000 in sugar extraction equipment would result in an annual saving of £200,000 in respect of the area by increasing the amount of sugar extracted from the beet by 0.3 per cent.  The work force also agrees to a reduction of numbers on the sugar staff of up to 50 people over a period of three to five years by natural wastage, early retirement and other schemes agreed with the unions.  This would give a saving of £350,000 per annum at 1981 prices. The workers also agreed to co-operate with any schemes such as cost reduction, internal mobility of labour etc. which may be required to reduce costs or facilitate growers or customers.  The hours of work are at present being altered by a section of the staff to achieve better services for growers and customers.  The effect of these suggestions and proposals by the workers will result in the following cost saving to the Sugar Company in Tuam: the increase in the acreage envisaged over the next three years would reduce the costs by £1.2 million, the capital investment on sugar extraction would give a cost saving of £200,000, and the reduction of staff over the period will give a saving of £350,000.  The net saving to the company per annum would emerge at £1.75 million.  The actual budgeted loss in sugar production and sugar trading would be £1.8 million.  These are the kind of proposals to be examined by the Sugar Company and by the Department.  But, as the Minister has decided, the very least that should be done is that they should be examined by this consultant group that he intends to appoint.  The Government must recognise the response that has come from both the growers and the workers in this area.  Their commitment and dedication and their concern must be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government, in taking the decision they did, may as well have said that they were closing the factory after this <Col N="180" /> beet campaign because, by extending it for one year, all they have done is ensure that there will not even be the acreage of beet in the coming season that there was this year.  That is why it is imperative, as we now move into the beet contract stage by the end of this month, that the Government tell the people in that area that they will examine all these proposals with a more long-term view rather than just saying that at the end of the beet campaign of 1982-83 the factory will close. That is not good enough.  It is a retrograde step to have made such a decision. While I sympathise with the Minister who has to fight the case with the Government, he should make an even stronger case because of the interest that there is in this factory in the Tuam area and in the entire province of Connacht and other areas outside Connacht.  We can show quite clearly that this factory, in so far as it could ever be made viable when it was set up in 1933, can survive.  If one were to make the decisions on economic grounds then one would be able to accept what the Government are trying to do. But that is not why Tuam was ever started.  As I said at the outset it was started on the basis of social considerations and job creation.  God knows, in this day and age of rising unemployment &mdash; and it continues to rise and nobody seems to care &mdash; surely the last thing a Government should contemplate is the closure of such an important facet of survival in the province of Connacht and in the north-west and west of Ireland.  It is ridiculous that the Government would do this at this time.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the Government's handling of the situation and the fact that the Government gave little or no response that we know of to the request by the Sugar Company for a subsidy to maintain the operations in the Tuam area.  I would also like to refer to a statement made by the Minister, Mr. Dukes, when he referred to the Fianna Fáil Government having advance notice of the closure of the Tuam factory from the Sugar Company board.  I have already replied to this outside this House and I want to take this opportunity of doing so here as well.  When in Government, as <Col N="181" /> Minister for Agriculture, I met the Sugar Company board on numerous occasions regarding their overall financial situation. The board put forward their general views and ideas about what could be done.  At no time did the Sugar Company board inform me of a decision by them to close the Tuam sugar factory or that they had requested the IDA to look for alternative industry for the Tuam area. In fact, they told me on numerous occasions in discussions regarding various food operations in Skibbereen and Carlow that the IDA would not get involved in any area where the Sugar Company had operations unless and until the board and the Government had decided finally on the closure.  That is reported in many of the minutes of the Sugar Company and, I am sure, in many of the documents that the Minister felt obliged to quote from regarding reports of various meetings and delegations by the Sugar Company with the Minister and his officials. In fact, in the Seanad debate on 11 March 1981 on the joint committee report I stated in vol. 95, col. 1117:</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to refer to the point made by Senator Connaughton in relation to the Tuam factory and to state quite clearly that there are no proposals before me regarding the closure of the Tuam factory.  Not only does the commercial life of the town benefit greatly from the presence of a sugar company operation but so, too, does the social environment.  Departure of young people to the major cities is greatly stemmed as service industries also grow up in the town, creating employment in all walks of life.</P>
    <P>One can see by that as late as March this year there were no proposals before me, and it was stated quite clearly by me as Minister for Agriculture in March of this year in the Seanad debate.  That was in reply to a debate on the joint committee report which did have as one of its suggestions the closure of Tuam.</P>
    <P>In September 1980, arising from a request for Government finances, I asked the Sugar Company to prepare a comprehensive plan of their future operations to restore viability to the company and in <Col N="182" /> the same debate in the Seanad at col. 1123 I said:</P>
    <P>subject to the company coming forward with a suitable programme for restoring full viability the Government will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>I understand that that report arrived in the Department of Agriculture during the general election campaign and no decisions were taken on it by me or the Fianna Fáil Government at that time.  I want to say quite clearly that the Minister has tried to put forward the idea that I or the Fianna Fáil Government had already decided on the closure of the Tuam factory. That is not so; it is totally untrue and the Minister knows it and he should say so here tonight.</P>

      <P>The question of the closure of the Tuam factory and its future has been discussed before either I or the Minister were born.  That is a long time. I may be around a bit longer than the Minister, but it is a long time.  If the Minister wants to dig up various documents and reports of meetings either in the Sugar Company minutes or in relation to various discussions which took place between them and Department officials or various Ministers, he will find on numerous occasions the question of the Tuam factory.  I want to emphasise quite clearly here that at no time did I or the Fianna Fáil Government concur in any way with such a decision by the board.  We could not because the board had not even decided.  The Government I was a part of did not get involved in decisions of semi-States bodies.  The Sugar Company are the people who are entitled <Col N="183" /> to make a decision but they did not make that decision.</P>
      <P>In the minutes of their meeting of 21 May, when they discussed the proposals they put to the Department, the Minister and the Government, they said quite clearly that the targets exclude the continuation of beet processing in Tuam after 1981 and the alternative to the discontinuation of beet processing in Tuam would be for subsidisation by the Government of the social costs involved.  The board were aware of the social commitment they had over the years to the Tuam area.  The minutes go on to say that the matter is more appropriately a decision for the shareholder.  The Minister knows who the shareholders is.</P>
      <P>At a meeting between officials of the Department and representatives of the Sugar Company the secretary of the Department is quoted in the minutes as saying that the company had not decided to close the Tuam factory, as far as he could see.  That was on 8 June 1981.  I am sorry to be labouring those points but it is important because the Minister tried to create the impression that the decision had been taken long before he was even elected to the Dáil.  This is totally untrue. I made it my business to contract a member of the board who was at a number of meetings when I met the board.  I want to read this letter for the benefit of the Minister and for the benefit of the House:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. MacSharry,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your query regarding the closure of the Tuam Sugar Factory. Since I joined the Board in 1978 plans and corporate plans were discussed regularly at meetings, the status of Tuam was inevitably included.  The object of these plans was to provide a basis for the company's request to the Government for an injection of capital. One of these plans was presented to you in September 1980 when you met the Board of CSET.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the Board had not made a decision to close Tuam.  The first time Tuam closure appeared on my Agenda was 9 September 1981 for decision the <Col N="184" /> following day.  The result of that meeting is now well known.</P>
    <P>I believe, judging from the handling of this whole affair, that the Government panicked in regard to the decision they made about the closure of Tuam.  The board of the Sugar Company in good faith put forward their ideas about the future of Tuam.  They said to the Minister that without subsidisation they would not be able to continue.  I understand that the Sugar Company requested the Department and the Minister to give them a reply.  No such reply came until this hurried item on the agenda on 9 September last for consideration on 10 September.  The worst thing of all in the mishandling of this situation was that when it became known that this item was to appear on the agenda for the board meeting of the Sugar Company on 10 September &mdash; Deputies, Senators and the community at large were interested in it and obviously tried to do something about it &mdash; the Minister met Deputy Connaughton and, according to the report furnished at that time by Deputy Connaughton to the community at large in the Tuam area, the Minister had informed the Deputy that the item would not be included on the agenda.  The item appeared on the agenda and the people in the area were completely misled by the Minister and his Deputy.  That confirms my belief that this matter was hurriedly dealt with by the Minister or by his Government and insufficient examination was made of the proposals put forward by the board.  It is an indictment of the Minister and the Government that he did not carefully examine the proposals put forward in the interests of the Tuam operation and in the interests of all the people affected by the Sugar Company operation in Tuam.  The Minister has let the west of Ireland down.</P>
    <P>There have been various suggestions from a Labour element in the Government about various bodies which are to be set up to create employment.  Those sort of statements rings very hollow when one sees the decision made by the Government in relation to Tuam.  This area is very dependent on employment from <Col N="185" /> that factory.  There are many small farmers in that area who cannot survive without the temporary employment they get in the Tuam factory.  All those things must be taken into consideration by the Government or else they are not worthy of the name of a Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should reconsider this matter.  The Minister should tell us tonight that he is prepared to have all the alternatives and all the options examined by him and his Department and ultimately by the Government and that whatever money is required will be given by the Government. Any replacement can never have the same impact as the Tuam operation. The future of Tuam has been talked about over the years &mdash; in fact, during my entire lifetime.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments made sure that no decision was taken to close the Tuam factory.  No Fianna Fáil Government would agree with such a decision.  They would examine all the possibilities and would ensure that this operation continued.  I want to say quite clearly on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that will be in Government in the near future &mdash; let us hope we will be back before the Government have damaged Tuam and the Sugar Company operation beyond repair &mdash; that as far as we are concerned when we get back into Government we will keep the Tuam Sugar factory open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after&ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the Government's decision that Exchequer resources be provided for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. to enable it to continue sugar production at Tuam for the 1982/83 beet campaign and that absolute priority would be given to securing new industry in the Tuam area with a view to providing alternative employment opportunities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common knowledge that the Sugar Company are currently faced with serious financial difficulties which have not risen <Col N="186" /> this year alone but have been building up for some time.  I intend to go over that point in a little more detail.  My concern this evening is to explain the background to the issue now before us, that is, the closure of the company's plant at Tuam. I also want to set the record straight as regards the Government's position about which there has been some misrepresentation and inaccurate comment in recent weeks, and not only in recent weeks but I submit also this evening.</P>
    <P>The total losses of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta for the year ended 30 September 1980 were £11.27 million and the estimated losses for the year to the end of last month are expected to be even higher.  The deterioration in the company's finances, although relatively sudden, were signalled for some time past by falling profits.  For example, a profit of £1 million in 1978-79 must be seen against a total turnover of £126 million.  In the period from 1973 to 1980 there was only one year where the company's profits amounted to a little short of 3 per cent of total turnover.  In no other year did they exceed 1.7 per cent of total turnover. Given the kind of operation involved, the diversity of their activities and the amount of resources involved in the company's operations, a profit level at that point in relation to turnover is obviously a cause for some worry, to say the least, about the financial situation of the company.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why the problems experienced by the company, some of which existed already, should have become more acute in recent times. These include factors common to other sectors of the economy such as steep increase in energy, wage and other production costs, high interest rates and the overall recession in agricultural trade.  I want to make the point that, given the nature of the company's operations, quite a part from sugar production, an overall recession in agricultural trade was bound to have its effects on the company's non-sugar operations also.</P>
    <P>The factors leading to the difficulties also include a number of factors specific to the company, such as the heavy losses incurred by Erin Foods in every year <Col N="187" /> since their establishment, high costs of processing relative to competitors in other EEC member states, the recent Erin Foods irregularities and the industrial dispute last year at Carlow.</P>
    <P>The continued production of sugar at Tuam is a major factor in the company's difficulties.  Many of the long term problems which have affected the company's finances for a period of years are now, in a period of economic recession, seriously aggravating the position by pushing the company into serious losses.</P>
    <P>In August 1980, some months after Deputy MacSharry took over responsibility for the company from the Minister for Finance, who remained a shareholder of the company, the company sent him a memorandum informing him of the serious state of their finances.  This memorandum outlined the company's plans for rationalisation and referred to the need for increased State equity.  The main elements in the rationalisation plans suggested, not decided, were the closure of the Erin Foods plant in Carlow, the withdrawal of the company from the Fastnet Co-Op in Skibbereen and the ceasing of sugar production at Tuam after the current year's campaign.</P>

      <P>In September 1980 the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, met the board of the company to discuss their financial position and their rationalisation plans.  He indicated to them that the whole situation needed careful consideration in the light of the prevailing unemployment problem. He suggested immediate contact with the IDA in order to bring about a timed co-incidence of job replacement in the case of the three factories mentioned for closure together with discussions with the growers and the unions with a view to putting together a package upon which the board's decisions could be made, which could then be put to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In November 1980 the board of the company took the decision to proceed, as part of their rationalisation plans, with the closure of the Carlow Erin Foods Plant and the withdrawal from the Fastnet Co-Operative in Skibbereen after the 1980-81 processing season.  In their public announcement the company undertook to do everything possible in conjuction with the IDA and other State agencies towards securing alternative productive employment for those concerned.  Operations at both centres have since ceased in accordance with the board's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies published their report on the Sugar Company last February. Deputy MacSharry referred to that report a few minutes ago.  This all-party committee recognised the need for the company to regain commercial viability. They appreciated the reasons for the board's decision with regard to the <Col N="190" /> two food plants and recognised also that the closure of the Tuam sugar factory was inevitable.  I quote from the report of the committee:</P>
    <P>The closure of Tuam, when all factors including the need to extend the other factories to make up for the loss of its capacity are taken into account, would result in considerable savings for the company.  The Committee believes that the closure of Tuam is inevitable and that there is a strong case for doing it now rather than later.</P>
    <P>That was the conclusion of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on this matter.</P>
    <P>The company's recently announced decision to close the Tuam sugar factory, therefore, must be seen as an element in their plan for a return to profitability. This plan was communicated both to the former Minister for Agriculture and to the Government of the time and was discussed and accepted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee.</P>

      <P>I have just read the passage from the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  I have also given the House the Deputy's reaction to the Sugar Company in September 1980.  The reasons for the company's decision to close the Tuam factory were based mainly on the size, location and efficiency of the plant.  The factory is situated in an area which, despite the best endeavours of the company and of bodies such as An Foras Talúntais and the Beet and Vegetable Producers' Association has not responded by producing sufficient quantities of beet.  The yield of beet in the western area is low, is some two tons per acre less than that in the Carlow area. The small acreages grown &mdash; which are also a feature of western beet cultivation &mdash; result in higher production costs since optimum use cannot be made of machinery. These factors, along with the more traditional reluctance to engage in tillage have led to a steady decline over the years in sugar beet acreage west of the Shannon. Over the past ten years the acreage <Col N="191" /> grown west of the Shannon declined from 4,800 acres in 1970-71&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Therefore the acreage has changed in the way I have said between 1970-1971 and 1980-81.  The increase in the current season was due largely to the fact that land was being leased.  The Sugar Company have done everything in their power to bring western acreage to a level that would keep the Tuam factory operating at full capacity.  Nothwithstanding the efforts of the company large quantities of beet have had to be transported in recent years to the Tuam factory from as far away as Cork and Wexford, at the company's expense, and indeed at the expense of growers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to refer to the overall situation of the company and this Government's commitment to bringing about its return to financial health.  In May of this year the previous Government received an urgent request from the company for a £75 million capital injection to help them over their financial difficulties.  That request was accompanied by a plan setting out the company's objectives and strategy for the period to September 1983, including a clear indication that the Tuam factory should be closed at the end of the current campaign unless an annual subsidy was provided by the Government towards the costs of their operations. Despite the urgency of the request for a capital injection the company received no response from the Government at the time.  In July the present Government, immediately after taking office &mdash; having been made aware of the extent of the <Col N="192" /> company's problems, decided in principle to make a substantial increase in the State's capital investment in the company, the amount, timing and nature of this capital injection to be decided later as soon as consultants appointed by the Government, in consultation with the company, were appointed to make a fundamental examination of the company's affairs and as soon as they had finalised their report.  These consultants have begun their work and I hope to have their final report to hand early in the New Year.  The Government will then be in a position to decide the methods by which the company can be restored to its position of financial strength.</P>
    <P>Early last month it came to my notice that the company was about to take a formal decision to close the Tuam factory. In accordance with the Government's wishes and because of their concern for the social well-being of the area, I asked the company to defer a decision in order to allow time to enable the possibilities of providing alternative employment to be fully explored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the company say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying and this is a fact.  I asked the company to defer a decision so that we would have time to explore the possibilities of providing alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister merely asked them not to announce it.  That is all he asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting to that if the Deputy will have a little patience.  This request was very much in line with the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, that final closure should await the establishment of an alternative industry.  On learning that the board had actually taken their decision on 10 September I met the Chairman, Managing Director and worker directors of the company and requested that an announcement be deferred so that the possibilities of providing alternative employment could be reviewed before an announcement was made.  The board, for <Col N="193" /> reasons which I understand, felt they could not defer an announcement of their decision.  In view of the effects of the closure on the town of Tuam and its surroundings and in line with their concern to ensure the provision of alternative employment, a concern shared by the Oireachtas Joint Committee, the Government decided to make Exchequer moneys available to enable the company to continue the operation of the Tuam factory for a further year during which time the IDA would give absolute priority to securing new industry in the Tuam area.  I can say now that the IDA have already intensified their promotional efforts to attract new industry to Tuam and propose to build a 24,000 square feet advance factory which will be available in June of next year.  In addition the IDA hope to have completed by December of this year a cluster unit for small industry comprising five 3,000 square feet units.  In addition there are two sites totalling 50 acres available for green field projects in the Tuam area.</P>
      <P>Apart from the decline in beet acreage in the western area the small size of the Tuam factory itself places it in a very difficult position in relation to the other factories.  Its daily throughout of 2,000 tonnes of beet is less than half that of the Carlow factory and less than one-third of the average for factories in the United Kingdom and on the continent of Europe, a comparison which has become very relevant for reasons I shall come to later.  It costs £40 per tonne more to produce sugar in Tuam than in Carlow.  Even operating at full capacity the Tuam factory would be uneconomic by EEC standards and indeed by comparison with the other three factories in this country.  To maintain sugar production at Tuam costs the company, on their estimates submitted to me, £2,500,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the capacity question is concerned &mdash; and it is an important one in this discussion &mdash; the position is that to keep the Tuam factory operating at full capacity throughout a normal campaign we would require the growing of four times more beet than was produced in the region this year, that is, we would require something in the region of 13,000 <Col N="194" /> to 14,000 acres of sugar beet to keep the plant operating at full capacity through a normal campaign.  Even at this throughput the factory would still be uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not suggesting that farmers in the west should not produce beet; they should.  Indeed for some of the reason to which Deputy MacSharry referred himself in relation to the gross margin per acre and the other benefits to be derived from growing sugar beet, it is a very economic and worthwhile crop for farmers who wish to become involved in tillage. The company have given an assurance that they will provide an outlet for all of the sugar beet grown west of the Shannon.  What I am talking about is the broader issue of the economic viability of the Tuam Sugar Factory.  The company have long been aware of the economic problems surrounding the production of sugar at Tuam.  The workers and growers involved cannot have been unaware of them and I am quite sure they were not unaware of them.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee recognised these problems as well as the consequent need to close the factory if the Sugar Company operation is to return to financial health.  The previous Government were well aware of these problems but chose to ignore them. The plain fact is that Comhlacht Siúicre Éireann cannot be expected to run a sugar enterprise successfully or to hold their markets against competitors from other countries if they are forced to maintain in production uneconomic units which are commercially not competitive. In this connection I would point out that economic barriers to trade are not permitted within the European Community. In the context of the common agricultural policy this is important for us, as Deputy MacSharry well knows, since it ensures unrestricted access for our agricultural exports to the large EEC community markets.</P>
    <P>That freedom of trade which is so vital for our main agricultural exports, applies equally to sugar.  Trade is a two-way matter and there has to be free movement in both directions.  This means that there is <Col N="195" /> a limit to the price which the Sugar Company may charge here for sugar &mdash; a limit which is set not by the Government action but by the price at which sugar may be landed in Ireland by sugar manufacturers from other member states of the Community.  In those circumstances there is clear necessity for the company to keep a very close watch on its production costs or suffer the consequences of being unable to compete even on its home market with imported sugar.  The company's margin for manoeuvre has been diminishing sharply in recent years with rapidly rising costs which cannot always be recovered in its sales.  This problem has been particularly acute in terms of the competitive capacity of other EEC sugar producers on our market since 1980.</P>
    <P>It is misleading then for anyone to try to create the impression that the company can continue in the future, as was possible a decade ago, producing sugar at any cost as if its market were completely insulated and protected.  That day is gone and it is time that we all recognised that &mdash; beet growers, factory workers, unions and management.  For my part I shall endeavour at the annual price fixing in Brussels to secure the best possible price for growers and for the Sugar Company when we fix the EEC prices for sugar and sugar beet.  In addition when the production quotas fall due for review in a few years time it will be my aim to ensure that we get the largest quota possible. In this I am in complete agreement with Deputy MacSharry who suggested that if we do not continue to expand sugar production and produce up to our quota we will obviously be in danger of coming under pressure to accept quotas less than our present figure.</P>
    <P>I cannot too strongly emphasise, however, the need for us to produce sugar competitively and efficiently.  We must rid ourselves of any feeling that because the industry is run by a State company costs do not matter.  We should remember that there is a large surplus of sugar in the EEC, up to six million tonnes this year.  Our total sugar requirements <Col N="196" /> amount to only 10 per cent of the surplus sugar produced by France.  Transport from France to Ireland would present few difficulties and so the risk of imports, if we do not get our costs right and are not competitive given the price levels we now have to reach on the market, is a very real one and we could lose market shares.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the company have serious problems. The annual penalty, that is, extra costs incurred annually &mdash; currently £2½ million a year &mdash; of continuing to produce sugar in Tuam is one of the larger problems. Rationalisation is necessary if the company is to survive.  That survival ultimately depends on its ability to compete successfully with competitors in other member states.  That is a factor we cannot lose sight of in this argument because that is what the production business is about. Unless we can market our products competitively then we are not using our resources to the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The company is facing up to its problems and will receive every assistance from the Government in doing so.  I have already indicated that the Government have given their agreement in principle to invest more money in the company. They must be prudent in their approach to this and have regard not only to the cost to taxpayers but also to the provision of jobs with long-term prospects of survival. That is why I engaged a team of consultants to make an independent appraisal of the company's position and prospects.  Deputy MacSharry referred to his belief that within the Department of Agriculture and the Government services generally there are ample staff to do the job.  The problem has nothing to do with the number of staff.  It is quite different.</P>

      <P>The company put forward a plan to rationalise its operations between now and the end of 1983.  I do not consider it is the job of experienced civil servants in the Department of Agriculture or any other Department to sit in judgment on a plan drawn up by the <Col N="197" /> financial experts of a company.

      <P>I will come to the Deputy in a moment.  The consultants have been asked to do their work with all speed and when their report comes to hand I shall not delay in putting forward my recommendation to the Government as to the amount, manner and time of the injection of Exchequer money.</P>
      <P>The decision taken by the company in relation to Tuam was a difficult one even if all of the figures pointed in that direction and if the closure was accepted by the Oireachtas Committee, for whose thorough and painstaking examination of the company's affairs we must all be grateful.  The company must have been well aware of the likely reactions, both genuine and contrived, to its decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time the Government have faced the issue squarely and honestly <Col N="198" /> and because of their social concern they have acted rapidly in deciding to extend their aid further to enable production at Tuam to continue for 1982-83. They have done this despite the many calls on the Exchequer at present.  The breathing space gained by the decision to maintain the factory for another season is valuable in that it affords an opportunity to seek and find alternative industry for the area.  This, I would repeat, is very much in line with the view taken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>I have set out the problems fairly and squarely because I believe that the issue is a vital one for a very important industry. We must be realistic in our approach. The reality of the present situation has been highlighted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee and by the Sugar Company; it was brought to the notice of the last Government by my predecessor.  It will take hard work and the co-operation of all concerned to overcome the problems facing the company.</P>
    <P>While we must act to ensure the necessary conditions for the future development of the company, we must have regard to the pressing interests of those people now employed in the Tuam factory. It is on the basis of that concern that the Government have decided to make the necessary funds available to the company, so that the Tuam factory can continue in operation for a further season. This in turn gives us time to tackle the problem of seeking alternative employment for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry mentioned the question of EEC aid for the company specifically to keep the Tuam factory in operation.  He mentioned the fact that he put proposals to the Community.  Those proposals were not received with any great enthusiasm.</P>

    <P>The Deputy made a point which has been a source of some confusion.  He seemed to be somewhat proud of it and said that Fianna Fáil did not get involved in the decisions of semi-State bodies.

      <P>I wish to support this motion. Though it is in the names of Fianna Fáil Deputies I am confident that it will be accepted by all other Members, including <Col N="201" /> Deputy Sherlock.  We are asking simply that Dáil Eireann requests the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to keep open the sugar factory at Tuam and also the ancillary activities there as well as playing the very important role of promoting sugar beet growing in the neighbouring farming areas.  It was necessary for us to table this motion because of the cruel decision to announce the closure of the factory, a factory which is so vital to the social and economic welfare not only of County Galway but of the west as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the deep concern that has been expressed by people in the west and by the various organisations there &mdash; the farming organisations, the trade union movement and chambers of commerce.  At a special meeting of Galway County Council a call was made for the continuation of operations at the Tuam factory.  One of the more memorable comments was that made by the Archbishop of Tuam, who said that the decision to close the factory was cruel and heartless and showed total indifference for the workers who have worked there for so many years.  It was hoped that a deputation to the Taoiseach might lead to a long-term commitment by the Government to preserve the Tuam factory as part of the overall plan of the Sugar Company, but after three hours of discussions between the Taoiseach and the 26-man delegation we heard that the factory was being given a 12-month reprieve.  The Minister for Agriculture was present also at that meeting.</P>

The people of the west will not accept this decision.  The reprieve that has been granted is merely a stay of execution.  It is only a matter of putting off from today until another day the axing of the Tuam factory or, in other words, to make merely a formality of the closure in a year's time.</P>

      <P>The Government had adequate time in which to make a response. They were notified by various bodies regarding the position of the Tuam factory but they failed to take action. Indeed, it appeared that when the Minister for Agriculture heard about the closure he decided to keep the news a secret for a while.  He asked the board to postpone the decision.  I deplore the manner in which the intention to close the factory was announced.  The matter was to be on the agenda of the board meeting of 10 September.  Then it was supposed to be removed from that agenda but we discovered that all that was postponed was the announcement regarding the closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall hearing Deputy Connaughton on radio giving us one version of what happened while the Minister for Agriculture gave us another version.  On the weekend after the board meeting a headline in the <i>Connaught Tribune</i> read that the Tuam factory closure was averted by the <Col N="203" /> Minister for Agriculture but that the battle was just beginning.  The battle was just beginning but it goes on.  We know now that the closure of the factory was not averted by the Minister.  In the article that followed that heading it was stated that an assurance was given by the Minister to Deputy Connaughton regarding the factory.  I do not know what the Minister said to the Deputy but there was a different account from each of them as to what was said.  However, what is certain is that the local community in Tuam were misled by the blundering and the contradictory statements of these two people. This matter was raised at the deputation to the Taoiseach but no clarification was offered.  Neither did the Minister in his statement throw any light on the matter. I am told that when Mr. Sheehy, the CEO of the Sugar Company met workers in Tuam, he was asked whether the Minister had specifically requested the board to defer a decision and said that at no time was there any special request.  This evening we hear about consultants.  Did the Minister not say that he would be taken aback if the consultants had produced findings different from those of the Government?  Is that not the position?</P>

      <P>The Minister tells us now that a large amount of money is to be invested by the Government in the Sugar Company.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies recommended an immediate injection of £25 million and a long-term additional investment of £40 million.  Now we are told that the Sugar Company have requested £75 million. The question must be asked if taxpayers' money to the tune of £75 million is to be given to this company, and this includes the taxpayers in the west of Ireland.  If this large amount of money is to be given, surely some notice would be taken of Government priorities and this Government must have a priority of creating employment in the west of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that this is not the case.  I am mentioning the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; because it is important to point out that even though the Sugar Company have the day-to-day responsibility of running the company, it is the Government who control the policy.  I have no better authority for that than the present Taoiseach who in 1963 in an article on State-Sponsored Bodies, published by the Institute of Public Administration said that the Minister and the officials of his Department are responsible for preparing the basic policies which guide the operations of these bodies, for securing the approval of the Government for these policies, and for communicating them to the boards of the State-Sponsored Bodies concerned.  They also hold a general watching brief in the public interest and keep an eye on the activities of the bodies for which they are responsible in order to ensure that their operations conform to the policies laid down.  The Taoiseach said also: &ldquo;The Dáil itself has the right to debate the policies of these undertakings and to direct the Minister to modify these policies should this appear desirable in the public interest&rdquo;.  That is what we are doing here tonight.  We would like to direct the Minister to modify his policies, especially the policies as regards the Tuam factory.</P>
      <P>The Minister should realise the socioeconomic reasons which decided that the factory would be built in the first place. Deputy MacSharry quoted the late Deputy Seán Lemass who said that we were going to provide employment there. Deputy Paddy Belton said that it was realised by us, even by those outside Government who urged the Government of the day in 1924 and 1925 to experiment in sugar production, in the growing of beet, that money was never going to be made on the production of sugar and that other considerations would compensate for any monetary loss in the production of the sugar beet crop.  The other considerations are very important, as Deputy MacSharry has pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is there such a hurry to close the <Col N="205" /> Tuam factory?  If a strictly economic yardstick is to be applied to all our State and semi-State companies which provide employment, how many of them would survive?  Can we go on as we are for example with CIE or Aer Lingus?  How many jobs will we have to get rid of in these enterprises if the economics of Tuam are to become the general rule? These other considerations which were mentioned by the late Deputy Lemass and by Deputy Belton are very important, but we are talking about employment, about 586 jobs in the factory, 483 of which will be lost if this factory closes. How can new industry be secured in one year for the hundreds who will lose their jobs?  How can this be done when already over 2,000 people are on the live register in the Tuam area including 600 unemployed in the town of Tuam?  For that reason the amendment which the Government have moved this evening which talks about the absolute priority given to securing new industry in Tuam is just pie in the sky because certainly this cannot be done in 12 months.</P>
    <P>As well as losing these jobs in the west of Ireland we will also be losing skills, expertise and knowledge, all of which have been learned in the factory and have resulted in spin-off employment in small industries being set up.  I am talking particularly of the apprentices whom the Sugar Company sponsored.  Already I see lack of confidence in that sponsorship. For example, last year 14 apprentices were sponsored by the Sugar Company and this year only five apprentices are being sponsored by them in the AnCO training centre in Galway.  The closure of the Tuam factory will result in no training opportunity for these young people, fewer employment opportunities and, of course, unemployment for the skilled people in the factory.</P>
    <P>The engineering works at Tuam which are to remain will find it difficult to survive in the event of the sugar factory closing.  These engineering works are now in their second year and they depend on the sugar factory for support through mobility of labour, maintenance work for the sugar factory itself and so on.  The turf-cutting operation also would <Col N="206" /> encounter similar difficulties as this is a seasonal job only.</P>
    <P>The workers action committee have recommended a national plan covering the entire Sugar Company with particular emphasis on procuring beet, and that this plan would be drawn up by the Government Departments, the growers, the company and worker representatives as soon as possible to ensure that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo will once again become a major force in the economic and farming life of our country as they were previously.  If this is not done as an urgent priority the situation now facing Tuam will shortly be a real threat to the other factories and eventually could result in CSET becoming a mere distributor of sugar produced on the mainland of Europe.</P>
    <P>The action committee also have produced figures comparing the losses of the Tuam factory which are claimed to be £2.5 million.  The action committee have pointed out that this figure does not take into account the loss to the Exchequer with regard to the PAYE element, social insurance, unemployment assistance and also the redundancy cost.  What is it going to cost the Exchequer to provide alternative employment to the workers in the Tuam sugar factory?  In fact, the closure would result not in saving but in a net financial loss to the nation for some years.</P>
    <P>The grower is, of course, the most important person as regards the sugar factory.  The primary producer is the farmer.  If beet is not grown we have no processing and no factory.  The first encouraging sign is that there is an increase in acreage of 39 per cent over the previous year and there is credit due to all involved for that increase, to the farmers, the Sugar Company, the farming organisations, the advisers, the field men in the factory and ACOT who have been promoting the growing of beet. ACOT have stated in their annual report for County Galway that they believe an increase of 500,000 acres of sugar beet could be grown without affecting adversely the livestock population.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is in talking about the future of the sugar beet industry in the west of Ireland when we are getting only a 12 months reprieve.  A meeting of the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Members in the west took place recently with the Beet and Vegetable Growers Association and the BVGA were committed to getting the beet grown.  The first thing they pointed out was that it was difficult to make a commitment when there was just a year left for the factory. Their priority was to drop this 12 months reprieve and to have a long-term plan for <Col N="208" /> the beet industry.  In a situation like that you could talk about planning, investment of machinery and modernisation of plant.  They stated also that companies in Italy and France can get national adaptation aids, and why not a special case for Ireland, especially for Tuam?  The yields per acre are low in the west of Ireland. In 1979 the yield of beet in the Tuam factory area was 12 tons per acre compared with 15.5 tons per acre in the rest of the country.  This could mean up to £100 an acre less for a farmer in the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>In addition to the normal development programme for tourist facilities, it is hoped that Leitrim will benefit significantly from the European Regional Development Fund (Non-quota section) for both development of resources and marketing through to 1986.</P>

      <P>Approval to the preparation of contract documents for the Letterkenny No. 2.  Water Supply Augmentation Scheme Stage 1 &mdash; issued to Donegal County Council in July 1978.  I understand that the further planning of the scheme has been postponed pending the outcome to objections to a proposed source for the scheme, the River Leannon.</P>
      <P>On 11 March 1981 Donegal County Council wrote to the Department enclosing an application for sanction to borrowing £90,000 to finance a drainage survey of the River Leannon.  The proposed survey arose as a consequence of the council's intention to abstract water from the River Leannon.  The farmers who have riparian rights are opposing the abstraction of water until a survey is carried out as a first step to determine the extent of the drainage scheme which would be required to alleviate flooding in the valley.</P>

      <Col N="46" /> The local authority have been informed that the capital allocation for miscellaneous environmental services for 1981 will be completely absorbed by existing commitments but that the application will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the capital allocation which will be provided for these services in 1982.</P>
    <P>Following objections by An Taisce to the proposed water abstraction, Donegal County Council proposed to commission a separate study of the environmental implications of the proposed water abstraction by An Foras Forbartha, at a cost of £6,000.  It is considered that the justification for this study is not apparent at present and the proposed expenditure of £6,000 cannot be approved at this stage.  Donegal County Council have been informed accordingly.</P>

      <P>Every effort is made by my Department to ensure that disability benefit is paid to all claimants who are entitled to payment immediately on the receipt of medical certificates.  While there was delay in payment in certain cases earlier this year the position has been back to normal for some time and, except where inquiries are necessary to establish a claimant's entitlement to benefit, payments are being issued without delay.</P>
      <P>On the question of medical certificates, problems arising in this respect are usually related to the quoting of the identification number of the claimant.  In January last there was a change-over from the old system of social insurance numbers to a new system of Revenue social insurance numbers.  This followed the introduction of a pay-related system of social insurance contributions which are collected by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in conjunction with the PAYE tax system.  All claimants were notified individually in writing of the necessity to quote both their old and new numbers on medical certificates submitted by them.  In addition an extensive press and television advertising campaign was mounted in December and January advising all claimants to quote both their numbers.  Despite these measures many claimants failed to comply with the request and a considerable amount of time had to be spent in attempting to identify the claimants to whom the medical certificates referred with consequential delays in the payment of benefit.  The position in this respect has however improved considerably as claimants became accustomed to the new system and quoted correctly their registration numbers thereby eliminating the difficulties that would otherwise arise in connecting medical certificates with claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was also adversely affected, particularly during the summer months, by industrial action taken by members of the staff who refused to operate certain items of computer equipment. When this dispute was resolved, <Col N="58" /> the back-log of work which had accumulated was cleared as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned did not claim unemployment benefit from my Department.</P>
      <P>He did, however, claim disability benefit from 11 May 1981 and was paid from 14 May 1981, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All benefit due to 22 August 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, has been issued.  Due to industrial action by members of the staff of my Department the initial payment was not made until 15 August 1981.  In the meantime he had been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the local health board.  The amount paid to him therefore represented the difference between the total amount of benefit payable and the amount of the welfare allowance paid during the period of his claim.</P>
      <P>He had earlier notified my Department of the non-receipt of a cheque for £159.42 which issued for the period 24 December 1980 to 20 January 1981 in respect of a previous claim to disability benefit.  As the cheque concerned had been cashed and returned by the bank and as the signature on it appeared to be the same as the signatures on other paid cheques it was referred to an inspector of my department for investigation.  Following inspection of the cheque, the claimant agreed that he had in fact received and cashed it.</P>

Occasionally an appeal may be lodged against a decision of the Civil Service Commissioners to reject a candidate for employment on the grounds of health.  In such a case a second <Col N="72" /> medical opinion is obtained.  These appeals never number more than about six cases a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation and control of the Civil Service are provided for in the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956 and 1958 and aspects relating to appointments, including promotion, are governed by the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  The Acts do not provide for a formal appeals procedure against decisions by the Minister for the Public Service in individual cases in respect of the items mentioned.  General issues in relation to remuneration and certain conditions of civil servants, however, are subject to the formal procedures of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for grades covered by this scheme and, in the case of industrial employees, to the Industrial Relations Acts.  Of course every civil servant is afforded an opportunity of submitting through the normal channels, or through his staff association if he so wishes, any representations he may wish to make to the Head of the Department on any matter affecting his official position.</P>
      <P>The position regarding other public servants is governed by a wide variety of statutes, regulations and procedures. Decisions in individual cases on the items mentioned are mainly assigned to other Ministers and authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidies paid in respect of bread are consumer subsidies and not an aid to the bakery industry. For administrative reasons bulk payments are made to bakeries in the case of home-manufactured bread and to agents registered in the State in the case of imported bread.  The benefit of the subsidy accrues to the consumer through the mechanism of the Maximum Prices Orders under which the price of bread subject to control is reduced by the full subsidy payable.</P>
      <P>The bread subsidy which was introduced in 1975 was originally confined to bread manufactured and sold for consumption within the State.  In 1979 the EEC initiated action against Ireland on the grounds that the manner in which the subsidy was being applied was contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome. Under Articles 92-94 of the Treaty, in the case of goods originating in the Community, consumer subsidies must be applied without discrimination as to the origin of the products.  In these circumstances proposals were put to the EEC for the phased extension of the subsidy to imports from other member states (including Northern Ireland) and the procedure against Ireland was then terminated. Subsidy payments in respect of Northern Ireland bread imported into the State are made in accordance with these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present rate of subsidy payable on standard bread manufactured and sold for consumption within the State is 15½p per 800 gm loaf and pro rata on other standard size loaves.  In the case of bread imported from Northern Ireland for consumption within the State, the rate of subsidy payable is 13p per 800 gm loaf. In accordance with the arrangements with the EEC, this rate will increase to <Col N="83" /> 14p per 800 gm loaf with effect from the 25 October 1981.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of similar subsidies on bread sold in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The new school is to be built on a site offered by the convent school authorities and while it is generally acceptable, difficulties have arisen regarding access to it.</P>
      <P>In their report of inspection in June 1980 the Office of Public Works stated that site works would be required at a total estimated cost of £35,000.  These works involved development of site and the provision of a proper entrance and car parking facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their comments were subsequently conveyed to the school authorities, and it was explained that under the terms of the Department's rules for national schools, the cost of the development works would have to be borne from local sources.  The school authorities objected to the proposal, stating that the high costs <Col N="95" /> derived from the Department's insistence on using a particular point of access.  In the wake of representations it was decided to re-investigate the case with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works reply was received recently and it confirms that a rear entrance to the site could be used.  If acceptable to the school authorities the cost of the site works etc., would effectively be reduced to £10,000.  The Department are prepared to accept the alternative access and have written to the Rev. Chairman seeking written confirmation that the entrance can be made available. A letter was issued to the chairman of the convent school board of management on 13 October 1981 and a reply is awaited.</P>

      <P>The Department's grant was delayed because of difficulties relating to the clearance of title to the site extension, required to accommodate the scheme. The evidence of title was submitted for approval in November 1979 and had been with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor for almost a year.  During that time, the Chief State Solicitor had been corresponding with the Rev. Chairman's solicitor in the matter and it appears that delays in obtaining replies from the chairman's solicitor played a major part in holding up the scheme.</P>

      <P>The original decision to provide two additional classrooms and a general purposes <Col N="98" /> room at this school was taken in March 1978.  In order to make provision for the possible future extension of the existing school to eight classrooms it was found necessary to re-design the sketch plans already prepared in June 1979. These revised plans were submitted to the Department for approval in May, 1981 and the Rev. Chairman was asked to discuss the local contribution with the Department in mid-June, 1981.  The chairman's response came in September 1981 and following discussions with him agreement was obtained on the local contribution. The Office of Public Works were then authorised to proceed with the preparation of working drawings.  I am aware of dissatisfaction with the rate of progress on this case and, indeed, the matter was raised in the Dáil on 26 March 1981 by Deputy John F. Donnellan.</P>
      <P>With regard to the temporary accommodation, the position is as follows: two years ago partitions were erected in two classrooms (built 1969) and these two rooms have been catering for a total of four teachers and their classes for this period.  As the summer months of this year approached the school management decided that prefabricated classrooms would have to be provided.  The partitions were accordingly removed and two mobile homes erected without Department approval on the site, during the summer months.  The two &ldquo;mobiles&rdquo; were provided temporarily pending the erection of two prefabs.</P>
      <P>It is understood that a parents committee have now purchased a secondhand prefabricated unit, which consists of three classrooms, and that arrangements are being made to have it erected at the school.  In the meanwhile the &ldquo;mobile homes&rdquo; are being used as a teachers' staff room and classroom.  The latter is being used on a rota basis with each of three classes (1st, 3rd and 5th) spending no more than two hours in the &ldquo;homes&rdquo; at a time.</P>
      <P>The divisional inspector is to furnish a report in the matter and the question of a grant towards the cost of the provision of temporary accommodation will then be considered in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any pupil eligible for school transport in accordance with the arrangements communicated to the relevant school authorities in 1974 is not <Col N="101" /> being provided with school transport to Ballymacaward national school.  However, the Deputy may be referring to the re-arrangement of transport for children attending Ballymacaward school, arising out of a report from CIE in August, 1981 that 19 children who had been availing of free transport were found, in the course of routine checking, to have been ineligible for free transport.  Fourteen of these children were found to be residing less than one mile from the school and five others were found to be living in the area of Woodlawn national school.  However, the majority of children were allowed fare-paying facilities to their respective schools, and a curtailment of approximately one mile was introduced to the service.</P>
      <P>I received a request from Paul Connaughton, T.D. to receive a deputation which I did on 10 September 1981 and, subsequent to this, I decided that free transport should be restored to the 19 pupils who had been found to be ineligible and that the route of the service should be restored and operate as it did up to the end of the 1980-81 school year. These arrangements were implemented on 22 September 1981 and are currently operating.  I am unaware therefore of any reason for dissatisfaction at this time.</P>

      <P>Since there are only two eligible children in the particular locality it would not be open to the Department to establish a school transport service for them.  The suggestion made by the Deputy in his earlier representations on this case have the following three major disadvantages: firstly, it would greatly inconvenience all of the other children involved in the transport service and would mean them having to be picked up significantly earlier and set down much later in the afternoon; the suggested turning point would not be suitable for the large bus which operates this service and a further extension <Col N="102" /> would therefore be necessary to meet the request; thirdly the cost involved would be wildly disproportionate to normal costs in the scheme.</P>
