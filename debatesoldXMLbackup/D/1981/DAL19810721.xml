      <P>As the Government's agreed programme indicates, we will continue the current Anglo-Irish talks and studies aimed at achieving peace and reconciliation and at improving the relations between the peoples of Ireland and Britain. It will, however, be my aim in any further discussions in which I am involved to seek ways of eliminating distrust surrounding the talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any progress been made or have any discussions taken place under this Anglo-Irish studies set-up which was initiated at Christmas?  In present circumstances should we be willing participators in any such operation in view of the intransigent attitude of the British Premier in regard to the hunger strike?</P>

      <P>These discussions are taking place at civil service level, as the Deputy will be aware, and they will continue with a view to preparing the ground for discussions at ministerial level later. <Col N="496" /> There is no ministerial meeting in prospect at present and no arrangements have been made for one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the Government's policy in regard to seeking a declaration of intent from the British Government to withdraw from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Government 1981-1986</i> indicates that the Government will continue to strive to unite the people of this island.  It also indicates that in seeking to do this on the basis of reconciliation and consent, the Government will seek the full support of the British Government who have a crucial role.  In the Government's view that role should be played in a positive manner by indicating publicly what so many British political leaders say in private, that they wish to see the unity of the people of Ireland and that they will support everything that promotes the achievement of that objective with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  I want to stress that in the Government's view it is also vitally necessary to eradicate the suspicions, fears and misunderstandings that divide the major traditions within Ireland.  We are pledged to do everything possible to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to remove the suspicion on the part of the minority in the Six Counties, will the Taoiseach give serious consideration to the positive request that Britain make such a declaration and cease to make the declaration that she will stay there as long as the majority contrive, as was once the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated our position clearly.  The British declaration was made at the time of Sunningdale and is part of the joint declarations on which the British Government based their support for Irish unity achieved by agreement. That is the position which we would hope the British Government would be willing to return to and assert <Col N="497" /> as they did at that time.  Beyond that I have nothing to add to my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered or will he consider recalling our Ambassador to London with a view to having consultations with him in view of the deteriorating situation in Northern Ireland and such an overspill of violence in the Republic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Flor Crowley Mr. Flor Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flor Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach brought to the notice of or asked the British Prime Minister how many more fractured homes and psychologically ruined internees we are going to have before she at last sees the light and acts in a humane fashion?  Further, is she aware that the role of her troops in the North of Ireland is one of marauding and molesting rather than, as she says, peace-keeping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the part of the Deputy's question which appeared to relate to the situation in the Maze Prison, the House will be aware that we have made every effort in this matter to secure a resolution of the problem along the lines suggested by the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.  I have nothing to add to the other part of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that repeated calls for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland at this time would be unhelpful and harmful in the present state of relations between this country and Britain and, indeed, that these repeated calls for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland could be offensive to the one million British subjects in the North of Ireland to whom the sign &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; is offensive because they are British and Northern Irish just as the Welsh are Welsh and British and the Scottish are Scottish and British at the same time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what Deputy Kemmy has said and I agree that repeated calls for British withdrawal without regard to the circumstances which exist in Northern Ireland are simplistic and do not help the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see how the Taoiseach can answer a reasonable question put by Deputy Kemmy and other Deputies in this House and yet say that the question I have put to him is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising from the Taoiseach's replies, what way does he visualise anything on a Sunningdale basis as a means to an end considering it turned out a complete fiasco?  Would the Taoiseach not consider at this stage the withdrawal of all co-operation and collaboration between security forces on both sides of the border while Mrs. Thatcher and her Government proceed in the intransigent manner which is creating such havoc among our people, North and South, at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference to Sunningdale was simply to draw the attention of the House to the solemn declaration made then by the British Government with regard to its attitude of support for a united Ireland achieved by agreement, a statement which I would have thought all Members of this House would welcome. Questions of security do not really arise on this question, but in any event we have no intention of doing anything which is going to diminish security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the day following the meeting, 14 July, in which it is stated that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald instructed Foreign Minister designate Dooge to open immediate talks with his British counterpart, Lord Carrington, in Brussels?  What was Professor Dooge's status on that occasion, arising out of such, if any, discussions with the British Foreign Secretary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Professor Dooge, who had accompanied the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to London for discussions with British Ministers several days earlier, was asked to take the opportunity in his capacity as adviser to the Department to have informal discussions with Lord Carrington because it was thought this might help towards a resolution of the problem in the Maze prison and that no opportunity of doing that should be missed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that under the Constitution and Statutory Instruments made under the Constitution, particularly by reason of Article 28 of the Constitution, every member of the Government must be a member of Dáil or Seanad Eireann?  On this occasion was Professor Dooge acting as a member of the Government or as a representative of the Government?  In what capacity was he so acting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He was acting as someone who had attended in his capacity as adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs pending his appointment as Minister. He had attended the meetings in London a few days earlier and was therefore <Col N="500" /> well versed and well briefed.  As someone who had informal contact with Lord Carrington he could draw Lord Carrington's attention as forcibly as possible to some of the considerations in the minds of the Irish Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach appoint Professor Dooge to speak on behalf of a sovereign Irish state in dealings with the Foreign Secretary of another sovereign state?  Is this an initiation of a high degree of cronyism in high places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the fact that Deputy Lenihan should seek to introduce this note in relation to such a serious matter.  Since this Government have come into office they have made unremitting efforts to try to resolve the problem.  We will not be deterred by any such attacks in using any channels open to us with a view to trying to find a solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider it desirable that the highly sensitive negotiations and discussions that must take place on behalf of the Government between one Foreign Minister of a sovereign state and a foreign Minister of another sovereign state should be conducted by people who are properly appointed under the law and the Constitution and that we behave in international affairs as we should behave: as a sovereign independent state and be so regarded by other sovereign independent states?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy his plans for the immediate development of the Leinster coalfield with particular reference to the development of Rossmore coalmine and other coal deposits in County Laois; and if he will give assurances that the Government will give priority to this development because of the existing energy situation and the need to provide employment in south Laois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister for State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A leading firm of coalmining consultants has been engaged to advise on the extent, nature and potential for mining on an economic basis of the Irish coalfield reserves, including the Leinster coalfield.  The intention is that the consultants will develop a body of data on the coal reserves to a degree which I hope will be sufficient to interest prospective developers to seek mining facilities from my Department.</P>
      <P>A draft of the consultants' report on the first phase of the study was recently received in my Department.  It consist of the assembly of all available data on the extent and nature of our coal reserves and it identifies certain areas considered worthy of further investigation of their potential for the establishment of viable mining operations.</P>
      <P>I would add that, while the consultants have estimated the recoverable reserves in the Leinster coalfield to be in the region of 15 million tonnes, some 12½ million tonnes of this may have a high sulphur content.  High sulphur coal would not be suitable for domestic purposes and the means of utilising it without environmental pollution will require particular investigation.  It must also be stated that the coal seams in the coalfield are generally not more than 18 inches thick, a factor which has a major influence on production costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rossmore Anthracite Ltd.  went into voluntary liquidation in November 1980. My Department are in continuing co-operation with the liquidator in his efforts to secure a purchaser for the mine who <Col N="502" /> would resume coalmining operations there.  I fully appreciate the contribution resumption of mining at Rossmore could make to employment in the area and this factor is being borne very much in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, the Leinster coalfield covers a very large area of south-east Laois. Because of the closure of the Rossmore coalmine a large number of families have been seriously affected by unemployment. Will the Minister take positive steps to ensure that the Rossmore coalmine is opened and brought into production at the earliest possible opportunity, both from the point of view of creating employment in the area and also, perhaps of greater national importance, to bring to the surface the very valuable coal deposits that are in that area but which are unmined?  Would the Minister consider making finance available for the development of this area of the Leinster coalfield?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, my Department continue to co-operate with the liquidator in his efforts to secure a purchaser for the mine.  As the Deputy may be aware, the mine is held on a care and maintenance basis at present.  There is a possibility that a purchaser for the mine will be successful in his application. This week the Tánaiste is meeting trade union interests with a view to having a discussion with them about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reveal to the House the number of companies interested in coal mining in the Leinster coalfield area in general?  Would he further indicate if those interests are outside the country or if there are Irish mining interests involved also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one company interested in the Rossmore Anthracite Company.  I have not got the other information regarding the rest of the Leinster field.  It is the wish of my Department that the consultants' further reports would encourage potential developers to become interested in coal mining in the <Col N="503" /> Leinster coalfield.  As yet, we have not gone further than having received the first phase of the study of the consultants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is satisfied, in the context of the present and future development of uranium mining in County Donegal and of the ancillary workings connected therewith, that the environment will be adequately protected that is, in relation to water and atmospheric pollution; and that the health of persons directly employed in the industry is not, and will not be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, no actual mining of uranium in Ireland at present.  A uranium deposit of economic size and grade has not so far been discovered, so the question of mining of uranium does not arise at the present time. If, however, at some future date such an economic deposit were to be located, it would be necessary for a prospective mine operator to secure planning permission from the local planning authority to obtain a mining lease or licence from my Department and to secure a separate licence from the Nuclear Energy Board before a mine development could take place.  The most stringent conditions would be applied to such an operation and the appropriate authorities would have to be fully satisfied in regard to the impact of a proposed mining operation on health, safety and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present a number of companies prospecting for uranium in certain parts of the country, including County Donegal, under prospecting licences issued by my Department. the Nuclear Energy Board, the statutory authority in Ireland in relation to radioactive substances, have advised that there is no evidence that prospecting operations in County Donegal or elsewhere in the county lead to any radiation hazard.  The board's advice in this matter is based on their study of the available information on the impact of uranium activities worldwide, <Col N="504" /> on discussions with national and international regulatory authorities and on the results of a continuing programme of radioactivity measurements on water samples from certain areas in which uranium prospecting operations have been in progress.  The board have also carried out some studies of soil, rock and air but they decided at an early date that water sampling was the most direct and sensitive method of detecting a possible contamination problem.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the prospecting work in progress does not constitute a hazard to workers employed on prospecting sites, to local water supplies or to the general environment in the vicinity of prospecting sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to name the experts who are involved in giving advice to the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Energy Board or suchlike?  It would appear that there is a great variation of opinion which, in itself, appears contradictory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have consulted authorities which include the EEC, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Energy Agency, the United Kingdom National Radiological Protection Board, The British Geological Survey, the French Safety Directorate of the Atomic Energy Commission and the West German, Danish, Italian and Canadian experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ClementCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's reply, it would appear that Donegal's potential is such that the necessity for the granting of permission to mine would be negligible.  Would he not agree at this stage, to protect Donegal's two inexhaustible sources of revenue &mdash; tourism and the environment &mdash; that any such exploration should be prohibited forthwith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a distinction between prospecting for radioactive substances such as uranium, and the actual mining.  As stated in my reply, <Col N="505" /> if the question of mining ever arose the operator would need planning permission from the local authority.  He would also need a licence or lease from my Department and a separate licence from the Nuclear Energy Board.  Obviously, my Department, the Nuclear Energy Bord and the relevant local authority would take every circumstance into account before granting a licence to mine.  Certainly, my Department, together with the Nuclear Energy Board, would ensure that all environmental considerations were fully examined before granting any lease or licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, with experts on both sides of this question of mining and exploration, classifying themselves as experts and quoting contradictory end products or results, that the question should be determined by a referendum on the question of mining in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Nuclear Energy Board were constituted for the study of the development of nuclear energy and that any advice which may have been tendered &mdash; well meaning though it may be &mdash; must be suspect on the basis that they are all pro-nuclear people on that board? Furthermore, is he not aware that such is the disquiet among the population in and around the site of the explorations in Donegal, that some members of the committee who are against this whole process, because of the dangers involved, are making arrangements to move out of the <Col N="506" /> area at very great disadvantage because of the information which they have received from very well qualified people throughout the world.  The members of the Nuclear Energy Board are surely not the people who should determine the issue, as they are pro-nuclear and the board were set up as such from the start.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he considers that the procedure whereby public utility bodies and Government Departments are permitted to by-pass the normal planning requirements by merely consulting with the local authority is satisfactory; and if he will consider subjecting such bodies to more control in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any urgent reasons for an amendment of the present statutory position which requires State Authorities &mdash; that is Government Departments, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Land Commission &mdash; to consult with planning authorities before undertaking the construction or extension of any building, other than one connected with afforestation, and further requires them to consult with me in connection with any objections to such proposals by planning authorities which they have not been able to resolve by direct consultation.  The consultation procedure does not apply to &ldquo;public utility bodies&rdquo;. Development by such bodies, except where specifically exempt, is subject to planning control in accordance with the provisions of Part IV of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a party issue.  Consent was given to a Department in 1973 and acted on in 1981. <Col N="512" /> Because of that consent an ancient village was destroyed.  Would the Minister agree that such application should have gone through the normal planning procedure? It would be in keeping with good local democracy if public utility bodies were subjected to the same planning requirements as everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure to what the Deputy is referring.  A local authority who want to develop in another local authority area must apply for planning permission.  In their own area, they cannot go outside their own development plan.  To that extent, there is a constraint on local authorities on the type of development they carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to a very ancient village.  The problem arose because consent was given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1973. Would the Minister not accept that Government Departments should be subjected to the same planning requirements as other individuals, companies and groups?  This is a subject all parties have neglected down the years and I ask the Minister to consider the matter and perhaps bring forward recommendations to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

I would add for the information of the Deputy and the House that the Government have, on my recommendation and in view of the total inadequacy of the capital already provided, agreed to an additional capital allocation of £30 million for the local authority housing programme.

      <P>We welcome the further allocation to Donegal County Council.  Is the Minister aware that a survey carried out recently by the County Council in conjunction with An Foras Forbartha established that there is much unfit and grossly overcrowded housing and a prospective need for 13,000 houses by 1985?  Is he further aware that during the past eight years we have been averaging approximately 290 houses per year?  At that rate we would meet housing needs in Donegal in about 40 years' time. Of the capital commitment of £4.4 million to Donegal County Council we have been allocated £2.04 million.  Can the Minister give an assurance that the additional allocation will be sufficient to <Col N="516" /> enable us to meet the present inadequate target of 290 houses?</P>

I am very conscious that local authorities throughout the country have totally inadequate funds for housing.  I am happy to announce this provision of £30 million and I am concerned to examine the housing programme throughout the country. As Minister with responsibility for housing, I will seek as much money as possible and this provision of £30 million is a good start.</P>

      <P>My predecessors in office directed housing authorities to exclude from their tenant purchase schemes dwellings specifically provided by them for elderly and disabled persons.

I understand that the central board are now on the look out for another premises.  On the question of negotiating with the staff there are about 30 headquarters staff altogether and it is anticipated that not more than 20 of these will be involved in the transfer to Galway.

These concentrations of algae, which take place under certain conditions during the late summer months, are natural occurrences.

The effect on fish can be minimised only by counter measures such as the diversion of fishing or the removal of farmed fish.</P>

      <P>In accordance with a recommendation made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I have to remind Members of the necessity to maintain the strictest confidentiality with regard to budget information circulated to Members in the House prior to its disclosure to the Dáil by the Minister for Finance.  Disclosure of any such information in advance of its announcement here by the Minister will be treated as a serious breach of the privileges of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objective in framing this Budget has been to ensure that Ireland remains an independent economy.  The piling up of foreign debt to finance daily expenses is the negation of the principle of self-reliance, the principle of Sinn Féin, on which this State was founded.</P>
      <P>We must trade and exchange with the countries around us, but on a basis of equality and strength.  Current budget deficits, which harm the balance of payments and weaken the currency, deprive us of this strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only from economic strength that Ireland can provide and protect jobs.  It is firm and predictable management of <Col N="566" /> the national finances that provides the essential anchor for the moderate incomes policy which we must have to reduce inflation.  Reduced inflation is the sure basis for increased agricultural and industrial production.</P>
    <P>Timely action by ourselves now on Irish public finances will avoid enforced deflation later on.  We must act if we are to protect essential public and social services, and guarantee real income increases to the needy.  No one has a greater interest in the continued solvency of the State than those who depend on it.</P>
    <P>These are the declared immediate policy aims in the Joint Programme of the Government, and as I have shown they are mutually interdependent.  They are the basis upon which this budget has been built.  It is the considered view of the Government that this budget is necessary unless the whole basis for social progress is to be endangered.</P>
    <P>The measures I announce today are, therefore, the first stage in the Government's campaign to reconstruct the nation's finances on a secure and durable basis.  They mark a positive and determined effort to return to the principle of living within our means, a principle referred to on television by both the present and the previous Taoiseach.  This means paying for day-to-day services now instead of charging them up to the taxpayers of tomorrow.  This generation does not have an unlimited right to pass on burdens to its successors.  Our plan involves much closer examination of public capital expenditure to ensure that money borrowed for investment is spent effectively enough to ensure that an income is generated, directly or indirectly, to repay the borrowing.</P>
    <P>The process of financial reconstruction must be gradual so as to avoid dislocation of the economy.  The Government's stated aim is to end borrowing for day-to-day purposes over a period of four years.  This aim is difficult but not impossible.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUDGET POSITION</P>
    <P>I wish now to comment on the 1981 budgetary situation, past, present and to come.  I shall be brief, because the financial <Col N="567" /> and economic situation has been described already at length in the paper &ldquo;Economic Review and Outlook, Summer 1981&rdquo; which was released by my Department last week.</P>
    <P>In the January budget the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement was set at £1,296 million or 13 per cent of GNP, of which £515 million, or 5¼ per cent of GNP, was intended to finance the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>At the end of June, borrowing for current purposes was £457 million, or almost 90 per cent of the target for the whole year.  This has happened because of increases in current spending.  Some of these arise from decisions of the previous Government, for example, to have additional agricultural and consumer subsidies, but the majority of them happened because the money allocated was plainly insufficient, without changes in policy, to finance the programme it was supposed to implement.  If present trends were to continue unchecked, current spending for the year would be £500 million more than the budget estimate.</P>
    <P>Apart from an expected shortfall in Post Office receipts, revenue is generally on target.  In fact there is likely to be a modest increase because of the extra tax revenue generated by the higher public expenditure.  But that increase falls far short of what would be needed to counteract the excess on the expenditure side. In the absence of corrective action, the current budget deficit would be nearly £950 million, equivalent to 9½ per cent of GNP at the end of this year.  This is far above the previous highest level of 7¼ per cent of GNP in 1979, which was artificially increased by the Post Office dispute of that year.  Such a deficit would be exceptionally high by EEC standards and far beyond the next highest deficit expected among our EEC partners, the majority of whom are either close to balance or even in surplus.</P>
    <P>Excesses also emerging on capital expenditure could, if present trends continued, bring the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement to £1,973 million, or 20 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The cost of servicing existing debt is <Col N="568" /> now absorbing nearly all of the revenue buoyancy.  The burden of inherited debt interest is depriving us of the ability to finance desirable expenditures without increasing the rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>We are committing a fraud on the young people of this country by piling up debts to be repaid by the workers of the future.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of young people, more so even than of the older generation, that action be taken now to put the national finances on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>We have had a budget deficit in every year since 1972 and the public debt has grown enormously.  If all of this debt were raised at home, this process could in theory continue so long as inflation devalued the currency, because the Government would, in effect, be repaying less than they had borrowed.  But it cannot continue indefinitely if money is being borrowed abroad, to be repaid in full in other currencies.</P>
    <P>This is what is now happening in Ireland.  Since 1974 we have been borrowing abroad on a large scale.  For instance, in 1980 47 per cent of all Irish Government borrowing was raised outside the country as against 16 per cent in 1977.  Our borrowing needs have become so large that the Government could not finance them all at home without using up the money available for private borrowers.</P>
    <P>Big budget deficits are dangerous for many reasons:</P>
    <P>&mdash; They introduce an air of unreality into politics by making it seem that spending does not have to be paid for and that demands can be made without reference to taxation.</P>
    <P>&mdash; They pump new money into the economy and thus encourage imports without generating a similar growth of domestic production; instead of encouraging imports in this way, our economic development requires us to export more.</P>
    <P>&mdash; If deficits are financed at home, they push up interest rates and reduce investment, especially in areas such as housing which rely heavily on borrowed money.  If they are financed <Col N="569" /> abroad they carry major financial risks, which I will refer to shortly.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.</P>
    <P>The scale of over-spending in recent years has encouraged the economy to develop on an artificial and ultimately unsustainable basis.  Much of the resultant demand went on increased imports, with adverse consequences for our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit this year could, unless we act to correct it, be about £1,500 million, approaching 15 per cent of GNP.  This would be above the combined deficits of 1979 and 1980, which were themselves high.  It would be of very serious proportions by any standards, Irish or international.  Within the EEC, the next highest deficit forecast for this year, as a proportion of GNP, is about half the figure that could emerge here.</P>
    <P>Why has the deficit grown to this extent?  I have referred to Government over-spending.  External factors have also played a part.  The oil price increases of 1979-80, aggravated by downward movements in the exchange rates of the EMS currencies, including the IR£ against sterling and the US dollar have increased our oil import bill to about £900 million this year, as against £527 million in 1978. This has happened despite an expected fall in the actual volume of oil imports this year.</P>
    <P>The international recession has also reduced the rate of growth of our export markets, especially in our largest single export market, the UK.  Although other countries have also been hit by higher oil prices and the recession, their balance of payments deficits have not risen to anything approaching our level.  We must therefore face the fact that our problem is to a great extent due to developments at home which we ourselves must rectify. If we do not stop the deterioration in the balance of payments now it will become so large that we will not be able to finance it solely through the normal international markets.</P>
    <P>A balance of payments deficit can normally be financed by Exchequer foreign <Col N="570" /> borrowing, or by private capital inflows. If we attempted to rely solely on private capital inflows to finance deficits of the present size, interest rates would have to rise sharply, with a consequent severe deflationary effect on economic activity and investment.  Our growing balance of payments deficits have, in fact, therefore, been financed largely by Government borrowing abroad.</P>
    <P>There are limits, however, to the extent that international banks are prepared to lend, even to Governments. These limits can be reached suddenly and with little warning.  If for some reason the availability of money on world markets were to contract, or if large extra funds were required by other Governments, the bankers would no longer be knocking on our door offering us money.</P>
    <P>We would then have to have recourse to the loan facilities of the European Community or the IMF, but the finance which they provide is subject to conditions which can be stringent.  Such assistance would be welcome in certain emergency conditions, but it would bring with it an unwelcome limitation on the freedom of our own Government to make decisions about policy objectives.  In the interest of our national economic independence, the Government are acting now to halt the growth in Exchequer borrowing and in our balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>A major difference between the present and earlier periods of economic difficulty is the obligation to defend the exchange rate of the IR£ in the EMS. The Government are fully committed to meeting that obligation.  Devaluation would only lead to faster inflation and worsen our problems.</P>
    <P>The choice before us is simple, but stark.  Either we act now, in a planned way, to reduce the imbalances in the public finances and the external accounts, or we face enforced and severe economic dislocation and contraction, possibly in the not too distant future.  In other words we either act now or we risk the loss of much of what we, as a nation, have already achieved.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOMES POLICY.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> We have to find a way, as a community, of bringing our aspirations and demands in the area of incomes into line with the international value of what we produce. Even in the absence of any further addition, non-agricultural wages and salaries under the present national understanding will this year increase by 17 per cent, which is more than double the average figure expected in other EMS countries.</P>
    <P>The Government aim to solve the problem that this poses by agreement.  In our programme we have said that free central wage bargaining ought to remain the way to determine money incomes. The welfare of the community requires that such bargaining have due regard to its economic and social effect.  There are many not represented in national pay discussions whose position is directly affected by the outcome of those discussions. These include the unemployed, the young seeking jobs, those in precarious employment, the retired dependent on past savings and the farming community. Equity demands that their interests be served by the outcome of central pay negotiations.  Therefore the Government's programme provides for a new approach to central wage bargaining, with the aim of reducing inflation.  The necessary steps to implement this approach will be taken in the near future.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF 1981 BUDGET</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the specific decisions taken by the Government in order to reduce the high budget deficit and to give a better direction to economic and social development.  These new measures include</P>
    <P>&mdash; a revision of expenditure plans and the curtailment of certain expenditures; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; taxation changes designed to increase the overall tax yield.</P>
    <P>These changes are the forerunners of more fundamental longer term reassessments of the financial and fiscal situation. They will be followed, in due course, by proposals to give effect to the Government's <Col N="572" /> 1982 budget and medium-term economic plan.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>The Government have spent considerable time in an intensive review of the possibilities for curtailing the excesses on public expenditure.  It is not easy at any time to make a quick change in the trend of current expenditure.  To do so at a stage when half the financial year has already passed, and commitments have already been entered into, is extremely difficult.  The Government have, nevertheless, taken decisions which will reduce non-capital spending in 1981 by £148 million as compared with what it would otherwise have been.  I propose to mention the major items comprising this reduction.</P>
    <P>The decision of the previous Government to postpone increases in ESB charges and CIE rates and fares, which had been approved by the National Prices Commission and justified by actual increases in costs, severely disrupted the finances of both CIE and the ESB.  It would have required the companies to be compensated by the Government if they were not to be permanently damaged by loss of revenue.  Given the state of Government finances, there is simply no scope for assuming new and open-ended commitments of this magnitude.</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, had to decide that the increases in ESB and CIE charges, postponed since early this year, be implemented.  In the case of the ESB, a significant amount of badly needed revenue from the postponed increases has already been lost, so the board will be permitted to impose a surcharge to recover this loss over the next twelve months.  If the increases had been implemented from their original dates it would not now be necessary for the board to impose this surcharge.  As for CIE, the Dáil has already approved a Supplementary Estimate to compensate the company for the revenue lost in the first six months of the year.  The increases in rates and fares, approved by the National Prices Commission, will be implemented at the earliest practicable date.  These two measures will reduce the projected <Col N="573" /> Exchequer deficit for 1981 by the substantial sum of £67 million.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture will be making some adjustments in expenditure so as to fund measures which the Government believe are most urgently required by farmers.  The economies being made will require An Foras Talúntais and ACOT to absorb certain staff and other costs for which extra funds had been sought.  Also, the terms of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are being modified slightly to concentrate available resources on smaller farms.</P>
    <P>In the health area, hospital and prescription costs will be borne to a greater extent than heretofore by those users who are able to pay for them.  Appropriate changes will be made from 1 August in the terms of the drug refund scheme administered by the health boards and in hospital charges.</P>
    <P>Substantial savings will also be achieved by the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Defence and others.  In all, these various Departmental savings will amount to £31 million in 1981.  But, in general, the reductions will leave Departments with allocations not less than the original allocation in the January Budget.</P>
    <P>In their examination of the financial situation, the Government identified a number of areas which offer scope for reductions in public expenditure in future years.  These will be examined in greater depth in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is studying the possibilities of enabling local authorities to gain access to new sources of revenue, other than rates.  The Government should be in a position to take decisions on his proposals before the 1982 Budget is finalised.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on social welfare payments is rising rapidly, and the opinion has been expressed that some of the benefits may, in certain limited circumstances, act as a disincentive to taking up offers of employment.  The Minister for Social Welfare is carrying out an examination of this complex area to determine if reform is necessary.</P>
    <P>The health and educational services will also be reviewed in the coming <Col N="574" /> months in order to find ways of reducing the very heavy costs which they impose on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the studies to which I have referred, and others which will also be undertaken, will help to arrest the long-term upward trend of non-capital spending.  The results of the studies will be incorporated in the expenditure programmes forming part of the Government's economic and financial plans.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Sector Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need for a new approach to pay determination.  An aspect of this matter which must be improved immediately is that of special increases in the public sector.  In addition to pay provisions totalling £1,780 million in the Volume of Estimates, the budget of January last provided £80 million to cover the cost of any additional improvements in pay and pensions arising in 1981. This provision has already been exceeded and the latest estimates suggest that, if current trends continue unchecked, the cost of public sector pay and pensions could rise by more than 25 per cent this year.  This is unacceptable, both because it would add to the budgetary imbalance and because it would represent a serious inequity at a time when the majority of employees in private sector employments are receiving only the basic terms of the current pay agreement, and some may not even be receiving these.</P>
    <P>Despite the state of the public finances, the Government are prepared to honour special increases sanctioned to date as well as firm offers or formal commitments which have been made before today, and would be anxious to accept, if at all possible, findings in cases currently before the Labour Court, or before an arbitration board or a review body.  However it is obvious that this is the limit.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in the case of all other claims, the Government will request public sector employers formally to invoke Clause 6 of the pay terms of the National Understanding.  They will seek immediate negotiations with the public sector unions with a view to agreeing an alternative arrangement which will take <Col N="575" /> account of the community's inability to find the resources to meet further special increases without risk to jobs and the viability of the economy.  My colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, will also invite the public sector unions to discuss the general question of the present methods of determining public sector pay and, in particular, whether the present arrangements for conciliation and arbitration should be modified or supplemented.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Numbers Employed in Public Sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>Today the public sector in its widest sense employs about 300,000 people &mdash; more than at any previous time and an increase of 30,000 in the last four years.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of the resultant expenditure reflects a disproportionate allocation of human resources to the public sector.  This imbalance in the economy must be corrected and the Government have, therefore, decided that the numbers employed in the public sector will not be allowed to exceed the numbers employed on 21 July 1981.  An exception will be made for productive employment where the cost of additional staff is recovered from charges made to the public for the additional goods or services they provide.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the provision of essential new or expanded public services will not be inhibited by this necessary halt to the expansion of the public sector.  Existing services will be rigorously examined to ensure the elimination of schemes and programmes which are no longer needed. Increased efficiency will be sought in all services.  Resulting staff savings will be used through redeployment to ensure that all necessary new services required to meet emerging national needs are provided.</P>
    <P>The policy I have outlined does not mean a cut-back in public employment but an end to its continuous and unsustainable increase.  There will still be job opportunities resulting from the replacement of the large number of people who every year leave the public service for one reason or another.  The Minister for <Col N="576" /> the Public Service estimates that about 5 per cent of serving civil service staff leave each year.  Applying this percentage over the whole public sector, we get a figure of roughly 15,000 vacancies for young people.  In addition it is envisaged that a limited number of existing vacancies can be filled where the recruitment process has already reached an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these proposals enables the excess expenditure on pay to be reduced by £50 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the maintenance of a capital investment programme which will stimulate economic growth and provide the basis for the creation of additional employment.  Never-theless, during this year there is evidence that, if nothing is done, the amount actually spent will in many areas be much more than was provided for in the 1981 public capital programme.  The Government have therefore taken steps to ensure that the Exchequer commitments will be maintained at or around the level provided for in the January budget.</P>
    <P>In our review of capital expenditure, the Government concluded that the existing allocation of £116.5 million for local authority housing was inadequate and we have, therefore, decided to approve additional expenditure of some £30 million on the programme in order to maintain that level of housing output in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Government will be providing additional funding for the farm modernisation scheme as demands under the Scheme are running at a higher level than was provided for in the January budget. Associated with this will be funds to be made available as required for the EEC interest subsidy for development farmers. Certain changes will however be made in the farm modernisation scheme to bring about savings and to provide funds for investment which will best assist production.</P>
    <P>A contingency provision of £70 million was made in the January budget for the additional requirements outside of the public capital programme for loans and share capital for certain semi-State bodies. <Col N="577" /> Potential demands on this provision could amount to about £217 million.  The Government have reviewed these demands carefully and have concluded that, in present financial circumstances, these demands must be confined within a total of £82 million; that is, an additional £12 million will be provided to meet the most pressing cases.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVENUE</P>
    <P>The action taken in reducing spending which I have just outlined is very substantial, especially in the circumstances of a mid-year adjustment.  It has had the effect of reducing the amount of taxation which would otherwise have had to be raised.  But the scale of our problem is such that tax measures must still be significant.</P>
    <P>We cannot have recourse to income tax for two reasons.  First, the Government's commitment is to a reduction in the burden of taxation on the ordinary worker combined with a special tax credit for the spouse.  It would be quite inconsistent with this commitment to impose new burdens on the income taxpayer. Secondly, income tax changes cannot be introduced in the middle of a tax year because of the nature of the tax system and the method of calculating taxable incomes.  It is for this reason that, as was always envisaged, I will implement the Government's tax reform proposals, including the £9.60 tax credit for spouses and the new augmented child benefit, from the beginning of the next income tax year.</P>
    <P>For similar reasons it is not possible to have recourse to capital taxes in a budget introduced at short notice.  Measures of capital taxation are of their nature complex and, if drafted with insufficient care, can have unintended adverse effects on the economy as a whole.  The Government are, as indicated in our programme, undertaking a review of capital taxation with special reference to non-productive capital.  We are therefore compelled, whatever might be our wish otherwise, to rely today for the most part on indirect taxation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VALUE-ADDED TAX</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> My main proposal in this regard is for an increase in the present 10 per cent VAT rate to 15 per cent with effect from 1 September next.  This rate band covers by far the major share of expenditure liable to VAT and accordingly must be looked to in a situation where additional revenue is needed urgently.  Fifteen per cent as the main VAT rate will still stand comparison with the corresponding VAT rate in most countries in Western Europe.  This measure will, it is estimated, yield £28.2 million this year and £188.5 million in 1982.  In connection with this change, I should say that I am providing that the effective 3 per cent VAT rate on building, which is related statutorily to the 10 per cent rate, will remain unchanged; and that, because of the importance of agriculture to national production and exports, the flat-rate VAT refund for farmers will be raised to 1.5 per cent in order to offset the consequent increase in VAT on farm inputs.</P>
    <P>I will refer later in my statement to the Government's commitment to provide a VAT relief for agricultural contractors.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXCISE DUTIES</P>
    <P>In reviewing the levels of excise duties, I have taken into account the fact that the new 15 per cent VAT rate will apply to the main excisable goods from 1 September.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Beer</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am proposing a duty-based increase of 2p in the retail price of the pint of beer, to take effect immediately.  This is expected to bring in extra revenue of £5.3 million this year and £14.5 million in 1982.  This increase, together with the VAT change on 1 September, will make for a total tax increase of 5p to 6p on the pint of beer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Spirits</i>
    </P>
    <P>An immediate duty-based increase of 2p in the retail price of a glass of spirits is proposed.  This is expected to yield £2.5 million in 1981 and £4.5 million in 1982. Combined with the VAT change on 1 September, a total tax increase of 8p to 9p would be expected in the glass of spirits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wine</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I propose to increase by 10p the duty-based element in the retail price of a bottle of wine, to have immediate effect. The increase will be <i>pro rata</i> for stronger wines, and for sparkling wines it will be 20p per bottle.  The yield is estimated at £0.8 million in 1981 and £1.6 million in 1982.  For a bottle of wine at present costing £3, a total tax increase of 24p would result from this additional tax together with the VAT change on 1 September.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cigarettes and Tobacco</i>
    </P>
    <P>The duty-based tax on 20 cigarettes will be increased immediately by 4p, estimated to yield £5.4 million in 1981 and £13.1 million in 1982.  There will be a <i>pro rata</i> tax increase on tobacco.  This tax increase, together with the VAT change on 1 September, will result in an aggregate tax increase of 8p on 20 cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol, Road Diesel, Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) Used in Motor Vehicles</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the contribution to the balance of payments deficit by expenditures related to motor vehicles, particularly motor vehicle fuels.  Accordingly, I propose to supplement the VAT-related increases by immediate duty increases representing 4p per gallon on petrol, 4p per gallon on road diesel and 8p per gallon on liquid petroleum gas used in motor vehicles.  Combined with the proposed VAT change on 1 September, total tax increases of approximately 13.4p on petrol and 12p on road diesel will be involved.  These duty increases will yield £6.2 million in 1981 and £14 million in 1982.  I am arranging that the existing rebate for handicapped drivers will be increased so that the excise duty increase now will not affect them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Private Motor Vehicles</i>
    </P>
    <P>The purchase of private motor vehicles, which reached record levels earlier this year, represents a large element in the balance of payments deficit.  While the VAT change proposed will apply to such purchases, the Government are not satisfied that the impact will be adequate having regard to the serious balance of <Col N="580" /> payments position.  I propose, accordingly, to increase the excise duty on private motor vehicles, including motorcycles, from 40 per cent to 50 per cent with immediate effect.  The revenue yield is estimated at £8.5 million in 1981 and £32.3 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The abolition by the previous Government of road tax on almost all cars not only narrowed the tax base but ran counter to all balance of payments and energy considerations.  I propose, therefore, to reintroduce road tax on cars of 16 horse power and under with effect on and from 1 September at the rates in force in July 1977.  As a result of the restoration of road tax, the annual registration charge on these vehicles will be repealed for renewals on and from 1 September. I am also increasing the road tax on cars exceeding 16 horse power by £2 per horse power.  These changes will bring in £8 million in 1981 and £27.5 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that I will come later in my statement to the Government's commitment to provide a measure of relief on industrial fuel oil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to stamp duties.</P>
      <P>I propose to increase the stamp duty on cheques from 3p to 5p and to impose a new stamp duty of £5 on credit cards issued by banks and on charge cards issued by international companies.  I am also increasing the stamp duty chargeable on transfers of property between associated companies from a nominal rate of 50p to an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of 2 per cent. These changes will come into effect shortly.  They will yield an extra £0.65 million this year and £2.5 million in 1982.</P>
      <P Just="Center">BANKS</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's programme includes provision for a temporary levy on the banks pending the completion of the review of the taxation system affecting banks.  I have consulted the Central Bank and have received representations from the Associated Banks about this proposal. <Col N="581" /> I have come to the conclusion that a levy to yield £5 million in 1981 would be an appropriate contribution from the banking sector.  In arriving at this amount, I have attempted to strike a balance between what could be regarded as reasonable in view of the need for additional revenue and what would be prudent as a charge on the banks.  This measure will require legislation and, subject to this, it is intended that the levy will be payable on 1 December next.  The method of assessment of individual banks will be decided after consultation with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRICES</P>
    <P>The Government would be anxious that price increases consequent on today's taxation proposals should be fully justified and, in the case of items subject to price control, price increases must be notified and, where appropriate, await the making of new maximum price orders.  These will be made by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism who will determine the appropriate size and timing of increases.</P>
    <P>These price increases will of course be reflected in the consumer price index. Because of the delayed nature of some of the tax increases, the immediate effect on the index will be slight &mdash; less than 1 per cent in the August quarter.  The full effect of the tax increases will be approximately 3 per cent.  I shall be announcing later measures which will fully protect the weaker sections of the community against this price rise.</P>
    <P>The Government would impress on the House and on the community at large that increases in taxation are unavoidable if we are to make a serious attempt to meet the cost of our day-to-day public services.  It would be unrealistic to expect or to pretend that the process of phasing down a current deficit of the present scale could be a painless experience for the community.  I have already referred to the need for moderation in income trends.  All the more so, it would be unrealistic and indeed self-defeating for the community to attempt to compensate through higher incomes for these tax <Col N="582" /> increases.  I cannot sufficiently stress the fact that this would merely give a new impetus to the spiral of inflation with consequent losses in employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POST OFFICE CHARGES</P>
    <P>Post Office revenue for the year was projected in January at £319 million but later estimates suggested a shortfall of £25 million on this figure, because of a slower than expected pick-up in economic activity in the first half of the year which affected the volume of business. More recently, the industrial action affecting the issue of telephone accounts by members of the Civil and Public Services Staff Association in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is expected to increase this shortfall in revenue by a further £10 million.</P>
    <P>In principle, the postal and telecommunications services are expected to pay their way but heavy losses have been incurred on them in recent years.  Taxpayers generally should not be expected to carry losses on these services, the costs of which should be borne by the users. The increases last April in postal and telephone charges were insufficient to cover the costs of the services at their present levels.  However, recoupment in full of the losses in the remainder of this year would involve unduly high charges.</P>
    <P>It is proposed therefore to raise postal charges generally by 20 per cent with effect from 1 September next, the telephone and telex connection fees by £20 from the same date, and telecommunications charges generally by 5 per cent approximately from 1 October.  The new charges are calculated to rectify the position over the period to end 1982; but they do not provide for further increases in costs which may arise during that period. They should bring in about £6½ million extra revenue to the Exchequer in 1981 and £29 million in 1982.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCIAL PLANNING AND PROCEDURES</P>
    <P>These tax measures are unwelcome but unavoidable.  They underline the need to see that the present situation should not prevail any longer.  The reform of our <Col N="583" /> financial planning and procedures must be given priority to ensure that expenditures are properly aligned with the means to finance them.  I intend to move on this straight away.  It is not conducive to proper allocation of resources that proposals for public expenditure are presented to and debated by Dáil Éireann in one-year estimates, and in a format designed more for formal accounting audit than rational planning.  We need a new form of estimates document designed to direct attention to the results of public expenditure and the extent to which they meet the needs of the economy and society.</P>
    <P>The proposals should also be presented to the Dáil in good time to enable the discussions here to have a real effect on policy.</P>
    <P>With these objectives in mind I intend to pursue vigorously the following aspects of the Government's programme:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the publication of public expenditure estimates in the autumn preceding the commencement of the financial year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the correlation of the public expenditure estimates on a multi-annual basis with the public sector section of the national plan;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the facilitation of specific Dáil debate of the Government's capital expenditure and borrowing plans in the same way as the annual current estimates are now debated;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the improvement of the format of the estimates;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a review of conditions governing the classification of expenditure as capital;</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvement of procedures relating to the format, presentation and debate in the Oireachtas of the various annual reports of State spending bodies.</P>
    <P>I intend that these reforms will be accompanied by study of the concept of deficit budget reporting, which will place a special legal onus on Governments undertaking <Col N="584" /> deficit budgets to explain their consequences to the public.  I will also study the possibility of linking supplementary estimates with the revenue measures to finance them, which will thereby maintain the original balance of the annual budget.  The objective would be to secure that expenditure over and above the agreed budget provision would be paid for from revenue and not from borrowing.  Means of ensuring that spending agencies adhere more rigidly to authorised budgeted allocations are very necessary and will be examined.</P>
    <P>The new estimates timetable will require the whole process of the preparation of the budget to be brought forward by some months.  To avoid excessive disruption, it may be necessary to adopt a phased approach to these changes.  At this stage of the year it will not be possible to implement new procedures in the time remaining before the 1982 budget.  I am hopeful however that a start at least can be made, perhaps by way of presentation of estimates in November, in time for discussion, as far as the Dail programme permits before the budget.</P>
    <P>As a result of this reform programme, there should be increased awareness also of the relationship between the public services and the levels of taxation and/or borrowing needed to finance them.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new planning and finance units in Government Departments will play a major role in this reform programme.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that steps be taken quickly to reform the procedure of the Dail on a more general basis.  Amongst the measures on which urgent study is being undertaken are the enlargement of the powers of joint committees, fuller access by the general public to the legislative process and better facilities for Members to do their work.</P>
    <P>The intended effect of the measures I have just outlined will be to prevent the situation we now face from ever arising again.  There is no point deploring our present circumstances without advocating specific measures to prevent their recurrence.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PLANNING</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The Government programme has made it perfectly clear that economic and social planning will be a high priority.  A Minister of State, Deputy B. Desmond, with this special responsibility has been appointed and a National Planning Board will be established without delay.  Government planning for some time to come must focus on achieving the economic and financial stability on which sound development, both social and economic, ultimately depends.  In drawing up the plan, the Government will consult sectoral and other interest groups concerned.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GOVERNMENT PROGRAMME</P>
    <P>I have said earlier that the Government's programme will be implemented on a phased basis.  I stress that I am making provision today only for those elements of this programme which were planned to be brought into effect before the end of 1981.</P>
    <P>SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>One of the most important aims of the programme is to assist the most vulnerable section of our society, namely those who are dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The programme stated explicitly that all old age pensions would be increased by 5 per cent from the beginning of October as a first step towards a substantial continuing improvement in the real level of these payments.  Not only will this commitment now be fulfilled and old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory, increased by 5 per cent from October, but the increase will be extended to all other social welfare pensioners over the qualifying age for old age pensions, that is 66 years of age, and also to retirement pensioners.  In addition, weekly rates of benefit paid to all other welfare recipients will be increased by 3 per cent in compensation for the effects of the rises in indirect taxes.  These improvements will cost £10,500,000 in 1981 and £39 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>FOOD SUBSIDIES</P>
    <P>The Government's programme said <Col N="586" /> that there would be no further increases in 1981 in the prices of specified key foodstuffs, namely, bread, flour, milk, butter and margarine.  In pursuance of this undertaking, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism announced on 6 July, on behalf of the Government, that he would meet by a subsidy a bread price increase of 5p per 800-gram loaf which had been recommended by the National Prices Commission.  The 1981 cost of that decision is expected to be about £6 million.</P>
    <P>Further price increase applications in the present year could require up to about £5 million more in subsidies on foot of the undertaking in the programme. I am making the necessary provision for this.  This is very important for the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>ANTI-POVERTY PLAN</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Government's aim of eliminating poverty there is a firm commitment in the programme to constructive community action to tackle poverty, as recommended by the national committee in their final report on <i>Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty in Ireland.</i> The Government are especially concerned with the problems of the aged living alone and homeless young people. The results of this pilot programme are being examined by a review group who are expected to report shortly to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Immediately the recommendations of the review group are to hand, the Government will decide on the nature of the new structures to carry forward the work of the combat poverty team in this area.  I am making a contingency provision of £100,000 for this purpose, but a substantially larger sum will be necessary next year.</P>
    <P>ADAPTATION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS FOR THE DISABLED</P>
    <P>It is the Government's policy to ensure that public buildings are easily accessible to the disabled.  Suitable facilities continue to be included in the design of new buildings erected by the Office of Public Works.  In so far as their existing buildings are concerned, I am arranging for a speeding up of the modification work <Col N="587" /> necessary to afford facilities for the disabled, and am including an extra provision of £50,000 in 1981 for this purpose so as to ensure that no such modification which could otherwise be undertaken this year will be delayed for lack of funds.</P>
    <P>EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED PERSONS</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent employment quota for disabled persons in the public sector will be implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>YOUTH EMPLOYMENT AGENCY</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the programme to set up a youth employment agency to integrate and extend youth employment schemes.  The necessary administrative preparations are being put in hands immediately.  Funding the agency will, as indicated in the programme, involve a levy of 1 per cent on incomes.  Legislation for this purpose will be introduced as soon as the Dáil resumes after the Summer recess.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of youth, the Government have already decided that special standing will be given to the National Youth Council and other youth bodies as proposed in their programme.</P>
    <P>AGRICULTURE</P>
    <P>Our programme includes a wide range of improvements for agriculture.  The Government are most anxious to provide the right conditions in which farmers can overcome the difficulties of the last two years and increase production again.  In this context, the Minister for Agriculture has had discussions yesterday and this morning in Brussels on the implementation of measures to aid farmers' recovery and the intention is to move as quickly as possible.  The Government believe that working in close co-operation with the Community is the way to get the best arrangements for Irish farmers.  Clearance by the Commission of the proposed aids will be sought prior to their implementation. I am earmarking £8,500,000 for additional expenditures in 1981 for this purpose.  The Minister for Agriculture will, in the course of the budget debate, provide further information in regard to the new measures and the further <Col N="588" /> steps to implement the full Government Programme for agriculture.</P>
    <P>EDUCATION GRANTS</P>
    <P>Improvements in the grants scheme for higher education have already been announced by the Minister for Education. These improvements are estimated to cost £2.35 million this year and £6.5 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>HOUSE IMPROVEMENTS</P>
    <P>Details of the new scheme of house improvement grants for certain basic amenities will be announced shortly by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  I am providing £3 million for this purpose in the current year.</P>
    <P>HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, ETC.</P>
    <P>Meeting the legitimate demands of would-be house purchasers, particularly young married couples, for housing finance under the present system is a problem requiring urgent attention.  Discussions with interested parties are already under way and the Government expect to be in a position at an early date to formulate proposals in connection with the establishment of the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    <P>In order to speed up housing and general construction programmes, the procedure for compulsory purchase will be expedited.  The anomaly of compensating owners for not developing land adjacent to other serviced land will be removed.</P>
    <P>OTHER PROGRAMME MEASURES</P>
    <P>I have decided that legislation will be introduced to protect our archaeological heritage and will be presenting proposals to the Government next week.  The proposals should have the effect, in particular, of helping to avoid situations such as that at Wood Quay arising in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government will also seek to improve economic efficiency by introducing legislation to modify restrictions which impede efficient road haulage.</P>
    <P>TAXATION INCENTIVES</P>
    <P>The dominant objective in the Government's taxation programme is the reform of the income tax code including the <Col N="589" /> introduction of a tax credit system. Because of the administrative problems associated with income tax changes in mid-year, this reform must necessarily await the beginning of the next income tax year for its implementation.  The social insurance and health contribution changes which form part of this reform will come into effect at the same time.</P>
    <P>In the meantime other taxation changes in the programme are being implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Fuel Oil</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the programme to reduce by 50 per cent the tax increase on industrial fuel oil imposed in the 1980 budget.  This tax increase was 5 pence a gallon and, in accordance with the commitment, the tax will be reduced by 2½ pence a gallon from 1 December next on purchases by manufacturing industry of oils in the residual fuel oil category.  The reduction will cost £500,000 this year and £6 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small Businesses &mdash; VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>I wish to assist small business in some way through the tax mechanism.  There is limited scope at this time because of the cost implications.  I will however increase the present registration thresholds for VAT purposes and I would hope to make provision for this in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT on Agricultural Contractors</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government wish to encourage and maintain agricultural contracting services throughout rural areas.  On foot of our commitment in this regard, I propose to reduce the effective VAT rate on agricultural contractor charges to 3 per cent with effect from 1 September 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Profit Sharing</i>
    </P>
    <P>A further commitment in the Government programme relates to the exemption from income tax of shares given by companies to their workers under profit sharing arrangements.  Other European countries have made considerable progress in promoting the financial involvement of workers in their firms.  I am anxious <Col N="590" /> that we should move forward in this area, too, with the minimum of delay.  I am, therefore, having this matter examined urgently.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SAVINGS SCHEMES</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the contribution which saving can make to financing investment and monetary restraint, I shall be concerned at all times to make national saving in all forms as attractive as possible to investors, large and small, consistent with the costs involved.  In this regard I have been examining ways in which small savings schemes can be improved in order to make a greater contribution to Exchequer funding.  I am satisfied that there is scope for further improvement and I have decided to introduce modifications in three of the schemes: (1)  I propose to increase the rate of interest used in determining the prize fund for prize bonds to 8½ per cent and I shall make an announcement later about the improvements which this will make possible in the range of prizes.</P>
    <P>(2)  To encourage further investment in savings certificates, I have decided to increase the limit on individual holdings from £15,000 to £25,000.</P>
    <P>(3)  Earlier this year the minimum age limit for the purchase of index-linked savings bonds was reduced from 65 to 55 years and the maximum amount which a person may hold in bonds was increased to £3,000.  I am now increasing this limit to £5,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">1981 DEFICIT</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit which would have emerged this year in the absence of the measures announced today is estimated at £947 million.  The various expenditure reductions which I have outlined will reduce this by £148 million and I have proposed additional revenue changes of £77 million, giving a total reduction in the deficit of £225 million. This will be partly offset by the cost, totalling £35 million, of the additional expenditures to implement priority items in the Government programme; by the <Col N="591" /> further shortfall of £10 million in Post Office receipts which I have already mentioned; and by an estimated reduction of £20 million in the underlying general tax revenue buoyancy in order to allow for the effects of this package of measures. The revised current deficit emerges, therefore, at £787 million, or 8 per cent of GNP, a reduction of almost £160 million on what would otherwise have been the outturn.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the Public Capital Programme is estimated at £1,785 million, with a further £99 million being provided for capital expenditures outside the Government programme.  The resources available to defray capital expenditure are estimated at £1,034 million, leaving a balance of £850 million to be found by borrowing by the Exchequer itself.</P>
    <P>Together with the current budget deficit of £787 million, the total Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1981 is now estimated at £1,637 million, or 16½ per cent of GNP.  This figure is £336 million less than that with which the Government were confronted when they commenced their examination of the public finances on taking office.</P>
    <P>The Government's immediate concern was to achieve an improvement in the budget position for 1981 because of the unacceptable position which we inherited. In effect we were dealing with a financial emergency.  We had to identify and introduce measures with the least possible delay to deal with the situation. Other measures will have to follow with all possible speed according as we are in a position to introduce them.  I have specifically in mind the need to finance the elements of the joint programme which are being introduced this year and which have been indicated in this budget.  This involves changes in pay-related social insurance which will be put in the form of legislation after the summer recess but they are unlikely to yield any significant revenue until 1982.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUDGET PROSPECTS 1982</P>
    <P>Although we have been attacking the immediate problem of 1981 we have been <Col N="592" /> conscious all along that an even more important consideration has been the need to improve the opening budgetary position for 1982.  Had matters been allowed to drift, we would be facing the prospect of a current deficit of more than £1,500 million in 1982, merely to maintain the present level of services.</P>
    <P>As a result of the measures we have taken, this 1982 deficit will be reduced by £450 million.  This includes £50 million saved on debt interest by the reduction we have made in 1981 borrowing; this £50 million would otherwise have had to be subtracted from the money available for spending next year.</P>
    <P>While the action we have taken now will result in a very substantial reduction in the problem facing us next year, the position is still daunting.  It has to be remembered that public capital investment has also to be financed next year. Our firm resolve, therefore, is to continue our attack on current expenditure in the coming months in order to protect the availability of resources for capital investment, to safeguard also the implementation of the Government's tax reform programme and to move further towards eliminating the current deficit.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY</P>
    <P>The firmness of the Government's tackling of the economic and financial problems with which we are faced will be good for confidence, both domestically and abroad, in the future of our economy.</P>
    <P>We have made a start &mdash; but only a start &mdash; in bringing the balance of payments deficit back to an acceptable level. The deficit this year should now emerge below the £1,500 million that was otherwise in prospect.  More important, this budget and our plan for the future will now ensure that the deficit will remain within tolerable limits.  A stable basis for continued economic growth will thereby be established.</P>
    <P>We need economic growth now, as well as in the future, and I have designed the measures I have announced to guard against any possibility that the economy might be put into recession.  I am confident that the steps that will be taken to <Col N="593" /> contain current public expenditure will not have any noticeably adverse impact on growth.  On the capital side, the additional £30 million I am providing for local authority housing will support activity in the building industry and, of course, capital expenditure has emerged from the Government's review of the finances with an increased global allocation, even if small, as compared with the original provision in the budget last January.</P>
    <P>A growth rate of about 2 per cent, well above the international average, is attainable this year.  By acting now to avoid the necessity of harsh economic corrective measures at some future time, the Government are lifting a threat of unemployment on a much larger scale.  This lays the foundation for real and sustainable growth which will provide more jobs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>This budget is designed to face reality. In the last ten years we have multiplied our national debt by eight.  Policies or expectations based on continuing that rate of increase are just not viable.  This budget will not reduce the debt but it will prevent it reaching the enormous proportions it would otherwise have attained next year and will improve the way borrowed money is used.  It is a start towards building a genuinely secure economic future on the solid foundation of a solvent Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Today's adjustments in expenditure and in taxation are as much as, in the Government's view, can be made at short notice.  We held back from more drastic remedies, because of the adverse impact they would have on employment.  We have gone as far as necessary but no further.  We ask public support for this budget so that this country can maintain its freedom to order its own economic <Col N="594" /> affairs and to design its own social programmes.</P>
    <P>Our task today is not of course entirely concerned with the problem of correcting Government finances.  I have announced today the first phase of the Government's programme to develop the economy and to achieve social justice.  The other elements of this Programme will be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier that the tax reform measures, including the tax credit for spouses and the new child benefit, will come into effect next April.  I have referred to our plans for the Youth Employment Agency.  Later this year we will reduce the social insurance costs of manufacturing industry and tourism.  We will implement our programme to boost agriculture, restore reconstruction grants and guarantee no increase in the price of certain basic foodstuffs.  The other aspects of the programme will also be receiving early attention and the Government's aim is to ensure that in two years from now all aspects of the programme will be under way.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for hope that the world economy will strengthen in the coming months.  We must make the most of this opportunity.  We can do so if we have the will.  Ireland has great strengths in its agricultural resources, its modern industrial structure and its young and expanding population.  Today's budget is the first step in the planned and determined effort this Government will make to use all of these advantages to the full and for the benefit and future security of the community.</P>
    <P>But the Government can only do so much.  The decisive factor will be the response of the people.  That response will determine whether we overcome our current difficulties and put our economy back on a path of fast but sound advance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures mooted by both the Minister here in the House today and by the <Col N="600" /> Taoiseach on television on Friday night of £950 million are not in accordance with the facts as we knew them a very short while ago.  The figure then was substantially lower than that mentioned now and last Friday.  The Taoiseach was the first to laugh but perhaps he would also be aware of the statement made by his Minister for Finance on 2 July last, just three weeks ago, when he said that the present figure would be in the order of somewhat more than £100 million less than the figure now being mooted.  In other words what this Government are doing is taking the advice given them by a national newspaper to paint the picture as black as possible and propose difficult measures now so that they can gain the benefits later.  That is purely a political exercise or alternatively perhaps one of panic as we have seen already in the three weeks that this Government have been there.  But it is one of those two reasons and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Let me talk for a moment about the scenario that led up to today.  As far back as December last, January of this year and even right through the election campaign we had the present Taoiseach lamenting and complaining about the problems of our financial situation.  Yet it was he who introduced a programme for an election campaign that was costed at about £1,000 million.  Where is the responsibility here?  I say that was all part of the beginning of the backdrop.  With the election over, the two parties met to formulate a further programme.  The Government was formed.  Then the wheels of publicity got into operation and the scenario was created for what we have seen here today.  The scenario today indeed is no different.  I would ask the Labour Party Members in particular where is there one item of help for employment?  The Minister, by his own admission, agrees that this is a deflationary budget.  He says that Post Office revenue that he is taking into account will drop by £20 million simply because of a drop in activity.  We are seeing deflationary measures by a Government in their first week of office.</P>
    <P>We, by sound policy decisions in Government, decided to aid areas like <Col N="601" /> employment, agriculture, food subsidies and social welfare.  Is anybody saying that we should not have done it?  I certainly believe that as a Government we were right to do it and I would say to all Members of this House, particularly to new Members, that it is their duty to read carefully the comments of the present members of this Government, their Leader, their Minister for Finance, their Tánaiste and all the other Members, and their contributions to the budget debates in January, February and March of this year.  There they will see the greatest about turn by any group of people in such a short time.  There is only one reason for this and that is pure political expediency. They are aware that their tenure of office will be a short one.  They are also aware that their tenure of office is insecure. They will try to use that publicity dishonestly and it is calculated to mislead people in order to try to secure a stronger base within the community.  Their efforts to date have been futile.</P>
    <P>On the budget tables one could almost say we had so much noise all week&mdash;we had ministerial broadcasts, state of the nation speeches&mdash;that one would have expected major decisions to be taken here today.  But what are we talking about?  We are talking about a budget deficit still there of £767 million, not far away from what the real and not the imaginary one would have been.  This Government are already using hypothetical figures and certain assumptions which cannot stand up.  The Minister has projected a certain budget deficit into 1982.  He knows, as does everybody on the benches opposite, that it is absolutely misleading to project a deficit into 1982 without telling the people, without telling the media what assumptions were being taken into consideration.  It is a hypothetical figure until all these asumptions are laid down and spelled out clearly and the Minister opposite knows that well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go from there to some of the comments by the Minister in his speech to the House and will deal first of all with the balance of payments.  He has referred to the current position and he has projected it forward to 1982.  He is now trying to claim for this Government something that was about to happen because of Fianna Fail policy. He does not have to take my word for this and neither does the House.  I can refer them to two recent surveys published, one by the OECD and one by an American business review group, saying that because of the policies&mdash;I am talking about the policies that existed under Fianna Fáil&mdash;our exports would increase substantially in the latter part of this year and more especially in 1982, thus giving a very substantial drop in the balance of payments.  The Minister here today in <Col N="603" /> this House is trying to claim credit for a foundation that has already been laid for the measures here before us.  If the balance of payments is high, Members of the House, particularly new Members, should know that an investment plan of the magnitude launched by Fianna Fail earlier this year was bound in the short term to affect the balance of payments and increase imports.  I would wish dearly that every item of expenditure under the investment plan would be available within our own shores, but alas that is not so yet at any rate.  While in the short term it would increase the balance of payments, in the longer term, because of the investment in infrastructure and industry, because of the building up of our exports, our balance of payments would be reduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to incomes policy and he went on to talk about public sector pay and numbers employed in the public sector.  I am sorry to understand from the Minister that there appears to be an embargo placed on recruitment into the public service.  If it is an embargo similar to that imposed by the last Coalition Government in the mid-seventies then one has to ask if we are further taking away from the employment opportunities for young people.  The Minister referred to 50 per cent of our population being under the age of 25.  Are there for the time being under this Government no further opportunities for any of those boys and girls in the public service?  Was it a wise decision in 1975?  A further proof of my earlier point is that there is not one whit of help or support for employment in the package before us today.  It can be said that it contains more promises and plans than real content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding prices, the Minister tells the House that his measures will mean a 3 per cent increase in the CPI.  Again I am afraid that he is not telling the full story. In his statement he has said that there will be an imposition of ESB and CIE charges.  How much over and above the 3 per cent are those charges?  Perhaps it is another way of not telling the full story to the House despite the claims at some <Col N="604" /> point in the statement of honest presentation and admissions.</P>
    <P>Mention of CIE reminds me that the Dublin public have not had a bus on the streets for three weeks now.  Provincial and city services have been disrupted while a Government sit in power who claimed in Opposition days to have all the answers to problems of this nature.  I merely mention that in passing.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the ESB.  If there is a surcharge here it can be described as penal on the ordinary social welfare recipients and the lower paid people and, of course, it is a problem for industry also.</P>
    <P>I referred to the embargo on recruitment to the public service and then the reference to public sector pay.  It is not clear what the Minister has in mind here. He talks about reviewing the conciliation and arbitration scheme and consultation with the trade unions.  The conciliation and arbitration scheme has served the various Governments and the public service well, but again it appears that there is now some popularity to be gained in attacking a certain group in our society. That group is a very wide one consisting of gardaí, teachers and many others as well as civil servants.  One must ask again how beneficial was the second embargo imposed by the previous Coalition Government in the mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>Regarding duty impositions, VAT has increased from a 10 per cent rating to 15 per cent.  Did the backbenchers on the Government side hear about that 50 percent penal increase?  Did they hear that properly?</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The 10 per cent rating covers non-luxury and semi-luxury goods and it contains 60 per cent of the whole range of goods covered by VAT. That 10 per cent is now increased to 15 per cent, an enormous and very penal increase of 50 per cent.  It is followed by increase on beer, spirits, wine, cigarettes, tobacco, petrol, road diesel and liquid petroleum gas.</P>

      <P>There is no give for the ordinary housewife.  The £9.60 promised to her at every door has not come yet.  It may come next year or later. Meanwhile the ordinary housewife going into a shop will know that she has to pay 15 per cent VAT &mdash; not 10 per cent VAT &mdash; from 1 September because of the Government who have now taken over.</P>
      <P>I would remind those new Deputies in the House to read particularly what the present Tánaiste had to say when he was replying to the budget debate in April. He spoke then about the imposition of indirect taxation and he said that this was inflationary, that it was increasing the cost of living and that workers should be compensated for every percentage point in those increases.  How does the Tánaiste feel now in the light of his speech then and the 3 per cent plus introduced by way of CPI increase by the Minister today?  In the Minister's words the budget is deflationary.  Here it is inflationary and contributing to inflation.  We will have a cutting down and a slowing down in activity on the one hand and increasing costs on the other.</P>
      <P>Regarding the increases, the Minister said that some of the policies are being implemented.  I would say it is a very minute portion, made even more minute in the way it was presented, for example, the rebate promised on fuel applies from 1 December &mdash; the latest possible date. We will be questioning these figures later because they do not seem to add up to what we believe is the real figure involved.  On the Financial Resolutions we will have a greater opportunity of questioning the assumptions the Minister is making about revenue from the various increases mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was under the impression, as was the public, that the Government were introducing a 5 per cent increase across the board to social welfare recipients.  Others are getting a 3 per cent increase.  Surely the Minister will not try to persuade me that the recipients receiving a 5 per cent increase will be compensated for the increased costs imposed in the budget? Therefore, there is no chance that recip <Col N="606" /> ients in receipt of a 3 per cent increase could be compensated.</P>
    <P>On the question of the restoration of private motor tax, I smile when I look at the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and recall his comments on these benches when we had a modest increase in registration fees a few short months ago.  Now the Minister for Finance is restoring road tax.  Has he some specific complaint against the motorist?  Is he anti-motorist? He has increased petrol and road tax, in addition to all that has been imposed on them already.  He has often said in this House how essential the motor car is today both in rural and urban areas.  It is certainly essential in Dublin city since this Government came to power because there are no buses to take people to and from their destinations.</P>
    <P>The financial statement presented to the House is so vague that it is difficult to understand parts of it.  The Minister said hospital and prescription costs will be borne to a greater extent than heretofore by those users who are able to pay for them.  Who are those users?  The Minister and I might not agree on the interpretation of who might be able to pay for them.  He may have one category, I may have another.  It should be spelled out very clearly who those people are.  The Minister goes on to say appropriate changes will be made from 1 August next in the terms of the drug refund scheme administered by the health boards and in hospital charges.  Is the Minister saying that the PRSI contributor is going to have further impositions levied on him?  He has already had indirect taxation.  Is there now going to be a further imposition for health charges?  The Minister should be honest and tell us what it means.  He goes on to say that substantial savings will be achieved by the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Defence and others.  What kind of savings?  Will there be cutbacks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said all these various Departmental savings <Col N="607" /> will amount to £31 million in 1981.  In what areas?  In general, reductions will leave Departments with allocations not less than the original allocation in the January budget.  We will be watching that very carefully.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment is studying the possibilities of enabling local authorities to gain access to new sources of revenue, other than rates.  We are aware the present Minister, at a seminar in Donegal late last year, said he was personally in favour of restoration of rates on houses.  Since he has assumed this portfolio, will rates be put back on private dwellings?</P>

      <P>Postal charges are to be raised by 20 per cent from 1 September next.  Telephone and telex connections fees will be raised by £20 from the same date and telecommunications charges generally will be increased by 5 per cent approximately from 1 October. This will cure the list of telephone applications where my colleague had been making such progress in installing telephones.  It is an enormous continuing imposition on business firms.  There is nothing in the budget to help the business sector.  We have a budget that contains taxes on expenditure, no capital taxation, although the advocates on the other side of the House have said they will introduce it.  How soon?  This was a very good exercise in publicity but remember there is more to governing than presentation. <Col N="608" /> There are references to figures and they are very important.  It is also very important that the finances of the country be guided in the right direction.  We have always supported the idea of curbing the current deficit, but over a period and commencing at the appropriate time.  The appropriate time is not now.  When we were in office we succeeded in bringing the economy through the worst ever world recession in far better shape than the other EEC member states.  All the evidence is that the second half of this year will see a marked upturn in world trade from which we can substantially benefit because of the policies of the previous government.  That improvement in world trade will be enhanced enormously next year.  The 2 per cent growth rate which the Minister claims was projected on Fianna Fáil policies.  On those same policies the OECD projected a growth rate next year for this country of not less than 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>This budget is deflationary, on the Minister's own admissions.  There is no whit of enjoyment for those seeking employment.  There is no joy for school leavers whose main aim in July of any year is to get a job.</P>
      <P>Will they now have little or no hope from a Government without a commitment to the greatest single problem in our community?  I do not deny that unemployment is a problem.  However, we can hold our heads high in comparison with conditions across the water because of the monetarist policies which, I fear, are now being adopted by this Government. Because of these policies in the UK unemployment there has soared to new heights.  We have a growing work force, increased numbers going on the labour market.  Through all our time we succeeded, despite the world recession, in keeping unemployment at reasonable levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my first, immediate reaction to this unnecessary budget which, purely for low-down political expediency, is presented by the Minister to this House this evening.  There will be many reactions during the coming days.  All Members of this House have an obligation and a duty to examine what I have said here and to <Col N="609" /> ask themselves: was this budget really necessary, was it the right time to introduce the measures which have been introduced? Half of our population is under 25 years of age and this percentage is growing.  They are well educated and deserve everything the country can do for them.</P>
    <P>Government is not all about sums all the time, although sums must be done accurately and correctly.  Government is mainly about people.  If there is a difference between us and the parties opposite it is that we were always flexible and could adjust our situation to cater for the greatest needs of our people at any time. The greatest need of our people during a recession is to create jobs and to keep people in jobs.  In this, our performance was a good one.  We are now moving out and I hope that the deflationary measures adopted today will not be the beginning of monetarist policies.</P>
    <P>Today's budget is a very poor reflection on the Government.  It will set back the progress which has been achieved.  It is incredible that a Minister for Finance should admit that the budget effect will be deflationary.  This can only mean major unemployment, less opportunities for our young people.  We had made arrangements for the recruitment of substantial extra numbers of gardaí.  Has that decision now been shelved?  These are all serious questions which every Member must ask himself or herself before voting on the tough resolutions imposing additional financial burdens on the ordinary people and not giving one single bit of compensation, other than a promise to bring in legislation to deal with youth employment, a promise to bring in, possibly next April, some of this £9.60 mentioned for women in the home.  Perhaps when April comes for some other reason it will be postponed until September or April 1983.  That is the kind of cloudcuckoo land idea this Government will be trying to convey, through the media, in this House during their short tenure of office.</P>

    <P>The effect of this resolution is to increase immediately the rates of excise duty on an average 75 centilitre bottle of wine by amounts varying between the equivalents of 9p approximately and 18p approximately per bottle depending on the alcoholic strength of the wine.  When VAT of 10 per cent is taken into account the increase will raise the total tax content on a bottle of wine by amounts varying between 10p and 20p per bottle.  It depends on the strength of the wine which, as the House will be aware, is very variable.  The resultant increase in revenue in the current financial year is estimated at an additional £0.8 million and £1.6 million in a full year.  If Members opposite have any questions I will endeavour to answer them.</P>

      <P>This proposal is really for the optics.  It is not of great significance and we do not intend to get very excited about it.  It seems to be a bottle. tax, a specific money amount per bottle. It is not related to the <i>ad valorem</i> value of the product.  The same duty will apply <Col N="617" /> to a bottle costing £1 as to a bottle costing £40, the only variation being on the alcoholic strength and not on the value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As indicated in the Financial Resolution, which the Leader of the Opposition has received, the grade of duty in respect of sparkling wine is 3.02p per litre whereas on still wine of an alcoholic content by volume not exceeding 15 per cent it is 1.52 per litre.  There is a differentiation between these two.  In general the Leader of the Opposition is correct in saying that within these bands it does not matter what the price of the bottle is.  Once it comes within one of the categories of alcoholic content the duty applies.  Once it moves up to the alcoholic range it moves into another band where a higher <i>pro-rata</i> duty is applied.</P>

      <P>The Opposition have more experience of this matter than I but my understanding is that the position has always been as it is now proposed to be with the duty levied in the way indicated. There was never an <i>ad valorem</i> duty and this is not happening as a result of an EEC requirement.  It is merely a continuation of an existing Irish practice.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975);</P>

      <P>(2)  THAT the duty of excise on beer imposed by paragraph 7(1) of the Order of 1975 shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 22nd day of July, 1981, at the rate of £119.647 for, in the case of all beer brewed within the State, every 36 gallons of worts of a specific gravity of 1,055 degrees, and, in the case of all imported beer, every 36 gallons of beer of which the worts were before fermentation of a specific gravity of 1,055 degrees, in lieu of the rate mentioned in section 31(1) of the Act of 1981.</P>
      <P>(3)  THAT, subject to paragraph 5 of the Imposition of Duties (No. 250) (Beer) Order, 1981 (S.I.

      <P>The effect of this Resolution is to immediately increase the <Col N="619" /> excise duty on beer by the equivalent of 1.82p on the pint of average gravity.  This increase will attract an additional payment of .18p VAT at the 10 per cent rate making a total tax increase straight away of 2p on the pint.  The resultant increase in revenue in the current financial year will amount to approximately £5.3 million or £14.5 million in a full year.  As a result of the increase in VAT as from 1 September there will be a further increase in the price of this commodity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and his party vehemently opposed the increase in the January budget and I would like to know how this turn about can be explained.  What contribution will this make to the increase in the CPI?  The Minister says that the extra revenue expected to be raised this year is £5.3 million.  In the budget statement today the Minister also said that revenue, with the exception of Post Office charges, was buoyant.  That can be attributed possibly to Fianna Fáil policies in Government.  Is the revenue already there from beer in line?  The Minister claimed that an increase would have a huge impact on employment in the beer and spirits industry last January.  Can he say what impact this increase will have?  Is the Minister aware of the plans in Guinnesses' brewery to drop about 2,100 jobs over a period?  Is the Minister not fearful that in view of the approach in this budget, its inflationary impact on the old reliables, the enormous imposition of VAT and the number of items affected by it, the imposition on the housewife and the motorist, any further pressure on beer will further affect employment in the industry?  Were such things taken into consideration when this budget was being formulated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's figure of £14.5 million in 1982 and £5.3 million in the current year is correct &mdash; I take it that 1.82p will be applied now and the VAT content will go on from 1 September &mdash; this is due to Fianna Fáil policies and it is a rather buoyant figure.  The Minister is well aware that his Government have already given a sizeable increase in the price of the pint of the beer.  What increase will now <Col N="620" /> go on in the public house for a pint?  Will it be 2p, 1.8p or does somebody gain the advantage between now and 1 September of the difference between the two?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be 2p straight away as indicated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the increase based on the 10 per cent VAT which is the rate of VAT applying now and when the excise duty comes into effect.  Adding together the excise duty increase of 1.82p and the additional payment arising <i>pro rata</i> from the application of the 10 per cent VAT rate to an increased total price brings the amount to 1.82p plus 0.18p which is 2p. The Deputy wished to know if there had been a decline in the consumption of beer as a result of the increases he introduced and if the revenue buoyancy figures which he had projected had been maintained. There has not been a significant decline in the consumption of beer and the revenue projections have been maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the position of certain breweries which are facing difficulties and I assure the Deputy that these were considered before we decided on this increase.  I have been advised that the problems being faced in the brewery which the Deputy had in mind are not attributable to the levels of excise duty which we inherited or which we are now introducing but that they relate to rationalisations being undertaken in the brewery in question <Col N="621" /> for reasons which it would not be proper for me to divulge if I could.  The problems are not as a result of excise duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in saying that the increases the Minister is imposing today are 2p on a pint of beer and 2p on a glass of spirits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The next resolution has to do with spirits and we will deal with that then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but, as it relates to the Financial Resolution before us, surely the Minister is aware, as most politicians would be, that in drinking terms half a glass of whiskey and a pint are compared as a drink unit in any pub.  The effect of what the Minister is doing here today is being weighted in favour of spirits and against the pint.  In other words, effectively, from the point of view of a drink unit price in the publichouse or at the hotel counter, he is imposing 2p on the pint and only 1p on the half glass of spirits, which is the comparable drink.  Is the Minister not aware that that imbalance has been of particular concern to all breweries in this country because of a substantial drop in consumption of beer and stout when it happened in the past?  He is now helping to contribute to a continued differential between those two drinks.  Why did the Minister not take that into consideration? I am sure the employees and management of those breweries, who have so many problems, would be very interested to know.  It is basically in the interests of equity that drink units that compare in drinking terms in publichouses should be increased at about the same level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although there has been, as the Deputy correctly points out, in recent budgets a one-for-one relationship between the increase in the excise duty on the pint and the increase on the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my predecessor restored that balance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="622" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am really saying is that the Deputy is correct in what he was saying about this balance being adhered to in the past.  But that balance is not actually justified in full by the relative alcohol content of the two, the half one and the pint of stout or beer.  It may interest the Deputy to know that there is .038 pints of pure alcohol in a pint of beer whereas there is the equivalent of .025 pints of alcohol in the half one.  There-fore, there is a slightly greater alcoholic content in beer, comparing the pint and the half one.  I am merely making that point for the record.  Therefore, in terms of alcoholic content this one-for-one relationship is not exact.</P>
      <P>However, that is not the real reason for what we have done on this occasion. The reason is &mdash; perhaps the Deputy and the House might suspect &mdash; that spirits have proven to be more price sensitive. It has been the experience that past increases in spirits, on the half one, on the basis of equivalence with the pint of stout have proven to have a much more deflationary effect on the consumption of spirits than an equivalent increase in the price of the pint has on the consumption of pints.  There is a worry in the Department of Finance, in the Revenue Commissioners and indeed in the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is concerned with the distilling industry, that an increase on this occasion of exactly the same amount on the half one as is being imposed on a pint of beer would have serious effects for the distilling industry. Therefore, we have chosen to implement an increase which is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will meet the Deputy's request if he will allow me finish. The discrimination to which he referred has been implemented on this occasion.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that when the effect of the total increase imposed in this budget&mdash; this includes not just the immediate increase in excise duties but also the consequential increase as at 1 September arising from the general increase in the 10 per cent VAT rate to 15 per cent, <Col N="623" /> which applies to both spirits and beer &mdash; is taken into account the increase in beer will be 5.5p as against 8.5p for a full glass of whiskey.  Therefore, the gap will not be quite as wide when one has the final result of the budget as at 1 September as it is now in respect of the excise duties alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So the real increase in the price of the pint of beer in today's budget from 1 September effectively is 5.5p.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The omission by the Minister is a very significant and damaging one.  He does not know what will be the effect on the consumer price index of the increase he is proposing on beer.  That is what he has just told the House.  I am sure the same position applies in regard to spirits and probably to tobacco and a number of other items.  He just does not know.  He has not got the figures and, had he even looked at them they would be available to him now.  It is very surprising to say the least &mdash; and I am putting it mildly when I say that &mdash; that the Minister does not know that figure.  One <Col N="624" /> thing that is quite clear is that the figure he gave us in regard to the effect of this budget on the consumer price index is a wrong figure.  That is one thing that is clear.  One does not know, but one assumes, that in giving us a figure of 3 percentage points he did not include the effect of adding the VAT increases on 1 September&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if he did, I doubt very much if he included the effect, when those increases are imposed on 1 September, of the mark-up that is charged in the shops and, in this case, in public houses: what effect the mark-up will have when that is added in and on all the other items on the consumer price index.  I venture to suggest that the figure the Minister gave us of 3 per cent will turn out to be quite inadequate in comparison with the real figure of the imposition on the consumer price index.  This mark-up effect is of very considerable importance not alone in relation to these items but perhaps more importantly to an item we will be dealing with later, that is the increase in the value-added tax.  Of course it is a factor for which the Minister does not &mdash; and I do not blame him for this, he has good precedent for it &mdash; accept responsibility, if you like, as far as the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is what I am saying, there is a very good precedent for it. The point is that the effect on the consumer price index is the most important factor to be judged in regard to many aspects of this budget in relation to its effect on the economy.  It is not the only aspect.  Certainly if the effect of this budget on the consumer price index is anything like I suspect it will be, then this budget will turn out to be disastrous.  We are dealing here with a resolution which <Col N="625" /> illustrates this point very well.  The response of the Minister to the question put to him by Deputy G. Fitzgerald illustrates, I am afraid, that the Minister and the Government, in preparing this budget, did not know or did not care what effect it would have on the consumer price index, a vital matter as far as the future of our whole economy is concerned, a vital matter as far as the effect on wages, on wage claims, on social welfare recipients and on a whole host of other things.  As far as they are all concerned this is vital and the Minister does not know or does not care what is the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to allay the Deputy's fears I can tell him that the effect on the CPI of the full increase, including the increase in VAT, will come to .622 in respect of beer.  I am sure the Deputy realises that the figures for the CPI, which are given in respect of tax increases in the budget, reflect only the increase in prices resulting from the increases in taxation. I am sure the Deputy is also aware that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the National Prices Commission have at their disposal a means for guarding against any unwarranted increases in prices by the retailers of those products which exceed that justified by the tax increases.  If other increases occur for other reasons, such as an increase in brewers' costs or in publicans' costs, those are examined by the National Prices Commission and sanctions are given as an entirely independent exercise which has nothing whatsoever to do with increases in excise duties.  The figure for the CPI which I gave in regard to the tax increases, 3 per cent, the total effect of the tax increases in the budget, reflects the full increase, including the immediate excise increases and increases in VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the margin at retail level on beer is between 30 per cent and 40 per cent and in some cases it goes as high as 42 per cent?  Is he aware of that the passing on of the additional margin is more or less <Col N="626" /> automatic where substantial increases in duty of the kind envisaged here are proposed and the true increase in the pint of beer is not 6p, as has been implied by the Minister, but at the very minimum is 8p and if they are to maintain their full margin it is 8½p?  As I know from bitter experience, where you have halfpennies you always have to round them up.  The actual increase here that will be paid by the consumer is likely to be 9p a pint on stout.  The CPI effect of 9p a pint on stout is between .9 per cent and 1 per cent on the CPI for beer alone.  This is only one of eight Financial Resolutions here today.  The figure here is 1 per cent for this commodity alone and not .22 per cent which the Minister tried to fob off on the House at an earlier stage in reply to a question by Deputy Fitzgerald. Would it not be more honest for the Minister to stand up and say that the increase in the price of beer on 1 September will be between 8p and 9p and that the CPI effect is between .9 per cent and 1 per cent?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy thinks that what he has described will happen he must have very little confidence in the arrangements for the control of drink prices, which were within his charge for four years and which he handed on to this Government.  As the Deputy should be aware, there is a standstill order, which was introduced by his predecessor, in regard to prices of alcohol and the increases are sanctioned on the basis of that standstill order and expressed in pennies per pint.  If, instead of increasing the price by a specified number of pennies per pint, depending on the decision of the National Prices Commission in a particular instance, publicans were to impose a percentage increase across the board of 30 per cent or 40 per cent &mdash; I am surprised at the Deputy talking about 30 per cent or 40 per cent increase as if he did not know, even though this was his specific responsibility for four years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If this happened during the period when the Deputy was in charge of price control, it would have been in breach of the law. I am surprised if the Deputy was aware that this happened that he did not take any action about it.  We will rigorously enforce the rules in regard to retail price increases and we will enforce the retail drink prices standstill order in full as it states in law.  We will not allow 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent increases in the prices.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the most charitable thing to do with that unfortunate Minister is to remain silent about him. God help him, he has a lot to learn.  I believe quite a number of people will be interested in what the Minister has said. The effect of what he has said is that there is now a standstill order in which there will be no allowance for margins by retailers, publicans or otherwise, and they will get all this duty, additional cost and consequential working capital requirements thrown on them but no allowance is made for their margins.  That is not the way the commercial system works.  However he may think in his pristine innocence he might like it to work, the fact is that on 1 September next the price of the pint will go up by between 8p and 9p retail to the consumer.  The Minister can take it from my experience that they usually tend to go to the higher rather than lower figure.  This means that the increase in price, which is directly attributable to the duty increases the Minister is now proposing, is 9p a pint or virtually 1 per cent on the CPI.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's approach to this matter.  The Deputy should be aware that an increase in the margins of publicans is an entirely separate matter and the National Prices Commission, before allowing an increase in margins, will have to be satisfied that those are justified.  That is the position as it now applies.  There may well be no <Col N="628" /> increase in margins at this particular time but that will be decided on by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism in consultation with the National Prices Commission if it is justified by figures furnished by those engaged in the trade.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Minister's answers to the questions put by my colleagues and in the light of the experience of Deputy O'Malley which I will take as being accurate rather than the Minister's contribution, and taking a figure again of around 8p to 9p of an increase from 1 September next would the Minister care to reconsider his comments to the beer drinkers that the increase being imposed today is a relatively modest one on the pint of beer? Many of the electorate who voted for this Government at a time of promises, incentives and benefits will have reason to reconsider their decision of June last in the light of today's budget impositions and the subsequent and consequent increase that the licensed trade will require.  It is not an increase in margins &mdash; when I mention the licensed trade &mdash; it is a percentage increase on the figures that are being mentioned.  There is talk of about 6p here and they will wish to continue with their existing margins if not wanting increased margins.  Even on their existing margins the figure given by Deputy O'Malley of 8p to 9p is correct. Would the Minister care to comment on his statement that this is a relatively modest increase on beer drinkers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>It is a valid description of the increase itself as being modest.  On the items or in the financial circumstances or in circumstances where money was plentiful this increase might be described as more than modest but in the very serious financial circumstances requiring the raising of revenue I believe the increase certainly is a relatively modest <Col N="629" /> one.  In relation to the increase in January there was an increase of 6p in the pint but contrary to the information given by various opposition Deputies there was at that time no authorised increase in margins. If an increase in margins took place it was unauthorised and should not be spoken of in such terms as have been used by the people who were responsible at that time.</P>

      <P>We are not very concerned about whether sparkling wine or champagne is increased by 10p or 20p per bottle because we do not look on products of that kind as what we would call the working man's drink, but we are very concerned that we have had two or three increases on the pint in the past year.  We had one in our own budget earlier; we had one to give extra profit to the vintners and now we have this extra tax.  For the Minister to say a few moments ago in reply to a question from Deputy O'Malley that he could put a price freeze on the pint is ridiculous.  I am not a vintner but Deputy Fitzpatrick who spoke a few moments ago is from Dublin and is a publican and he realises that publicans and others in running their businesses may have to borrow money for stocks and must meet their costs.  No matter what the Minister says here, the publicans therefore will come to him with a request for an increase to keep up their margin of profit.  It has been said here <Col N="631" /> back as far as the time of Eamonn de Valera and the foundation of the State that 1p or 2p on the pint is very important for the person who is working and who may take a pint with a sandwich at midday or on his way home from work.  Consequently, while we are not very concerned about wine or champagne we are very concerned about the increase on the pint.</P>

      <P>In relation to what we have now heard as a result of further questioning of the Minister I want to go back to my earlier question about the margin of difference between what are regarded as the two normal drinks, the pint and the half glass of spirits.  While I know it relates to the next resolution the basic question I now want to ask is this: we are told that the real minimum increase in tax on the pint is 5.5p bringing it up to the figure to which Deputy O'Malley referred, probably 9p.  In excise terms we have 5.5p between the two increases.  I now ask what is the increase per glass of spirits.  I accept that I am going on to the next resolution but I want to raise a point I mentioned earlier in connection with the difference between the 2p and the 2p per glass on spirits.  We are now getting down to the real figures involved and the real figure in the case of the pint of beer or stout is 5.5p revenue duty plus all the additions.  I want to know the real increase on the glass of spirits &mdash; the 2p per glass plus the 50 per cent increase in VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall increase in the price of spirits, equivalent to the 5.5p in the case of beer, will be 8.5p per glass. That is a combination of the excise duty increase and the VAT increase when the two have been imposed next September. There is a budget increase of 2p now and a VAT increase of 6.5p making 8.5p in total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The real increase <Col N="632" /> in the price of spirits is 4.25p per half glass or 8.5p per glass.  Since there is no way in which one can charge 4.25p the increase will be 5p before the retail margin arises.  We shall come to that later. So, we see here a 5.5p or 6p increase on the pint of beer or stout and a 4.25p increase on the equivalent drink in spirits, a half glass of spirits.  The margin is substantially weighted in favour of spirits as against the pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several questions involved.  In general there has been a tendency to maintain a relationship between the two but it has not been maintained consistently.  There is 50 per cent more pure alcohol in the pint than in the half one and the traditional relationship between the two drinks is not soundly based in terms of alcoholic content. There is also the fact that the glass of spirits was taxed an additional 16p in 1980 while only 6p was imposed on the pint and this somewhat disturbed the relationship. Taking those factors into account, what is being done now is reasonable in re-establishing a relationship that is broadly appropriate.  It cannot be refined to an exact figure but the factors that I have mentioned explain why there is not on this occasion an exact relationship between the two drinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Taoiseach is not familiar with the problem to which I have referred.  The balance between the two drinks was not upset in 1980 &mdash; it was restored.  In this exercise it is proposed to put an additional 6p on the pint and 5p on the half glass of spirits. What is being done will be to the detriment of the brewing industry.  From what we have read recently in newspapers, it appears there are problems in that industry in Dublin and other brewers elsewhere also have their own difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is concerned about the effects on the industries that are involved.  In those circumstances he will want to take into account the fact that spirits are much more price sensitive than beer.  If an equivalent amount were put on both drinks, on past experience <Col N="633" /> the impact on consumption would be considerably greater on spirits.  In terms of the impact on the industry the increases we have proposed &mdash; they are not what the Deputy mentioned but are 4.25p and 5.5p respectively &mdash; will have roughly an equivalent effect on both sectors of the industry, as far as one can judge.  This is not an area in which one can be absolutely precise but it should have a broadly similar effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course one way to redress the balance is to allow only a 1p increase on the pint and 2p on the glass of spirits.  That would solve the problem for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Taoiseach has sent the Minister for Finance scurrying out of the House to do his homework, rather belatedly, we discover that we will now have to pay £1 for the pint.  In view of the meagre increase of 5 per cent in some cases and 3 per cent in others to social welfare recipients, will the Taoiseach not accept that a hardship will be imposed on old people who regard the pint as part of their life and recreation? Will the Taoiseach not accept that this is a savage blow in view of the low level of increase given in respect of social welfare benefits?  The Taoiseach said that there was 50 per cent more pure alcohol in the pint as compared with a glass of spirits.  That is total nonsense.  The working man, after a hard day's work, follows the traditional pattern of drinking a pint of Guinness or Murphy.  In public houses and hotels families gather once a week or once a fortnight to have a drink and perhaps listen to music.  Here we have the Coalition coming along with a most savage increase on the price of the pint disregarding, as they have done in the budget, the lower paid workers and the old age pensioners.  They have even threatened to impose more increases in the future.  I urge the Taoiseach to reconsider this imposition as a matter of compassion. <Col N="634" /> I know he is a compassionate man.  What is being done here will encourage people to drink spirits rather than beer and this will be counter-productive to the campaign being carried out by the Department of Health.  When one considers the meagre increase granted to social welfare recipients and contrasts that with the savage increase proposed here, which will affect the poor more than the rich, it is conclusive proof that the Government will never change their spots.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with custom, the Minister for Finance has left the House in order to broadcast on radio and record a broadcast for television.  Previous Ministers are familiar with this custom, even though the Deputy may not be familiar with it.  The Deputy referred to the increase as &ldquo;savage&rdquo;.  How does he describe the increases in taxation on beer in the budgets of 1980 and 1981 introduced by his Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time we increased social welfare payments at a rate far in excess of 5 per cent; in some cases we granted increases of 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the answer I expected from the Deputy.  He is attempting to obscure the fact that, while we are increasing the tax element in the pint by 5.5p, in the last budget his Government imposed an increase of 6p and in the previous budget they increased it by 6.2p.  The increase now proposed is less than that imposed on either of those occasions.  I admit that this is a supplementary budget and is not in the same category.  The former Government abolished October increases for social welfare recipients &mdash; one of their first actions on entering office was to abolish that innovation introduced by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This supplementary budget was necessitated by the economic situation.  The increase in taxation on beer is less than what was proposed in <Col N="635" /> the last two normal budgets.  When one considers the overall balance of taxation, with the rather heavier impost on motorists, for example, the old age pensioner who drinks a pint of beer is rather less severely affected by the budget.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners do not have cars and do not have to pay for petrol, road tax and so on.  The budget has a greater impact on people who are in the category of car ownership.  The cost of living increase for old age pensioners will be less than the overall average cost of living increase in the budget including the increase in the cost of the pint.  Far from being savage as far as that category are concerned it is more considerate.  The description of the amount as savage could only be made by someone who either wants to forget or does not know the size of the increase imposed in two successive budgets by the Government he supported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach is here because he is the person who is supposed to be taking an overview of the economy.  It is clear from the discussion that on beer alone we are talking about a 1 per cent increase in the CPI.  Spirits will add another 1 per cent.  In a later financial resolution we will be dealing with a 5 per cent overall increase in VAT. How does this square with the statement made by the Minister that the full effect of the tax increases will be approximately 3 per cent?  It is clear that that 3 per cent is not correct and is totally out of focus with the overall effect that these resolutions, nine in all, will have in regard to the CPI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One real achievement of outstanding weight and importance as far as the economy was concerned was in the area of labour and industrial relations and the rapport we had between trade unions and employers which led to the conclusion of the recent successful national understanding. This understanding will come forward for further negotiation before the end of the year.  The CPI will be used as the criteria for pay claims.  What effect will the budget have on our economy and pay claims?  It will jeopardise the highly <Col N="636" /> sensitive edifice of labour relations built by the last Government and formulated in the last national understanding which has brought a high degree of industrial peace.</P>
    <P>Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance has taken into account this all-important aspect, so much so that some minutes ago we had the spectacle of the Minister for Finance being unable to give the correct figure for the increase in the CPI attributable to the increase in beer.  At first he gave a wrong figure which did not relate to the VAT increase. After discussion with his officials we worked out from him that it would be .62 per cent.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, when one considers the mark up in prices claimed by the trade, one is talking about a figure much nearer .8 per cent or .9 per cent.  These are the realities.  The whole thrust of this resolution and others is towards substantially increased indirect taxation which will be written into the CPI and used in pay claims.  It will trigger off the undesirable effects arising from that through the public sector and the economy.  It will lead to a dangerous situation for the Government in the negotiation of the national understanding.  It will put it into serious jeopardy.  This is the course upon which this Government have embarked.  The person responsible is the Taoiseach who should be taking this aspect of industrial relations into account if we are to make real progress towards the enhancement of productivity and national growth.  This resolution is part of the Government's running away from the central necessity of a government to ensure that there are no built-in inflationary pressures that will be written into the CPI and translated from that into pay demands which will cause trouble as far as concluding a successful national understanding is concerned.</P>

His remarks in that regard cannot be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>The increase in the cost of living arising from the tax in the dual form of the VAT and budget increase is .62 per cent as has been stated.  The Deputy started by saying it would be 1 per cent and later rounded it to .85 per cent.  The overall impact on the CPI of the increase on spirits through the budget and VAT increases will be of the order of .22 per cent, lest anyone be taken in by the Minister's figures.

      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by asking the Taoiseach to stop this political reacting and at least for once appear to be responsible and in the Taoiseach's seat running the country.  If the Taoiseach wants to play the political game let him stand aside and <Col N="638" /> we will run the country and have no hesitation in doing it properly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the 5.5 plus increase on the pint of stout.  It will be 8p or 9p.  That is the position.  The Deputy referred to social welfare increases of 3 or 5 per cent.  The Taoiseach, in a most unsustainable way, said it was our Government who did away with the October increases.  The October increases are the greatest gimmick in economic and political terms.  What it basically meant was that the old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients did not get their due entitlement at the normal time of the year.  Some of it was deferred until a later date.  A new dimendion is being added this year.  There is 5 per cent for certain recipients and 3 per cent for others.  As Deputy Lenihan has said, while officially the increase in the CPI officially is only 0.622, when all the inevitable rounding-up is taken account of plus the margin, the increase will be almost 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach talks glibly about national understandings.  I remember clearly his contribution to the last budget debate when he shed crocodile tears about our imposition of indirect taxation, about our fuelling inflation and about how we were damaging the national understanding.  He talked of how we were fuelling wage demands and said that we should be compensating those people whose standard of living was being eroded.  Has there ever been so much done in such a short time?  The Taoiseach seems to have accepted the advice of the newspapers to paint the picture as black as possible but I can assure him that nobody believes him, that the people know he is playing a purely political game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us turn now to the lower paid worker.  There is some miserly recompense for the social welfare recipients but there is nothing for the lower paid worker.  Instead, for him as well as for the social welfare recipient, there is the imposition of an extra 2p on the pint immediately plus a further increase of 3.5 per cent on 1 September, plus the margins, all of which combined will, as Deputy O'Malley said, be likely to bring the <Col N="639" /> increase in the price of the pint to between 8p and 9p by 1 October next. We have a duty to point out the extent to which inflation will be fuelled by the resolutions before us.  In a very naive way the Taoiseach says that the increases being imposed by way of this supplementary budget are less than the increases imposed either in January 1981 or in February 1980.  But in mid-year terms, the increases we are discussing today are extremely inflationary coming as they are at a time when the current national understanding is drawing to a close and when the increases in social welfare benefits are being postponed for some months.</P>

      <P>When previous Deputies put to the Taoiseach questions relating to inequities, to discriminatory measures against certain sections of the population, the Taoiseach took up one issue that was raised by Deputy Andrews.  That was the one concerned with the old age pensioners and he tried to justify the increase in that respect.  However, in fairness, if he acknowledges the almost 1 per cent increases that is being provided for here, he must acknowledge also that such increases are not justifiable.  Scant justice is being done to the human needs of the worker, human needs which today are a very much in the form of recreation after a hard day's work.  I am talking about the recreation of being able to have a pint of beer or a small one.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would explain for the benefit of those people why he chose to hit them so hard by way of these measures.</P>

      <P>I have purely a statistical question to put to the Taoiseach, a question to which his officials may have the reply to hand.  It is my personal opinion that the volume of drink consumed has been decreasing as a result of increased prices, especially in the past couple of years.  Has any calculation been made in the budget figures to take account of a decrease in consumption as a result of these increases?  Are there any <Col N="640" /> figures in this regard in respect of the past couple of years?  Successive Governments have chosen to increase the excise duty on alcoholic drink in their budgets and in the past the reaction of the public tended to be that it did not matter too much so long as the brewers continued to brew the drink.  I am of the opinion that that situation has changed and that with each additional increase in the price of drink, the volume of consumption decreases.  Is it possible that we are reaching the point of diminishing returns in this regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like first to go back to the point harped on by Deputies today, that is, the alleged automatic effect on margins.  It is irresponsible of Deputies opposite to suggest that an increase in the duty should or could in any way justify of itself an increase in the margins.  An increase in margins is justified by reference to the overall costs incurred by those concerned in the trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no relationship in time and if one looks back to see what happened following increases in the price of beer in the last couple of years, one finds that there were increases in margins which were conceded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day, but these increases were at a timelag so far removed from the tax increases as to have no direct relationship with them.  In one instance the increase in margins occurred in October following the February budget while in another case they occurred in July following a January budget.  Therefore, the question of margins is irrelevant.  It is irresponsible to introduce it and to be suggesting to the publicans that in some way they ought to be seeking an increase in margins because of this increase in excise.  That is not the way of a responsible Opposition.  The <Col N="641" /> facts do not warrant the claim being made.  What we are talking about here is an increase in the price of beer involving, taking the two increases together, an effective 0.63 increase in the cost of living, and any attempt to suggest that the figure is greater than that is false.</P>
      <P>On the question of the impact on consumption, I am advised that it is not likely that the increases in beer prices arising immediately on the passing of this resolution will have any measurable effect on consumption but the further increase in VAT in September &mdash; somewhat of greater magnitude and coming not very long after the excise increase &mdash; could have some effect on consumption.  It is not possible statistically to calculate this accurately.</P>
      <P>Fifteen years ago I was engaged in this kind of exercise in relation to beer and spirits when I was acting as a consultant.  Taking advantage of the most expert economic advice then available, it was not possible to arrive with any certainty at any particular effect on consumption of an increase in price.  All one could say &mdash; and I gather this has been confirmed by more recent work &mdash; is that the consumption of spirits is more likely to be affected by a price increase.  The price usually associated with beer is low, and the impact of the increase we are proposing, together with the change in VAT, on the consumption of beer, as far as can be calculated, is expected to be less than 1 per cent.  I give the figure to the Deputy for what it is worth, realising that precision in this area is not possible.  I say that from experience in my own work 15 years ago and from the technical work done since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to refer to the Minister's speech today. Referring to the increase in the price in beer, he said that the tax increase, together with the VAT change, would make for a total price increase of 5p to 6p on the pint.  I suggest it has been established clearly that that is not accurate. Whether it is or not, I want to underscore the miserly social welfare <Col N="642" /> improvements to be given to recipients. For instance, the under-80 contributory old age retirement pension is to be increased by £1.55.  We are now faced with a £1 pint of beer, but the increase for old age contributory pension for a person of more than 80 years will be only £1.65.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Labour Deputies who have helped to compose this Coalition patchwork, and the socialist Independent Deputies, how can they justify as socialists voting for this resolution?  I say this particularly to the socialist Independents. This resolution is anti-worker, anti-people. It lacks compassion or any sense of fair dealing.  Therefore, will the Taoiseach now re-consider this imposition, which, as I said earlier, is savage from the point of view of working people.  I make a special plea to Deputy Sherlock and to the other socialist Members to vote against this.</P>

      <P>I am constrained to quote, for the benefit of Deputy Andrews, from column 492 of the Official Report for 28 January 1981.  A certain Government had then increased the price of spirits by 12p a glass and beer by 6p a pint.  The defender on that occasion said, and perhaps we may then discover who he was:</P>
      <P>To get the sort of revenue required these days you have to tax things which are in fairly popular usage.  Of course, the obvious things to tax are beer, spirits and wine.  These are things which people are going to consume anyway and, therefore, it is almost axiomatic that, if you want to get the sort of revenue you need to pay for the various State services in a modern community, you are almost inevitably driven to taxing tobacco, beer and spirits to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give a further quotation and then it <Col N="643" /> may be possible for Deputy Andrews to identify the speaker:</P>
    <P>I am rejecting the argument that we should not put on these taxes because drink, in our circumstances, is very moderately used and that it is unfair to do so for that reason.  I base my case for these Resolutions on the one simple premise, that is, drink, alcohol, beer, whiskey, wine, these things are good old reliable revenue producers.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy, then on this side of the House, went on:</P>
    <P>We feel that the people who will be paying these extra taxes for their beer and spirits will understand and appreciate that they are going to a very sound social purpose, and bear with them, perhaps not cheerfully, but at least willingly.</P>
    <P>Who said that?  The same Deputy went on when some comments had been made about the effects on the trade union movement:</P>
    <P>Surely Deputies opposite, as I have done over the past 12 months or two years, see from time to time in our newspapers and our media consistent reports of seminars which give staggering figures for the amount the Irish community spends on drink in any year.  These figures of the amount that we, as a community, spend on drink are frequently highlighted in the most dramatic terms in our newspapers and media.  Do Deputies opposite say that that is not so?</P>
    <P>Finally he said:</P>
    <P>Is it not also true that the Irish trade union movement has found it necessary to institute programmes designed to cut down absenteeism in Irish industry because of alcoholism?  Is that not so?  Do the Deputies opposite say that that is not true?  I know it is true because I am in very close touch with the trade union movement about this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give a final quotation:</P>
      <P>This revenue is being raised, and the money raised will be used to pay social welfare benefits, to pay for the things that the Minister for Finance has provided for in this budget for the poor, the weaker under-privileged sections of our community.  That is what the taxes are being put on for and that is the purpose for which the money is being used.</P>
      <P>That Deputy, none other than Charles J. Haughey, the then Taoiseach, said:</P>
      <P>We know there is a great ritualistic exercise gone through before every budget.  There are particular people in the community who orchestrate a whole chorus before the budget, proving that if the thing in which they are involved is taxed, ruin will follow.  One can recognise it.  The same pattern is followed every year.  People try to frighten the Government off imposing taxes on their particular area by a whole orchestrated chorus of propaganda. We had it in a big measure this year.  Very large sectors of the community set out to establish before the budget is introduced that their particular sector must be left alone because, if not, total ruin and disaster would follow.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Haughey had to say in January last about Irish Distillers down in Midleton I would not dare to say if I had been on this side.  He said that the distillers could go out and get export markets and that they would do very well.  They have been doing enormously well thanks to the strictures of Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to our new colleagues in the House, my Cork colleague, Deputy Sherlock, not to pay whit of attention to the special pleadings which he will hear, perhaps from both sides of the House, least of all from Deputies who last year increased the price of whiskey by 12p per <Col N="645" /> glass and the pint of beer by 6p.  That Government left us with an addition to the balance of payments deficit of £450 million more than they told us about.  At least in relation to the price of spirits, the civil servants cannot be blamed because the Fianna Fáil Government got their figures wrong in relation to the cost of living.  At least the people know that the price of beer and spirits is being put up. They know the amount and there will be no confidence trick on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be all very impressive were it not for the fact that Deputy Desmond omits to say that most of what I said at that time related to the additional taxation on spirits.  We have already indicated that on this occasion we are not opposing the additional taxation on spirits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond quoted the then Taoiseach quite extensively <Col N="646" /> but he failed to mention that social welfare recipients received quite a considerable increase.  What we have here today is the most paltry increase since long ago beyond my recall when a Member of this House who was Minister for Social Welfare reduced social welfare by a shilling.  I am saying to Deputy Sherlock and the other socialist Members of this House that they have a lot to answer for in this budget, and I am saying to the Labour Party that not only has the carpet been pulled out from under them on the left by Sinn Féin the Workers Party, but Fine Gael are working on it damn hard too.</P>

    <P>The effect of this Resolution is to increase immediately the main rate of excise duty on spirits, at the equivalent of 1.82p on a glass of spirits.  This increase will attract an additional payment of 1.8p in value-added tax at 10 per cent, making the total tax increase 2p on a glass of spirits.  The resultant increase in revenue is estimated at an additional £2.5 million in the current financial year, or about £4.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some questions.  Firstly, I want to know the full increase on the glass of spirits when the 2p is added to the 50 per cent increase in VAT which was announced here earlier today.  Secondly, what is the combined revenue income from the higher increase or what, in fact, will be the real increase from 1 September onwards?  Thirdly, could I refresh the Taoiseach's memory on the contributions of some of his party colleagues to the budget debate in January-February?  They then expressed very grave concern about the employment content and short time working of the employees of Irish Distillers.  Crocodile tears were then wept by many Ministers now in Government.  It is hard to understand why there has been a rejection. Fourthly, what is the full CPI impact of the 2p increase plus the 50 per cent VAT increase on spirits?  What steps does <Col N="651" /> the Taoiseach now feel should be taken, in view of his comments and those of his colleagues in January-February, to compensate those people whose earnings are eroded because of this, the second substantial CPI increase of the season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The full effect on the glass of spirits when the second increase takes effect&mdash;this is taking the excise duty and the VAT increase together for 1 September&mdash;is 8.5p on a glass of whiskey, or 4.25 on a half glass.  The revenue for the current year is, in total, expected to be £4.8 million.  That is to say, the VAT increase this year will yield £2.3 million, in addition to the £2.5 million from the excise duty.  The full year effect of the increases will be £24.5 million. That is to say, the VAT yield will be £20 million and the yield from the excise duty £4.5 million.  I must correct myself, the total increase is £20 million, being £15.5 million from VAT and £4.5 million from duty.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated, we do not intend to vote against this taxation measure because we do not see an increase in the price of spirits as having the same implications for employees, in particular, as an increase in the price of beer.  There is no doubt, as has already been pointed out, that beer generally is very much the drink of the ordinary working man and occupies quite an important part in his standard and style of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Even in my most crusading days in the Department of Health, I always acknowledged the fact that, for people who are engaged in arduous manual labour, in particular, a pint of stout in the middle of the day, or at the end of the day, was something to which they were entitled. Beer or stout, taken in moderation, could not be regarded as in anyway detrimental. Of course, like all other alcoholic beverages, if it is abused it certainly has its effects.</P>
    <P>We resisted the further imposition, at this period of the year, on the pint of beer.  That was a legitimate attitude for us to adopt.  Whatever about increasing the tax on the pint of stout and beer at normal budget time in order to finance the normal budgetary requirements and provide resources for social welfare increases, it is a totally different matter to come along at this stage of the year and increase the tax on beer and stout generally.  The two cannot be looked on in the same light and that is why we oppose the addition at this time of year, halfway through the budget year, on beer and stout.</P>
    <P>We do not feel the need to resist this increase in taxation on spirits in the same way.  We would certainly prefer if it did not have to happen.  Our general approach to this budget is that these increases do not have to happen.  This is very much a political exercise which we are going through here.  After all the preaching of gloom and doom and all the drama and the state of the nation broadcast and around the clock Cabinet sessions, what the Government are engaged on here to day is, from the point of Government finances, a minimal exercise.  It is of very great significance, of course, from the point of view of the housewife and others who are going to have to pay increased charges in prices, but from the point of view of budgetary finances and the Exchequer as a whole, what we are doing here today is really only tinkering with what was supposed to be a major financial crisis.</P>
    <P>That is our general approach to this exercise here today in Dáil Éireann.  If the Government feel that spirits at this stage can take a further increase in taxation, <Col N="653" /> we are not prepared to go strongly against it, although we feel it could and might well be avoided.  Even though, the-oretically, spirits are the drink of the better off classes &mdash; therefore an increase in the price of spirits does not have the same social implications &mdash; nevertheless an increase in any of these products in which some people find relaxation should be avoided if possible.  As I said, we do not intend to oppose this increase.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a great exercise in hypocrisy which is being indulged in by members of the Fine Gael Party in particular. When we, in the course of our normal annual budgetary exercise, found it necessary to increase the price of spirits in the January budget, we were met with a tirade of abuse and attacks from the then opposition, Fine Gael front bench.  In particular I remember Deputy Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>) being quite vociferous on this matter.  First, he gave a lecture on the fact that Irish people did not abuse drink and that, therefore, it was wrong to increase the price of drink. It was in response to that statement that I made the speech which Deputy B. Desmond quoted from.  At that time I was almost exclusively talking about spirits. That is why I can claim that our attitude on this occasion is a logical one.  At that time the Fine Gael speakers in particular were totally opposed to an increase in the tax on spirits.  They said it would have disastrous effects on Irish Distillers and on the important industry in Midleton. Generally speaking, they were most trenchant in their criticism of that tax increase being imposed.</P>
    <P>I want the Taoiseach to tell us, as the principal spokesman of the Fine Gael Party, what has happened in the meantime. How has the situation changed? That party are now coming here, not at the crucial time of the year when the annual budget is being proposed but at this half-way stage, putting forward this proposal for an increase in the tax on spirits.  Has the danger to the Irish distilling trade and the Midleton Distillery disappeared?  Has the situation in regard to the spirits industry improved so dramatically <Col N="654" /> in the meantime that there is no fear for the industry or for employment in that industry in putting on this tax now?  These are questions we on this side of the House are entitled to ask.</P>
    <P>Admittedly we increased the price of spirits in the January budget.  We felt we were reasonably safe in doing so.  We had done careful calculations and got estimates from experts and felt that as part of the annual budgetary exercise it was legitimate to increase the tax on spirits at that time.  This is a different exercise. This is an additional imposition.  This is a second increase during a 12-month period.</P>
    <P>There is a very onerous responsibility on the Fine Gael Party in particular to explain how their opposition to this imposition last January can have faded away and what change has come about in the situation.  Why can they now put on this additional taxation increase without any ill-effects?  These are some questions for which we would like to have an explanation, but bearing in mind that, taking a consistent attitude, we do not intend to vote against this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not with any pleasure that we put on this or any other imposition.  One cannot but be concerned about the effects these impositions may have in respect of particular industries. We have not taken this course of action lightly without examining all possible alternatives.  The Leader of the Opposition asked what happened.  What happened was very simple.  The deficit, which at that time was stated to be £515 million, now emerges as £947 million, and the overriding need to save the economy from the disaster facing it forces us to look at courses of action which in ordinary circumstances we would wish to avoid.  When the Leader of the Opposition speaks about this financial exercise as being minimal, not living up to expectations aroused, I have to reject that. What we have done in today's budget is to reduce by one-sixth the borrowing in the current year &mdash; although we are taking action well into the second half of the year &mdash; from £1,973 million to £1,337 million, and to reduce the opening current <Col N="655" /> deficit for next year by one-third from £1,500 million to £1,050 million.</P>

      <P>With respect, the Taoiseach has not responded to the points I raised.  I asked what were the implications now with regard to the distilling industry, employment in that industry and the future of the Midleton Distillery. I asked what change had come about.  I also asked how, if he and his party found it necessary to vote against the tax we imposed last January to achieve a budget deficit of £515 million, he can now propose an additional tax.  What are the implications for the distilling industry? These are the questions I asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question. Faced with a current deficit of £947 million, the greater good of the nation requires that considerations which weighed heavily in January, and still weigh heavily, have to be overborne by that new development which threatens the welfare of all our people.  Things which were unpalatable then and which should have been avoided but which were done in the expectation apparently on the part of the Government that the current deficit would be £515 million, now have to be done because we are faced with a situation where the deficit is almost twice that figure.  It is as simple as that. The Leader of the Opposition knows it and he will not do himself any good by dragging the discussion on that point any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>With regard to the figure of £947 million, we have witnessed in the past few weeks the classical propaganda ploy of repeating a lie often enough so that people will begin to believe it and some of it will stick.  The Taoiseach has been engaged in this since the day he took office, as have been his spokesmen and his whole paraphernalia of press agentry.  The Leader of the Opposition asked the exact implications for Irish Distillers and we have not had a reply.  The distilling industry has been going through a very difficult time and sales figures have been dropping.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would give the figures for sales since the previous budget and say how he expects the volume will be further eroded as a result of this measure. For reasons given by the Leader of the Opposition, we are not opposing this resolution. However, it is fair to say that while the pint of beer and of stout are the traditional drinks of the working man there are a considerable number of people, of whom I am one, who enjoy a &ldquo;small one&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach might make some comment on the likely wage demands that will be made by the trade union movement consequent on this measure and on demands from the licensed trade.  This industry is a very important employer and it will be very badly affected by this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that clearances of spirits are only marginally down on 1980 but that the 1980 figures were inflated by the fact that there were large pre-budget clearances that year.  An exact comparison of the trend in consumption is, therefore, difficult to make. <Col N="657" /> Allowing for that factor it would appear to me from advice given that there has not been a net drop and that the actual level of consumption this year is not down on last year.  That is a very tentative comment, given the difficulty of assessing it because of the different way in which clearances were treated in the two years.</P>
      <P>The total increase proposed here in two stages amounts to 8.5p.  The increases imposed by the preceding Government were 16p in 1980 and 12p this year.  It was against the latter increase that we voted, at a time when we were told that the current deficit was £550 million. The increase we are now imposing additional to that adds up for the year as a whole to a worryingly large sum &mdash; I immediately concede that &mdash; but the increase is only half that imposed in 1980 and significantly smaller than that imposed earlier this year.</P>
      <P>For reasons I have already stated, the impact on consumption is not easily assessed.  As far as one can judge it is likely to be less than 2 per cent but we are in an area of inexact science and any assessment of that kind can only be tentative.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the best reply I can.  The imposition earlier this year of 12p does not seem to have significantly affected consumption, although that is a very tentative judgment.  There is a marginal reduction in clearances but there were special factors which led to clearances being abnormally large in 1980.  A theoretical calculation based on past experience would suggest that there might be some small effect on total consumption which would amount to less than 2 per cent.  The actual experience this year arising from a significantly larger increase earlier does not seem to validate the theoretical calculations of a reduction in consumption of less than 2 per cent arising from what we are now doing.  It is <Col N="658" /> difficult to say what the precise effect will be, but it is unlikely to be of significant magnitude.  One cannot go beyond that with the data available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government at that time were working on the same advice as we are now working which would have shown a theoretical reduction in consumption of, I suppose, the order of something like 2.5 per cent.  That would have been my own expectation based on my knowledge in a general way of the price elasticity of spirits.  For whatever reason there is some indication that the effect has not been as great as that in the current year in that the reduction in clearances is only marginal and appears to be partly accounted for by exceptional clearances last year.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the leader of the Opposition on the decision not to vote against this measure.  It does not affect the ordinary person, but it is no harm to point out the responsibility of those in Opposition not to oppose every measure.  This was not the course followed by the previous Opposition.  They voted against the increase of 12p but by their own imposition are bringing the increase this year to 20p, yet we are not opposing them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> In effect this will raise the excise duty on tobacco products by the equivalent of 3.6p per packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular priced category.  This will attract an additional payment of .4p in VAT at the 10 per cent rate, making a total tax increase of 4p.  In the case of pipe tobacco, the increase in the duty element will be in the region of 3p to 5p on the 25 gram pack depending on the type of tobacco.  The resultant increase in revenue including the VAT in the current financial year will amount to approximately £5.4 million or in a full year £13.1 million.  The increase in the duty will raise the total tax content of a packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular priced category by 4p, that is from 57.3p for 20 to 61.3p for 20.  Because part of the excise duty is <i>ad valorem</i>, based on the retail selling price, the duty content of the price of a packet of cigarettes in price categories higher or lower than the most popular price category will be relatively higher or lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to increases, generally speaking, in the price of cigarettes and tobacco.  In the budget speech the Minister said that the overall increase, that is the duty on tobacco plus the 50 per cent increase in VAT, would represent approximately 8p increase in the price of 20 cigarettes, but when one considers that manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of cigarettes, to carry stocks, have to borrow more money to keep those stocks, it is only natural that shortly they will look for a certain increase in the price to compensate for their losses.  We can expect as we would in the case of beer, spirits and so on, that we could be looking to a round figure on 1 September or possibly in October of 10p on a packet of 10 cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the rise in the price would be 3p or something like that per ounce of tobacco.</P>

      <P>Tobacco, particularly hard pressed tobacco is sold in two ounce lots <Col N="662" /> commonly known as a half quarter of tobacco.  The hard pressed tobacco is generally smoked by the poorer sections, old age pensioners and lower paid workers. In other years the Minister for Finance when introducing his budget sometimes gave a special rebate in relation to the two ounces of hard pressed tobacco because this affected the poorer sections. We normally compare 20 cigarettes to the two ounces of tobacco.  A person either smokes 20 cigarettes or two ounces of tobacco.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House, as far as hard pressed tobacco is concerned the exact increase by which the cost will go up inclusive of the 50 per cent increase in VAT plus the duty now imposed.  I also appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister to consider giving a rebate on the hard pressed tobacco for the reasons stated.</P>

      <P>There is an excise duty differential in favour of the pipe tobacco as compared with cigarettes but it is difficult to measure this accurately due to the fundamental difference in the way tax is levied on cigarettes as compared with other tobacco products.  This is part of the effect of our EEC membership which affects the method of levying duties on cigarettes.  I am not quite sure about the Deputy's question because there is a range of variation depending on the type of tobacco.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 6p for two ounces of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is from 3p to 5p for 25 grammes so it is obviously fractionally above that per ounce.  It would be fractionally <Col N="663" /> above the range of 6p to 10p for two ounces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the two ounces of hard pressed tobacco including the 50 per cent increase on VAT will be increased by 12p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I am giving now do not include VAT.  I was sticking to the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if we are at odds here.  I am not sure if I can answer that on this resolution.  I doubt if I could lay my hands on the precise figures for VAT and so on as quickly as that.  However, I will see what I can do for the Deputy.  The total increase for 25 grammes in tax, including the VAT increase, for plug tobacco, would be 7.8p; for two ounces it would be just over double that.  For flake tobacco it would be 9.4p for 25 grammes and for two ounces obviously just over twice that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore it is approximately 25p per two ounces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take plug tobacco it looks like being about 16p to 17p for two ounces.  In the case of the other, flake tobacco, it looks like being about 20p, fractionally over 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a simple question about the price of an ordinary item on sale in any shop in this city or down the country &mdash; two ounces of tobacco.  The Minister for Finance is imposing a duty on tobacco and cigarettes here today.  Yet the Taoiseach is unable to inform this House how much will be the increase on two ounces of tobacco if, say, tomorrow afternoon somebody walks into a shop and asks for two ounces of tobacco.  How is the shopkeeper himself to know what to charge for it or what is the duty on it? It is important that the House should know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty arises from the fact that for the purposes of <Col N="664" /> selling this product we are claiming to use ounces whereas the taxation is being levied in terms of grammes and all the data and resolutions are being passed in terms of grammes.  That means I have had to calculate on my feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to have a table written out available to Members of this House and that can be issued to the Press and others tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that it depends upon the grade.  I do not want to give figures that will mislead anybody because it does depend upon the grade.  I can say that for two ounces of hard pressed tobacco I have a figure of 17.4p but for top grade it would be 21p per two ounces.  But obviously it depends upon the grade.  It is not possible to list every type of tobacco and say in the House here exactly what the amount will be as from a price list.  But that is the range of variation within which the increase will fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but normally after a budget there are advertisements issued by the various tobacco companies and others usually in the following day's papers.  We must get these Financial Resolutions through this House this evening before 10.30 p.m.  Therefore tomorrow morning a shopkeeper can increase those prices.  The Minister for Finance is not present in the House and the Taoiseach sitting in for him is unable to inform the House what will be the price of two ounces of hard pressed tobacco in any shop in the country tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But I have informed the Deputy.  The answer to that question is 17.4p on two ounces, but there are other types of tobacco as well.  For example there is a top grade which would be 21p.  I do not want to mislead anybody by saying 17.4p if they come in looking for top grade tobacco and complain that there is a 21p increase.  I am trying to be helpful to the Deputy, as I know he is endeavouring to help his constituents and people generally by clarifying this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is now sitting in for the Minister for Finance and he should be in a position &mdash; as has always been the case with Ministers for Finance in this House &mdash; to inform the House of the exact increase on the price of a particular item on sale tomorrow on which a duty is being imposed by resolution of this House this evening.  I am not satisfied with the explanation or answer the Taoiseach has given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but a difficulty arises in areas like this where there are variations in quality.  The same thing is true in regard to cigarettes.  The figures I have given are required by EEC regulations to relate to the most popular price category.  But, as I have said, there will be variations upwards or downwards depending upon the particular circumstances and price levels.  Obviously I cannot reel off every type of cigarette and every particular brand of tobacco here and the figures; it would not be feasible. In both these cases the effect of the tax depends upon the particular quality of tobacco used.  In the case of cigarettes this is very much complicated by the complex taxation system imposed by the EEC which involves the combination of value-added tax and specific duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that there are different brands of cigarettes at different prices, whether tipped or not, generally speaking their price and that of two ounces of hard pressed tobacco are all the same.  That is why I asked the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <P>But I answered that question &mdash; 17.4p.  I merely added the rider that it would be more for other kinds of tobacco, lest anybody be misled, wishing to help the Deputy.  The answer is quite specific and clear in respect of two ounces of hard pressed tobacco.  Perhaps I am giving too much information.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1981 (Resumed): - Financial Resolution No. 5: Excise&mdash;Hydrocarbons.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1) That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Order of 1975&rdquo; means the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975 (S.I. No. 307 of 1975);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Act of 1981&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1981 (No. 16 of 1981).</P>
      <P>(2) That the duty of excise on mineral hydrocarbon light oil imposed by paragraph 11(1) of the order of 1975 shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 22nd day of July, 1981, at the rate of £17.32 per hectolitre in lieu of the rate specified in section 35(1) of the Act of 1981.</P>
      <P>(3) That the duty of excise on hydrocarbon oil imposed by paragraph 12(1) of the Order of 1975 shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 22nd day of July, 1981, at the rate of £11.67 per hectolitre in lieu of the rate specified in section 35(2) of the Act of 1981.</P>
      <P>(4) That as on and from the 22nd day of July, 1981, the rate of any repayment allowed under paragraph 12(11) of the Order of 1975 in respect of hydrocarbon oil on which such repayment is allowable and on which the excise duty mentioned in paragraph (3) of this Resolution was paid at the rate of £11.67 per hectolitre shall be £9.88 per hectolitre in lieu of the rate allowable immediately before the 22nd day of July, 1981.</P>
      <P>(5) That the duty of excise on gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form imposed by section 41(1) of the Finance Act, 1976 (No. 16 of 1976), shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 22nd day of July, 1981, at the rate of £0.48 per gallon in lieu of the rate specified in section 35(4) of the Act of 1981.</P>
      <P>(6) It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>The general effect of the resolution is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Firstly to increase the rate of excise duty on petrol by 3.64p per gallon.  This increase will attract an additional element of 0.36p in value-added tax making a total tax increase of 4p on a gallon of petrol; secondly, immediately to increase the rate of excise duty on diesel oil used in motor vehicles by 3.64p per gallon. This increase will attract an additional element of 0.36p in value-added tax making a total tax increase of 4p per gallon; thirdly to increase the rate of excise duty on liquid petroleum gas (LPG) used in motor vehicles by 8p per gallon.</P>
      <P>The 7p per gallon duty on other oils and on LPG for non-automotive use is not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the side of reliefs, the resolution increases the present rate of repayment in respect of diesel oil used in buses operated by persons carrying on a passenger road service within the meaning of section 2 of the Road Transport Act, <Col N="671" /> 1932, so that there is no &ldquo;net&rdquo; increase in duty on the diesel oil used in these vehicles.</P>
    <P>The resultant increase in revenue in the current financial year will amount to approximately £6.2 million, of which £4.7 million is attributed to petrol, £1.3 million to road-diesel and £0.2 million to motor vehicle LPG, or £14.0 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The cost of increasing the rebate on diesel oil used in buses is estimated at about £0.27 million in a full year; £0.12 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>In the case of previous duty increases Deputies have asked questions about VAT that I did not anticipate but as the questions were asked I might as well anticipate now that questions will be asked and go on to say that on and from 1 September 1981, the 10 per cent rate of VAT will increase to 15 per cent.  This will further raise the tax content of a gallon of premium grade petrol by 9.4p approximately and a gallon of auto-diesel by 8p approximately.  It is estimated that the increase in VAT will yield an additional £4.4 million VAT in relation to oils this year or £29.4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I should point out that LPG is not liable to VAT and so the aggregated increases between excise duty and VAT in the two phases will amount to 13.4p on petrol, 12p on auto-diesel and 8p on LPG.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say what effect this has on the CPI?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Government have not given any consideration at all to this aspect of these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give immediately the amount relevant to what we are discussing. The VAT effect is slightly more complex.  The effect on CPI of the 4p on petrol, 4p on DERV and 8p on LPG is .116 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that the Taoiseach should be so flippant about the effect of increases being introduced in the budget today or <Col N="672" /> that he should say that it is difficult to state what the effect of the VAT increase is.  It appears the Taoiseach is not interested in inflation or in the effect of decisions taken here today.  It is amazing to think that no thought has been given to the effect of the combined price increases on the CPI as from 1 September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Deputy is making a rather puerile point.  We are dealing with a resolution on excise duties and, strictly speaking, we should stick to that.  To facilitate the Deputy and in view of the fact that in previous cases questions were asked about the further effect of VAT, which we have not yet come to, I have answered questions in relation to that matter.  I could very well have told Deputies to wait until we got to that resolution, but I wanted to help the House.  The information readily available to me in relation to this resolution is that the total effect on the CPI, including the effect of VAT, is 0.38 per cent.  There is nothing flippant about our approach in regard to this matter.  We are dealing with this resolution now but Deputies opposite are anticipating in relation to VAT. That information is in a different section of the file.  Deputy Fitzgerald is entitled to ask for information and I am more than happy to give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not conferring any favours on me by making those remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Just being a little out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When he was introducing the resolution he referred to the impact of the price increase as a result of the excise duty and also the VAT increase as from 1 September.  The Opposition will ask for full information when items like this are brought before the House.  I should not like him to think he is doing us any favours by commenting on the effect on the CPI.  What is being proposed here is a substantial and harmful increase that will affect employees and employers.  The Taoiseach may say that last January the price of diesel oil <Col N="673" /> and petrol was increased.  That is so.  At that time he and his colleagues who are now in Government were extremely critical of what was proposed.  They pleaded the case of the urban and rural motorist and said what we proposed was a savage imposition on them.  How much more savage is what the Government have done today?</P>
      <P>Other severe hardships will be imposed on motorists also.  There will be an increase from 40 per cent to 50 per cent in excise duty on cars, a 50 per cent increase in respect of VAT on new cars and there is also the matter of the restoration of road tax.  That is all in addition to the increase of 13.4p on petrol and 12p on road diesel.  All of these increases will impose severe hardship on workers who must travel to work.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in all the Financial Resolutions will be highly inflationary. The newspapers spoke about all the midnight oil burned by the Government, but I am not so sure it was burned wisely. Perhaps the meetings, if they took place at all, were very short.  Certainly little thought was given to the impact of what was proposed here today.  This inflationary budget will have a serious effect on any wage negotiations that take place this year.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach must be aware of the contributions made by the Tánaiste and other members of the Government earlier this year during the budget debate. They spoke then of the need to compensate for loss of income.  The erosion of earnings will be so great as a result of this budget and will be so much to the detriment of people that I fear the outcome. In concluding the budget debate in February or March, the Tánaiste said that a contributing factor to industrial relations problems &mdash; since 30 June there seems to have been an abundance of them &mdash; was the lack of concern by the Government in imposing inflationary taxes.  Here again is an example of a complete turnabout by members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week there was a demonstration by road hauliers.  I do not support a demonstration that disrupts traffic and business as happened in that case, but that <Col N="674" /> does not mean I have not some sympathy for those people in the difficulties encountered by them.  What is being proposed in the budget will impose further hardship on that industry.  I am sure the Taoiseach is not surprised at the outright opposition expressed by us to the resolution before the House.  Every Member has an obligation to examine his or her conscience in voting on this resolution. We know that increases in petrol and diesel oil have a spin-off effect of a disastrous nature that goes far beyond the impact on the CPI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised at the view taken on this matter by the Opposition.  The degree of inconsistency in their previous remarks is not surprising. I should like to refer to what was said in 1980.  I do not endorse any of the remarks, but it shows what can be said in these debates.  It was stated that if we look at it purely from the economic point of view any Government could be justified, from the point of view of the balance of payments in particular, in putting on some sort of tax in order to get people to cut down on their consumption of petrol. Any Deputy who is honest about this will recognise that would be totally justifiable in the overall national interests having regard to the unprecedented increase in our balance of payments deficit largely as a result of an increased consumption of oil.  The balance at that stage was some fraction of the £15 hundred million towards which it was heading when we came into office.</P>

      <P>He went on to say that it would cause some inconvenience and perhaps some hardship here and there, but by and large the ordinary motorist could adjust his motoring habits to economise to the extent of saving this amount in his weekly motoring.  Those were the comments of the present Leader of the Opposition in respect of a 20p increase in petrol in 1980.  I do not endorse those remarks.  The much more modest imposition involved in these two increases, 13.4p between them, are one third lower <Col N="675" /> than what was imposed then.  They will cause not just some inconvenience but a lot, and not just a little hardship here and there, but a lot of hardship.  I will not delude the people as the former Taoiseach did when he spoke in frivolous terms about the increase of 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy fears the outcome of what we are doing, but we and the nation as a whole feared the outcome of the continuation of the people opposite in office and of their policies.  Had they continued those policies the effect would have been disastrous.  I do not wish to broaden the debate but I am answering the points made and the phrases used.</P>
      <P>This increase involves a significant increase in the price of petrol.  The tax proportion of the price of petrol after these two impositions will be 49 per cent as against 51 per cent after the last budget.  I accept that that is a reflection of the spiralling cost of petrol imports and imports of oil products generally. This increase does not keep up with the increase in the price of petrol and next September taxation will be a smaller proportion than it was left by the last Government when they imposed 15p on top of the 20p they had imposed in the previous budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this imposition as savage.  The present Minister for Defence on several occasions spoke about people who lived away from industrial centres. The Minister is from County Meath, the same constituency as the Minister for Finance, and would be very much aware of this.  Many workers have to travel by car from their place of residence to Dublin and consequently a car would not be a luxury for them.  We had to be very careful not to put on too much excise <Col N="676" /> duty and tax and to keep fuel prices as low as possible.</P>
      <P>Due to the success of the Government between 1977 and 1981 in the development of industry in rural Ireland many industries were set up.  By the very nature of things a rural dweller is some distance from a factory and consequently this penal imposition will be very severe on him.  In my native parish young people learned the mining business in Canada and, before the strike, were mining at Navan.  This involves travelling 34 miles each way for most of these workers.  That kind of travel will be severely penalised by this increase.</P>
      <P>We depend largely on manufacturing industry and particularly that which exports its goods.  Inevitably this increase will bring pressure for higher wages which will add to inflation.  If one is in the export business, one's competitiveness will suffer.  The cost cannot be passed on in the open market to the customer as it can be in the case of the ESB or CIE. The Government have spoken about the pressure on wages.  They complained about increases that brought pressure on wages and increased inflation.  Like the Indian Chief, they are speaking with foreign tongues when they speak about dangers in inflation, pressures of the market, the danger of pricing ourselves out of the export market, the danger to the púnt in the EMS and at the same time are doing something that has the most far-reaching effect on the worker.  It is easy to do without a car if one lives in Dublin 4, but if one has to travel 35 miles it is not easy. The success of the development of rural industry may be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be an attitude that a car is a luxury and that we should force people to cut down on their use of petrol. How can a worker who has to get to his place of work cut down on the amount of petrol he uses? In the mines a worker could be on night shift and he would not have very much energy for spending money on petrol skylarking around for the weekend.  The Taoiseach seemed to indicate that there was frivolous expenditure on petrol.  The people I am talking about, who will suffer by this and whose expenditure will impact on the demand <Col N="677" /> for wages, should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance might consider making a list of manufacturing industries and particularly those with a big export business.  I have often toyed with the idea that it should be possible to treat them more easily in the income tax code because they are so important in the economy.  There are other important industries and services that can pass on costs to the consumer, but I am talking about people involved in increasing the volume of exports.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of caterwauling about the balance of payments.  We are not really logical or consistent when we do something like this.  The person I am talking about is not only being murdered by 13.4p on a gallon of petrol but will pay more for his car tax, which has been resurrected by the Minister.  The Minister should consider seriously what he is doing and should exempt those involved in manufacturing industry and depending to a great extent for their existence on competitive exports.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned cutting down.  In Western Europe there has been a 25 per cent cut in the use of oil over the last 12 months.  People are sensible enough to use the oil as sparingly as possible, but before I sit down I wish to say to those people whose case was made very often in this House by the now Minister for Defence, who lived in an area which was on the move to Dublin, that it is not merely the Dublin area or its hinterland that will be affected by this proposal but that every rural area in which a successful industry has been established will be affected.  The continued success of these manufacturing industries, these exporters, will depend to some extent on keeping down their costs, but harm is being done to them by this increase in excise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First we should consider what the increase is, because there was a time when a Minister for Finance when proposing changes in duty would tell the House what would be the ultimate net effect to the consumer.  We have not <Col N="678" /> been given any such information today. The Minister for Finance is seeking in this instance, as in others that we have dealt with already, to wash his hands of the direct consequences of the changes in duty.  The immediate change that will have to be made in margins for retailers in relation to petrol, which is one of the two principal items here, will be something more than 2p per gallon.  This means that in effect the increase is not 13.4p but slightly in excess of 15.5p.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made what I considered to be a remarkably weak argument in replying to Deputy Fitzgerald on this point.  The Taoiseach said that the proportion of tax in the price of oil is less than it was 18 months or two years ago. We know the way in which taxes have increased, but the point made by the Taoiseach demonstrates how much the inherent price of oil has gone up and the difficulties that this is creating for so many businesses and individuals.  In that situation, a situation which is demonstrated in the Taoiseach's figures, one would have thought that the last thing a Government who wished to stimulate the economy would do would be to increase further the price of an item that is being pushed up in price all the time anyway from outside sources.  Therefore, the Taoiseach's argument defeats the point he is trying to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution is divided into six parts. It seems to be very technically worded and I am not sure which paragraph refers to which oil.  However, I should like to refer in particular to what I call heavy oil, which is black oil as distinct from petrol, diesel or any of the light oils.  The House will recall that in the budget of, I think, January 1980, an additional duty of 5p per gallon was put on that oil.  That increase was the subject of a good deal of criticism at the time.  As one might expect also, it was the subject of much debate within the Cabinet as to whether such an increase&mdash;an increase which had been imposed originally by the previous Government in 1975&mdash;should be made having regard to the damage it would do to industry.  But when the yield of the additional 5p per gallon was pointed out there was a compelling case from the <Col N="679" /> point of view of the Exchequer and of the Department of Finance that it should be included and, albeit very reluctantly, I went along with it.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the yield in that respect was £45 million.  I would estimate that the yield in 1981 in respect of this proposal will be of the order of £50 million to £60 million.  I do not think anyone will be in a position to put an exact figure on it until the end of the year.  The Minister tells us that he is halving that additional 5p, but if the House cares to refer to his speech, it will find that he will save £6 million in a full year and £500,000 in this year. Apparently he considers that he has fulfilled his promise, but how can one fulfil one's promise to remove a level of taxation which runs at almost £30 million by removing £6 million worth of revenue? It seems to me to be perfectly evident that when we see the Finance Bill that is to follow on this budget&mdash;that is, if we ever see such a document &mdash; we will have a very long section which will begin by halving the rate of duty and then going on to state that, for instance, subsection (a) does not apply to the following, the following being a list as long as one's arm.</P>
    <P>Late last year because of the concern I had in relation to the effects which this unfortunate duty was having on all industries and because of the very serious effects it was having on some industries, the then Government devised a scheme of energy conservation grants whereby reliefs might be given to some of the hardest hit industries by way of their devising energy conservation schemes.  In effect this was a way of trying to relieve them of some of the hardships caused by the taxes.  This hardship was particularly evident in those industries in which a high proportion of costs was due to the cost of energy.  That scheme cost the Exchequer £2 million but it benefited only a handful of firms.  Indeed, only one firm got any worth-while benefit from it while about eight others derived limited benefit from it.  Under this hydrocarbon arrangement we are to get a rebate of £6 million.  On the basis of the experience I have just outlined I estimate that about 24 companies will derive some benefit from this <Col N="680" /> scheme while most of the others will get very little.  Is that not a flagrant denial again of the undertaking that was given to halve that tax? We will not know how the whole thing is to operate until we see the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal before us is to come into operation straight away but I wonder how it is to be administered.  There is no section of a Finance Act to guide the Revenue Commissioners.  Yet, administrative action is to be taken.  How is the whole system to be worked out?  Some of these changes become effective tomorrow but this one will not come in until later.  I am dealing with the resolution on excise on hydrocarbon oils of which there are six types.</P>
    <P>On 10 June last, Fine Gael supported <i>The Irish Times</i> to the extent of a one-third page advertisement.  The advertisement stated: &ldquo;Fine Gael Nail the Big Lie&rdquo;.  On the top left hand corner, top of the left, was a picture of a nail in a wall, with the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo;.  The advertisement stated: &ldquo;Lie: There will be huge increases on petrol, beer and spirits.  Answer: Fine Gael will strictly control the prices of these items&rdquo;.  An event happened the following day which was a poor thing for the Irish people.  The advertisement dealt with housewives and what they would get within weeks of the budget, the £9.60p. That was lie No. 2 that was nailed. &ldquo;Everybody will pay more tax&rdquo;.  That was another lie they nailed.  With Fine Gael, only people earning more than £50,000 a year would suffer.  The next one was about VAT.  I do not think the nailing of that lie catered for the 50 per cent increase in VAT which we have seen today.  The remainder of that historic advertisement can be discussed on a more suitable occasion than this when we are discussing only increases in the prices of various types of oil.</P>
    <P>We will now have the dearest petrol in Europe.  It is a distinction which changes from country to country from time to time.  We are now in that situation.  We certainly will have the dearest motoring in Europe because this budget is unique. It does not just increase the price of petrol: it increases the cost of new motor cars by increasing the excise duty on <Col N="681" /> them, by increasing VAT on them.  It re-imposes road tax on cars and at the same time imposes a substantial increase in duty.</P>
    <P>One would worry less about it if we had an efficient public transport system, but since this Government came into office the public transport system has not operated in the capital city.  When the strike has been settled finally, somebody should go out and take a film or a photograph of a bus moving in Dublin because if it happens between now and the end of July it will be the first bus that has moved in Dublin since Fine Gael and Labour came to office in the year of our Lord, 1981.</P>
    <P>Every one of these resolutions will have a deep and heavy impact on the tourism industry, not least this resolution in relation to petrol.  Having started the year not with prospects but with bookings which indicated that this year would be the most successful year ever for tourism, we are now unhappily in the situation, thanks to the H-block people and their sympathisers, that we are having the worst tourist season ever.  Nails in walls and in coffins seem to be fashionable with the Government, and these eight resolutions dealing with drink, motor cars, petrol and various other things that are of concern to tourists are the final nail in the coffin of that unfortunate industry which, because of currency differentials between here and Britain, this year could have had its best year ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned particularly about the impact these measures will have on our health services.  I know how they will operate in practice.  I am particularly concerned at the statements made by the Minister for Finance.  He spoke about a whole range of increases in ESB charges, hospital costs and the VAT changes, which will have an enormous effect on the general health services, in the cost of the many items that have to be purchased for those services. At the same time the Minister spoke about further substantial savings which will have to be made in the health services. He joined them with the Department of Justice, the Environment, Education and Defence and estimated that <Col N="682" /> £31 million will have to be saved by the end of the year.  In this measure the proposals will have a profound impact on the cost of providing health services, on the community based services, in particular, on the hospital ambulance services and on transport generally in the health services.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to make any special allocations to the health services to cover these extra costs?  Does he intend to provide a special allocation to cover the additional costs which will be incurred by the health services because of this resolution?  An enormous amount of work has been done in the last two years to try to reduce energy costs within the health services generally, including a major study of the longer term needs which was carried out by the ESB on behalf of the Department of Health to establish whether long-term arrangements could be made for further savings. This would involve new equipment, new machinery, arrangements for new heating systems.  In the short-term these savings could not be made, though some savings have been made, and because of that the health services have been working to a tight budget.</P>
      <P>This measure alone will impose a considerable additional cost on the health services and I should like to know if the Minister intends to make any special allocation to the health boards, to the voluntary hospitals and the health board hospitals, the homes for the handicapped and for the psychiatrically ill.  I know the normal procedure is to advise the Department of Health and the health boards to find means to absorb such costs.  I am afraid health boards will have exceptional difficulty and will face the problem of seriously reducing services, thus putting services at risk, if they are to absorb these increased costs, plus the changes in VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points on the price of petrol which is the one that will mostly affect workers, particularly those in rural areas.  The majority of the workers in my area have to travel each day to work in Galway, driving 25 to 30 miles per day.  To them, cars are not luxuries &mdash; they must have <Col N="683" /> them.  I made that comment when the Fianna Fáil Government increased the price of petrol.  I said it was too much, that it was the straw that would break the camel's back.  Whether the increase be 13p or 15p, those people must buy two gallons of petrol to get to and from work. The pint and the packet of smokes are luxuries, but they will pay 9p extra for those as well.  I do not know how you are going to get these people to accept the wage which they have at present and how inflation is going to be kept down with this type of budget.  I am referring to the smaller type of farmer who has not big tanks of milk and who has bought a car for taking his small tanks of milk to the creamery each day.  Every small farmer brings his milk in tanks behind his car, and all those people are going to be affected by this increase.  Some of the other items which the Government are taxing are luxuries anyway but a car to an ordinary worker or, indeed, to any person is not a luxury and the tax in this area has gone too high entirely.  The Government have made a big mistake in putting this further tax on petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point being made by Deputy Callanan.  Indeed I can appreciate that the increased cost imposed on workers as a result of any increase in the price of petrol, whether it be an increase in excise duty or in the price of crude oil, undoubtedly causes a problem and I have not the slightest intention of attempting to deny that. However, I indicated in my speech that this was not going to be an easy budget. I indicated that raising revenue is never easy and when one is confined, as we are, by the nature of the situation that we face in the middle of a financial year in regard to raising revenue, one is forced by the circumstances to have recourse effectively only to the indirect taxes.  The problem in increasing some of the other indirect taxes &mdash; Deputy Callanan referred to what he described as luxuries and I presume he had in mind things like cigarettes and alcohol &mdash; is that one does not have an unlimited capacity to increase the price of those commodities <Col N="684" /> without running into what is known as elasticity of demand.  In other words, people stop using them and the State stops getting revenue.  In selecting the taxes that we increased on this occasion I am afraid that we had to go across the whole range, including petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not give me any great pleasure to be defending this increase but, as I explained in my speech, we face a very serious financial situation about which action had to be taken immediately. Once the Exchequer return figures for the end of June, the first six months of the year, were published &mdash; they were not published before the previous Government left office but they were published just after we came into office &mdash; in the interest of the country it was incumbent upon us to take action to raise a sufficient amount of revenue or to reduce expenditure to such an extent that some measure of balance would be brought into our budget.  In facing that situation quickly we could not have recourse to the other taxes.  I explained why we could not have recourse to income tax and I explained also the situation in regard to capital taxation.  In that situation there was really only one area of taxation to which one could turn and that was indirect taxes.  One of the major indirect taxes from which revenue can be obtained, albeit at a cost and I do not attempt to minimise or deny the cost, is that on petrol and that is what we did. The House will appreciate that previous Governments have done this in less severe financial circumstances perhaps than the one we face now.  Circumstances being faced at the moment are more severe than any on record.  Other Governments have increased the tax on petrol by substantially larger sums than it is being increased on this occasion.  That is my answer to the point made by Deputy Callanan.  I can agree in large measure with the argument he is making but I must draw a different conclusion in the interests of protecting the currency and our balance of payments and providing sound public finances so that money will be there next year to meet services which have to be met.  We cannot confine our concern solely to this year.  Of course, <Col N="685" /> there would be no problem in letting things run for this year.  Probably we would survive for the next six months without doing anything.  The problem would be the following year and the year after, and the time to act is now.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by the contribution from Deputy Woods who referred to the need, in view of the increase in petrol prices, to make a special allocation to the health boards.  As those Members of the House who were here in January will remember, there was a very substantial increase in the price of petrol on that occasion, larger than the present one, and I do not recollect Deputy Woods making any special allocations to the health boards on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not covered in the Estimates because the Estimates were published before the budget and the budget increases in the price of petrol took place after the Estimates had been published.  There was no special allocation to the health boards after the budget and I am afraid that Deputy Woods's case does not impress me in the least.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can read into what I have said no more and no less.  I will turn to Deputy Wilson who, unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to answer the question, is he making any allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowances that will be made will be no less generous than those made by Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Health because he made <Col N="686" /> no allowances for a larger increase in the price of petrol which occurred after he had made the provision for the health boards on the previous occasion.  We will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I will turn to Deputy Wilson who is not here.  He referred to the problem of manufacturing industry.  I would like to point out to him that we in our programme will be providing substantial improvements in the competitive position in manufacturing industry.  We will be reducing the price of heavy oil used by manufacturing industry and, as I indicated in my statement, we will also be reducing the level of pay-related social insurance contributions falling on such industries.  The idea here is in recognition of the point made by Deputy Wilson that at least substantial sectors of manufacturing industry face competition problems.  They have to compete with similar industries elsewhere and one should act to reduce the cost.  That is precisely what we said we would do in our election programme and that is what we are going to do in Government in regard on the one hand to pay-related social insurance and on the other to fuel oil.  That more or less deals with the point made by Deputy Wilson.</P>
      <P>However, the main point that I wish to make in this contribution is the one I made in answer to Deputy Callanan.  I can see and I concede that serious problems are being caused by this increase, but we had very limited options in the matter of taxation.  We had a very serious situation and we had to act immediately. That is why we have acted as we have and I do not believe that Deputy Callanan, were he in my position, would have acted significantly differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question.  Does he concede that he could have raised the money required by capital taxation?  Is he saying that he found it easier to have indirect taxation? He has made that statement just now and I ask him to clarify what he has said.  I cannot quote him verbatim.  He said it was capital taxation, but then he seemed to brush that aside and said that the easiest thing was indirect taxation.  Is the Minister saying he recognises the fact that <Col N="687" /> he could have raised this money through capital taxation but found that not to be the way he wanted to do it and that the easiest way was by indirect taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Sherlock has asked that question.  The position is, as I indicated in my Budget Statement, that the Government, as stated in their joint programme, are reviewing the position in regard to capital taxation.  We have said we intend to increase substantially the yield to the Exchequer from capital taxation during our term in Government.  As I said in my Budget Statement, changes in capital taxation by their nature require very detailed and complex drafting if they are not to have unintended adverse effects. They must, therefore, be drafted with care.  We have only been in office for three weeks.  If we were to rush in to measures of capital taxation in that short space of time we could easily find we would introduce measures which would have effects which, for lack of preparation and lack of adequate attention to detail, no one could envisage.  Far from being in the interests of working people they might work to their detriment because of the way in which they had been drafted.  We preferred to defer action on capital taxation until we have had a greater opportunity to consider the matter and bring forward detailed proposals. We will bring forward those proposals, as indicated in our joint programme, in due course, because we recognise that all forms of taxation should make a fair and reasonable contribution to the costs of running the State.</P>
      <P>The point I made about indirect taxation being the one we have to turn to on this occasion arose from the fact that we had to introduce a budget quickly.  The speed with which we had to act was the determining factor.  In that situation we could not quickly introduce changes in capital taxation.  That is not to say we do not recognise that in the relatively immediate future something should be done and we will do something, as stated in the joint programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance <Col N="688" /> slipped this one over on the House when he was speaking about the petrol increase.  Deputy O'Malley showed this when he produced the Fine Gael advertisement in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The other point to which the Minister for Finance should reply is that a worker living 20 miles from his place of employment, a normal distance, when one takes all taxes into account &mdash; VAT, road tax &mdash; will pay somewhere in the region of £3.84p per week extra to go to his work.  That is an astronomical figure for an ordinary worker to pay in one fell swoop.  It does not appear that bad in terms of the petrol increase alone, but, in terms of all the taxes applied, that is the calculation the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach must stand over.  On a standard motor car of 1400 cc to 1000 cc, used by most workers, I estimate it will cost £3.84p or £ 4.40p if the horse power is a little higher. A car is not a luxury and the re-introduction of the car tax is a crippling blow when you take into account the philosophy expressed by Fine Gael prior to the election when they complained about the crippling effects on the finances of the youth of the country, especially the cost of insurance and petrol.  Now we have huge increases on petrol, beer and spirits. Fine Gael said they would strictly control the price of these items.  They certainly have strictly controlled them, to the point I have mentioned.  Will the Taoiseach contradict the figures I have given?  There is no point in giving £9.60 to the housewife next April or the following April if already £3.84p or £4.40p has already been taken from the husband long before you apply this so-called goody.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it was essential to tax these items because of the state of the economy.  It was very dishonest for the Government to say that their taxes would not affect the lower income groups, that only the higher income group would suffer.  Surely people going into work and the small farmer who is bringing his milk to the creamery by car are in the lower income group?  I agree with the Minister that if you want to increase taxes you must get it from those who are using what you are taxing.  It is <Col N="689" /> ordinary workers who use cars and who will be hit severely by increased taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the budget is such that it tends to spare as much as possible the least well off people. The least well off people in the social welfare categories are on very low levels of income and are not in a position to afford a car.  They may not have employment or may have retired.  There is no way in which the problems facing us at present, as a result of what we have been left with, can be resolved by confining taxation to the wealthy.  The burden has to be shared in some measure by all with the least burden and the greatest, and fullest relief offered to those who are poor and underprivileged in the social welfare categories or otherwise on very low incomes.</P>
      <P>That is what lies behind this budget. There can be no question of finding the sums necessary to do what had to be done to get at least the opening current deficit for next year down by one-third.  There is no chance of getting taxation under control without affecting a wide range of people, including workers.  We cannot hide that fact and we do not pretend to do so.  This is basically not our budget; it is the budget which was not brought in earlier this year when everything was deferred for electoral purposes.  We are left to pick up the pieces and to impose the unpopular charges.  We have taken that responsibility and have done so in a manner which spreads the burden as equitably as possible in the time available. It is true that if more time had been available we might have been able to do it in a more equitable way.  Deputy Sherlock has a point.  The Minister said we will be examining that area in accordance with our joint policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further reply to what Deputy Killilea said, while I am not accepting his figures because I have not the facility to calculate what the costs are but, undoubtedly a worker travelling 20 miles to his employment is going to suffer a significant increase in his costs as a result of this.  I cannot comment on the figures but I do not dispute the fact.  However, the <Col N="690" /> tax reform which we will be introducing at the earliest practicable moment, which, as we stated when we presented our programme initially, will be in the next tax year, will involve relief for this category, workers with typical incomes, whose order of magnitude will be somewhat higher than the figures mentioned by Deputy Killilea, whatever accuracy or merit those figures have as a measure of the cost of getting to work.  Those reliefs will be directed towards that particular group.  In the nature of things it is not possible to provide those reliefs sooner than next April because of the income tax year.  You cannot effect changes in the taxation system within that year and to that extent relief was deferred for that period.  I accept that this is a disadvantage. However, that relief will come and will certainly exceed the extra burden imposed on the typical worker by this resolution, even the worker who in rural areas has to travel by car to work.  I am not accepting Deputy Killilea's views but am not contradicting him either, as I have not had a chance of calculating.  The point he makes is one which, in principle, is valid, whatever about the amount.  But it will be met, and more than met, by the income tax measures we will be introducing in our next budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a point, rather than to ask a question.  On the tobacco question, we listened to facts and figures and here again we are listening to facts and figures.  The Taoiseach is renowned for being capable of doing a simple calculation.  I make the calculation and do not pretend that I can compare in any way with the statistician he is acclaimed to be.  I make my claim, which could be made by any ordinary human being in this House.  He does not need to be an acclaimed genius at figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to the point of what it costs, the Taoiseach has funked on every issue raised in this House today.  He funked on the tobacco issue to Deputy Nolan earlier on and now says that he cannot calculate a little sum for me.  It is a simple sum and ranges from £3.84 to £4.10.  I am not a mathematician, but am going on the figures given to the Taoiseach <Col N="691" /> by his own Minister for Finance. He can assume a deficit of £946 million in the budget at the end of this year, but cannot make a simple sum of what it costs a worker to travel to work and back 20 miles in one week of the year.  He can assume what the deficit will be and make allegations through the propaganda machine, as has been done in the last five to eight weeks, yet he cannot make up how much it will cost a worker to travel to work and back 20 miles for five or six days a week.  I cannot understand that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can attempt to answer the question.  The Deputy has been doing some homework there, but I have not had the opportunity of making calculations. If the Deputy wants instant calculations, the result would be something like this.  Twenty miles each way is 40 miles and for five days is 200 miles.  Forty <Col N="692" /> miles to the gallon for a typical small car makes five gallons a week.  Forty-nine weeks in the year.  Taking 45 gallons multiplied by the amount of the increase, the figure got will be about one-tenth of what the Deputy produces.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the little time left to us we do not intend to discuss this matter in any detail this evening, but I should like to make some comments and to ask some questions.  I would ask whether the Government have considered the employment implications of this duty.  Financial Resolution No. 6 increases the duty on motor cars from 40 per cent to 50 per cent and I am sure I am right in thinking that this will be further increased by the VAT proposal.  This is a major imposition on the motor car industry which will seriously affect it and must have very serious repercussions on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were preparing the January budget this was one of the proposals put to us from the official side. It was a very ready way of raising a considerable amount of revenue but because of all its implications we turned it down and did not proceed with it in that budget.  I am at a loss to see how the Government can be reconciled with this imposition on the motor vehicle industry at a time when they are allegedly concerned with the employment situation, leaving aside entirely for the moment all that this means from the point of view of those who rely on the motor car for their employment or other purposes.  It will represent a very considerable imposition for a large section of the community and <Col N="696" /> in the course of the Budget discussion I am certain that a number of people on this side of the House will wish to elaborate on all that is involved in this increase.  We deplore this imposition, apart altogether from what it means in terms of taxation to the organisations concerned.  We deplore it because of its economic implications and the very serious repercussions it will have on employment in this very sensitive industry.  The motor industry has just come through very grave difficulties in a serious recession and this measure is a serious mistake by the Government.  I am reinforced in this view when I recall that this was one of the measures we decided not to take in January when we were searching everywhere for some source of revenue to try to ensure that the budget deficit would be retained at a level of £515 million.</P>
    <P>Time at our disposal is limited and we wish to talk in some detail on VAT and its implications.  I assure the Government that the fact that we are not having a major discussion at this stage on this resolution does not mean that we are not seriously perturbed by what is proposed and by its implications, particularly on the employment situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of the Leader of the Opposition not to spend the time of the House unduly discussing one resolution when there are a number of others.  The estimated effect of this duty on the sale of cars is a drop of less than 2 per cent in car sales.  This is the calculation made by the Revenue Commissioners and I am sure Deputies opposite will recollect that the Revenue Commissioners are both scrupulous and reliable in their estimates of likely trends in consumption resulting from a tax change and hence the likely yield.  I am not denying that the estimated drop in sales is significant but one must bear in mind that in January this year car sales reached an all-time record level.  Since January there has been some fall off and the latest figures would not represent a record level.  However, the House will see that the car market is relatively buoyant and that the effects of this measure <Col N="697" /> will not be as severe as the Leader of the Opposition seems to anticipate.</P>
      <P>The assembly industry here is not as large as in many other European countries. The greater part of most motor cars is imported and motor sales have an adverse effect on our balance of payments. To that extent while there will be disadvantages in any reduction in sales there will be advantages in the terms of relief on our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>The main point about this measure is not that it can be justified in its entirety standing on its own but that it is justified because of the serious financial situation in which it had to be introduced.  It is necessary for the revenue it will yield. We have not attempted to conceal that. It would be preferable if we did not have to put this extra cost on the people but it is necessary in present circumstances.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this resolution is to increase the 10 per cent VAT rate to 15 per cent with effect from 1 September <Col N="700" /> 1981.  It also provides for a reduction of 3 per cent in the effective rate of tax applied to agricultural services and for an appropriate adjustment in the agricultural flat rate VAT percentage in order to compensate farmers for the changes in the general rate increase on goods and services used for agricultural purposes. The yield from this proposal is estimated to be £28.2 million in 1981 and in a full year £188.5 million.  The justification for this measure, which we have not great pleasure in proposing, is the justification for all the other tax measures in the budget.  We were convinced that revenue had to be raised quickly to put this country and its finances on a solid footing.  We recognise that this will have an effect on the cost of living but we have taken steps to compensate the weaker sections by, in the first instancee, providing a 5 per cent increase in the rates of old age pension and a 3 per cent increase in other social welfare benefits.  In judging its effect on the cost of living this measure must be set beside measures such as the guarantee given by the Government not to allow certain basic foodstuffs to rise in price this year, regardless of whatever increases may occur in the normal course, by means of spending subsidies on those commodities.  This measure in effect is an adjustment of the price system.  Certain products will go up in price whereas certain basic foodstuffs will not go up or will be reduced from what they would otherwise be, relative to costs.  That is a redistribution of the burden of inflation to the benefit of the weaker sections who spend a larger share of their incomes on food and clothes.  This measure is only necessary because of the serious budgetary situation we face and it would not otherwise be introduced.</P>

      <P>The effect on the CPI, including the increase that this brings in the items which are subject to excise duty is 1.98 per cent.  If one excludes the effect of the increase in VAT on the items which are subject to excise duty about which we <Col N="701" /> talked earlier, the net effect is substantially less &mdash; it is 0.745 per cent.</P>

      <P>There is no justification for this penal imposition of a 50 per cent increase in the 10 per cent rate of VAT.  It is probably the most penal imposition that this House has ever seen and the present situation does not justify it.  It is pure political expediency and it means that the Government have decided to impose a brutal tax.  The Minister talks about a 2 per cent increase in the CPI but that is a minor part of the inflationary impact of this imposition.  It will also have an enormous impact on employment.  The Government and those who vote with it will live to regret the day when this resolution was carried through the House because their constituents will bring it to their notice every day.  If one of the parties opposite claims to be the guardian of the working man and woman, may God protect them from parties like that and thank God for the continued existence of Fianna Fáil.  Before Deputies laugh too loudly, before those people who have now decided to support this insecure Government laugh too loudly, let me tell them what this 50 per cent affects, what types of goods, services and products.  There are very few it does not affect.  I said earlier today that for the most part it covers non-luxury or semiluxury items.  Are the Government saying that the people are not entitled to avail of these essential commodities?  They may not be clothing or essential foodstuffs but they are nonetheless important and essential in most homes, farms and businesses because they are all affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me mention a few.  Fertilisers are included as is machinery, plant and equipment of a kind commonly used by farmers and fishermen.  How does the Minister for Agriculture feel about that? Also included are seeds, trees, plants and so on, as are printed books and booklets. Also included are schoolbooks, yes, 50 per cent increase in the VAT on school books.  I hope Deputy Kemmy's constituents will cheer him loudly.  Also included are newspapers and periodicals. And we heard the cries from those <Col N="702" /> benches when in opposition, &ldquo;Take VAT from schoolbooks.  Take VAT from newspapers.&rdquo;  Where is the sincerity or honesty now?  Also included are materials commonly used in the construction industry.  It covers every single item of construction from the gravel, the sand, the block, the brick, whatever may be produced in all our constituencies; they are all covered.  There are those who will worry about that also because it will affect the purchase of blocks and bricks for local authority work and I am sure people like Deputy Kemmy would have an interest in that or would pretend to.</P>
    <P>Also included is all office equipment and food and drink for human consumption. I remember, when my predecessor in the Department of Finance introduced impositions on table waters here one and a half years or more ago, the screams that arose from the Opposition benches.  They are now taxing the ordinary mineral, table water, ice cream, sweets and the lollipops children eat.  They are all covered by this imposition and are the people across saying they are not essential?  Of course they are to any child in any community and let us hope they will long be available to them.  Also included are medicines for use other than oral medicines. I could continue.  Our leader has referred already to the imposition on cars.  I have a particular interest in them because of the city that I and others on that side represent in which there is the Ford Motor Company employing some 1,100 people.</P>
    <P>I entirely respect the honesty and ability of the Revenue Commissioners.  I have no reason whatsoever to doubt any of the figures they present for a budget, not like some people over there when they were on this side of the House.  But one thing that not even they can estimate &mdash; when there are four penal impositions on motorists &mdash; with their wisdom and ability is the number of cars that will be sold in the remainder of this year.  I believe, and the Minister said himself, that the car industry had become buoyant, so it had, a great boon to our city, to Cork.  But if it begins to decline that Minister, that Government must take responsibility and I fear today's impositions <Col N="703" /> will do that.  Tyres and most other car accessories are also included.  In other words, the motorist is not finished with the costs enumerated by us but additionally has to meet the increased cost of accessories and so on.</P>
    <P>I believe this is the greatest, most penal imposition ever imposed by a Minister for Finance.  He said it will yield £188 million, almost £200 million in a full year. Perhaps we will be able to tease out that figure in greater detail later, obviously not this evening, when perhaps &mdash; if the Government are still in existence &mdash; the Finance Bill comes before the House.  It seems to me to be a very hefty figure because of the downturn in activity it will occasion.  All services are affected by this imposition.  I could continue but I am conscious that the hour is late, that our deadline is close and that there are other speakers on this side of the House who want to contribute to this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that it was very fortunate that the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, removed VAT from equipment for the handicapped.  This is particularly important now since this measure would have imposed a tremendous burden on the handicapped in this year were it not for his action.  Of course the 10 per cent rate still applies to a wide range of medical apparatus which will affect the whole population, just as it will medicines, as Deputy Gene Fitzgerald has said, including dental, medical, surgical instruments, artificial teeth, splints, fracture equipment, wadding, gauze, bandages, all these commodities used because some 60 per cent of the total area covered by VAT is affected by this 10 per cent rate.  Therefore it will have a devastating impact on the health services generally. However, I am glad to bring the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister's predecessor at least exempted the handicapped from this very severe imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution represents, much more than any of the others before us, the most serious imposition being <Col N="704" /> made under this budget.  I say that because, as the Minister himself indicated, we get some measure of its impact from the full year figure which he gave for next year of £188 million.  Obviously it will hit very many items.</P>
      <P>As I said in relation to an earlier matter, it is not just the imposition of the increased value-added tax, the 50 per cent increase in VAT, it is the mark-up on top of that and the overall effect on prices, inflation, on wage claims, on the cost of building and all other types of contracts which will work their way through in a way which I am afraid will cause a price explosion in our economy. The situation is bad enough at present but this is deliberate Government action with their eyes open which will result within, I would say at the outset, 12 months in an enormous price explosion for which the responsibility rests solely on the members of the Government and those who vote for these resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>When considering the question of imposing value-added tax it is rather surprising that the Minister did not realise that its imposition will mean that workers will pay tax now on every pound they earn.  The worker needs every pound he earns.  At this time when, as I pointed out when speaking the other evening, the situation obtains in which a tax on profits is a mere 7 per cent per £100, workers' tax is £17 per £100 of earnings, it shows quite clearly that insufficient consideration was given to alternative means of raising the finance needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say this also that the Members in the Opposition benches do not convince me one bit by the manner in which they are now speaking, nor do they vindicate themselves, that they, when in office, considered this matter, because they also did the same to working people. They are now saying that this is an imposition on working class people, but if there was a shift of power tomorrow there would not be any change.  As well as imposing this indirect taxation, which will be a terrible burden on the people, there is the cut in public expenditure of £170 million.  I understand health services will be affected by this.  I would like the Minister <Col N="705" /> to tell us that there are funds available for drugs, which is of benefit to those who have not full eligibility.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Electricity Supply Board that construction of the electricity network on Clare Island is in progress. The plant commissioning is scheduled for October 1981 and it is expected that supply will be made available then, provided the generator building is completed on time and work is not interrupted by unfavourable weather or other unforseen occurrences.</P>

      <P>Arising from Government decisions in 1979 and 1980, I have been informed by the Electricity Supply Board that in view of the small number of houses on Innisturk Island it has been decided to provide individual generating sets instead of a central generating unit.  The board expect that the provision of these sets will be completed on schedule in October this year.</P>

    <P>These proposed schemes are dependent for their supply on the South Leitrim Regional Water supply Scheme Stage 2.  Augmentation works are being carried out on this scheme at present and it is expected that water will be available to these groups in 12-18 months time.  In the meantime a number of the smaller groups are being advised to amalgamate into a larger group and all groups are being advised to have designs prepared and submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P Just="Center">(3) Proposed Schemes the number of houses for which are not yet finalised</P>
    <P>Gubadoorish &mdash; Leitrim County Council have been asked if they are in a position to give the group a supply of water and to date a reply has not been received.</P>
    <P>Kilcoon and Ardvarney&mdash;The County Council were asked if they could give these groups a supply of water but they have indicated that because of the already high demand in this area they are not in a position to give them a supply at present.</P>
    <P>Stonepark, Lattoon, Corlea and Stradrina&mdash;The designs for these schemes have been approved by both the Department and the County Council and quotations for materials and labour are awaited from the groups.</P>
    <P>Bohey, Middle Wardhouse, Aughavanny and Lower Annagh/Eden&mdash;These schemes are being designed at present and copies of the design and design data are awaited in the Department.</P>
    <P>Clenaghoo&mdash;The County Council were asked to give this group a connection to the Council's mains but they have indicated that they are not in a position to do so.  The group have been advised to seek an alternative source.</P>
    <P>Erriff&mdash;Grants will be reallocated on the basis of the higher rates recently introduced as soon as Leitrim County Council indicate that they are satisfied with certain legal aspects of the scheme.</P>

      <P>A decision to grant or refuse an application for a medical card is one for the chief executive officer of each health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the CEO are unable to provide medical care for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  In assessing entitlement to medical cards, regard is had not only to income but also to other personal and family circumstances which have a bearing on ability to meet medical expenses. A statement of the means assessed in any particular case would not, therefore, necessarily convey the basis for the refusal to grant a medical card.</P>

      <Col N="548" /> It is to be expected that the figure for the year 1980-81 will increase for some time to come as also will the figures for the years 1979-80 and 1978-79, but to a proportionately lesser extent, because the unpaid tax referable to the latter two years tends to diminish with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>The eventual loss to the Exchequer in respect of PAYE due in insolvency cases can reasonably be expected to be considerably less than the total tax outstanding as ascertained at any given time.  Substantial payments are usually received from the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of assets as the PAYE due for the 12 months prior to insolvency enjoys preferential status.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that there is no question of countenancing the retention of moneys due under PAYE so as, in effect, to provide what are described as indirect grants to firms in financial difficulties. Every effort is made by the Revenue Commissioners to carry out their statutory obligations and to collect amounts due under PAYE as soon as possible after the due dates.</P>

      <P>In order to be granted a wine licence a person must already hold a refreshment house licence.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following representations from the trade, my predecessor concluded that the combined imposition of £100 for the refreshment house and wine licences should be reduced in order to assist the smaller guesthouse owners and restaurant operators.  The 1981 Finance Act provided accordingly for the reduction of the refreshment house licence from £50 to £10.
