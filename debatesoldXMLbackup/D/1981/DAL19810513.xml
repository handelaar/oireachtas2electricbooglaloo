        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that there are approximately 300 mentally handicapped children and adults on the waiting list for residential care in the Eastern Health Board area; if he is further aware that this constitutes a phenomenal pressure on the families concerned; if he has any proposals to remedy the position by providing the required residential care to relieve their difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 31 December 1980 there were 2,419 persons in special residential centres for the mentally handicapped in the Eastern Health Board area.  Of these 1,437 were from the Eastern Health Board area.  I should say in this regard that on 31 December 1980, there were 199 mentally handicapped persons from the Eastern Health Board in special residential centres outside the board's area.  There were 271 persons from the board's area on the waiting list for residential care on 31 December 1980.</P>
      <P>Major building works in the mental handicap field within the Eastern Health Board area are in progress at Cheeverstown House, Templeogue, St. Michael's House, Ballymum, Stewart's Hospital, Palmerstown and at Ballyboden.  These projects taken together with the Loughlinstown complex upon which I will be allowing planning to proceed this year will have the effect of providing 500 additional residential places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two specific questions for the Minister in relation to the <Col N="2731" /> Loughlinstown project and also St. Michael's House, Ballymun.  With regard to Loughlinstown, is the Minister in a position to give more detailed information about when he will allow planning to proceed and also why he has not allowed it to proceed already?  In relation to St. Michael's House, Ballymun, will he state why the three chalets of the five being constructed, and which are virtually ready for use, have not yet been brought into use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, they are due to be ready in June this year and will come into operation at that time.  With regard to Loughlinstown, I gave authority for proceeding with the planning development at a recent meeting of the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state if the application for planning permission has been lodged by the authority?  If not, will he bring some pressure to bear to ensure that the application is submitted without any further delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pursue that point.  I did not think any problem was envisaged there.  The main problem was with regard to the funds to proceed with the major planning of the complex, for which I have given approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Will the Minister accept that the number of people, particularly young people, on the waiting list is at an unacceptably high level?  The number of inpatients in mental institutions has been reducing considerably.  Will the Minister state why it was not possible to convert these existing buildings into suitable accommodation?  There appears to be a particular problem with young people who are moved from an institution for children when they reach 16 or 17 years. These young people are sent home very often but this is not a suitable method of dealing with them and it creates a real problem for families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this area is a <Col N="2732" /> priority area and that there is need to proceed with urgency.  Despite the difficult economic situation, this year an additional £2 million has been provided in the capital allocation.  We are providing a total of £8 million for work in this area as against £6 million last year.  The programme which we have in the Eastern Health Board area will provide an additional 500 places.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is being treated as a matter of considerable urgency.  In relation to the other question raised by the Deputy of using buildings that are vacated in the existing psychiatric centres, I will make the following comment.  In some instances a substantial campus is available and facilities can be provided.  However, in many cases the buildings that become available are very old and are not suitable.  A number of developments currently taking place are based on the village concept.  I mention the development at Cheeverstown House which is a very exciting and interesting concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am sure it is very exciting and interesting but appears to be a long-term project.  Is the Minister in a position to do something in the short-term to facilitate families who are under fierce pressure? Will he state how many extra beds have been provided in the past four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable number has been provided.  I do not have the figure to hand and perhaps the Deputy will put down a separate question on the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister can go back as far as he wishes.  We have had two whizz-kids <Col N="2733" /> in the Department in the past four years but they have done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the arrangements he has made to meet the urgent needs of the victims of the Stardust fire in respect of the payment of medical expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the victims of the Stardust fire who received or are receiving hospital treatment are receiving services free of charge.</P>
      <P>Free transport by taxi was provided for the injured who have to return to out-patients departments of hospitals for continuing treatment.</P>
      <P>With regard to other medical expenses, some of those injured already held medical cards, which entitles them to a general medical practitioner service and medicines free of charge.  A further 45 persons have since been supplied with medical cards.  In general, every effort is being made to facilitate those injured in the fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister repeat in this House the undertaking he gave on radio immediately after the fire to the effect that all medical expenses would be met by his Department for victims of the Stardust fire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly could from the statement I made.  Finally, lest any of those who are undergoing treatment as a result of the accident in the Stardust are concerned about the cost of such treatment, let me reassure them on this point. The vast majority of these patients, if not all, will be eligible for completely free hospital services under the Health Acts. But, if there are any of them who are not, and the cost of whose treatment is not met by other agencies such as the <Col N="2734" /> Voluntary Health Insurance Board, the Government will take steps to ensure that they personally will not fall liable for any costs they may incur in the course of the hospital treatment they are receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House under what legislation he will provide money to meet all the medical expenses of the victims who may not be covered by existing schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As it transpires, all the patients are covered so the problem does not seem to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing the Minister said to me was that the majority, if not all, were covered, from which I take it that he simply does not know whether or not all are covered.  Can the Minister clarify the situation?  Under what legislation will he provide money to meet the expenses of anybody who may not be covered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement I made was made after someone had suggested to the media that there might be costs and services which would not be covered.  In that context at that time I made that statement to reassure those involved.  The phrase &ldquo;if not all&rdquo; applied at the time.  It does not apply at this time to my knowledge. Our services cover all the patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A very brief final supplementary question from Deputy Cluskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be unsure whether or not all the victims receiving medical treatment are covered by existing legislation.  In the event of any of the victims not being covered by existing legislation, under what legal provision will the Minister make their expenses available to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify the point that I am not the one who is unsure. Deputy Horgan was unsure about a statement made at the time of the accident. The Health Acts cover all the patients so the problem does not arise.</P>

      <P>The Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination was established in November 1977 with the following terms of reference: To examine persons who, it is claimed, have been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, review the medical information available in relation to them and indicate whether, in their opinion, the damage is attributable to the vaccination.</P>
      <P>To date, 50 persons have been examined by the group.  They have not, as yet, completed their work.  It would not be appropriate for me to provide specific information regarding the group's findings or to make any other statement in the matter, until such time as the group complete their work.</P>

      <P>The expert group was established in November 1977.  There was a meeting in March 1977 with a deputation from the association which included the present Taoiseach, then Opposition spokesman on Health, and Deputy O'Connell.  It was agreed to set up an expert medical group at that stage.  The group was set up in November 1977. There was some delay initially about the terms of reference I think.  Once that was sorted out the expert group have been proceeding with the cases.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that only 50 children are involved and that it has taken three-and-a-half years to date, could the Minister state when the panel of experts will have completed their examination, and what will be the recommendations of the Government in respect of these children where there is an established link between the brain damage and the pertussis vaccine?  Is the Minister aware of the report published in Britain yesterday, or the day before, about the definite link established between pertussis and brain damage? Would he take the conclusions of that <Col N="2739" /> report into consideration in any decision taken in regard to these children?</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the incidence is so low&mdash;one in 90,000&mdash;and that the incidence of brain damage from pertussis itself is so high, a statement from the Minister to that effect might reassure the many parents of children who are still in great fear of having the vaccine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the dental service in the North Eastern Health Board area is grossly under-staffed and that many areas are left without the service of a dentist under the choice of dentist scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter with particular reference to the number of people who are eligible for treatment <Col N="2741" /> in Counties Cavan and Monaghan and to the number of dentists available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in common with other health boards the North Eastern Health Board have had difficulty in filling all their whole-time posts due mainly to the overall shortage of dentists.</P>
      <P>For the North Eastern Health Board area as a whole there are 17 whole-time dentists, five dentists are providing part-time services on a sessional basis and a further 32 in private practice are participating in the choice of dentist scheme for medical card holders.</P>
      <P>In Cavan and Monaghan, where there are 46,500 eligible adults, four of the nine whole-time posts are vacant.  The four private dentists in Monaghan are participating in the choice of dentist scheme but none of the four Cavan dentists are in that scheme.  As will be appreciated it is a matter for each individual dentist to decide whether or not to participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to improve the dental services.  The new career structure and increased rates of pay recently introduced should improve recruitment. Discussions with a view to further improving the dental service for eligible patients have already commenced with representatives of the dental profession.</P>

Would the Minister accept further that there are the equivalent of four full-time dentists only to cater for these people, that it has been suggested that this constitutes an impossible task and has been likened to me by the head dentist in the scheme as attempting to water the desert with a watering can?

Since the Minister says that none of the dentists in County Cavan participate in the choice of dentist scheme does the Minister not accept that that means that it is not acceptable to them?  Does the Minister not agree that that being the case it is his business, as Minister for Health, to provide a service for people eligible for it?</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is inquiring about capital projects and that his interest is in developments which I have announced in recent weeks.  The reply to the Deputy's question it in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, <Col N="2744" /> I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.  In regard to (c) of the Deputy's question I wish to say that £5,150,000 is allocated for these schemes in 1981.  Many factors make it difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy what money will be spent on each project but overall expenditure will be of the order of £5,150,000.</P>
      <P>In regard to (d) it would not be accurate to speak about the date of commencement as in all the schemes under consideration some work of planning has been carried out.  The money I have allocated will provide in each case for continuation on the road to completion.</P>
      <P>In addition to the schemes outlined in the tabular statement I have allocated a total of £1,850,000 in the current year to health boards, voluntary hospitals and other health agencies for minor capital projects, that is for capital schemes which individually will not cost more than £50,000 and which will be totally expended in this year.  I would also inform the Deputy that the projects I have referred to are additional to those which are on-going and for which a capital allocation of £40,000,000 is available this year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister has given himself the benefit of both worlds, using a tabular statement and then answering the question, thus preventing supplementaries. I gather the Minister said that there is £5,150,000 provided this year.  Am I correct in thinking that this includes projects in Galway, Castlebar, Sligo, Cavan, Waterford, Cork and a number of other counties?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The projects in which I am interested are those the Minister announced on his grand tour some time ago, projects that were not included in the £40 million in the capital programme.  As I understand it, he announced them in Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Cavan, Louth, Waterford, Tipperary, Kerry and probably in a number of other counties.  There was £5.1 million included and there was a special function in each place to announce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Deputy's difficulty in following the situation since in 1976, the last year for which the Coalition were responsible, £11.2 million was spent on all capital projects.  This year we are spending £47 million, which enables us to develop and expand the programme which will lead directly to completion.  Any of the projects which we have undertaken are phased in our capital expenditure, assuming the expenditure stays at or about the level which we have set, so the Deputy need have no fear about that aspect.  I know the Deputy is concerned about some of them in particular.  It is our commitment to pursue these directly to building and completion and we have provided in our ongoing capital programme to do that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am concerned about the whole performance as well as the one in Cavan. Am I right in thinking that most of the work the Minister has outlined in these ten or 12 counties as far as this year is concerned is invisible work and that the work which the Minister brought to a standstill in Cavan 12 months ago ensures that there will be no visible signs of progress there before well into next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>I will do what I can to advance that project in the light of the moneys available.

    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Altranais have made modifications to their syllabus for general training in order to give effect to EEC directives <Col N="2751" /> concerning training of general nurses.  My Department have recently written to the health boards and voluntary hospitals concerned with training requesting confirmation that they are taking the steps necessary to meet the requirements of the board's training programme. The position will be further examined in the light of the replies received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is it not a fact that some of the training hospitals were not in a position to give the training prescribed by EEC directives and that the training was then modified?  However some of the larger hospitals in this city are not even now in a position to give the modified training in obstetrics and community care as well as lectures and theory.  The Minister was informed of this and that some of the nurses in training since July 1979 will now come out of training without the necessary qualifications or experience to entitle them to registration.  Is it not true that the Minister has been told about that on several occasions and that the major curtailment in finance is the direct cause of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

This additional syllabus, which will bring a wider base in training, is being discussed with a view to implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim for unemployment assistance of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer from 29 October 1980 on the grounds that his means exceeded the statutory limit of £1,521.00 applicable in his case.  The person concerned appealed against the assessment of means, but an appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer on 30 December 1980.  However, if the person concerned is of the opinion that his circumstances have changed since the date on which his case was determined by the appeals officer, it is open to him to apply to have his means reassessed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from December 1976 and was paid to 17 May 1980.  Payment was disallowed after that date as he was considered by a medical referee of my Department to be capable of work.</P>
      <P>He was examined by a second medical referee on 1 May 1981 and was considered to be incapable of work but from 1 March 1981 only.  Payment has therefore been made from 1 March to 11 May 1981. His claim is being passed to an appeals office for decision in respect of the period 18 May 1980 to 28 February 1981.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the availability <Col N="2755" /> of EEC funds, he will initiate a nationwide scheme to provide milk in schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he intends to introduce the EEC scheme to subsidise milk for distribution to primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The EEC Council decided in 1977 to make funds available for the supply of milk and certain milk products to school children at reduced prices for a period of at least five years.  The funds provided under this arrangement have been availed of since then in respect of milk and cheese supplied under the existing school meals scheme.  Of the 89 urban local authorities entitled to operate schemes 44 do so and of these 26 supply milk as part of the meal.</P>
      <P>A special scheme is in operation in the Gaeltacht areas but none of the local authorities concerned supplies milk.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing a nationwide school milk scheme under the terms of the EEC regulations was examined in 1977 and the Government decided that the scheme on these lines was not suitable for general implementation in this country.</P>
      <P>To introduce such a scheme now would involve increased expenditure of about £5.4 million annually from the Exchequer and there would, of course, be enormous administrative problems.</P>
      <P>The position will be re-examined, however, to see whether it would be feasible to operate a free milk scheme in particular circumstances where there may be a demand for such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that certainly in the winter months there is a need for a nationwide scheme? It is unfortunate that only half of the urban authorities referred to by the Minister have even a partial scheme.  Would he not agree that it is important that all the local authorities, especially in relation <Col N="2756" /> to primary schools, would establish a scheme to ensure that young children who have to travel many miles to school by bus on winter mornings should have the benefit of such a scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly prepared to have this matter re-examined.  The Deputy is aware that the co-operation of the local authorities and, indeed, of the schools, is required.  If it is feasible to operate a free milk scheme in particular circumstances, where there is a demand then we will have that matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware &mdash; and I am sure he is &mdash; that under this scheme half-a-pint of milk could be supplied each day to primary school pupils throughout the country at a cost of about 1p per week per pupil?  Is he saying that he is prepared to examine this?  Has he not examined it since 1977?  The money is there from EEC funds to pay for this scheme.  I am assuming that that is correct.  Is the Minister saying that he is now prepared to consider and investigate it?  Has he not done so previously?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This study was undertaken and the various people involved were consulted and at that stage it was not seen as feasible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or desirable to introduce that scheme.  It is fairly obvious from the figures that only half the local authorities presently operate the scheme that exists at the moment, as Deputy Collins has pointed out.  In addition, the schools have to undertake administrative arrangements.  Certainly, I have an open mind and I am prepared to look at the whole matter in circumstances where it may be seen as desirable or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that Bord Bainne are very neglectful in not ensuring that milk and milk products are available to all the young children in our schools?  Have any representations been made to him by Bord <Col N="2757" /> Bainne to ensure that such a system would be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not personally aware of any but it is an interesting point.  There might be some way of dealing with the administrative arrangement through particular forms of packaging and so on.  I will certainly look into that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that Bord Bainne have been extremely neglectful in not trying to ensure that such a nationwide scheme is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this matter was investigated with the various interested parties concerned and that it was found not to be desirable to introduce this scheme.  That was one phrase the Minister used.  Why is it not desirable, especially during the winter months, to have free milk available to our pupils in rural areas as well as where this is being done?  We are advertising milk and agriculturally as well as socially and economically, it is important that this milk scheme be utilised.  It is there to be used, particularly by us as a milk producing country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 28 November 1980 in respect of incapacity due to an accident at work on 10 November 1980. Payment could not be made pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily in such cases payment of disability benefit is made on an interim basis pending completion of the inquiries, but the person concerned was not entitled to such payment because she had not sufficient contributions in the governing contribution year.  The last insurance card to her credit was for the year 1976-1977.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries it was accepted that the incapacity was in fact due to an accident at work.  The claim to injury benefit was allowed and payment has been made for the period from 10 November 1980 to 6 March 1981, when she was certified fit to resume work.</P>

    <P>Following investigation his claim to injury benefit has been allowed from 2 September 1980 to 2 March 1981, the maximum period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident that such benefit is statutorily payable.  All the injury benefit <Col N="2761" /> due for the period less disability benefit paid on account has now been paid.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit has been allowed from 17 September 1980.  Arrears of the benefit due are in course of being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 1 December 1980.  She was not, however, entitled to payment from that date to 3 January 1981 as she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid in the 1978-79 contribution year which governed that period.</P>
      <P>Her claim from 5 January 1981 is governed by her insurance record in the 1979-80 year.  As she had a total of 40 contributions in the 1979-80 year, payment was made to 19 January 1981 after which date she ceased to submit medical certificates.  Further medical evidence of incapacity for work has now been received and benefit has been paid to 8 May 1981.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a non-contributory widow's pension at the maximum rate appropriate to a widow with no qualified children with effect from 12 December 1980.  A pension order book, payable from 6 February 1981, has been issued to the designated post office for collection by her and a payable order for the arrears of pension prior to 6 February 1981 issued on 6 April.</P>
      <P>There was no undue delay in processing the claim for widow's pension in this case.  The widow was the owner of a good-sized farm and also had a considerable amount of capital and the assessed means from these sources far exceeded the statutory means limit for the award of pension.  Although she intimated in October 1979 that she was transferring the farm to her son, the formal transfer was only notified to my Department recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was referring to the statement by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in relation to the stock exchange facilities now available.  The speculation on the stock exchange was raised by the Taoiseach in suggesting in the past few weeks that an oil find was imminent.  The speculation was due to such a statement coming at that level.  The position in relation to the added moneys being provided to the IDA under different headings is a very welcome development and Members on this side of the House welcome this new approach.  I should like to refer to one heading under which there is an increase, maximum grant for research and development.  It is significant that this heading has been picked out for an increase although it is a small one.  The Minister is also aware of the importance of this area within the industrial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems that has arisen in the recent past relating to the closure of factories has been that in many cases they have not been carrying out the kind of research and development which is necessary for them to maintain viability.  In some cases, in the case of multinationals for example, this research and development facility is not located here.  In many cases it is at their home base in their native country, wherever that might be. The increase under this heading will, I hope, encourage the improvement of <Col N="2789" /> research and development where it exists and the setting up of research and development sectors where they do not exist but are taking place outside the country. Members are aware of the massive increase in unemployment and the tragedy that follows in relation to people who are involved in it and their families. Anything that can relieve such pressure and improve the employment situation must be welcomed by any right-thinking person.  Overall, the Industrial Development Bill is welcome.  Indeed, one wonders why it was not introduced before this.  The signs of erosion and contraction have been evident for some time.</P>
    <P>The second Bill, the Industrial Development (No. 2) Bill, is of great importance. The Minister devoted three pages of his speech to it yesterday.  It is of significant importance in that it broadens the base for the application of grants by the IDA to this services sector.  At the moment 46 per cent of our total work force are engaged in the service industries. One might think that a high figure, but when one compares it with figures for developed countries one finds it is quite low.  For example, in Sweden, Switzerland and the US upwards of 60 per cent of the total work force are engaged in the services sector.  In 1965 the IDA did provide for grants for the services sector and in the last 16 years since the inception of this approach one cannot jump for glee at the success this approach has had.  It does represent something in the region of 6,500 jobs which is not, in terms of the success of the IDA in other fields, a great success.  In 1980 roughly 1,640 jobs were created in the sector and in the current year the target for job approvals in the sector of 1,500 has been set with current grants of £6.25 million.  The Minister in the course of his statement yesterday said that the number of jobs in this sector would double in the next four years.  I do not think he is over-optimistic in that provided that the assistance is given and is seen to be given, because this is an area where in developed economies the job share taken up by the services sector is much larger.  Therefore, it would seem now that we can make up ground in the sector with an increase in our 46 per cent <Col N="2790" /> share of the job-taking at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the total concept of job creation, in other words taking into account not only the provision of jobs but the maintaining of these jobs through the application of this total business concept which he referred to, taking into account things like research, development and marketing.  I have already stated that in regard to research and development there seems to be some form of gap in our industrial endeavour in this country, and it can be said with much more certainty that in relation to marketing there definitely is a lack somewhere along the line.  Indeed&mdash; the Minister of State will bear me out in this &mdash; recently a multinational company operating with subsidiaries in the west decided to withdraw from this country. One of the reasons for the difficulty in which they found themselves was, I would say, that they did not have in this country a marketing sector.  As far as I recall that sector was in Brussels in this case.  There are many more multinationals operating their services in this country with their marketing divisions in London, Brussels, Paris, Rome, Bonn and so on. Therefore, there is a need for emphasis on the development of a marketing sector to a greater degree than has been the case up to now.  I hope that this Bill will provide an incentive for the further development of marketing divisions within companies and so on in this country which will ultimately redound to the benefit of the subsidiaries here.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention &mdash; indeed the Minister also referred to this &mdash; the idea of availing fully of exploiting to the full the new developments based on micro-technology.  There is an idea abroad in some areas that unless we are very careful &mdash; I concur to some extent &mdash; micro-technology and the microchip will cause unemployment in certain quarters and unless we take corrective action we will be the losers.  It is of absolute importance that we develop an awareness of this first of all, and secondly that we develop structures in this country, consultative bodies for example, for all sectors of industry where industrialists, trade unions and the public service would <Col N="2791" /> be involved in investigating the best ways to exploit this new technology from the point of view of its effect on industry and business in general in the public sector. There is a committee in existence investigating the effects of new technology in the public service.</P>
    <P>We must also develop skills that would build on the very sound foundation we now have in the hardware end of the new technology.  Leading from that we come into the softwear area which the Minister referred to yesterday, and I hope that this No. 2 Bill will cater for the softwear area in new technology.  Having identified the areas where development is possible, having built up a framework within which the skills can be developed to avail of this technology, we must then go about selling the skills and this technology.  You can go only so far in selling hardware. There is a limit to the demand for the actual machine or computer or whatever kind of sophisticated object you are selling. There is no limit to the demand for skills, for being able to provide the software packages on film, on tape and God knows on what else in time to come.  The thirst for knowledge is always there.  It is insatiable and, human nature being what it is, it will always be there and on the increase.  In a country like ours without the capacity to develop as large economies might, our future lies in this field to a large extent, in particular if we are to ride out the rough storm of the recession and provide the kind of jobs that young people today are calling out for. That is the one area where there is a limitless demand for a particular kind of product, in some cases not yet gone beyond some person's imagination.</P>
    <P>That brings us back again to the educational base, to prepare people for the learning of these skills, such as science subjects and subjects directly associated with technology.  One must ask if there should not be parallel legislation on education to enable the incentives provided here to be taken up by the educational sector, so that people are put on the right track and are in a position to acquire of the kind of skills which must be made available to young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2792" /> The Minister did not specify what kind of industries might be eligible for the grant, which he says will be in the region of £4,000 to £5,000 per job.  I hope that discrimination will be applied here and that areas where expansion was assured &mdash; in so far as anything can be assured nowadays &mdash; will be selected as being the most eligible.  Priority should be given to ensuring that we get value for money and that the broadening of this incentive base will be used for the benefit of the country and to the best advantage possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party naturally welcome any Bill which will provide money from any source for the basic development of our economy, which is the provision of jobs for those who are coming on to the labour market for the first time and for those who are also available for work because their present jobs have disappeared or because the contraction in the sales of the product which they were manufacturing has put them on short time or has otherwise imperilled their jobs.</P>
      <P>Nobody can overestimate the seriousness of the problem at present, not least in relation to young people.  There are an estimated 45,000 young people looking for work at present.  They form approximately a quarter of the total unemployed. The figure of 45,000 is not my figure; it is the figure given by the Minister for Labour in a recent debate in this House. We will have tens of thousands of school leavers at the end of the summer also looking for jobs.  Even though it is obvious that many of them will get jobs, nobody in his right mind suggests that there will be sufficient new job opportunities, either by the creation of new jobs themselves or by retirements, to provide adequate employment for these young people.</P>

    <P>The irony is that time and time again young people are asked to place their trust in a system which has obviously failed and which will continue to fail to do anything more than take the pot off the boil in relation to unemployment.  If you think the system is working, ask any young person who is not.  They will tell you.  If you are lucky, you will find they <Col N="2793" /> are merely bewildered and baffled.  But they are more likely to become increasingly hostile, not just to the system that condemns them to a marginal life on the dole but indeed to institutions, such as this House, which they see in some sense responsible for their continued unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government's present policy gives us the worst of both worlds.  It has to provide, naturally &mdash; and we commend it when it does so provide, even from foreign borrowing &mdash; money for job creation through the IDA.  At the same time it insists that private enterprise is the engine of growth for our economy and that it is ultimately on the private sector that the vast burden of job creation will fall.  When you look at the Government's own rhetoric and at the small print which follows it, you will find that the Government do not believe what they are saying themselves.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In this context I might mention here my continuing disappointment with the role of the banking system in industrial development, particularly its reluctance to finance new projects without cast iron guarantees.  I wish our bankers would follow the example of bankers in countries such as Japan and the US and play a more prominent part in financing industrial development.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on the Government of a sovereign State that all they can do, faced with an investment policy by the banks, which are conservative to the point of absurdity, is to wring their hands and express the pious aspiration that one of these days the banks will do better and will show a little bit more social responsibility in deciding where they put their money or where they advise their clients to put their money.</P>
    <P>It is the belief of the Labour Party that, left entirely to their own devices, the banks will not do that.  They are conservative businessmen and they are not concerned with providing jobs.  They are concerned with making money.  I do not criticise them for that: it is in the nature of the institutions that they are.  Not long ago a celebrated conservative columnist. <Col N="2794" /> Mr. Hugh Munro, writing in the now defunct <i>Hibernia,</i> pointed out that if industrialists &mdash; I suppose you could include banks in this &mdash; create jobs it is a by-product of their investment policies, not its fundamental purpose.  Anybody who sets up an industry merely to provide jobs is not in the industrial business; he is in the philantrophy business.  Most industrialists are not philantrophists.</P>
    <P>The Government have the worst of both worlds.  They do their best, with necessarily limited resources, on the public side <i>via</i> the public sector employment and the IDA private investment.  But because they choose not to exercise any effective degree of control over the investment policies on the private side, they run the risk of forever throwing good money after bad.  They run the risk also of casting the public sector in the role of something which merely stops the gaps to keep the wind away, something which will come in on a fire brigade basis to pick up the tab for redundancies, to airlift in another factory where one has failed, and to apply economic sticking plaster to the wounds which were inflicted on the country by the uncontrolled and very often heartless activities of the private sector. Sooner or later they are going to have to face up to the fact, or some Government are going to have to face up to the fact, that this kind of <i>laissez faire</i> approach &mdash; part carrot, part stick and not a great deal of either &mdash; is simply not enough to get the country moving again.  This is particularly true in relation to employment and to the whole economic strategy of the IDA.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech earlier this year the Minister announced the extension of IDA activity into the services sector.  I spoke immediately after the Minister and I welcomed the announcement.  In so far as I had any criticism it was that we had taken too long to reach agriculture and its related sector where we should have started.  If anything, our industrial development policy has started at the wrong end of the road.  I hope that eventually we will have an agricultural development authority or some kind of institution &mdash; perhaps the IDA would fulfil <Col N="2795" /> the function &mdash; that will give major priority to jobs based on our greatest single resource and our major renewable resource, namely, agriculture.  This does not have the energy and other implications of many industries which are based either on rapid import-export trade or on high energy consumption.</P>
    <P>I should like to underline what has been said in relation to the need of other sectors of the economy to mesh in to the greatest possible extent with the job-creation programmes of the IDA, notably the educational sector.  At the same time, we must be cautious about this.  People have the most amazing expectations of the educational sector.  Whether a person is on the conservative or the radical side, there is an overwhelming temptation to believe that education can solve all our problems &mdash; not only that, but that it can solve all of them tomorrow.  On the conservative side people tend to believe that if the educational system can be controlled, basically we can maintain the old values that all of us hold so dear.  Incidentally, nobody specifies exactly what those old values are but that is as may be. On the radical side there is the assumption that if you can manage to wrest control of the educational system from the conservatives you can revolutionise society overnight.  That view is equally fallacious. Of course the educational system is important &mdash; in the long-term it is crucial &mdash; but for people to believe that its contribution to anything, including industrial development and employment, can be turned on and off like a tap is to fly in the face of facts.</P>
    <P>There are two facts in particular that we must bear in mind when talking about the role of the educational system and industrial development.  The first is that the lead-in time of any change in the educational system is immense.  Ask any educationalist involved in the technical or technological area and he will reply that he sends questionnaires to industrialists throughout the country asking them to predict the kind of people they will be offering employment to in the next three to five years but he will be lucky to get a reply from them.  Then, in four or five <Col N="2796" /> years' time there will be thunderous knocking on his door from those selfsame industrialists asking for 40 to 50 persons with a special skill.  His reply to the industrialists will be that they did not answer the questionnaire he sent to them four years previously.</P>
    <P>The second fact that must be considered is that we have a different employment market than we had 20 or 30 years ago.  The idea that a person who leaves school or third level education and goes into a job for life is a fast-disappearing one.  More and more we will have to educate the young people not for specific skills, whether academic, technical or technological, but for a world of work where job descriptions will change radically perhaps two or three times or even more during the working life of the young people.  In this context adaptability, the power to change and to take advantage of changes in society and in the work pattern, will be of far greater significance than any specific skills.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the implementation of that part of the legislation that is devoted to providing jobs in the services sector or to encouraging the creation of jobs in that sector.  At the same time, I must warn the Minister that I do not believe it will be seen as an adequate response to the problems of industrial development and job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the two Deputies who have contributed to the debate and for the general support they have given to the two Bills before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole laid stress on the importance of research and development and I am in full agreement with him on this matter.  This is borne out by the new limit of £250,000 in respect of grants as opposed to the existing figure of £50,000. This is designed to step up activity in this area, particularly among Irish-owned firms, a great many of whom have been seriously lacking.  The Deputy asked why this Bill was not introduced earlier.  I considered it would be better to take the two Bills together as they are complementary to one another.  The second Bill has just become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2797" /> Deputy O'Toole said he thought employment in the services sector was 46 per cent.  The provisional figure for 1980 is 50 per cent but it is worth comparing the international figures of the more developed countries.  In the United Kingdom the figure is 57 per cent, in Sweden it is 60 per cent and in the United States it is 65 per cent.  Therefore, it is clear that as this country develops, the percentage of our people working on the services side will increase quite dramatically.  The second Bill before the House recognises that situation.  It gives incentives and, to some extent, it sets targets.  It is a very important Bill.  It is worth reflecting that it is the first attempt ever to break away from the old system of incentives which was very much tied in with capital assets, where incentives were always thought of in terms of a percentage of fixed assets rather than of the actual jobs being created. For that reason the Bill is of fundamental importance.  I suppose it has less human interest than the Bill dealing with NET and perhaps its significance gets overlooked.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole referred to the significance of marketing.  I agree with him that a strategic function such as this should take place in Ireland.  In my opening speech I touched on the fact that it is regrettable that such a high proportion of firms who come here have seen this country only as a base for manufacturing. Only 5 or 10 per cent of the foreign firms have seen Ireland as a base for anything other than manufacturing.  They just stuck to manufacturing.</P>
    <P>Now that we are at last making good progress in terms of infrastructural development, which is so vital to support things like marketing and servicing, and so on, we are in a position to push these aspects of development here.  Those kinds of jobs can be created relatively cheaply as an adjunct of the main investment in manufacturing.  A large manufacturing firm can easily absorb another 100 people in marketing or servicing or some other non-manufacturing activity.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Toole asked for a parallel education Bill to complement the second of these Bills.  Over the past two years in particular the Government have started <Col N="2798" /> to gear our educational system very much to the needs of new technology particularly in electronics.  New courses and conversion courses for existing graduates have been introduced in several of our third level institutions of education.  The Minister for Education, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and I had a very fruitful meeting some months ago with the Higher Education Authority. We explained to them the priorities as the Government saw them in terms of new industries, and new technology and adapting to it.  I am glad to be able to say to the House that the response from the HEA was positive.  If they can put into practice fairly rapidly the sort of objectives on which we agreed with them that will be very beneficial to the country and to young people.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Horgan that you cannot change things overnight in terms of education and, even where you change the education, that does not have a radical effect for some time.  It is a move in the right direction, even if it has to be perhaps a bit slower than any of us would wish.  Some of the third level institutions in particular have responded enthusiastically to the changes in technology as they have seen them develop in recent years. Others unhappily less so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I always have to point to the institution at the back of this House which, as far back as 1969, as Whip I tried to get UCD to vacate because of accommodation problems in those days and in the early seventies I tried to get them out for security reasons.  I was given a solemn promise in the early seventies that they would be gone out of there by 1976.  We are coming towards the middle <Col N="2799" /> of 1981 and they are very strongly entrenched there still.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that our largest university college should think so little of the faculty of engineering that it is the only faculty in that large college which is still reclining in mid-19 century accommodation.  I urge that institution for goodness sake to face up to the realities and needs of engineering and try to expedite the movement of their engineering school into new premises where they can expand it and modernise it, and increase the number of engineers and perhaps broaden the number of courses in the more modern branches of engineering.</P>
      <P>One has to contrast that attitude with the more enlightened attitude, I suggest, taken by Trinity College.  Although under the share-out they were to lose out in engineering, they are very anxious to do all they can.  Over the past couple of years at the request of the Government they have provided temporary accommodation successfully and gone to some trouble to try to make their contribution to meet the national needs in this respect.</P>
      <P>In my opening speech I referred to the type of service industries which will be promoted under this legislation.  Deputy O'Toole may have missed that.  I will refer to them again as broadly being engineering and architectural services, computer services, headquarters operations, commercial testing laboratories, medical care and contract research and development services.  This list will be expanded if and when it appears that high quality jobs of the type we want can be created in other service sub-sectors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan referred to the problem of youth unemployment.  We all recognise that as a very serious problem. I suggest to him and the House that the second Bill before us today was formulated very much with young people in mind, particularly those leaving second and third level education institutions at the moment and over the next number of years.  It recognises the reality of the sort of opportunities they will have in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On education I have been referring mainly to third level institutions, but it is <Col N="2800" /> worth acknowledging with some gratitude the attitude taken by many of the more progressive second level schools. Roughly half of the second level schools in Ireland have a computer as part of their equipment.  I would hope that in the not too distant future every school will be in that position.  The Minister for Education is looking at the possibility of helping schools who might not be able through their own resources to acquire access to a computer.</P>

      <P>That is a temporary hiatus which is in the long-term interests of the college and of education generally, I am sure the Deputy will agree.  Deputy Horgan referred to some criticisms I made of the banking system here yesterday. He suggested that what was needed was the nationalisation of the banks in Ireland.  I referred to Japan and the United States as examples of places where the banking systems play a major part in industrial development.  Of course this role can very easily be played here by our banks, if they chose so to do, as do the United States and Japanese banks, without nationalisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in the Deputy's context that probability means nationalisation, <Col N="2801" /> or has the policy been changed in that respect of late?  Deputy Horgan referred also to the question of our failure in this country to process many of our natural resources.  This is a major, perennial problem and unfortunately is not one that is easily solved.  I want to put before the House an example of one sector, even though it may not be the largest one, in which it has been solved, I would suggest, that is, in relation to timber.  I recall, when I came into this present office nearly four years ago, that the timber industry was in absolute chaos.  The saw milling side of it was inefficient, old, run-down and scattered in too many small units.  The processing side for waste or pulp timber was on the point of collapse. In fact nearly every firm on that side subsequently collapsed.  The position today is quite different.  We have now approximately 30 modern, well-equipped saw mills and the saw log side of the industry has been rationalised.  We are in a position in which very shortly most of our construction timber, traditionally imported, will be of Irish origin.  On the processing side we have now two viable plants which will be able to use up all thinnings and waste timber that will become available in the foreseeable future.  Thus we will be able to get away from the very unhappy situation obtaining in recent times of actually exporting unprocessed waste timber, which was a very regrettable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference though between timber and some other produce, particularly agricultural produce, is that timber is available all the year round, it has not these seasonal cycles.  One of the great difficulties about both beef and milk processing is the cyclical nature of their production here.  For example, if one compares it with the situation in a country like Holland, there are very few peaks and valleys, there is a constant level of production.  The whole of our agricultural system basically is founded on grass and, of course, there will be peaks of production when the grass tends to peak, which has created many problems for us.  I think this is really the kernel of our failure as a country to develop our agricultural processing to the degree to which we <Col N="2802" /> would clearly wish.  That is a problem not easy of solution because one cannot change the whole nature of agricultural production in this country within a short time.  It is something that must be done slowly, and probably will have to be done through some kind of differential pricing whereby those who are prepared to produce in the off-season, as we would know it now, would receive a higher reward for so doing than those who glut the market when it is at its peak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that my thoughts have reached a more concrete stage than the Deputy's in many of these areas.  I think I mentioned these figures before; I may not have given them here. It is worth remembering that the Dutch produce twice as much milk as we do but they have half our processing capacity. That is worth thinking about because our processing capacity is geared to the peak in milk in say, June, our production being like that.  The Dutch production is much smoother.  They can cope with twice as much milk with half the installed capacity. It is somewhat of a drain on our <Col N="2803" /> resources that one must install capacity in co-operatives to meet the June peak. It is under-utilised for nine months and perhaps idle for six.  These are some fairly fundamental problems.  The basic problem in relation to beef is not dissimilar because, if one is producing 80 per cent of one's beef during two or three months of the year, it is very difficult to market that product.  It is easy enough to pitch it into intervention as a commodity.  Of course intervention is a mixed blessing from a marketing man's point of view because it encourages people not to make the effort that ideally they should.  For example, to market beef as a product into a large English food chain like Sainsburys or Marks and Spencer is very difficult when one is producing 80 per cent of one's product in 25 per cent of the year.  The demand for beef in, say, Sainsburys or Marks and Spencer is more or less the same all the time and their suppliers must take account of that fact.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The amount of an employment grant shall be subject to such financial limit as shall be fixed from time to time by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In his speech yesterday the Minister referred to the fact that he envisaged that there would be effectively an averaging clause here so that the employment grant would in its first year be fixed at a limit at an average of £5,000 per job created. Does this refer to an average across the scheme, to an average within the firm, an average within the category of jobs created within the firm, or what does it refer to?  Secondly, is there any understanding in the mind of the IDA or of the Department as to the appropriate salary level above or below which a grant might not be paid?  If somebody wanted to create a service job, perhaps on a part-time basis and decided to pay only £2,500 a year, he could effectively get the full cost of that job for two years out of the £5,000 grant subject to all the certifying conditions being reached.  In relation to jobs not in existence at the end of the second year is there any proposal about possible recoupment of finances advanced under the scheme in the first year for firms which may not maintain their employment into the second year?  I am well aware that firms run into difficulties and that they cannot maintain employment regardless but is the Minister satisfied that the scheme is fairly watertight in relation to possibilities of abuse?</P>

      <P>The average that is proposed for the first year by agreement between the Minister for Finance and myself is £5,000 per job across the whole scheme.  There is no limit in terms of salary but the IDA envisage that the average salary in respect of the kind of job that they are trying to create and assist here would be £10,000 so that in percentages it would be about 50 per cent.  On the question of recoupment I understand that the position is that there is full recoupment of the grant if the job fails at any time within five years.  That is not more onerous on the firm, as the Deputy will appreciate, than would be the case in a capital grant because that seldom, if ever, operates on a sliding scale over a ten-year period.  For every year that the firm survives the liability to repay the grant decreases.  But the situation here is that the whole grant is repayable if the job should fail or be lost within five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not quite clear about the mathematics.  If the Minister gives the IDA a certain sum to provide for these service-related jobs at an average £5,000 per job created, it is possible that the scheme might run out of money before the end of the year because of the averaging effect.  What does the Minister see himself doing if over the first six months of the scheme the average per job created turns out at £6,000 or £7,000? Would that mean effectively that there would be less money in the kitty at the end of the year and that the scheme would dry up?</P>

If the average was higher than £6,000 in a period of six months they would have to reduce the level of assistance in the latter part of the year to perhaps £3,500 which would be less attractive.  They will have to monitor the scheme on a monthly basis to ensure that they stick closely to the £5,000 average.  In terms of the amount of money, the situation will be not that a particular sum will be designated for it, certainly in the first year, because it will <Col N="2806" /> be difficult to judge how much will be taken up, but that the IDA will pay this out of their capital allowance.  I am sure they have good accountancy reasons to justify that.  It is a substantial amount of money, £196 million this year from the Exchequer plus about £20 million from their own resources.</P>

      <P>Criteria are laid down in relation to eligibility for payment of the grant, one of them being that the job would not be developed in the absence of an employment grant.

      <P>Does the Minister know whether the IDA have in mind any pencilled in upper limit?  To get an average of £5,000 per job there will obviously be a number of jobs over or under £5,000. The House might be reassured to know that large amounts of money would not go to the people who are in fastest with the most attractively packaged submissions for very expensive jobs leaving comparatively less for people who will come in under the £5,000 level.  I envisage that there could be a fair amount of administrative costs incurred on the IDA side in the administration of the scheme, which would involve fairly detailed <Col N="2807" /> assessments of the job proposals from individual employers, and the monitoring of the scheme, which would possible be on a monthly basis.  Is the Minister satisfied with the cost-effectiveness in administrative terms?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Sections 139 and 140 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 are hereby amended by the insertion of a new subsection ((2A) and (2) in the case of the said sections 139 and 140 respectively) as follows:</P>
      <P>`() This section shall apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a claimant being a female person as it applies to a claimant being a male person and</P>
      <P>(b)  a male relative as it applies to a female relative</P>
      <P>and similar words shall be construed accordingly.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments are concerned with a matter that I raised during Committee Stage in that they indicate that certain allowances which may be claimed by men in certain circumstances may not be claimed by women in the same circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevant sections are sections 139 and 140 of the Income Tax Act 1967.  The first is concerned with the question of an <Col N="2812" /> allowance in respect of a relative taking charge of an unmarried person's brother or sister.  It reads:</P>
    <P>if the claimant proves&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that he is unmarried and that he has living with him either his mother, being a widow or a person living apart from her husband, or some other female relative, for the purpose of having the charge and care of any brother or sister of his, being a child in respect of whom a deduction is allowed under this Part, and that he maintains the mother or other relative at his own expense; and</P>
    <P>(b)  that neither he nor any other individual is entitled to a deduction in respect of the same person under any of the other provisions of this Part or if any other individual is entitled to any such deduction that the other individual has relinquished his claim thereto,</P>
    <P>he shall be entitled to a deduction of £165.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in this section of anything to indicate that an unmarried woman may claim these allowances in the same circumstances.  This is in marked contrast to the position as incorporated in section 139 of the same Act which provides that the section shall apply to a claimant being a widow as it applies to a claimant being a widower with the substitution of the words &ldquo;her deceased husband&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;his deceased wife&rdquo;. Therefore the possibility of there being any discrimination on the grounds of sex was recognised in the context of section 139 of the 1967 Act and to that extent the first part of my amendment referring to that section is not necessary.  But in so far as section 140 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is concerned there is no indication that the allowances that can be availed of by an unmarried man can be availed of also by an unmarried woman.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the Revenue Commissioners will adopt a reasonable attitude in cases of this kind and will grant <Col N="2813" /> an allowance but the fact remains that they have no power to do so, so that if they are acting in this way they are acting in excess of their power.  Basically, that is what amendment No. 1 is about.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is concerned with section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969, which, in turn, is concerned with an employed person taking care of an incapacitated individual.  The relevant part of this is subsection (1) which reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, an individual who, in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Acts makes a claim in that behalf, makes a return in the prescribed form of his total income and proves&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) (i) that, throughout the year of assessment, he was totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, or</P>
    <P>(ii) that, being a married man, his wife was, throughout the year of assessment, totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, and</P>
    <P>(b) that for the year of assessment he has employed a person for the purpose of having the care of the person (being the individual or his wife) who is so incapacitated,</P>
    <P>shall in computing the amount of his taxable income, be entitled to have a deduction of £165 made from his assessable income.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the section before us to indicate that the allowance may be claimed by a woman.  Therefore, I argue that there is in this section an allowance which is legally available to a man but which is not in precisely the same circumstances available legally to a woman. I should hope that if the Minister in his reply is to plead that while he agrees with what I am trying to do, this can be done or is being done already by the Revenue Commissioners.  If that is to be his argument, the best course of action open to him now is to make formal what up to now has been informal so that there will be no doubt in anyone's mind that women, in the stated circumstances envisaged in the legislation to which I <Col N="2814" /> have referred, can avail of allowances of which men can avail in similar circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed, by means of paragraph (a), to enable a claimant who is a female person and who engages a housekeeper to look after her children to claim the housekeeper allowance under section 139 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in the same manner as a male person.  By means of paragraph (b) the amendment is designed to ensure that the housekeeper may be a male person rather than, as is provided for under existing law, a female relative of the claimant or of the claimant's deceased spouse or, if there is no such relative, some other female person.</P>
      <P>The amendment of section 140 proposes, in paragraph (a), to enable a female person who is unmarried and who has living with her either her mother, who is a widow or living apart from her husband, or some other female relative, for the purpose of caring for a brother or sister of hers, to claim housekeeper allowance.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment is designed to ensure that the housekeeper may be a male person as well as, under existing law, a female person.</P>
      <P>So far as the claimant is concerned, subsection (1) of section 139 allows a claim only by a widower.  Other subsections extend the right to claim relief to a widow, a married man whose wife is not living with him, a married woman, whose husband is not living with her and an unmarried woman.</P>
      <P>Section 139 does not confirm entitlement of an unmarried man to claim housekeeper allowance.  It is understood that some cases have come to notice where unmarried men have responsibility for the care of children and consideration will be given in connection with next year's Finance Bill to extending section 139 so as to make them eligible for the allowance.  That should explain the position adequately to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to section 140, paragraph (a) is unnecessary as the claimant, by virtue of section 11 (b) of the Interpretation Act, 1937, may be either a male or a female person.  Section 11 (b) of the <Col N="2815" /> Interpretation Act, 1937, provides that every word importing the masculine gender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the feminine gender.</P>
    <P>As regards paragraph (b) of the amendment, there may be cases arising under sections 139 and 140 where a male housekeeper is engaged to look after young children. This matter will be examined in the context of next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is based on the assumption that there is a discrimination against the wife in granting a housekeeper allowance under section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969.  Where a person is employed to take care of an incapacitated spouse, the amendment is designed to remove such discrimination.  The position under existing law is that, where a husband and wife are jointly assessed to tax under section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, by virtue of the provisions of section 195 of that Act, the housekeeper allowance under section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969, is accorded, in common with the other personal reliefs, to the husband. If the husband is incapacitated and has no other income the entire allowance will be granted in assessing the wife's income.  If both spouses have income which is jointly assessed and either opts for separate assessment under section 197 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the relief under section 3 will be accorded under paragraph (a) (vi) of subsection (1) of section 198 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to each spouse in the proportions in which they bear the cost of employing the housekeeper.</P>
    <P>Accordingly if the wife, where separate assessment is claimed, bears the full cost of employing the housekeeper to take care of an incapacitated husband, she will be accorded the full allowance under section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969.  There is, therefore, no discrimination against the wife in section 3 where a housekeeper is employed to take care of an incapacitated husband and accordingly the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should <Col N="2816" /> like to make to the Minister is that he has conceded that there is a need for the amendment proposed in so far as beyond all doubt male housekeepers may not be employed and claimed as the basis for an allowance in the relevant section.  The Minister said he would look at this between now and next year.  If he accepts that it is necessary and discriminatory, why does he not accept my amendment? There is no need to think about this matter. The Minister has had longer opportunity to look at my amendment than I have had to look at his in regard to development land.  Therefore, he should be prepared to accept my amendment rather than wait until the matter has been considered between now and next year.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point in regard to the question of a housekeeper allowance that the same result can be achieved if the persons use separate assessments. Therefore, I do not believe it should be necessary for them to use separate assessments. There should be exactly the same facilities available to them to claim allowances as would be available to other people if the situation was reversed as between the roles of the husband and the wife who are free claim the allowances whether or not they are opting for separate assessment.  In that situation there is clearly still an element of discrimination in that certain steps have to be taken in the situation where it is a woman who is making the claim whereas such steps do not have to be taken in the situation not have to be taken in the situation where it is a man who makes the claim.  The Minister has not met the case I made.  He referred, rather quickly, to section 11 (b) of the Interpretation Act, 1937.  I have not had an opportunity of perusing that section.</P>

      <P>These amendments are concerned with extending the allowances which at the moment are available and may be claimed by persons who are blind in respect of their tax to people who suffer from other disabilities.  The disability of deafness is specifically mentioned in the amendment but other disabilities are indicated without being specifically named.  The purpose is to recognise the fact that while there is a justification for giving a special tax allowance to people who are blind and who, therefore, in earning a living or perhaps having a living made available to them from a pension fund or some other means of support do have additional disabilities by virtue of their handicap which deserve to be compensated for by means of a special allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister who introduced the blind persons' allowance in 1971 took a very <Col N="2818" /> enlightened and progressive step.  In pointing out that the allowance as then drafted is inadequate in that it only recognises one handicap, namely blindness, and does not extend the same facility to handicaps such as deafness or other equally debilitating handicaps, I am in no way criticising the original decision to introduce the allowance.  It was an enlightened step.  However, in this the Year of the Disabled it is appropriate that we should consider ten years later going somewhat further in extending this allowance than did the Minister in 1971.  I am, therefore, arguing that the same allowance which has been available to people who are blind should also be available to people with other handicaps.  I sincerely hope that the Minister, in view especially of the year in which we now are, will consider favourably the granting of this allowance.  The objection put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage to the introduction of an allowance for people who are deaf, for instance, was that while blindness was something one could relatively easily determine the handicap of deafness, or any other handicap, is not easily determinable.  That may have been so in 1971 with the standard of medical expertise available at that time when the blind allowance was introduced, but it is not so now.  Medical science has advanced to the stage that it is possible to determine degrees of deafness and whether deafness is such as to represent a degree of handicap which would be justifiable.  Indeed, the conditions which must be met by a person who is blind are laid down in considerable detail in section 11 of the Finance Act, 1971 and it is not beyond the wit of the Minister in this Year of the Disabled to determine equally exact requirements on the basis of modern medical evidence as to the relevant degree of handicap required in respect of other handicaps such as deafness.  In order to give the House an idea of the degree of precision which applies in defining blindness for the purpose of this existing concession I will quote section 11 (1) of the Act of 1971.  It says:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;blind person&rdquo; means a person whose central visual acuity <Col N="2819" /> does not exceed 6/60 in the better eye with correcting lenses, or whose central visual acuity exceeds 6/60 in the better eye or in both eyes but is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision that is such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.</P>
    <P>If it was possible to define blindness with that degree of precision in the Finance Act, 1971, it is surely not impossible in this Year of the Disabled, ten years later, with the considerable advance in medical knowledge now available to us since then, to define deafness and other handicaps with equal precision so as to ensure that there is no abuse of whatever allowances are made available.  I can see that the Minister might have some problems in extending this to all disabilities because some disabilities are ones with which we are not yet familiar to the same degree as we are familiar with the age long, age old, age known handicap of blindness, but I believe that there is a very strong case for making this allowance available to people who are deaf or dumb.  The numbers of people involved, as the Minister will be aware, are not significantly greater than those already suffering from the handicap of blindness.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk in this, the Year of the Disabled, about what should or might be done, and what society, that amorphous body upon whom we are all too ready to deposit all the problems that we are not prepared to tackle ourselves, could do about improving the situation of the disabled.  Now I present to the Minister in this amendment something that he himself can do, something that we ourselves here in this House can do, practically and directly without preaching to anyone else, about assisting people who are handicapped.  I argue that the Minister should in this of all years accept the amendment that I am putting forward which is concerned with extending to people who are deaf or suffering from other disabilities the tax allowances that are already available to people who are blind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking amendments <Col N="2820" /> Nos. 2 and 5 together as proposed by the Deputy, the intention of these amendments is to extend to deaf and other disabled persons the income tax allowance granted to blind persons under the provisions of the 1971 Act as he mentions and increased by me in section 2 of the present Bill.  Apart from any other considerations, the amendment could not be recommended for acceptance because of the absence of any valuable definition of &ldquo;deaf or otherwise disabled&rdquo;.  In this connection it will be noted that &ldquo;blind person&rdquo; is defined in specific medical terms in that Act to which the Deputy referred.  Part of the difficulty of extending the blind allowance to other handicapped persons has been the problem of categorising and defining the handicaps which should qualify for the allowance. One cannot easily define deafness &mdash; the Deputy, I am sure, is aware that there are an enormous number of different categories and in addition a vast number of other disablements of various sorts &mdash; and then provide suitable rules for medical assessment and so on for enabling the allowance to be administered properly. Very serious difficulties would arise.</P>
      <P>Another major argument against the allowance is that the relief would not help those who need it most, that is those with little or no income, and that is a very important point.  It would not help those who need it most&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is continually interrupting.  Obviously he has <Col N="2821" /> not done his homework.  In this budget, which I would describe as being one of the most acceptable budgets that ever went through this House, I was proud and pleased to be able to provide a sum of £2 million towards the disabled in this year.  I am not saying that that is adequate or that it fulfilled all the needs, but it shows what has always been the social concern of this party in Government over the years for those in our society underprivileged because of illness or for any other reason.  Determining the cost of accepting the amendment is hazardous as statistics indicating the number of disabled persons with sufficient income to come within the tax net are not readily available.  However, the report on training and employing the handicapped suggested that there might be as many as 100,000 adult handicapped persons in the country, and then one has to classify how many are in the various categories of income or otherwise.  I think that I should bring to the Deputy's notice the concern and commitment of this Government to provide assistance directly to those most in need.  Already we provide a wide range of assistance to the handicapped through the social code and, continuing in office as we will be, we will continue to improve the availability of such assistance to those people.</P>
      <P>Let me inform the House about some of the aids that are available directly to those most in need.  Walking supports and wheelchairs are given without charge to the disabled in the lower income groups.  If we look at long-term illness, persons suffering from any of the following conditions can obtain without charge the drugs or medicines prescribed for the treatment of that condition.</P>

I was rather amused to hear the Minister using the only argument he had, that &ldquo;deafness&rdquo; is not defined, nor was &ldquo;otherwise incapacitated&rdquo; defined. The Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance should be the last in the public service to claim that this or that had not been defined.  Did the Minister ever look at an income tax return form?  It seems to be wide and all-embracing enough to cover anything that could possibly be thought of to cover gains and incomes of every possible description. Surely it should not be outside the capacity of the Minister for Finance to draft a definition of &ldquo;deaf&rdquo; or &ldquo;some otherwise incapacitated group&rdquo; who would benefit for an income tax allowance this year? The Minister boasted of what he did in the past.  He went on to say on a couple of occasions that they would continue in government.  The Minister will remain in government if the Taoiseach holds a general election and if Fianna Fáil win it, which is extremely unlikely.  I think the Taoiseach and the Government are doing a very bad service to the country by having created the impression, some considerable time ago, that a general election is imminent and would be held&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am not even going to a village on it.  In the Year of the Disabled the Minister should have recognised it under the income tax code by accepting Deputy Bruton's reasonable amendment.  If he thinks deafness should be defined, as of course it should, I suggest he requests his parliamentary draftsman, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, to draft a definition of deafness which would satisfy him and make sure that only people who were incapacitated by deafness to some considerable extent would benefit under this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister for Finance using the argument against this amendment that because it was a tax allowance that was proposed, it would tend to be availed of to a greater extent by those who are better off among the handicapped.  If that is how he looks at the matter, why is he increasing the allowance for the blind because, of course, that allowance will also be availed of only by blind people who have a taxable income?  The more taxable income they have, obviously the more the allowance will be worth to them.  If the Minister feels it is bad that an allowance such as this should be available to a greater extent to people the better off they are, why is he increasing the blind allowance if he will not increase other allowances? That is not an argument because it is so inconsistent with what the Minister is doing in regard to the blind allowance that it does not even deserve to be entertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that the Minister seems to have that the best way to help handicapped people is to give them money to stay at home or to give them money whether they work or not is not the best way of approaching the problem.  The advantage of a tax allowance is that it encourages handicapped people, to take a job and earn a taxable income.  Giving <Col N="2826" /> an allowance of this sort to other handicapped people, as is already available to blind people, would encourage people with those handicaps to take a job, earn an income and not have a situation where handicapped people, in common with other people, very often find that because of the extent of the burden of taxation they are better off to stay at home and not work.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to have a tax allowance for handicapped people on the basis of an allowance already available for blind people.  It is the right thing from a social point of view because it will encourage the handicapped to go out to work.  If handicapped people have allowances available to them at home whether they work or not they are less likely to go out to work.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tilt the balance for handicapped people in favour of working so that they may develop themselves to the maximum extent.  For that reason I contend the Minister should have accepted the amendment.  I concede to him the point that there is not a detailed definition of the handicap of deafness or other handicap in my amendment.  My answer is that the Minister was able to present this House this morning with a nine-page amendment on development land and it should not be beyond his ability to put before the House a definition of deafness for the purpose of the amendment if he wished to accept it.  It would certainly be a more simple drafting matter than the nine-page composition we were presented with this morning for a debate this afternoon.</P>

We extend our hopes and offer our prayers for his recovery so that he may continue his work for peace about which he spoke so movingly at Drogheda 18 months ago, tragically with little effect on the men of violence in our country.</P>

For our people, who have already reached saturation point as far as violence is concerned, this additional act of violence has come as a very considerable shock indeed.  For a man who, when he visited our country, spoke in such unequivocal terms condemning violence, it is sad to think that he is now the victim of violence.

    </table>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with increasing the tax allowance available in respect of a housekeeper and in respect of the maintenance of a dependent relative. Section 142 of the Income Tax Act 1967 covers the situation of a dependent relative.  Basically the position is that if, in a year of assessment, a claimant proves that he maintains at his expense a person who is a relative of his, who is incapacitated, or who is a relative of his wife, who is incapacitated, he may obtain an allowance against his income tax liability of £95, the princely sum of £95.  That allowance was introduced in 1949 by the Inter-Party Government and Minister for Finance, Deputy Paddy McGilligan, at a figure of £60 which was increased to its present level of £95 by another Minister for Finance belonging to the same party as Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Richie Ryan, in 1975-76.  This allowance for a dependent relative has never been increased under the ministry of anybody other than Deputies McGilligan and Richie Ryan.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that families should be encouraged to maintain dependent people who are incapacitated in one way or another in their own homes.  I believe that this allowance assists in that direction. Certainly it is a great encouragement to people to maintain their relations rather than allowing them to become a total charge on the State.  Of course that is something, from a utilitarian point of view, the State might wish to see.  But, from a social point of view, it is better in every way that people who are in a position of incapacity should be maintained to the maximum extent by their families, in the sense that they will realise that, in their incapacity, somebody cares sufficiently about them to take care of them financially and materially.  Whereas if they are put in an institution operated by the State, no matter how ample may be the conditions of life in that institution, there is not the same sense of personal concern as is demonstrated in a situation in which an incapacitated person is cared for by a member of his family. <Col N="2831" /> I believe this allowance should now be increased from the very inadequate figure of £95 to a still inadequate one of £285.  Indeed, when one bears in mind the very substantial allowances &mdash; in excess of £1,000 &mdash; available to a person who may maintain his spouse, and compares that with the allowance available for maintaining a dependent relative, in this case an incapacitated one, at £95 only, and when one compares that with the fact that the costs of maintaining a dependent person who is incapacitated are likely to be considerably greater than the costs of maintaining a spouse who is in full health, the fact that a very substantial tax allowance is available to someone towards the support of his spouse, and such a meagre allowance of £95 is available to a person who maintains a dependent relative, one will see the need for an amendment.</P>
    <P>I think one will recognise also that the allowance should be more generous in a situation in which a voluntary decision is taken by the taxpayer whether or not he or she will maintain the dependent relative. In the case of a spouse one spouse is legally required &mdash; within the terms and spirit of the marriage contract into which they have entered &mdash; to maintain the other spouse if that spouse is not capable, or is not in a position, for one reason or another, to maintain himself or herself. There is some legal responsibility there anyway.  It is a decision which is not a discretionary one as far as the maintenance of the spouse by the taxpaying spouse is concerned.  Because of the existing contract anyway perhaps there should not be the need to provide a tax allowance to encourage an earning spouse to maintain a dependent spouse.</P>
    <P>Where a taxpayer decides to maintain a dependent relative, it is a voluntary decision.  To get people to take that decision I would argue that the allowance &mdash; far from being one-tenth only as generous as that for maintaining a spouse &mdash; should be considerably more generous.  Yet it has stood at £95, having been introduced in 1949 at the figure of £65.  If this allowance <Col N="2832" /> had kept pace with inflation since 1949 it would be somewhere in the region of £500 instead of the £95 which it now is or the figure of £285 which I propose.</P>
    <P>The other allowance I propose to increase is the housekeeper allowance which is basically designed to assist single parent families where the single parent, in order to make an adequate living for the family, must work outside the home. An allowance of £165 is available in this case to the taxpaying single parent for the employment of a housekeeper.  The dependent relative allowance was introduced in 1956 and the housekeeper allowance was introduced in 1949 at £100.  This allowance was increased by Deputy Richie Ryan, as Minister for Finance, to £165 in 1975-1976, the only occasion on which it was increased.  In modern circumstances there are more cases of single-parent families and there is a strong argument for increasing an allowance such as the housekeeper allowance which assists these families in what must be the very difficult task of bringing up and maintaining children without the benefit of both spouses.  This allowance has not kept pace with inflation.  This is a very reasonable amendment to seek an increase in this allowance to £495.</P>
    <P>In respect of both of those allowances I introduced amendments in the last two Finance Bills.  I made all these arguments on those occasions.  I obtained a sympathetic hearing from Deputy Colley, as Minister for Finance, and I had the impression that something would be done.  Something was done in respect of some aspects of the problem but the basic allowances were not increased.  I am repeating my call to increase these allowances. These allowances are concerned with helping families to help themselves rather than encouraging them to seek help from sources external to the family. A tax allowance to that effect would promote social responsibility and cohesion and should commend itself to this House and to Members of all parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Bruton one could bury one's head in the sand and take any item in the tax system and make a weak case for it, not looking <Col N="2833" /> at the overall position.  Deputy Bruton should not try to compare the tax performance of Deputy Richie Ryan as Minister with the performance of this Government because it would be pathetic to do so.  Deputy Bruton would take a long time to convince the people.  Deputy Bruton's case in supporting that Minister in what he did in the area of income taxation is certainly weak.</P>
      <P>This amendment is typical of the Fine Gael Party and the type of people they continually felt most needed their support. The people affected most by the housekeeper allowance are those in the higher income brackets.  How does Deputy Bruton compare comments by some of his colleagues, particularly his party leader immediately after the budget, with the case he is making now?  Deputy Bruton is clearly supporting those in the higher income brackets.</P>
      <P>The social welfare increases in this year's budget are of more benefit to the less well off than would be the increase in the housekeeper allowance.  There is much less need nowadays to increase the housekeeper allowance since, in addition to that allowance, there is available a one-parent tax allowance which was introduced in 1979 by Fianna Fáil, was doubled in 1980 to £500 and was increased in this year's budget to £650. Deputy Bruton chose to ignore that.  The cost of the proposed amendment is estimated at about £1.6 million in 1981 and £2.4 million in a full year.  The dependent relative allowance, if increased as proposed, would cost in the region of £9.7 million in a full year.  That means that we were talking about a cost of £12.1 million. Deputy Bruton has not suggested where that money might be raised and his colleague, Deputy John Kelly, is nightly parading centres in this city saying that public expenditure must be cut.  How does one justify the lip service now being paid by Deputy Bruton when one takes into account the statements being made by Deputy Kelly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money made available for increases in personal tax relief this year has been allocated by sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill so as to benefit to the greatest extent possible the greatest number <Col N="2834" /> of taxpayers, including persons in receipt of dependent relative's allowance. Any increase in this allowance and in the housekeeper allowance would require an additional outlay and it would be selective.  In this year's budget the social welfare allowance for child dependants, widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives, single parents and the rates of children's allowances were increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy's party has a number of kite-fliers who fly different types of kites as the occasion demands, as he is doing here this afternoon.  The second point is that in advocating an increase in the allowances, the Deputy is taking cases in isolation.  In the areas which I have mentioned, most of those people would be in receipt of those allowances.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Those tragedies do not only afflict the rich.  Many on modest means, it could be said, are more likely to become widows than people of great wealth, because people of great wealth can get better medical attention.  A look at some of the hospitals around about would prove this at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument that this amendment benefits the wealthy is absolutely silly and does not stand up.  In regard to the dependent relative allowance, people should be encouraged to look after their ageing or incapacitated relatives at home.  This is in keeping with their Christian traditions and with the Irish way of life.  Even on hard economic considerations, even looking through the glasses of the Minister for Finance, there is a lot to be said for this amendment if it would encourage people to keep at home their dependent relatives rather than send them to the old people's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion to put down a question in the House within the last 12 months to find out what it costs the State to keep an old person in an old persons' public health board home.  I am speaking now from memory and I believe it costs between £50 and £60 a week.  If every one of those people who are kept at home is a substantial saving to the State, I would regard it as good business and good economics. The Minister is giving an allowance of £95 a year.  At the time that was fixed it took two old pence to post a letter.  It now costs over 30 old pence to post a letter.  At the time that this allowance was fixed at £95 you could buy a daily newspaper for two old pence.  It <Col N="2837" /> does not make sense to keep this dependent relative allowance at £95.  It is an insult.  From my experience in dealing with my constituents at my clinic in my home, with or without notice, I find that a lot of the people concerned are people who are just in the income tax bracket and who are being given this paltry allowance in respect of their relatives.</P>
    <P>In regard to the housekeeper allowance, many people on modest incomes have to rely on housekeepers and it goes harder on them to have to pay a housekeeper to look after their children.  They are less likely to have wealthy relatives who can take them and look after them. Again, this allowance was fixed back in the late forties or early fifties at £165.  It is entirely inadequate.  I refute the suggestion that this is an amendment in ease of the rich, that this is an amendment, under either section, that benefits only the rich.  It affects everybody who has been widowed and everybody who has dependent relatives once they are in the income tax net.  Paying income tax is no sign of affluence and no sign of having money to spare.  The Minister is compensating these people with 1950 allowances, under raging Fianna Fáil inflation.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has no basis for saying that either of these allowances, if increased, would benefit the well off to a greater extent than they would benefit anyone else unless he is going to say also that he should not have increased any of the allowances that were increased in the current budget, such as the basic tax free allowance, because all tax-free allowances benefit more the better off since the greater the part of one's total tax on which one is paying at the rate of 60p, the more valuable is an increase in an allowance.  This is because it saves the taxpayer from paying 60 pence in the pound whereas if one is not paying 60p tax on any of his income, the saving is only 35p in the pound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no basis whatever for claiming that the allowances in question here will, by reason of their being increased, benefit the well off any more than any of the other allowances that he has increased substantially will <Col N="2840" /> benefit them.  He has not given any indication as to why the dependent relative allowance has not been increased from £95.  I concede that there is a single-parent allowance.  This applies in many of the cases in which the housekeeper allowance applies also but that in itself is not an excuse for not increasing the housekeeper allowance in line with inflation. That allowance does not apply and neither is there any other allowance which applies to people who are maintaining dependent relatives specific to their condition. It is very wrong for the Minister not to recognise the case being made here for increasing the dependent relative allowance.  When I put that argument to Deputy Colley, when he was Minister for Finance, while he was not in a position at that time, nor subsequently for other reasons, to increase the allowance, at least he indicated some degree of sympathy towards the situation of people who are maintaining dependent relatives and also single-parent families who find it necessary to employ housekeepers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why he introduced the single-parent allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not displaying any sympathy in such cases and is endeavouring to portray the people concerned as being well off and not in need of any special allowance.  That is a distortion of the facts as indicated to the House by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  From his wide experience he knows that in most of these cases the people concerned are in receipt of only modest incomes and that the impact of this allowance would be to help people in relatively poor circumstances. As a result of the allowance I am proposing there are many people who would no longer be paying tax but who are paying tax this year.  I say this because the increases I am proposing would put the allowances of many families &mdash; single-parent families and families maintaining dependent relatives &mdash; above the level of their incomes and, consequently, would remove them from the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that in such circumstances many thousands of families would be removed completely from the tax net. <Col N="2841" /> The Minister may say that that effect will be achieved by an increase in the general allowances, by increasing the personal allowances but the case for increasing the allowances I am talking of rather than for increasing the personal allowances is that they are discriminatory and are directed particularly to cases of genuine hardship.</P>
    <P>Increases in personal allowances benefit people regardless of whether they are in a difficult situation.  In this way everyone benefits regardless of whether he is supporting a family or whether he has a dependent relative.  Consequently, the increase loses its point, but the allowances <Col N="2842" /> I am talking about help people in identifiable, difficult and exceptional family circumstances and as such there is a far stronger reason for increasing them than there is or ever was for increasing the basic tax-free allowances which are indiscriminate.  In these circumstances I argue strongly that the allowances in question should be increased now and I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are the same as those put down by Deputy O'Leary on Committee Stage and they deal with the rates of tax chargeable for 1981-82 and subsequent years.  Following a brief discussion on Committee Stage it will be remembered that the first amendment was withdrawn and the second amendment was not moved.</P>
      <P>The rates of tax were last restructured in the 1980 Finance Act and section 3 of the present Bill proposes to alter those rates by increasing the standard rate 35 per cent band from £4,000 to £4,500 for single and widowed persons and married persons assessed as single persons for tax purposes, and from £8,000 to £9,000 for married couples assessed on the basis of their combined incomes.  The cost of the increase is estimated at £9.7 million in 1981 and £15.4 million in a full year.  The Deputy's amendment proposes to reduce the reduced rate of tax from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and to increase the bands of income chargeable at that rate from £1,000 to £2,500 for single and widowed persons and married persons assessed as single persons, and from £2,000 to £5,000 for married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost that I gave on Committee Stage for this amendment was £100 million in 1981 and £154 million in a full year.  I wish to tell the Deputies that I regret an error in calculation in those figures.  In fact the figures are substantially higher.  The revised estimated cost of the proposed amendment is now £174 million in 1981 and £267.5 million in a full year.  The figures that I gave the Deputy on Committee Stage represented the <Col N="2845" /> cost of extending the rate bands as proposed by him and did not take account of the proposal to reduce the lowest rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.  In other words, I am now telling the House the estimated cost of the amendments as before the House, and the Deputies will appreciate that these are very sizeable costs when you talk about £174 million in 1981 and £267.5 million in a full year.  As I have said in relation to other amendments, no Deputies have suggested how this extra revenue may be raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before line 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, the amount of rent paid by an individual on a principal private residence, which exceeds £10 but not greater than £50 per week, shall be deducted from the total income of that individual for the year 1981-82 and any subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with introducing a tax allowance for rent.  It is in order to bring about analogous conditions for people living in rented accommodation to that which obtains in the case of people who are living in a house on which they are paying interest payments in respect of the purchase price which they have paid.  At present tax allowances are available to people who purchase their houses, but no equivalent allowance is available to people living in rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which was moved by Deputy Michael O'Leary on Committee Stage and which on that occasion I heartily supported, I heartily support again. It will encourage the making available of rented accommodation, which has diminished <Col N="2846" /> very rapidly in supply in the last 30 years.  There is about half as much rented accommodation available to people looking for it now as there was 30 years ago. The main reason for this is because people find it more profitable to buy rather than rent a house.  It is more profitable to buy because the tax code is distorted in favour of purchasers of a house by virtue of the fact that the tax free allowance is available on interest payments associated with the purchase of a house.  There is no tax free allowance available for rented accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, this amendment is a slightly modified version of that put down on Committee Stage by Deputy O'Leary.  The difference between the present amendment before the House and that on Committee Stage is that the Deputy now proposes to place an upper limit of £40 per week on the amount of rent which would be allowed as a deduction.  In other words, it would be £50 minus £10.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the proposed amendment is in the region of £40 million in a full year.  There are a number of practical grounds on which the revised proposals could not be accepted, in addition to the budgetary considerations. Despite the £50 ceiling which the Deputy has now introduced the implementation of the proposal would give an unjustified tax relief at the high rate of tax to those who pay big rents for luxury accommodation. Obviously they would also get the allowance on the £40, as proposed by Deputy O'Leary.  I do not think that is justified.  I do not think people in luxury accommodation should get an allowance even to the extent of £40 on rented accommodation.  That is a practical reason why I could not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to go through the various tax bands.  The Deputies are well aware that this could assist people who rent luxury accommodation.  I made the point on Committee Stage that there is a serious question mark in regard to whether a tax deduction for rent paid would benefit the tenant.  I have some reservations about that.  It might never be passed on to the tenant.  Except in the case of rent <Col N="2847" /> controlled dwellings, it is likely that many landlords would increase their rents by an amount equivalent to the tax relief.  They would be in a position to do this because rented accommodation is in short supply.  The demand, inflated by the £40 million cost of the proposed relief, would result in an upsurge in rents. I am not sure that it would benefit the tenant.  These are practical reasons why I could not accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The administration of such a scheme would be expensive, not only from the point of view of the State but from the point of view of employers and taxpayers. A large number of taxpayers' cases would have to be reviewed every year.  There would be a large number of amended certificates and the scheme would involve a massive amount of documentation.  As I said, I am not sure the benefits would reach the people that I appreciate the Deputy would like to have the benefits accorded to.  For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by my colleague.  I am not quite sure what the Minister alludes to when he talks about people living in luxury accommodation gaining any benefit from that type of relief.  In my constituency every day of the week I have young housing applicants coming to me seeking help.  Some of them are living in a 12 ft. by nine ft. room in Dún Laoghaire and paying £15, £20 or £30 per week for this accommodation.  A one-bedroom flat, with a miniscule kitchen, and a small nine by nine living room costs about £25 per week in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister's allusion.  There are manifest anomalies in relation to mortage interest relief in the same context.  One can have a situation where individuals are obliged to pay rent but will never own their own dwellings.  They feel they are being discriminated against within the tax code.  They feel that strongly, since private rents, private residences and private flats have escalated enormously in the past ten years.  The motion which we are now about to take in Private Members' time has highlighted the fact that, in the absence of any form of rent control in respect of private tenancies, that kind of situation has escalated.  It would not come as any great surprise to the Labour Party if we saw Fianna Fáil adopting a formulation close to this, because the Fianna Fáil Party, presumably in their manifesto permutations, have run out of every possible system of relief that could be devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I will be very brief on this motion because, as the Minister pointed out last night, it is ill-conceived at this particular time because the subject matter is before the Supreme Court.  I would like, however, to say a few words on it, as Deputy Keating saw fit to place it on the Order Paper.  The amendment put down by the Minister answers the case as far as Deputy Keating is concerned.  It asks that Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>takes note that important aspects of the relationship between landlords and tenants of private rented accommodation are at present before the Supreme Court and is satisfied that the Government will take whatever action it deems necessary in the light of the terms of the Court's judgment.</P>
      <P>That speaks for itself as regards the intention of the Government in the field of rented accommodation.  We all know that in Dublin and other cities throughout the country there is a problem in regard to rented accommodation.  This side of the House can take pride in always having encouraged the purchase of private houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is the ambition of all married couples to own their own houses. Many householders who bought their homes 15 or 20 years ago realise the wisdom of those decisions today.  Even though the cost of houses has increased considerably over the years, I believe it is still the ambition of many married couples to buy their own homes.  We must realise that, with the expansion of urban dwellings and the increased number of <Col N="2850" /> people moving into the cities, it is not possible for everyone to purchase their own homes.  A considerable number of people must get rented accommodation, which is acquired under several headings. We know there are many people living in houses for 50 and 60 years that are owned by landlords.  We know there are many people living in flats on furnished flat terms.  There are also furnished apartments which are being developed in many parts of the city.  All those matters will have to be taken into consideration by the Government at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that a fair balance is applied right across the board.  I believe rented accommodation is here to stay.  I know that many people in the suburbs who have their families reared and who occupy large houses are moving into flats, which are being made available.  Special provisions were made in this year's budget to ensure that this type of accommodation is made available.  I hope when the terms are drawn up that the rent will be at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with people living in rented accommodation because I believe they are at a disadvantage in comparison with the people who own their own homes, despite the fact that the repayments may be expensive in the initial stages.  Differential rents are taken into consideration in local authority rented accommodation.  One disadvantage which people living in private rented accommodation have, and which will have to be looked at, is that the rent they pay is not taken into consideration in relation to income tax.  Many of those people are paying substantial rent for one, two or three rooms.  This accommodation can cost them £30 or £40 a week.  We must ensure that a certain proportion of this rent is allowable for income tax purposes.  The people in this rented accommodation will have to be given the same concession as people buying their own houses.  We must also ensure that no person exploits the people in rented accommodation and that when concessions are given to them this will not lead to their landlords demanding more rent.  I am sure the Government will take this into consideration because <Col N="2851" /> the Minister said in his amendment that all such matters will be taken into consideration when the decision is taken in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I believe there are many rented houses in a bad condition because the landlords do not carry out the necessary repairs. Landlords should be encouraged to repair their houses so that this rented accommodation is not allowed to deteriorate further.  There are many families in my constituency who have been living in the same houses for 50 or 60 years.  Some of those people were young married couples when they moved into this rented accommodation and their grandchildren are now occupying those houses.  Special consideration should be given to old age pensioners who are occupying those dwellings.  The Minister should ensure that those people are not put in an intolerable situation if the court decision goes a particular way.  I do not want to move into this field because I realise this matter is <i>sub judice.</i>  I can understand the Ceann Comhairle's position about entering into this area but the Minister will have to take cognisance of the situation if it arises to ensure that people who have lived in certain areas all their lives are protected by legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessor were seriously considering the area of rent restrictions, but because proceedings were initiated in 1978 on this issue it was not possible to develop legislation.  As the Minister stated in his amendment, we will deal with this matter immediately the decision is known.  That is very important. It is the Government's intention to study the problem very closely, because about 300,000 to 400,000 people occupy rented accommodation.  That is a substantial number.  This is a very important factor and we must ensure that a fair balance is struck for both sides &mdash; as regards the landlord to ensure he gets an income which will enable him to keep his property in good condition and as regards the tenants to ensure they are getting fair accommodation at a reasonable rent. These are the facts the Government must face.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2852" /> Many people in rented accommodation feel very insecure because they do not know how long they can remain in their flats.  If a young married couple have a child they may have to leave their flat. This is the type of sensitive issue which will have to be looked into by the Government. These are very relevant facts and I am sure the Minister will be examining them very closely in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong this debate which the Minister clearly established last night is ill-conceived and ill-timed.  It is indicative of Deputy Keating's political immaturity that, at a time when basic aspects of the statute law governing rents and relations between landlords and tenants are under adjudication by the Supreme Court, he should ask the Dáil to demand the establishment of tribunals to deal with these matters.  His snide comment about the courts &ldquo;who are in session now and again&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, working only intermittently &mdash; shows his regard for the courts.  Apart from the impropriety of debating in this House matters which are still <i>sub judice</i>, the motion must raise doubts about the sincerity of the speakers who moved and supported it.</P>
    <P>During the four-and-a-half years the Coalition Government were in office, and when Deputy Tully was Minister for Local Government, not one single item of legislation to deal with the problems affecting landlords and tenants was enacted.  The parties' manifestos issued at the time of the last Dáil and local elections contained no evidence of concern or good intentions about the solution of these problems.  Last night Deputy Keating accused the Government of not doing anything in this area.  These words would be far more appropriate if applied to the Coalition's Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully.  He did hardly anything in this area when he was in office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating and Deputy Tully thundered about the present Government reneging on absolute commitments and undertakings about the establishment of rent tribunals given to the National Flatdwellers Association in Senator Eoin Ryan's letter of 7 June 1977. <Col N="2853" /> This is completely dishonest &mdash; and less excusable because they both had before them at that time a copy of that letter. They were aware that the letter contained only one firm commitment, which did not relate to the establishment of rent tribunals. It merely stated that the Fianna Fáil Party would be in favour of setting up tribunals.</P>
    <P>This Government took office in July 1977.  Since then three important Acts governing the relationship of landlords and tenants have been enacted.  Considerable progress has been made with further proposals for legislation dealing with aspects referred to in Senator Eoin Ryan's letter and including provision for the registration of rented accommodation. However, actions on these necessarily had to be suspended when proceedings were instituted in the High Court in July 1978 challenging the constitutionality of the Rent Restriction Acts.  Once the decision of the Supreme Court is known, work can be resumed on these measures, due regard being had to the terms of that decision.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise from what I have said that the Government intend to proceed along the lines outlined in this amendment.  Because proceedings were instituted in 1978 the Government were inhibited from introducing further legislation. When the decision of the Supreme Court is known, legislation will be introduced and this problem can be considered in detail to ensure that a fair and equitable balance is drawn between these sections of our community.</P>
    <P>Many people opt for rented accommodation, especially people without children. I believe rented accommodation will be favoured in the future because a substantial number of flats are now being built.  In the inner parts of Dublin rented accommodation is at a premium because people want to live near their places of work.  Because of our very bad traffic congestion there is great demand for centre city accommodation.  When the Minister looks at all these proposals I have no doubt he will take all these matters into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider allowing a certain amount of rent to be charged <Col N="2854" /> against income tax because if people were buying their homes instead of renting them some of the interest repayments would be offset against their tax liability. That is a valid point and should be considered by the Minister when he is preparing legislation in the light of the Supreme Court decision, which we hope will not be too long delayed.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about old people in rented homes for the past 30 or 40 years.  I hope they will not find themselves in an intolerable situation when rents would be increased far beyond their ability to pay.  I ask the Minister to consider that particularly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>The motion states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned about many inequities in the present situation offending against the best interest of both tenants and landlords, demands the setting up of independent tribunals to consider questions relating to rent and conditions, to which both landlord and tenant may have recourse.</P>
      <P>It is a simple, clear statement of fact. Everyone agrees there are inequities on the side of both landlord and tenant.  If evidence was needed it is in the letter written by Senator Ryan, Fianna Fáil Director of Elections, in 1977.  In his letter he stated:</P>
      <P>It is our view that legislation should be enacted to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses but at the same time to ensure that landlords will still get a fair return from their investment and that they have protection against bad tenants.</P>
      <P>There is little difference between this motion and that statement by Senator Ryan who went on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully appreciate that the private sector provides a large part of the rented accommodation in the city of Dublin but we would not favour a situation where these people were restricted to such an extent that they were discouraged from investing in this type of project.  We would like to see <Col N="2855" /> a fair balance.  We would like to see the private sector being encouraged to provide good accommodation with certain minimum standards, with a rent that is fair to the tenant and fair to the landlord.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the setting up of an independent tribunal, and Deputy Fitzpatrick has just doubted the wisdom or the use of founding such a tribunal.  I would point out to him that Senator Ryan in that letter advocated setting up a tribunal to which landlords and tenants could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents and deciding disputes between the parties.  This motion does not call for any more or any less, and we may be pardoned if we wonder why in the intervening years that party, who were returned with a clear-cut majority, did not try to put into effect the terms of Senator Ryan's letter.  Instead of the pious platitudes then expressed we have not got any action of the sort.</P>
    <P>We on this side realise fully the deplorable shortage of housing in Dublin because of lack of finance.  Dublin Corporation have schemes on which they are anxious to embark but their efforts have been curtailed or postponed because of limitation of housing finance.  We are told that we get a certain percentage increase each year, but if you judge it against the rate of inflation it means a cut-back in finance and, even with the best will in the world, Dublin Corporation are being prevented from building houses.  They have to utilise the moneys made available to them in priority areas which will yield the best results, and private housing has become the Cinderella of the whole housing programme.  We have been told that about 400,000 people are living in private-rented accommodation, but the amount of public funds directed to this area is negligible despite all the statements of the Government party prior to the last election.  They have either competely ignored those pious promises or they have forgotten them.</P>
    <P>We know the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing from the point of view of rented accommodation and we appreciate <Col N="2856" /> that both landlords and tenants in some cases find themselves in a difficult position: some tenants are exploited by unscrupulous landlords but there is compete lack of support for law-abiding landlords.</P>
    <P>Many years ago when I was canvassing I spoke to a lady who pointed to a house across the road which she had let at £3 or £4 a week and which she could not increase because of rent restriction law. She said she had rented the house to a person and that that person occupied a flat in the house but had sublet two flats at £4 or £5 each.  She told me she had brought this to the notice of the present Taoiseach &mdash; I do not know if he was even a Parliamentary Secretary at the time &mdash; and he told her that there were more votes on the other side of the road than on her side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only stating what was stated by the Taoiseach.  I was glad to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick say that he agreed that tenants should be enabled to have the rent or portion of the rent offset against income tax.  Deputies on both sides of the House would agree with this. Further, we on this side of the House would agree that there should be substantial grants or package deals of £30 million or £35 million available to owners of private rented accommodation to enable them to maintain their properties in a fit condition.  I know many cases <Col N="2857" /> where private landlords are prevented due to the rent restrictions from increasing their rents and can only charge nominal amounts of about 50p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter would also be before the Supreme Court at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The landlords are responsible for outside repairs.  Therefore, because they are not allowed to charge a reasonable amount of rent, they despair and let the property become derelict. This tribunal should be set up to see that fair standards of rent and conditions are fully maintained.  Both the tenant and the landlord should have equal recourse to such tribunals.  It should also be obligatory to register all private accommodation. At the moment most of this private rented accommodation is supposed to be registered but the regulation in relation to it is more conspicuous by the refusal to comply with it than by compliance with it.</P>
      <P>Another thing that should be abolished completely is any discrimination by landlords against tenants on any grounds of class, creed or colour.  Too often we hear of young married couples who have become private tenants and are in the premises a short time, but as soon as the first baby arrives they are ordered to get out by the landlord.  In many cases they are unjustly and illegally evicted.  All these matters are in urgent need of special examination. We could do that by establishing these tribunals and allowing tenants and landlords to have recourse to them.  In that way we could avoid all this exploitation by private landlords who are charging as much as £20 per week for one room in some areas which are not the most select areas and are often in very dingy surroundings.  The landlords, for their part, are only allowed a very small amount for repairs, and if this tribunal were established the landlords could then make a case for necessary repairs and we would thus ensure that private rented accommodation would be of standard to meet the requirements of tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also entirely oppose illegal evictions. In many cases landlords have gone in and, without any approval from the <Col N="2858" /> courts or otherwise, have changed locks on doors so that the tenants have come back to find their belongings left out on the street.  They could go to the Garda and get back in again, but a lot of these people are unaware of their rights and in many cases they are afraid that, if they go back in, life will be made unbearable by the landlord cutting off water or electricity. There are several means which landlords can apply to make life a misery and make sure that the tenant will leave as soon as possible.  We are asking in a fair-minded way for tribunals to be set up as soon as possible.  It is not right to say that we are only now advocating the setting up of tribunals.  Four years ago the people on the opposite side of the House stated in a letter to the National Flatdwellers Association that they were in favour of setting up tribunals.  We are asking them to, even now, implement what they favoured at that time.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need to say very much more.  I am sure any Deputy in the Dublin area who is conversant with the problems facing tenants, and the desperate plight that people seeking reasonable accommodation are in, will tell the Minister that there is a need for some type of tribunal, some court where people can meet and talk.  It is a regular thing for any Dublin Deputy to find people who are chasing around Dublin looking for accommodation.  I know of several instances where people are paying as much as £35 and £40 a week for reasonable accommodation, for just a couple of rooms.  In many cases even a single room will cost £20 to £25.  These people have no other accommodation and are compelled to pay these amounts of money. The Government should automatically agree with this motion and hasten the setting up of tribunals to give a fair hearing both to the landlords and to the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Labour Party are pleased to have an opportunity of supporting this motion. We regard the Government's amendment as being exceptionally restricted and narrow and an effort to get out from under the entirely laudable objectives of <Col N="2859" /> the motion.  There is no doubt whatever that many tenants in private rented accommodation are being exploited. There is no doubt that they have been exploited for many years, particularly through the sixties and seventies, because of the increase in property values.  There is no doubt that we must now be one of the very few countries in Europe that has no system of assessment of fair and equitable rent for private rented accommodation. When the National Coalition were in power I fought long and hard to have a system introduced.  To his credit, my colleague, Deputy Tully, managed to get proposals to the Cabinet table.  They were not accepted but at least he got that far.  There is no difficulty whatever from the point of view of data being available for the Government to develop a fair and equitable system in the interests of both tenants and landlords.</P>
      <P>In my constituency there are several thousand people in private rented accommodation. I could bring the Minister to Clarinda Park East, Clarinda Park West, Clarinda Park North or Clarinda Park South in Dún Laoghaire.

      <P>Will the Chair please bear with me while I explain the situation so that the Chair will not get itself into any kind of procedural tizzy?  I am saying I can bring the Minister to houses in Clarinda Park, Dún Laoghaire, which have no reference whatever to the Supreme Court.  They have no reference to protected tenancies, a matter that is currently the subject of Supreme Court litigation.  I am talking about private rented accommodation.  I can take the Minister to a number of houses where multiple conversions have been carried out with planning permission.  Many of <Col N="2861" /> these houses have three or four floors with two flats on each floor.  The average width of the rooms would be about 12 feet by nine feet.  In such a room there would be two bunk beds, in the corner a breakfast cooker and on the other side of the room there would be a cot for one child.  There would be enough space for a wardrobe &mdash; all in a room 12 feet by nine feet.  My constituents have to pay between £14 and £17 per week for such a room.  There would be six flats in each house at an average rent of £15 per week, making a total of £90 for the landlord. Presumably he would be paying income tax on that money but in many instances there are grave doubts about this.  I hold the view that this is gross and vicious exploitation of the citizens and it is something we must remedy if we call ourselves a caring, Christian and democratic society.</P>
      <P>I could bring any Member of this House to Abbey Road, Monkstown, where about 30 three-storey houses have been converted to flats.  Each house has been converted into three flats and the garage has also been converted.  In this instance I am talking about a flat comprising of one bedroom, a sittingroom and an annex kitchen and the rent chargeable is £35 per week.  I could bring the Minister to the workers in Warner Road, Lambert Road and Pottery Road whose take-home pay is £75 per week out of a gross wage of £100 a week and who pay £35 per week to live in that kind of accommodation. The houses in question are owned by people who are speculating in property.  Very often they are not wealthy people; they move to another house while they get rent of £105 per week from their other property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold the view that we should have some system involving an appeals tribunal which would enable a tenant to go to the tribunal and to explain the kind of accommodation he has and the rent he pays for it.  There should be some way of assessing a fair and reasonable rent.  I do not think it is beyond our capacity to devise such a system.  We can afford the National Prices Commission, the Restrictive Practices Commission, we can afford sanction for motor vehicle insurance and <Col N="2862" /> a national insurance system whereby we pay pay-related social insurance.</P>
    <P>Apparently when it comes to renting a house, the sky is the limit.  Landlords can say as they have said to tenants in my constituency: &ldquo;I have just sold that house.  I told the person I sold it to that I would give him vacant possession.  You are on a week to week tenancy.  The rent is no longer £25 a week.  It is now £45 per week as from next week.  Out you get&rdquo;. The tenants say: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I have nowhere to go&rdquo;.  The landlord then proceeds to evict the tenant through the normal judical process.  The local authority say: &ldquo;We cannot house you because we do not house people for non-payment of rent&rdquo;.  In effect, the landlord can do what he likes.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are protected tenancies where individual landlords need a degree of relief.  Due to protected tenancies some landlords are losing money. There should be a fair and equitable system for landlords and tenants.  The current system is a joke.  It is a disgrace.  At the end of the life time of this Dáil, we have 15 Cabinet Ministers and a clutch of Ministers of State swanning around the country for the past two-and-a-half years doing God only knows what, apart from admiring their profiles in front of a Mercedes and obviously producing no legislation.  This Government have introduced no legislation in this area.  People are being exploited.  People are in dire distress.  Through no fault of their own some individuals have not been able to buy their own private domestic accommodation on the open market.  Therefore, they must have recourse to ordinary rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister a very simple case.  A constituent of mine who became redundant in the UK had council accommodation in Dagenham.  He lost his job in the motor vehicle industry.  It was a very good job but it was strictly a motor vehicle production job in Fords.  He came back to Dún Laoghaire and he could not get a job.  He was 55 years of age and he had pay-related social welfare for himself and his wife of £55 a week.  On arrival in Dún Laoghaire he had no option but to <Col N="2863" /> go into accommodation at a cost of £30 a week.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unusual about the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The same situation applies in Harolds Cross, or Fairview, or Clontarf, or any other part of the north side.  That left him with £25 a week.  He has had no employment for the past 18 months or two years and I have seen him and his wife visibly fading away.  Do we give a damn?  We do not.  I have a house.  The Minister of State has a house.  The vast bulk of Deputies have privately owned accommodation.  There may be a unique one among us who lives in a local authority house but if he does he has probably bought it.  Because we all have our own accommodation the vast bulk of the electorate could not care less about tenants.  The problem does not impinge on their daily lives.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a need to set up a system of independent tribunals to pronounce on questions relating to rent and conditions to which both landlord and tenant may have recourse.  I am glad the Supreme Court judgment is awaited.  It will bring matters to a head in relation to protected private rented accommodation. We will welcome that.  I prefer to deal with the broader general issue.</P>
    <P>The letter from Senator Eoin Ryan the former national director of elections for the Fianna Fáil Party, has been trotted out and has now become part of the folklore of this issue.  That is the letter of 7 June 1977 when all the promises were made about two weeks before the election when the National Flatdwellers Association's votes were attempted to be bought.  I know Senator Eoin Ryan personally and I regard him as an honourable and competent person.  I presume he wrote it at the behest of whatever committee was dishing out the promises.  It was a classic election promise but nothing was done about it as soon as the election was over.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan stated quite bluntly that it was their view that legislation should be enacted to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses but, at the same time, to ensure that landlords got a fair return on their investment and they had <Col N="2864" /> protection against bad tenants.  Those are laudable sentiments.  The letter goes on to say that the Fianna Fáil Party would be in favour of setting up tribunals to which the landlord and the tenant could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents and to decide disputes between the parties.  That was an absolute commitment. What happened?  As soon as the election was over it did not merit the status of toilet paper in the Custom House.  That is a cynical and disgraceful abuse of election attitudes.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, in the course of the election campaign we are now facing, if tenants berate Government Ministers on the doorstep they will get the same quota of bland assurances about what the party stand for.  If Fianna Fáil are returned to office they will do absolutely nothing about it.  While such tenants represent a number of votes they do not as yet represent such a powerful block of votes as to exercise an emphatic influence on the social policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this motion.  I feel very strongly about it.  We often hear of investigative journalism.  It has a happy penchant of being investigative about everything that is not relevant to the social and economic spectrum.  I wish that all the journalists, all the political correspondents, all the media cameras would concentrate on the kind of abnormal social conditions in which young people getting married have to live for perhaps three, four, five or ten years &mdash; in miserable, unsanitary flats, sharing a bathroom, sharing a toilet, sharing a shower, not to mention not having hot water in their own room but sharing those conditions with two or three other families and all the tension, aggravation and annoyance that can cause all the tenants of a particular house.</P>
    <P>Because the vast bulk of politicians are middle-class, as are the vast bulk of media representatives, people who have their own homes, who have never suffered the deprivation of lower incomes which many people have had to suffer in terms of private rented accommodation, I wish that they had to queue up in the <Col N="2865" /> Jervis Street Housing allocation section of Dublin Corporation, or in the Town Hall in Dún Laoghaire, queue up for hours on end in the housing section of Dublin County Council, week after week, month after month, hoping against hope that they might be sufficiently lucky at the end of five or six years of misery of literally having to pay £20, £25 and £30 a week rent to get a local authority dwelling. The politicians of this House should have to undergo that exercise, be almost compulsorily evicted from the comfort of their homes, and see their own children go through it and then they would appreciate the kind of misery and suffering experienced by a very small but nonetheless discriminated against sector of our society.</P>
    <P>If I have spoken in such harsh terms it is because any politician, no matter how long he or she has been in this House, cannot but be moved by the discrimination and exploitation that goes on in relation to private rented accommodation. Any elector in this country cannot but be absolutely cynical about politicians who make promises that they will do this, that and the other about rent tribunals and so on and then swan their way through the lifetime of a Dáil doing absolutely nothing about that kind of operation.  At the end of the lifetime of this Dáil, as far as I am concerned, on this issue we can collectively, Government and Opposition, but more particularly Government, hang our heads in shame because we have done nothing in this area.</P>
    <P>Once again we have a Government saying, &ldquo;We cannot do anything because the Supreme Court is about to pronounce&rdquo;. When it comes to contraception the Supreme Court runs this country. When it comes to family law reform the Supreme Court runs this country.  When it comes to income tax assessment between the State and individual families the Supreme Court runs this country and, when it comes to the landlord and tenant relationship, now the Supreme Court is also expected to run this country.  What have we got a Dáil Éireann for?  Do we have to hand over every socially desirable advance in the community to the Supreme Court?  As far as I am concerned <Col N="2866" /> this is an abject rejection by the Dáil of our responsibility to do something in this area.  We can bring it to the President, we can ask him to sign the Bill.  If he does not want to sign it then he can consult on the matter and, ultimately, the Supreme Court can judge whether or not it is constitutional. But now so brazenly incompetent and incapable of reading a Government memorandum are two-thirds of this Dáil, Government and Opposition, so bereft are we of any spark of simple legislative imagination we cannot sit down and spend a couple of hours together, particularly around the Cabinet table and say there is a serious problem obtaining, let us try to do something about it.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Supreme Court issue, where there are protected tenants who are paying in some instances miniscule rents, in respect of which landlords are demanding some relief and, where in other instances, there are landlords who want to go the whole hog, getting everything for themselves; where, above all, the vast bulk of tenants in this country who are not living in what could be described as reasonable rent conditions, surely it is not beyond the comprehension or capacity of this Dáil to bring about a remedy in the national interest, in the best interests of both landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>By and large every country in Europe has managed in one way or another to come to grips with this issue under far more pressing and difficult conditions. Whether it be Holland, Belgium or France they have reasonable recourse under law to reasonable protection for landlords and tenants.  In this country we are so busy participating at official functions it has almost reached the stage now at which Ministers of State are going about at such a rate that somebody, some day, will produce an Oireachtas envelope, there will be an official opening of that envelope, and there will be a script describing how that official Oireachtas envelope was opened.  There will be photographs taken of Ministers of State standing in front of Mercedes cars officially opening the Oireachtas envelope. It has virtually reached that stage <Col N="2867" /> because, with respect to the Cabinet, that is about the limit of their capability.  Even then they would have to be provided with a bloody big scythe to open that official Oireachtas envelope, making sure they would not cut their heads off in the process so incompetent are some of them.</P>
    <P>This motion has great urgency.  I make one positive commitment on behalf of my party at the next general election, that I will state here now quite categorically &mdash; and I have discussed the matter with Deputy James Tully, a former Minister, who tried his damnedess to convince some of his then Cabinet colleagues on the other side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very appropriate that this motion should be before the House at this time.  It is appropriate because of the merits of the motion and also in the context of an imminent general election.  It recalls to all our minds the fate of those foolish enough to believe in election promises made by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>At this stage it is quite clear that this motion exposes an absolute brazen breach of promise by this Government. It is clear to me at this stage, as a relative newcomer, that the whole area of politics of promise has been thoroughly debased by Fianna Fáil.  It is very important that the people be reminded of that because already we have the promise machine cranking up with no doubt in the very near future, many more such promises falling from the Fianna Fáil election machine like autumn leaves.</P>
      <P>Do this Government party, who are temporarily in office, ever consider the damage they are doing to the whole democratic process by conducting themselves in this fashion?  Are the Government not aware that the whole basis of our democratic system is consensus, the feeling of trust and reliance, and that by carrying on in this fashion this party are digging out the very roots of democracy.  The result of a continuation of this policy will be an electorate totally disillusioned and cynical.  In case members of the Fianna Fáil Party might think I am overharsh in this, I could run through a list of dozens of similar type commitments made at the time of the election.  The one closest to what we are talking about is the famous abolition of ground rents.  Hundreds of thousands of people were taken in by that promise.</P>

      <P>The relevance of this motion is that it totally exposes the falseness of the present Government party in making promises for election purposes without the slightest intention of fulfilling them.  It is essential for me as a member of the Opposition to point out the damage that that kind of approach does to <Col N="2869" /> the democratic system.  I will not go through the endless list of promises made in 1977 which were not fulfilled, but I promise the Government that they might hear more about those in the near future.</P>
      <P>In regard to this motion a clear commitment was made by Fianna Fáil.  They now, when my colleague Deputy Keating brings the matter before the House, hide behind a Supreme Court case that has not been decided.  They conveniently overlook that after 1977 there was no such case and that case is only recently in court.  In any event whether or not the case is before the Supreme Court is not an excuse for inaction by the Government. There is a specific point before the Supreme Court in relation to the Rent Restrictions Act.  The whole broad area of the inequities in the landlord and tenant legislation is wide open for action and it is ridiculous for this Government to continue to cod the country by pretending that they cannot take action because of the Supreme Court case.  They are fooling nobody.  It is clear that this motion has much broader implications than the immediate terms of it.  It shows clearly a specific area where the Government made a specific electoral commitment which they did not fulfil.  The real importance of this motion is twofold. Many thousands of people in that rented accommodation area will have to wait for us to get into Government to deal with their problems and, secondly, it exposes one example of the promises made and not kept by Fianna Fáil in 1977.  Many people will bear that in mind when more false promises are made in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>We have shown that this motion is timely and in all fairness deserved a better response than it received from the Government.  It is an attempt to be constructive about a problem which is increasing in seriousness and which affects between 300,000 and 400,000 people, mainly in urban areas. That the debate has hinged to some extent on the promises of the Government is not to be wondered at because over the next few months or year the many letters and commitments entered <Col N="2870" /> into by the Government, then the Opposition in the run up to the last general election on various issues &mdash; written with no concern for the welfare of the country but with an overriding obsession to gain power at all costs &mdash; will not be forgotten about and are not lost.  Instead, they will come back to haunt this Government and they will be dragged up from the corners of the country and thrown in the face of the Government who have done nothing about them.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister seems to be in a mood to enter a discussion on this matter, will he answer specifically on the letter to which I referred last night? By his interjection I presume the Minister means that he intends to honour the promises, so why is it that in four years of Government you have done nothing at all about the unequivocal and clear commitment in that letter of 7 June 1977 specifically in relation to commitments to enact legislation to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses, your commitment to set up tribunals to which the landlord and tenant could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and why have the Government not commited themselves to the introduction of appropriate legislation in relation to the charter of rights? These were specific, not general promises. These commitments were believed and the extrapolation from those promises and letters which were sent into flatland in this city and in others exacted the response it was designed to exact.  An unfortunately gullible and young electorate believed the promises.  The Government and the Minister have done nothing at all about these promises, and let no one pretend that the reason is a lack of resources.  These three steps in themselves entail no expenditure because they are administrative.  They are about the inculcation of standards of justice, equity and recourse to justice for tenants and <Col N="2871" /> landlords both of whom have in the present circumstances reason for complaint. Instead, the Government introduce the most mealy mouthed, anaemic, inept and disgracefully cowardly amendment that I have seen in the last four years.  To pretend that the Supreme Court's consideration of a matter which is not even in the motion should somehow, to use the Minister's words last night, constrain the discussion, is not just bad politics and injustice but downright deceit.  The motion asks:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, concerned about many inequities in the present situation offending against the best interests of both tenants and landlords, demands the setting up of independent tribunals to consider questions relating to rent and conditions, to which both landlord and tenant may have recourse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How can the Minister's Government now pretend that that is an issue even open to doubt or question, when the Minister gave that commitment in June 1977?  Is the Minister suggesting that, depending on the possible announcement of a decision by the Supreme Court, what he said then might not be implemented?  The truth is that the Minister is evading responsibility in this area, as he and the Government have done in many other areas.  I reiterate that, whatever response the Government could reasonably have made in the circumstances, this was not one of them.  I defy the Minister, or any spokesman on the far side, to show me where, in the motion as tabled, there is reference to any matter presently under consideration by the Supreme Court.  It is not there, because we respect the courts and would not seek to pre-empt their deliberations on this matter.  We were concerned about the serious problems of hundreds of thousands of tenants who, in some cases, live at present in hovels and in respect of whom the Government made clear and unequivocal promises and have done nothing about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Flatdwellers' Association, <Col N="2872" /> the Irish Landlords Law Reform Association, individual landlords and individual tenants, and every public representative in this House, know full well that the present situation obtaining in the private rented sector is fundamentally most unsatisfactory.  It is in need of major review.  We on this side of the House outlined last night the principles on which action in our case will follow, given a change of Government.  I unequivocally assure those who may be concerned about that matter that when we say that we will do something, we mean it.  Perhaps we are fortunate that some of the issues at the very heart of this debate, like the setting up of the tribunals to which I referred incidentally not just tribunals in relation to rent, which need not necessarily be successful, but in relation to rent and fair conditions, to which both sides may have recourse &mdash; are not matters which any Government or Minister for Finance, beleagured and beset as they are to try to find a few bob to get themselves out of the trouble and mess into which they have got themselves in the past number of years, have to worry about.  It is a matter where we honestly sit down with all sides and say &ldquo;There is a problem here.  Let us introduce the mechanics, the formula to deal with that problem&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have also suggested &mdash; although the Minister in his discussions on the Finance Bill this afternoon did not exactly rise to the occasion with enthusiasm &mdash; that the tenants should be entitled to offset at least part of their rent against income tax.  The Minister's concern this evening hinged on the fact that tenants at, we will call it, all levels of the social spectrum would benefit therefrom.  I find that frankly amusing, coming from a Minister who, not two months ago, introduced into this House a budget which gave massive handouts to people about whom, with all respect, it can be said that they do not have to worry certainly where the next meal comes from.  If social justice is to be the grounds of prevarication on that side of the House, I am deeply dubious and deeply suspicious.  The truth is that we have invested and are investing hundreds of thousands of pounds <Col N="2873" /> annually &mdash; millions in certain areas of the housing sector &mdash; in the private housing sector and local authority housing sector and I am pleased that we are doing that.  Investment in housing is an investment in our future and that of all our children to come.  What we have not done is looked at the existing needs of young families, perhaps couples with a child or two who find themselves pinioned, perhaps for ever, in private rented accommodation where they are paying a rent which is exorbitant in respect of the accommodation supplied, who are unable to put together the increasing deposit which is now necessary to get themselves out of that mess, and find that the cost of housing is now soaring beyond bounds which any of us involved in projection three or four years ago would have deemed to be incredible.</P>
    <P>The Cinderella of the housing sector, private rented accommodation, needs to be brought in out of the cold.  This should be done on the basis of the principles which I outlined at some length last night: firstly, the introduction of the offsetting of some part of the rent against income tax on the part of tenants of private rented accommodation: secondly, the giving to landlords of a substantial grant package, not less than £35 million, to ensure that they could genuinely introduce modernisation and improvements to their property, as long as it was kept as part of the housing stock; thirdly, the setting up of the tribunals we referred to, which the Minister's party swore that they would introduce but which have not been introduced &mdash; tribunals to which landlords and tenants could have recourse on any matter of dispute between them; fourthly the introduction of legislation which would outlaw discrimination on the grounds of colour, class, creed, or any other form of discrimination which would be seen to be unjust.</P>
    <P>One of the abiding shames of this country, which is supposed to be Christian, is that a mother and father with a young child will either be evicted from private rented accommodation, or will not be able to get it in the first place.  The biggest fear of many young couples who may be looking for their own home and unable <Col N="2874" /> to buy a house is that the wives would become pregnant.  We have all known of cases where that mother-to-be has had to hide that pregnancy, lie, cheat, and be deceitful about it in order to get a home. That is wrong and if it needs legislation to outlaw that, let us have it; fifthly, there should be registration of all private rented accommodation.  This is at present obligatory in many local authority areas, but is ignored.  Local authorities are afraid of their lives of what would happen if that were to be insisted upon.  It would mean a massive precipitation onto housing lists of couples all over the country who are presently living in conditions which are illegal, unlawful and, in some cases, unfit for human habitation.  What are the Government and the Minister doing about that?  They keep their heads down and duck responsibility and pretend that the matter is being considered in the courts.  That is deceit, also.</P>
    <P>We expect and anticipate in relation to the Rent Restrictions Act, which is the subject of the Supreme Court deliberations, that there will be a clearing up of that, one way or the other.  It will, at least, pave the way, because presumably it will remove the political excuse &mdash; though, who knows, perhaps another excuse, perhaps a commission on landlord and tenant legislation, or a review body, or some other reason for inaction will be invented.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that, prior to the establishment of their inner city unit in 1979, the inner city area was not promoted separately from the rest of Dublin.  This unit was established to promote in an intensive manner the industrial development of the inner city area and a total job approval target of 2,000 was set for 1979 and 1980.  Job approvals in this period amounted to 2,900.</P>

    <P>As part of their programme to promote the inner city, the Authority are currently developing two sites in the north inner city area.  A 4.5 acre site has been acquired by the IDA in the East Wall area.  A total factory space of 150,000 sq. ft. is planned for this site on which four advance factory units totalling 20,000 sq. ft. have already been built.  One of these units is now occupied by an engineering project which will employ 16 persons at full production.  The IDA are in negotiation for further projects for the remaining units.  The IDA have also acquired a <Col N="2771" /> half-acre site in Prussia Street.  It is expected that construction of four units of factory space totalling 20,000 sq. ft. will commence there in early June.  The IDA are at present seeking to identify further suitable sites in the North inner city area for future acquisition.</P>

As it was subsequently established from his employers that he resumed work on 8 December 1980 the balance of disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 6 December has been paid.</P>
      <P>He again claimed disability benefit from 23 January 1981 and was paid at the maximum appropriate rate from 29 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 3 March has issued.  No further certificates were received and it has not been possible to establish the date he was fit to resume work as he was laid off by his employers on 22 January 1981.  If he submits a note from his doctor stating date he was fit to resume work any balance due will issue.</P>
      <P>A further claim from 17 April 1981 has now been received from him and payment of all disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 8 May 1981 has been made.</P>

All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 10 April 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, has been issued.</P>
      <P>He was originally paid disability benefit at the rate appropriate to a single man plus pay-related benefit, the combined total of which equalled his earnings in the relevant tax year.  When he submitted the completed claim form for increases in respect of his wife and four children the basic rate of disability benefit was increased but the rate of pay-related benefit was reduced to comply with the statutory provision that the combined weekly total of disability benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed the weekly wage in the relevant year.</P>
      <P>A list of cheques which issued to him for the duration of his claim has been forwarded to him and if he is of the opinion that certain payments have not been received by him and he notifies my Department accordingly replacement action will be taken immediately.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 to 267, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The areas mentioned include most of the north Dublin city area.  One of the objectives of the current accelerated telephone development programme is to get into a position by the end of 1984, if possible, where all applications for telephone service can be met promptly.  In the case of the north Dublin city area, as in the country generally, this will involve extensive cabling works in all areas which it will take some years to carry out.</P>
      <P>Major cabling schemes planned for the north Dublin city area involve factors such as trenching, laying ducts, pulling in cables, jointing, and distribution. Because of the number of different types of work involved it is not practicable to programme work in such fashion as would enable the information required to be given on an area by area basis.  It is expected, however, that about 90 per cent of the existing waiting applicants in the areas will have been offered service by the end of next year and the balance of 10 per cent will be given service over the following year or so according as the remaining cabling, exchange, and so on, schemes required to meet them are completed.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the site of 14 acres approximately at Finglas Road, Glasnevin, 10½ acres of which the corporation propose to utilise for housing purposes.  I understand from the corporation that while they propose to develop the housing lands for local authority housing mainly, they also intend to make a number of sites available to small builders for private housing purposes.  Open space will also be provided.  A layout on the above lines is being prepared by the National Building Agency on behalf of the corporation.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2787" /> I should add that it is probable that there has been a reduction in the numbers unemployed since the date on which the information was obtained.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that the National Manpower Service, aware of the need to inform Irish employers of the output from these courses in 1980, issued an information booklet for Irish employers on the nature of the courses.  A similar booklet has been issued this year in respect of the 1980-81 courses.</P>
