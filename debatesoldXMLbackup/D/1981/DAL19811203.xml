      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,570,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Tagaim i láthair inniu chun meastacháin fhorlíontacha a chur os comhair na Dála do cheithre cinn de na Vótaí Oideachais, mar atá: Vóta an Aire Oideachais; Vóta an Mheanoideachais; Vóta an Ghairmoideachais, agus Vóta an Árdoideachais.</P>

Ní gá dom a rá gurb é seo an soláthar iomlán is mó, i bhfad, a <Col N="1003" /> cuireadh ar fáil don oideachas ó Chiste an Stáit ariamh.</P>
    <P>The original net estimates for the Votes for the Office of the Minister for Education, Secondary Education, Vocational Education and Higher Education for 1981 were: Vote 30: Office of the Minister for Education, £43,470,000; Vote 32: Secondary Education, £184,451,000; Vote 33: Vocational Education, £104,322,000; Vote 35: Higher Education, £69,697,000.</P>
    <P>The following additional amounts are now required:</P>
    <P>Vote 30: Office of the Minister for Education: a Supplementary Estimate of £4,670,000 making a total provision of £48,140,000 for this Vote.</P>
    <P>Vote 32: Secondary Education: a Supplementary Estimate of £2,953,000 making a total provision of £187,404,000 for this Vote</P>
    <P>Vote 33: Vocational Education: a Supplementary Estimate of £8,846,000 making a total provision of £113,168,000 for this Vote; and</P>
    <P>Vote 35: Higher Education: a Supplementary Estimate of £14,742,000 making a total provision of £84,439,000 for this Vote.</P>
    <P>The total net amount now sought for these Votes is £31,211,000.  The additional money is required for two main reasons, first as a rescue package to meet the shortfall in a number of services arising from an inadequate provision in the original estimates and, second, to provide funds for the improvements which I have introduced since taking up office. Before informing the House of the details of the additional moneys required, I want to draw attention to a number of matters.</P>
    <P>First, I want to emphasise the fact that an additional £31,211,000 is being sought for education through these supplementaries. I do so because when introducing recently a Private Members' motion, my predecessor in office stated that I should resign if I failed to get sufficient money from the Department of Finance.  Such a suggestion ill becomes the person whose failure to get sufficient money in the January <Col N="1004" /> budget to fully meet the cost of the education services this year has made the introduction of so much of this Supplementary Estimate necessary.  Because of that failure, it falls on me to bring these Supplementary Estimates before this House.</P>
    <P>Despite the daunting financial and economic problems bequeathed by the former administration, I am happy to have succeeded in securing the sanction of the Minister for Finance, and the Government, to bring these Supplementary Estimates before the House for its approval.  Facts are facts and the basic fact is that our educational services will benefit this year to the tune of an additional £31,211,000, through the decision of my Government.  Despite the severe financial restraint which has to be exercised in all public expenditure, the Government agreed as one of their first decisions, to make education a special priority for investment.  The present supplementaries are a tangible proof of that commitment.</P>
    <P>As I have just stated there are two main reasons why it was necessary for me to bring these Supplementary Estimates before the House.  The first main reason, of course, is the grossly inadequate provision in the original Estimate prepared by the former administration.  The extent of the additional moneys required for some of the services, for example, the universities and other third level institutions under the aegis of the HEA, in Vote 35 and vocational education in Vote 33 is of such dimension that it is clear that there was serious under-provision.  I am asking the House to approve my proposal to make an additional £8,905,000 available to the universities, and other designated institutions.  This represents an increase in percentage terms of 15.8 per cent &mdash; sufficient proof of the under-financing in the original estimates.  The position is so serious that without this money, the universities would not be able to meet the salary and wages bill before the end of the year.  One can only reflect with wonder at the thinking behind a Government which, at the beginning of 1981, left the universities under-provided by as much as 15.8 per cent for this year. <Col N="1005" /> Indeed the situation which I found upon assuming office was so bad that two of the universities informed me that their bankers had indicated that they would refuse to honour the university's cheques from September, last.</P>
    <P>This intolerable situation obviously could not have been allowed to happen and, consequently, following an urgent meeting which I had with the university heads, the Government agreed to my proposal that these rescue moneys should be designated, subject to the agreement of the Dáil.  I should mention that at a subsequent meeting which I had with the university presidents, and where the frustration of the colleges at the hand-to-mouth situation which they had found themselves placed in became apparent. I proposed that the colleges themselves should prepare a four-year forward plan for their requirements.  This they agreed to do and I understand that the work in this matter is progressing.  It would be my hope that such plans, prepared realistically, will provide the framework whereby the Government and the universities can together chart the vitally necessary course to be followed over those four years and that the confidence which has now been restored through my Government's action in rescuing the colleges from the plight in which they had been placed can be developed upon.</P>
    <P>A similar situation to that in which the universities found themselves also arose in the case of the vocational education committees, necessitating some £3,500,000 of the total of £6,650,000 now required in order to meet the needs of subhead A of Vote 33 &mdash; Grants to Vocational Education Committees. Again upon assuming office we found that serious underprovision for the pressing needs of vocational education had been made in the 1981 Estimates prepared by our predecessors.  A number of the committees were running out of money and, indeed, were having difficulty in arranging sufficient bank overdraft accommodation to enable them to continue their operations.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the case of the City of Dublin Vocational Committee, operating 21 schools as well as the six colleges, <Col N="1006" /> which colleges I am happy to take this opportunity to officially recognise as being, collectively, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the situation became so serious that the committee had to hold a series of special meetings throughout the year to work out how to cope with the crisis created by the shortfall in the initial allocation.  These meetings, the first of which was held in March of this year, were followed by extensive discussions with officials in the Department about the range of problems to be faced.  The reality was that the committee had been given a non-pay allocation which was actually lower than that given in each year from 1978 on, this despite the considerable expansion which had taken place in the second level schools, third level colleges and in the adult education programme.</P>
    <P>Immediately on coming into office I met with the chairman and CEO of that committee so as to ascertain the extent of their difficulties.  It was immediately obvious that a sum in excess of £2,000,000 would be necessary if the City of Dublin VEC were to survive to the end of 1981. Similarly other VECs indicated sizeable shortfalls in their allocations for this financial year.  Consequently, in the case of the vocational committees it became readily apparent that another rescue operation, similar to that mounted for the universities, was virtually necessary in this area also.  It was for this reason that the Government agreed also that additional moneys should be sought for subhead A of Vote 33.</P>
    <P>The third main area of under-financing which my Government inherited in the Department of Education falls under subhead D.3. of Vote 30, which is intended to finance the operation of the school transport scheme.  Not only was this school transport vote grossly under-provided for but, in fact, the figure allocated by the previous Government of £20 million for 1981 was actually £2.4 million less than the amount actually spent in 1980.  How anybody could have countenanced the suggestion that a figure reduced by £2.4 million would have financed the operation of the transport <Col N="1007" /> service for a full 12-month period is difficult to believe.</P>
    <P>How, when we, then in Opposition, questioned the adequacy of the provision could have been given an assurance as to its sufficiency is virtually incredible.</P>
    <P>The factual situation was, of course, that the moneys allocated at the beginning of 1981 would have enabled the school transport service to operate only until the end of October last.  The only reason that there are school buses on the road this morning, is because again my Government had to agree to a bailing-out operation to the tune of £5.05 million so as to keep the buses on the road.  The remaining £180,000 of the total £5,230,000 now sought under subhead D.3. of Vote 30 is for the purchase of a further 15 mini-buses.  In all this the total amount sought represents an increase of 26.1 per cent compared with the original moneys provided.</P>
    <P>So much for the failures and mistakes which were left to us to pick up the tabs for.  I do not want to comment anymore about this unhappy episode in the financial allocation for educational services except to say that I trust it will never happen again.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to the positive improvements which have been introduced since the Government took office and in respect of which portion of this Supplementary Estimate is necessary. The higher education grants which had not been increased since 1979 were substantially increased from £600 to £1,000 at the maximum value.  This unprecedented increase of 66? per cent takes effect from the present academic year. The maximum income limit for eligibility has been increased from £6,100 to £14,000 and for fee and maintenance grants it has been increased from £6,100 to £12,000 in the case of larger families. The income limit for fee and maintenance grants for smaller families has been increased to £8,000.  The previous limit was £4,400.  Fee grants will be payable in the case of smaller families with an income of up to £9,000 per annum.  Persons whose family income derives from a holding of rateable valuation not <Col N="1008" /> exceeding £64 compared with £35 PLV previously for the purpose of the means test are eligible for maximum maintenance and lecture fee benefits while for a lower rate of grant the maximum rateable valuation has been raised from £50 to £96.  Fee grants may be paid in the case of larger families with rateable valuations up to a maximum of £112.  The previous maximum was £50.</P>
    <P>The restriction on the number of third level scholarships awarded by vocational educational committees has been lifted. From the current academic year, there will no longer be a restriction on the number of scholarships to be awarded. The increased cost in the current year of these massively significant increases by any standards is estimated at £2.35 million. However, as payment is made retrospectively to the local authorities, in respect of the grants awarded by them, a sum of £1,084,000 only falls for payment this year in respect of grants to students in training colleges, and scholarships and ESF grants awarded by vocational educational committees.</P>
    <P>The value of the ESF grant is being increased from £600 to £1,000.  The estimated cost of this increase will be £450,000 in 1981 and £1.5 million in 1982. In making this decision I was conscious of the fact that had the ESF grant stood at its present amount, £600, more students would be influenced to opt for the grant or scholarship under the higher education grants and VEC scholarship scheme and therefore in some cases embark on an educational course for which they are academically less apt and which perhaps would lead to a qualification less urgently required by the economy.  My decision likewise prevents a situation which would be seriously prejudicial to the size of enrolments in classes organised under the ESF scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about unemployment among national teachers.  What are the facts?  Provision for the 300 extra posts required in order to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools was cut out of the original estimate by the former Government.  But as we all know only too well by now, my predecessor in office some few days before the <Col N="1009" /> new Government came into office announced that the necessary improvements in the schedule for appointing teachers in national schools would take effect from the school year.  His administration did not have to find the money, nor did they try.</P>
    <P>At my request the Government agreed to the recruitment of approximately 300 additional teachers in the current school year for the purpose of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools. This decision was taken despite the serious state of the country's economy and in particular the alarming deficit in public expenditure on current account.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government agreed to exclude teachers from the embargo on additional recruitment in the public sector. This decision, one more proof of the Government's commitment to education, enables an additional 300 teachers to be recruited in national schools for the purpose of catering for the extra pupils entering national schools.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the reason why a supplementary estimate to fund the payment of salaries to these teachers is not necessary is that the arbitrator's award for substantial increases in the allowances payable to principals, vice-principals and post holders was not submitted in time to enable these payments to be made in the current financial year, as well as other general readjustments within the Vote.</P>
    <P>I am seeking the approval of the Dáil for an additional £300,000 under subhead A.3. of Vote 32 &mdash; Secondary Education &mdash; for the purpose of providing additional moneys for computers and for science and other equipment grants in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This represents an increase of 80 per cent over the provision in the original estimate and is a measure of my commitment to the development of computerisation and the provision of adequate science and other equipment in our post-primary schools.  It is a massive increase by any standards and it will enable me to double the allocation for computers made available by the former administration for the secondary area.  In this regard, I should like to inform the House that as a result of my decision to arrange <Col N="1010" /> on behalf of the post-primary schools for the bulk purchasing of the computers by my Department, I expect that the substantial discounts available will enable me to provide computers for many more schools than anticipated.</P>
    <P>I have further decided to set aside £30,000 in subhead H.1. of Vote 32 &mdash; the running costs of Comprehensive and Community Schools &mdash; and £70,000 in subhead A. of Vote 33 &mdash; Grants to Vocational Education Committees &mdash; for the purchase of computers for comprehensive, community and vocational schools.  The total amount which is being made available this year for this purpose therefore is £200,000.</P>
    <P>The bulk purchase arrangement which I have just referred to has resulted in a most attractive package of micro-computer hardware, software, and back-up material now being offered to 105 post primary schools.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I should like to set out details of what will be supplied under the scheme.  Each school will be supplied with a Basic Apple 2 System, a 16K language card, two disk drives, a 12 inch monitor and a printer. The system will be supported by an adequate supply of software and high quality documentation.  An important aspect is that the micro will have a communications interface card which will provide a facility for communication with other computers.  A pleasing feature of the provision of the micro-computers is that they are assembled in Cork by Irish labour. Moreover, the company supplying the printer has a manufacturing base in Drogheda.  I am convinced of the urgent, indeed overdue, need to have such facilities and trained teachers available in all of our post primary schools.</P>
    <P>The world is experiencing a technological revolution.  We must, for the future of our country, be prepared to adapt and respond to that change.  We must ensure that our young people are to the forefront in the development of what has become known as the information society.  We must consequently be prepared to utilise the tools of that technological revolution to equip them to meet that challenge, not with fear or apprehension but in the <Col N="1011" /> knowledge that this country, already marketed by the IDA in the United States as &ldquo;the Silicon Valley of Europe&rdquo;, can respond to the great opportunities which being to the forefront in this change can provide.</P>
    <P>I regret that the task that was given to me was to commence the public funding of computers at the upper end of the post-primary level.  At this stage we should be considering putting the basic tools of this technological revolution into the upper end of primary school education. It is my hope that within the lifetime of my ministry I shall be in a position to embark on that project.  If we do not respond to computerisation or to the information society we are lost as a nation.</P>
    <P>A sum of £200,000 is sought under subhead A.2. of Vote 32 &mdash; Secondary Education.  The purpose of this requirement is to enable a substantially increased grant to be made to Protestant schools because of the special nature of their problems in providing education for Protestant pupils.  In a full financial year the cost will be £500,000.  I am satisfied that an injection of funds to this extent should solve most of the financial problems of the Protestant schools.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H.2. of Vote 33 &mdash; Vocational Education &mdash; I am seeking the approval of the House for the provision of an additional £2,350,000 capital moneys for regional technical colleges. £2.0 million of this sum is sought for the purchase of a site for a new RTC in the Greater Dublin area.  The total budget for capital works this year is £81.778 million &mdash; an increase of £2.478 million on the original estimate.  This is an all-time record for capital expenditure in education.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C. of Vote 32 &mdash; Secondary Education &mdash; and under subhead E. of Vote 33 &mdash; Vocational Education, I am seeking an additional £849,000.  The bulk of this money is to meet the increased fees paid to examiners and superintendents of the public examinations arising from a recent arbitration award which the Government, despite <Col N="1012" /> the extremely difficult position of the public finances, agreed to honour.</P>
    <P>I have decided that a national development plan for adult and continuing education should be drawn up.  The purpose of the plan will be to chart the course of adult education over the next few years.  The plan will formulate national adult education policies and identify adult education priorities.  With a view to the production of the development plan, I have set up a commission which I expect will advise on the proper structures and mechanisms for the immediate implementation and efficient administration of the plan, which will represent a landmark in the development of adult education in this country.</P>
    <P>The following details set out the situation in relation to the additional amounts required for the purpose of the individual Votes.</P>
    <P>Vote 30: Office of the Minister for Education: An additional sum of £750,000 is required for subhead A1 to meet the cost this year of various awards granted under conciliation and arbitration. Pay awards also account for the increase of £375,000 in the provision for grants towards clerical assistance for national and secondary schools under subhead D.8.  An extra £40,000 is required to meet an increase in the amount provided to voluntary organisations for grants towards the employment of development officers under subhead D.10.</P>
    <P>Under subhead A.2. an extra £282,000 is being sought for travelling and incidental expenses.  Of this, £150,000 is required to meet improved rates of travelling and subsistence and an increase in the level of travelling following on the appointment of 17 additional inspectors.  The £124,000 extra required for the miscellaneous expenses of the Department under subhead A.2. 3 (II) is chiefly due to increased costs.  £8,000 extra is sought for the Department's staff training and development programmes.</P>
    <P>An extra £34,500 is required under subhead A.3. (1) to meet increases in the cost of the Department's computer facilities. This is offset by a saving of £10,500 in the other two sub-divisions of the subhead <Col N="1013" /> making a net additional requirement of £24,000 for subhead A.3.</P>
    <P>£42,000 extra is needed under subhead B1 &mdash; International Activities &mdash; mainly to meet increased costs due to variations in international rates of exchange.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the grants and scholarships schemes account for increases of £75,000 under subhead C.2. and £34,000 under subhead D.6.</P>
    <P>I propose to make an additional £50,000 available under subhead D.4. for technological aids.  This extra allocation will enable my Department to reconsider a number of applications for grants which could not be dealt with earlier in the year because the amount provided in the estimate was entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>£5,000 each is required for development schemes for the National Library and the National Museum under subhead E.4. and F.4.  These are mostly additional pay costs.</P>
    <P>A further £15,000 is required for subhead F.1. the grant-in-aid fund for the purchase of specimens for the National Museum to enable the museum to make an additional purchase which would otherwise almost certainly leave the country.</P>
    <P>The extra £15,000 for subhead F.2. will enable the museum to replace obsolete equipment and to provide some additional new equipment.  £10,000 will go towards the restoration of furniture in the Art and Industrial Division and the Folklife Division of the museum.  This is made possible by a grant from the Charles E. Merrill Trust, Ithaca, New York, which is included in the increased appropriations-in-aid in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>An additional £77,400 is required to enable the Royal Irish Academy of Music to meet additional pay costs.</P>
    <P>An additional £20,000 is being made available for subhead G.3. &mdash; the Grant-In-Aid Fund for Youth and Sports Organisations.</P>
    <P>£38,000 extra is required under subhead G.4. for Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann to enable them to meet increases in pay of £11,000 and other costs of £27,000.</P>
    <P>The total net additional sum required <Col N="1014" /> for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education is £4,570,000.</P>
    <P>Vote 32: Secondary Education: Provision is included in the Supplementary Estimate for the Vote for Secondary Education under subhead A.3. for an extra £200,000 which, as I mentioned earlier, I have made available this year to Protestant schools in the free post primary education scheme.  The total extra provision in the present school year is £500,000.</P>
    <P>The extra £300,000 for subhead A3 the subhead for science and other equipment grants will enable my Department to deal with the large back-log of applications for grants that has built up as a result of inadequate funding of this scheme last year and this year.  I have already referred to the £100,000 of the total amount available in the subhead which I have allocated for grants towards the provision of computers in secondary schools, quite apart from the extra moneys for these facilities in community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £728,000 is being provided under subhead C., mainly to meet the increases in fees and travelling expenses to examiners and superintendents at the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>The redistribution of capital has enabled me to provide an additional £2,225,000 for comprehensive and community schools.  The additional provision is required to meet expenditures under the ongoing programme related to the provision of community schools/ community colleges at places such as Ayrfield, Rathcoole, Willington, Ballyvolane, Killininny, Palmerston, Ballywaltrim, Rosmini, Carrigaline, and extension at Carndonagh as well as the provision of physical education halls at: Bishopstown, Birr, The Donahies, Old Bawn, Springfield and Cabinteely.</P>
    <P>The total additional amount required for the vote for secondary education is £2,953,000.</P>
    <P>Vote 33: Vocational Education: This Supplementary Estimate makes provision under subhead A for additional grants to vocational education committees to enable them to meet increased <Col N="1015" /> costs of salaries, wages and employers' social welfare contributions amounting to £2,200,000 and increases in running costs of £4,450,000.  The additional amount required for running costs includes sums amounting to £950,000 for improvements in scholarships provided by vocational education committees and ESF grants tenable at third level institutions of education in line with the improvements in the higher education grants scheme to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included under subhead H.1. for an extra £1,650,000 to meet similar costs for regional technical colleges &mdash; £1,300,000 for salaries et cetera and £350,000 for other expenses.</P>
    <P>An additional £75,000 is required under subhead B. to meet extra pay costs amounting to £50,000 at colleges of home economics and improved rates of maintenance grants to students costing £25,000.</P>
    <P>The extra £121,000 under subhead E is mainly required for the purpose of meeting the increases in fees to examiners and superintendents at the group certificate, technical schools and block release examinations which were recommended by the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>An additional £2,350,000 is being provided under subhead H.2.  This will enable the site for the new regional technical college at Carriglea Park to be purchased, a major rationalisation programme at Carlow RTC to be completed and a fabrication workshop at Waterford RTC and an engineering workshop at Sligo RTC to be provided.</P>
    <P>The total additional amount required for the Vote for vocational education is £10,846,000.  This amount is offset by additional receipts amounting to £2,000,000 from the European Social Fund leaving the net additional sum required at £8,846,000.</P>
    <P>Vote 35: Higher Education: The provision of £10,000 for subhead A.1. is to meet additional pay costs.</P>
    <P>The extra amount of £8,905,000 for subhead A.2. is required to meet salary and other inescapable non-pay running costs in National University; University College, Dublin; University College, <Col N="1016" /> Cork; University College, Galway; Maynooth College; Trinity College; Bord an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha, National Council for Educational Awards, National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick, National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin, Royal Irish Academy and Thomond College of Education &mdash; a litany of disaster, a litany of underprovision right through all of the third level institutions for which sufficient provision was not made in the original Estimate.  These costs must now be met and it falls to my Government to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £6,168,000 is required for capital purposes under subhead A3.  This extra money is required to meet the cost of on-going building projects in the universities, the National Institutes of Higher Education, Limerick and Dublin, the National College of Art and Design and Thomond College of Education.</P>
    <P>An extra £7,000 is needed under subhead A5 for the Central Applications Office to meet additional costs incurred in reprocessing application forms following on the improvements to the grants for higher education.  The sum of £114,000 being provided for the Dublin Dental Hospital under subhead B is for additional salary costs.</P>
    <P>An extra £38,000 is required for the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies &mdash; £23,000 for pay and £15,000 for rent increases which had not been included in the original provision for subhead E.  The total net additional sum required for the Vote for Higher Education is £14,742,000.</P>
    <P>From the foregoing I hope it will be clear that these Supplementary Estimates seek to provide in two basic areas the substantial shortfall of the original Estimate requiring in the main some £26.497 million in rescue moneys, together with £4.714 millions necessary to implement the improvements introduced by the new Government.</P>
    <P>There is also a supplementary provision amounting to £48,000 required for Vote 36, the National Gallery.  The following additional amounts are required: Subhead A., Salaries: An additional <Col N="1017" /> £41,000 is required to meet the cost of Labour Court awards to attendants and professional staff to maintain parity with similar officers in the Museum and library.  An extra £7,000 is required for subhead B to meet a shortfall in the original provision.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Labour will give priority to primary education stressing systematic reduction of average class numbers.  A scheme to provide free school books at primary level will be introduced.&rdquo;  Fine Gael: &ldquo;The reduction of class sizes in primary schools will be treated as a top priority.&rdquo;  Joint programme: &ldquo;The whole structure of education will be reformed. In this reform priority will be given to the improvement of primary education through the systematic reduction of average class numbers, provision of free school books and so forth.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Minister for Education has the audacity to come before the House, in the light of what I have said about the priorities in education, as outlined by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party and in the Joint Fine Gael-Labour document emanating from the Gaiety Theatre, without any comment on Vote 31. No official leaflet has been provided for Members of the House on Vote 31.  Nevertheless, the Minister mentioned it, which is very strange behaviour indeed for a Minister with responsibility to the House and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Priorities were mentioned by Labour and Fine Gael and by the joint statement to rest in the primary area, but we have no leaflet on Vote 31, which is Primary Education, despite the fact that for some time all thinking people, including a NESC report, have stated that the compulsory education period is the period which should command priority.  I find this particularly strange, seeing that we had a very close examination made of the education budget in May-June, 1981.  As the Department of Education always do, we were making preparations for Supplementary Estimates, which come up every year.  The naivety of the Minister for <Col N="1018" /> Education to come in here and pretend to the House that Supplementary Estimates are a new thing, that he is doing something wonderful for education, is very hard to listen to.  Perhaps when he has a little more experience he will not be surprised at himself for bringing in Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <P>Vote 31 in May-June indicated to me that there would be a demand for £2.5 million for salaries at the end of this year.  Where has that money gone?  Where will the Minister get that money?  The total Vote 31, as assessed by us in May-June was that an extra sum of £3,216,000 would be required.  The Minister has a serious responsibility to the House to let us know what has happened to that.  Why has he not got Vote 31 on his agenda today despite the fact that he referred to it in the course of his speech?  It is a serious dereliction of duty in an area where the Minister's activities are already suspect, as the House and the country know.  This is simply an insult to an area in education which has been regarded as a priority area by all educationalists, all social thinkers and, indeed, by all the political parties &mdash; if we could believe what some of them say, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, I put it to the House that the Department of Education have been noted for accurate budgeting during the years.  With all the beating of drums the Minister for Education has done here today, with all the pom-pom we heard this morning, if the House does a simple calculation it will see that the Minister for Education is bringing in Supplementary Estimates which do not amount to 5 per cent of the education budget.  We are being asked to laud the Minister for 5 per cent and we are being asked to condemn the previous Administration and me for being 5 per cent out.  If the Minister for Education had been listening to his colleagues in the House in the very recent past, he would have heard two of them &mdash; one a Minister and one a Minister of <Col N="1019" /> State &mdash; indicating their praise for the budgeting of the Department of Education and the accuracy of it.  The Minister who, like the squid, likes to spread the black ink around him does not choose to listen to his own colleagues or to examine the figures in the Book of Estimates and those before the House and make a comparison. I will yield to the Minister now if he will tell me what happened to that £2.5 million for salaries and the total of £3.216 million assessed as needed for the primary sector on 31 May of this year.  I shall quote from an official document of the Minister for Finance which relates to the now notorious decision about the admission of children to primary schools:</P>
    <P>Raising the age of entry to primary schools to the compulsory education age of six would save an estimated £19 million a year on teacher salaries alone when fully implemented.  Further savings would arise on capitation grants, £1 million approximately, on school transport, on capital building, on teacher training and superannuation. A tentative initial saving of £1 million on teacher salaries in 1981 is suggested as a first step.</P>
    <P>The House will remember what happened when the Minister for Education bought that one shortly after he took office.  The document continues as follows:</P>
    <P>The minimum school entry age was set at six under the School Attendance Act, 1926.  Traditionally, schools have accepted children at the age of four under the non-statutory rules and regulations for national schools.  There is a wide variation between countries on the age at which children start school and some educational experts argue that children under the age of at least six do not benefit from school-going. What can certainly be said is that there is little evidence to suggest that it is necessary that four-and five-year olds should be taught entirely by university graduates trained at State expense.</P>
    <P>That gives the House an idea of the kind of package the Minister for Education <Col N="1020" /> bought and why he did not have Vote 31 on the agenda today.</P>

      <P>The officials in the Department of Finance have an obligation <Col N="1022" /> to the country.  Their position is to advance the financial interest but the obligation of the Minister for Education is to defend education.  The Minister should not buy any stories like that from officials who have no expertise in education. They may be prepared to say children do not benefit from education before the age of five or six years but, as this House was shown, it is generally agreed that the years from four to six are very important years in the educational development of a child.  For that reason there was a strict obligation on the Minister for Education to reject a suggestion that children should not be admitted at the earlier age to primary schools.  He should have rebutted any attempt to foist false educational arguments on this House or on the people.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried his cheap little smart aleck business here today.  He did not bring Vote 31 before the House.  We do not know where the money is to come from which has to be provided for the payment of teachers' salaries and other payments in 1981.  This is very serious.  It is the business of the Minister to tell the House.  It is the right and privilege of Members to know where this money is coming from, how it will be spent and how much it is.  This we have not been told.  The Minister should now stand up and tell us with regard to Vote 31 where the extra money is coming from for the payment of teachers' salaries.  I shall yield to the Minister now if he does so.</P>

No such Vote was brought before the House.  What I am asking the Minister &mdash; I have offered to yield to him &mdash; is: where is the money? Why has he not brought Vote 31 before the House?

This was the only reference I made to Vote 31 and it is a spurious device for people to spend 25 minutes talking on it. I should explain that the reason why a Supplementary Estimate is not necessary to fund payment of salaries to these teachers is because the arbitrators' award <Col N="1025" /> for a substantial increase in the allowances payable to principals, vice-principals and post-holders was not submitted in time to enable these payments to be made in the current financial year as well as other readjustments in the Vote.

      <P>The Deputy is not able to do his sums, apart from anything else.  He is now exposing the fact that he was not able to add up the money that was in the subhead on 31 May.  For God's sake give the House a break and speak about what is before us.</P>

      <P>A figure was made out by experienced officers in the Department of Education on 31 May as to what was required in Vote 31 and I am asking why <Col N="1026" /> there is no Supplementary Estimate before the House to deal with that.  If this money is necessary, as assessed by officers of the Department on 31 May, where is the Minister getting the money?  Is something being hidden from the House? Why did the Minister not bring in a Supplementary Estimate in the normal way? These are vital questions as far as the House and country are concerned.  There is financial accountability and I want to know what has happened to Vote 31.</P>
      <P>What I suspect is that the Minister was afraid to come into the House and discuss primary education seeing what has happened to it since he became Minister.  He has in fact &mdash; I do not want to be interrupted by officials &mdash; already indicated that he is not giving any priority to primary education despite the Fine Gael statement and the Labour statement that primary education was to be given priority. He is not giving it such priority. Despite the fact that the NESC and other bodies concerned with education have stated that the primary and post-primary area up to leaving age should be given such priority, he has not done so.  He has insulted the whole sector of primary education and he has insulted this House because he has concealed from it vital information of expenditure on Vote 31.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle with his <i>toujours la politesse</i> approach is asking me if I said the Minister deliberately misled the House.  I withdraw any such implication, but I am still asking the Minister why he has not told the House where the money is to be got that was seen by experienced financial officers in his Department on 31 May was needed to pay teachers' salaries and other expenses and that amounted to £3.216 million.  That is no small sum and the House is entitled to the information from the Minister.  I said on several occasions that I would yield to the Minister in order to let him give this information; otherwise the suspicion must be there that the Minister deliberately avoided bringing in a Supplementary Estimate on Vote 31 and then took the opportunity in a very peculiar way of referring to Vote 31 in the body of his speech.  I cannot understand how anybody could do that kind of thing unless he was trying in some way to escape the eye of the House.  I put it that way rather than the way that has offended the Minister when I said he misled the House.  It seems to me to be a device to get in a reference to Vote 31 without taking a Supplementary Estimate on Vote 31 before the House.  There is a serious responsibility on the Minister <Col N="1028" /> here and now to tell the House how his money is being provided.  To my knowledge there is no other way that it can be got than in something that has been voted by this House.  If the Minister now wants to tell us what has happened in regard to the £3.216 million I, as I have offered on several occasions already, will yield to the Minister to enable him to do so.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether the capital budget is involved in any way?  I am puzzled as to how provision is to be made, a provision that was seen to be necessary as long ago as 31 May.  I am entitled as spokesman for Education for my party to be puzzled and to get information from the Minister for the sake of the House and the country. As the House knows, we had a very substantial capital programme of £79.4 million and before I left office we succeeded in making a deal on Carriglea Park.  Is there any connection between this Vote and the capital Vote?  I am totally puzzled as to what the position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your views on the matter, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I am glad that you see it that I am entitled to comment.  Seeing that the comment was made already, I presume that both you and the House would agree that this House and the country are entitled to certain information and that I would be failing in my duty if I did not strive to elicit that information from the Minister.  I have not succeeded in doing so yet, but perhaps we can live in hope.</P>
      <P>I see by Vote 30 that the first saving is under subhead C.1. where £178,000 is saved on higher education grants.  I know the system of funding higher education grants is peculiar in the sense that moneys are paid to the local authorities out of the Education Vote somewhat later, but it is very strange that there should be a saving of £178,000 on higher education grants, in view of the much vaunted increase in grants which the Minister has been talking about today.  I complimented the Minister on raising higher education grants when he took office.  I also indicated that I looked forward to him doubling the higher education grants as I did during my period as Minister for Education. He has not done this but we look forward to it.</P>
      <P>I regret to see a saving in the Irish language field.  There is a saving of £100,000 on publications in Irish and grants to colleges providing courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> There is another very puzzling substantial saving under subhead D. 11. because, to my amazement, the Minister proposes to save £2,099,990 there.  That vote carries the title &ldquo;grants for the provision of recreational facilities&rdquo;.  How can the Minister save over £2 million under subhead D.11. unless he has scrapped all the plans and programmes for the provision of recreational facilities.  In my own constituency, there is a recreational centre being erected and funded at present.  There was provision made in the budget for funding such centres but I thought, in a 20 page script, the Minister might have shown courtesy to the House with regard to this saving of £2,099,990, after all we had been hearing about under-provision for educational and recreational facilities. Here, as round as a hoop and plain as a pikestaff there is a saving of £2,099,990. How can this happen?  Why did it happen? The Minister said he is underfinanced and that there were gross miscalculations, although anyone who can do a simple sum will see that the miscalculation is under 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said how bad we were at our calculations and boasted about what he is saving.  The financial officers in the Department of Education are noted for their accuracy in estimation.  In this huge sum for education they were less than 5 per cent out in their calculations.  How can we afford to save £2,099,990?  There is no explanation, I was in touch with an architect of one of these centres this morning and money has been disbursed. I do not know from what subhead that money has come.  I await enlightenment from the Minister, either by way of explanation in the House or a statement elsewhere. The House will agree that over £2 million is a lot of money to be saving seeing that the previous Government and this House decided that the money would be available for the provision of recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Under Vote 32, building grants for secondary schools, there is a saving of £500,000.  I cannot understand that.  I have written to the Minister about one little school in a small town in North Longford that was refused sanction for a few extra metres of space.  The Minister <Col N="1031" /> had £500,000 available which is not much money in the context of a huge budget for education, but it would mean an awful lot to Granard, Co. Longford.  It is not in my constituency, I have no political interest in it, but I hope the Minister might soften his heart and provide grants for schools like that out of the money he is bent on saving.</P>
    <P>I complimented the Minister on raising the higher education grants but I cannot understand why, if conditions were made more suitable, there is such a large saving. It may be because of the peculiar way they are funded.  I told him I more than doubled the eligibility limits and grants and I wish him every success in dealing with his Government to achieve the same results while he is Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks at documentation in his office to see what the fee increases were when I was increasing grants for third level educaion, he will see that they were much lower than the fee increases which were permitted this year.  For part of that time there were single figure increases in fees and he will also know from his officials that the discussions which were going on between the Government, higher education authority and universities earlier this year was in the context of a 20 per cent increase in fees, not 30 per cent, to the students of those colleges.  These are very important considerations when assessing the value of any extra money voted to the higher institutions, because there is an obligation on us to look at it from the point of view of the students concerned and the problems with which they have to cope.</P>
    <P>While I was in office each year a Supplementary Estimate was necessary for the provision of school transport. Roughly £2 million per month was provided for this service and any shortage was made up in the normal way by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  The Supplementary Estimate is a well-known animal in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But some Ministers, the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Kelly, and Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, were honest enough to admit that the Education Estimates were accurate and that the Department of Education and myself should be recommended.  The Minister for Education is in one of his moods and he is not going to admit that.  As I said, the Supplementary Estimate is an animal which has been around this House for years.</P>

      <P>Less than 5 per cent is the total this Minister has to provide by way of Supplementary Estimate and he is making a big song and dance about it.  Go bhfóire Dia orainn.  A sum of £2 million per month was provided for school transport and the Minister is providing £2.5 million for this system.  The school transport system is one of which Fianna Fáil are justly proud.  A Fianna Fáil Government introduced this system and since it was introduced for the most part it was the Fianna Fáil Government who funded it and paid for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, in order to prepare the way and soften the path for charges for school transport, set up a committee which duly obliged by recommending that charges should be made.  That was resisted by me as Minister and by Deputy Barry as Minister.  We kept as good a service as possible going.  There are always problems about this system because Members of this House are continually approached about school transport: the bus does not go far enough or it goes too far or it should go to this or that crossroads.  An honest and sincere effort has been made to run the service in accordance with the rules laid down and to try to provide a satisfactory service for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Vote 32 we increased from £50 to £70 the grant in lieu of fees in 1978 and 1979.  This year, 1981-82, the grant in lieu <Col N="1033" /> of fees is increased from £70 to £71.  I am sure the Minister is conscious of the effect of the budget introduced by this Government earlier this year and of the pressures that were put on the primary and the post-primary schools, in particular those referred to in the Minister's speech under Vote 32.  The Minister's predecessor has an honourable record in that regard.  Perhaps the managerial authorities were not totally satisfied with what was given, but the fact that within a period of less than four years grants in lieu of fees were increased three times is something of which we can be proud and is a pointer to the Minister to take cognisance of increasing costs and to increase grants in lieu of fees.  As Minister for Education, I increased capitation grants.  That too is an area I recommend to the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is better for the ulcer. The tuition grant was increased in 1978 and 1979 by £20, from £50 to £70.  This £70 was increased to £77 from the commencement <Col N="1034" /> of the school year 1981-82.  I hope that satisfies the Minister and puts the record straight.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of computer courses.  I want to recall the attention of the House to the launching of this programme, which was announced by me at the IVEA conference in Tralee on 13 May 1981 at 8 p.m. in the Mount Brandon Hotel.  On that occasion I said that as computer studies is not just a subject but is also a technology it cannot credibly be handled in a chalk and talk environment and that to be real it must involve a hand's on experience.  For that reason I proposed to introduce, with effect from September, a scheme under which micro-computers would be made available to all second-level schools.  I said I was very happy to be in a position to make that announcement at that time and that the new scheme was further evidence, if such be needed, of the Government's commitment to ensuring that our young people would be fully prepared for what was well described as the second industrial revolution.  I went on to say that for reasons which we all understood, we missed our share of the first industrial revolution and we were determined not to miss out on our share of the second.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has continued the scheme I launched at that time.  When the budget was introduced the House will recall that I expressed a fear for certain areas and this was one of them.  In the course of my contribution on the budget I mentioned the danger that the entry age to primary schools would be raised.  I also mentioned the danger that my computer scheme and my distance learning scheme might come under the hammer.  I am pleased that the Minister has committed himself to it and also that he is now in the process of providing both hardware and software interface for the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended that the micro-processors would be in all schools by September. We had made provision for training schemes during the summer for teachers and the Computer Society of Ireland also had training schemes prepared.  I have had correspondence from the latter and they are not 100 per cent satisfied that the Department of Education kept them <Col N="1035" /> informed of those who had failed to get on the Department's courses.  However, they have made a very good effort to familiarise people with the use of computers. It is not necessary to await the coming of an expert to each school for the apparatus to be useful to that school because there are various levels to be taken into account in dealing with them. Ordinary tactile familiarity with them is a help to pupils.  To see them takes some of the mystique and fear out of them.  Of course, there are several other levels of sophistication in dealing with them which can be developed right up to third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I had the agreement of the Government for the full cost of those microprocessors for all the schools and there was a Government guarantee, by way of our old friend the Supplementary Estimate, that we would make the financial provision for them this year, 1981-82.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that those who by raffle, private subscription or begging bowl were pioneers in this field and have installed the machines already are not mulcted because they were pioneers, because they had the enterprise and were ahead of the Department of Education in getting them.  The Minister should see to it that those who had already installed them &mdash; some of them are based in areas which cannot afford to spend much money &mdash; are grant-aided the same as those who are getting them for the first time.  The processors have not been installed all that long and consequently there could be consideration of paying a grant <i>ex-post factum</i> to them.  I understand some of them have been refused, but in my view that amounts to punishing enterprise.</P>
    <P>With regard to Vote 33, I am glad that the bargain we made before we left office to purchase Carriglea Park is being followed through.  The history of trying to find a site in the area of Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Bray was a long one.  We had a serious problem and there was general agreement that there was a need for a regional technical college in that area. We had been looking at sites in Blackrock and Bray and, finally, at a bargain price, <Col N="1036" /> we succeeded in purchasing Carriglea Park.  This is very important for the development of technological education in the area.  Sites in Tallaght, Blanchardstown and the north of County Dublin are also being sought.  This is a programme which I commend to the Minister and I hope it will progress.  I am aware that he will have a problem with regard to sites but progress had been made in places other than Carriglea Park.  I wish the Minister well with the development of that programme.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well also with his initiative on adult education development. I modestly claim some credit for having launched the scheme of adult education organisers.  That arose from a study of the Murphy Report on adult education, a very thorough and extensive report which is known to the House. During the week I attended a function in Cavan Vocational School where the adult education organiser, who is doing marvellous work, as are other adult education organisers throughout the country, made a presentation of the programme to the Minister for Forestry and Fisheries. It is a very impressive programme and I hope the new adult education committee will build on what has already started.</P>
    <P>There was an attempt made to indicate to the House that the Minister's predecessor, and the last Government, in some way were neglectful of the third level area in education.  I should like to tell the House the blunt facts about the financing of the Higher Education Authority in 1981.  The Higher Education Authority met the former Taoiseach, and myself, to discuss their funding problems and so on and were assured by us that they had made their case.  We listened very carefully to what they had to say and we told them that we are concerned with the financing of third level education.  We told then also that we accepted the principle that they needed more money and we gave them a commitment to provide for that extra money.  The total provision that we intended making was roughly in line with what the Minister has introduced today and about which he has done so much boasting.  He has had to do something <Col N="1037" /> that I would not have had to do had I remained in office.</P>
    <P>I repudiate the suggestion that there was any danger of the educational services running out of funds at any level had it not been for the change of Government In his heart the Minister knows that that was not so.</P>

I must emphasise again that what the Minister has introduced today represents less than 5 per cent of the budget, and that is what he is making a big story of.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the idea of a four-year pre-budget exercise is good in the sense that it may help the higher education institutes, the universities and the other funded bodies.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in that regard.  There is no mention here of the fact that some of the money the Minister must provide for the Dublin Institute of Technology is on foot of a purchase that was made by his predecessor.  Though I am not sensitive he might have given a little credit to me for that.  I had made a purchase for the extension of Kevin Street College of Technology of which I was very proud.  I had a very constructive and fruitful meeting with the chairman and with the Chief Educational Officer of the City of Dublin VEC.  We met in one of their colleges and had lunch which was provided by the students.  I have the appreciative letter that I received from the Chief Education Officer and I have some photographs also of the event.  These will be among my souvenirs.  I commend to the Minister the <Col N="1038" /> development of that sector.  When he was on the county VEC I found him very helpful, and that is more than can be said for some of his colleagues, one of whom is now a Member of this House.  The Minister was helpful to me on various occasions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the higher education grants and I recommend to the Minister that he follow my example and double these grants.  If he does this I shall have the privilege of complimenting him again in this House.</P>
      <P>In my notes I have written: &ldquo;where is Vote 31?&rdquo; I have dealt with that already but I am still wondering where the Vote is.  I have written here also that some of the Minister's colleagues were complimentary about the Book of Estimates and about the accuracy of the Department of Education in that regard.  I have dealt with the question of the technological revolution and of the Minister having followed my decision to develop the technological process in post-primary schools; also, the provision of the micro-processor.</P>
      <P>There is just one other matter, and this is one that was referred to also by the Minister.  It concerns my pet project of distance study.  In office I had considerable discussions with the National Institute of Higher Education on this matter. Contact had been made with the BBC in Northern Ireland and with the Open University people.  I had committed myself to a course which could command the expertise of the adult education officers around the country and the use of the regional technical colleges, both of which are to the credit of Fianna Fáil when in Government.  We had in mind the launching of a double course &mdash; a course in the familiarisation of people with the whole electronics area, a course which could be used as a foundation course for my other projects, which was to have a proper course in respect of which would be issued a national certificate in computers, such certificates to be designed, awarded and validated by the National Council for Education Awards. Added to that has been the proposal that a course in agricultural science be provided also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> I hope the Minister will ensure that the distance study project will be encouraged and that the number of worthwhile courses will be increased.  RTE were invited to some of the meetings and I found them anxious and willing to play their part in this development.  I found among them something that is going out of public life, going out of education perhaps, and that is enthusiasm.  There was a quite palpable enthusiasm among the people I met when we were trying to develop this project.  I hope it will be continued.  I am pleased that the Minister is funding clerical assistance for national and secondary schools.  I am pleased, too, that he is funding the employment of development officers, but I am very disappointed that a decision has been taken to stop this whole scheme of the provision of clerical assistance in schools and also to stop the appointment of development officers.  I understand &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that these appointments have come under the ban introduced by the Minister for Finance earlier this year on new appointments.</P>
    <P>The development in the comprehensive and community schools area is also welcome.  I understand Deputy N. Andrews has a problem.  I hope he will get an opportunity of raising the matter since he has been told that there has been a decision not to build in a particular area.  Some of the developments mentioned by the Minister are well under way.  Indeed I am sure Carrigaline must be finished.  Ballywaltrim and Rosmini are very familiar to me and I know they are well under way already.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have not had enough time to deal adequately with the Supplementary Estimate but it was a great disappointment to me &mdash; I repeat this because I think it is important that I should repeat it &mdash; that the Minister deliberately avoided bringing in a Vote 31 Supplementary Estimate.  I know there is need for it.  The Minister's failure struck me as a device for avoiding accountability to the House for the Primary Education Vote.  He mentioned the employment of teachers which, of course, would be paid <Col N="1040" /> for at about £500,000, if my memory is correct, for the remainder of 1981.  He mentioned he had various reasons for not bringing in a Vote, reasons I have not found adequate, and I will not withdraw my strong condemnation of the Minister for his particular attitude.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Education, as has been said, is a large one.  I think it is the largest Vote which will come before the House. It has outstripped Health and Social Welfare and consequently it is one which deserves the greatest attention.  It is one which the House is entitled to see and examine in full and to comment as to whether we are getting full value for the amount being spent.</P>
    <P>I still have hopes that the Minister will withdraw his Circular 24 of 1981.  He should get rid of it once and for all.  It is a cancer on the educational body.  It is doing harm and it will continue to do harm so long as it is there.  The Minister should cut his losses, get rid of it and establish some kind of rapport with the people in the field in that most important area of education.  If lipservice is a criterion it is the most important area.  We have the metaphor of the foundation of the house trotted out quite regularly but, despite the Labour and Fine Gael commitment and the joint commitment in that area, there has been neglect.  The Minister has avoided his responsibilities in that area and has not indicated to us how he will fund Vote 31.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments and on their decisiveness since they took over Education.  Anyone with an interest in education obviously welcomes the fact that the ministry is now in charge of two young men prepared to take decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the Supplementary Estimates the Minister announced some of the decisions he has taken and the funds provided to implement them.  In particular I welcome the changes in the higher education grants.  When these were first introduced the intention was very simple. They were designed to provide an opportunity for higher education in the case of people whose family finances did not allow them to avail of higher education. There is no doubt that the levels of the grants provided has fallen far behind what they should be and many students with excellent academic records found it impossible to avail of places awarded to them in third level colleges.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now redressed the situation.  The evidence of an improved situation was obvious in October when the colleges opened and vast numbers of students from lower income families were again able to go to university and third level colleges.  I realise the review of the grant and scholarship systems is an on-going exercise.  In that context I should like to make three points the Minister might take into consideration in future reviews.  In a situation where one member of a family is already in college and the parents are paying for <Col N="1042" /> that undergraduate, there is a strong case to be made where a second member of that family applies for a grant for higher education.  Obviously it is more difficult to keep two in third level education.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out an anomaly &mdash; it is minor on the national scene but major for those involved &mdash; where people whose incomes are calculated on the basis of agricultural holdings are assessed on a notional income.  This has always been the practice and it is fair enough.  But there are cases where, because of family circumstances, the holding is let and the actual income from the rent is lower than the assessment.  In such cases I hold the rent income should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some discretion given to local authorities who actually administer the schemes.  All the details of the schemes are laid down by the Department of Education but it is the local authorities who administer them.  They are refunded one year in retrospect.  They take up the loan charges for these schemes.  Some discretion should be given where there are late applications or people are reapplying for grants under change of means in family circumstances. It is another anomaly in that if someone applies for a grant in 1981 who did his or her leaving certificate in 1978-79 it is the means of the family in 1978-79 that are assessed.  Changed family circumstances are sometimes looked at.  I had a case recently where a young man decided to go to university.  He is now married.  He has one child.  Instead of being assessed on his own existing circumstances he is assessed on the circumstances of his father in 1979.  I welcome what the Minister has done.  I do not mean to cavil because what I have raised are minor anomalies.  There are thousands of students all over the country who are absolutely delighted with what the Minister has done for higher education and the higher education grants earlier this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): They are not all like Galway.  In the case of school <Col N="1043" /> transport funds have been provided this morning.  I welcome what has been done. It is a very important social programme although there are anomalies in the scheme.  I want to draw attention to one which the Minister of State in a review of the scheme might have a look at.  Eligibility is decided on the basis of distance from school.  If one is three miles from a post-primary school one is eligible.  In urban areas, especially in my constituency, I have had several examples of people being unable to gain admittance to a school near them, having to go to a second choice school more than three miles away and being refused free transport. It is decided on the basis of distance from the school nearest to one regardless of whether one can gain admission.  I know the Minister of State is examining the programme and I would like that anomaly to be looked at.  I believe it would be fairly easy to correct it.  It is a scheme decided by the Department of Education and administered locally. Local officials do not have much discretion in the implementation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important decision the Minister made since he came to office is to provide 300 extra teachers in primary schools.  Great work has been done in primary schools over the last few years. Since the abolition of the primary certificate and the introduction of the new curriculum a greater flexibility has been introduced into primary education which is really child centred now.  We have very skilled teachers coming from the colleges of education, new educational methods being applied; we have greater freedom, greater flexibility, greater creativity in the classroom, which I welcome.  The difficulties which arise in primary education now are physical in some schools because of inadequate classroom space or due to derelict buildings in some rural schools. I know the Minister will continue the building programme to eradicate this.  A second major difficulty which arises is the size of classes.  I welcome the decision to employ 300 extra teachers and reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to an all-time low. I am sure the Minister, realising the availability of teachers coming from the education <Col N="1044" /> colleges next year, will again make a reduction in the requirements for the appointment of teachers and that we will have another major decrease in the pupil-teacher ratio next September in the national schools.</P>
    <P>The quality of education in the national schools is excellent.  The new curriculum has produced a new generation of children who actually like going to school. They are happy, creative children.  This is due to the new curriculum and to the teachers handling of it.  If we could get the class sizes down even further tremendous progress could be made in this direction. I cannot say the same for curriculum development in post-primary education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's speech to the Seanad on 29 October where he committed the Government to the establishment of an independent curriculum and examinations board.  In the context of what he said this morning about the introduction of computers to schools and his commitment to curriculum reform in post-primary education I would like to comment briefly.  In post-primary education the examinations system determines the curriculum and, frequently, determines the teaching methods. Attempts have been made in the past by dedicated teachers to reform the curriculum within the schools but they found themselves totally tied up in the examinations system.  It was impossible to introduce new schemes right through the spectrum of post-primary education because parents would not simply accept the situation where their children were put outside the competitive examinations structure. This needed to be done to adequately reform the curriculum in post-primary schools under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Curriculum reform has been a kind of on-off situation.  We have had the experience of transition years and we have the experience of the Irish studies programmes.  Many teachers who were committed to curriculum reform in these areas found their work could not be validated by any national system.  There was no provision made under the examinations system to validate the work done in the classrooms.  The teachers were left, <Col N="1045" /> first of all, with the problem of working under inadequate guidelines, and secondly, with the problem of getting acceptance from the parents for new curriculum development schemes.  That is why I welcome this independent curriculum and examinations board.  It is impossible to introduce a curriculum board without an examinations board or an examinations board without a curriculum board.  The curriculum does not determine the examination any more. The examination determines the curriculum. I would like, in particular, to suggest that the regidity of the leaving certificate be examined.  Before children enter post-primary education, especially in middle class homes, ambitious parents are thinking in terms of points for university and grades for university.  As a result, the teachers have no option but to teach along certain lines.  The curriculum is laid down by the Department of Education. The content is invariably good in the different subject areas but, because of the particular examinations system the methodology is determined as well by the examinations system and very little individual choice is given within the schools.</P>
    <P>The type of traditional post-primary education leading to a leaving certificate, where the most successful was the person who got the most honours and the highest grades, was successful for quite a number of students.  It fulfilled the need, it provided the universities with an accurate system of assessment and it provided them with the most talented people in the community for entry to their courses.  It also provided people for entry to a whole range of white collar jobs.  At its best, it did all of these things but at its worst it was merely a whole mass of undigested fact passing from the notes of the teacher to the examination paper of the student without going through the minds of either.  This is the difficulty in many situations, which has been magnified by the greater numbers who have continued to enter post-primary schools since the introduction of free education.  There is now a whole range of talents coming into post-primary schools; there are people who literally cannot read on entry, and there are people who would probably <Col N="1046" /> pass their leaving certificate in the first year.  The range is enormous but the whole range of students are put through the two gaps, the intermediate certificate and the leaving certificate.  In many cases is does not suit their needs.  I welcome the Minister's decision to set up an independent curriculum and examinations board, because it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>There is another development I would like to see in the schools.  It is so easy in a post-primary situation to get locked into ones own discipline, to be so concerned with achievement in one's own subject area that the general aims of education are nobody's responsibility. Education, as defined by educationalists, happens rather by accident than design.  It is not enough to leave it to the ethos of the school or the atmosphere of the school to inculcate the values which we consider to be so desirable when we make theoretic speeches on education.  There must also be a systematic developed section of the curriculum which deals with personal development.  I would like this independent curriculum board to look at all the pastoral care programmes which teachers had been attempting to put into operation in the schools.  There is a great need among our post-primary students in the whole area of personal development. I hope this can be structured so that freedom is given to individual schools and individual teachers to adopt and adapt their own programmes for the personal development of their pupils so that the end will be that the excellent young students coming from primary schools can continue and graduate from secondary schools as mature young adults.  I have hopes that the new board will do tremendous work in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of the provision of computers to many schools.  Any attempt to reform the curriculum must accept the fact that we are in the computer age.  I was interested to see that the Minister intends to introduce computers not alone to post-primary schools but even to the higher classes in primary schools.  In many cases the children will see computers for the first time.</P>
    <P>I should like the Department of Education <Col N="1047" /> to get to the point of organising separate courses for computer studies.  It was a bad decision by the previous administration to include computer studies as an option in the leaving certificate mathematics programme.  That is to fall into the fallacy that only those who are good at maths can cope with computers.  As a matter of fact, there is probably a greater inter-relationship between ability at languages and computing than there is with mathematics.  Certainly mathematics has its input but there should be a separate discipline for computer studies if we are serious about it.  It is not the manual skills or skills closely related to typing for the input of information into computers that we should be interested in.  It is the whole software area that should be dealt with in schools, the programming and systems analysis.  That is the kind of programme that should be developed, because it will provide an adequate base for a separate computing subject.  I understand the Minister intends moving to this situation in the examination year 1983.  I welcome this move.</P>
    <P>I get upset when I hear people refer to education as one of the big spenders in government.  There is no doubt that with half of the population under 26 years the dependency level is very high.  An enormous proportion of the population is in school.  Consequently, education must be one of the big spenders, but I worry when I hear education and social welfare mentioned in the same breath.  I do not believe they are comparable.  There is an attitude to education that it is one of the public sector areas that is consuming funds needed elsewhere.  This has been articulated not so much in this House but by independent commentators.  We must look at our first, second and third level institutions as an investment in the future.  Even if one never had an interest in the welfare of students, one could make a strong economic argument for investing in the skills we will need to make us into a modern economy.  We may have the land and the capital but we certainly need the labour, and the unskilled or semi-skilled labour of the past will not be adequate.  A breakdown <Col N="1048" /> of unemployment statistics show that the sections hardest hit are the unskilled and the semi-skilled.  Our attitude should be to invest in all levels of education, to provide more places in third level institutions so that adequate levels of skills can be provided for the young people whom we need to run the country and the economy.  I would justify the expenditure on third level and higher education grants on those grounds alone.  Not alone will the students who availed of the extra extra £9 million the Minister for Education used to bail out the universities last September benefit, but the whole population eventually will benefit.  These are the people with the skills, with the necessary intelligence and the range of abilities to attract industrialists to this country.</P>

      <P>This is a serious debate.  I regret that more time has not been afforded to us to bring to the attention of the House and the public some serious shortcomings regarding the Meastachán Forlíontacha. As Deputy Wilson mentioned, Supplementary Estimates are not new to this House.  They from part and parcel of the tradition of the House but they need to have a balance.  One of the strongest charges that can be made about Supplementary Estimate is that it lacks balance, and that is certainly the case here.  Vote 31 is not included, the needs of primary education are disregarded and indeed that whole sector is referred to in a derisory way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By his actions recently the Minister has curtailed and impeded the progress made by his predecessor in the primary sector of education particularly regarding pupil-teacher ratios.  I refer in this instance to staff levels.  There is a great need to promote this area of education. However, I am not too surprised at what has happened, particularly the recent decision to raise the entry age of children to national schools.  In his speech defending that decision the Minister showed a total lack of understanding of the needs of the primary sector.  With all due <Col N="1050" /> respect to the Minister might I suggest that it would be more desirable if he and the Minister of State exchanged places. I am not throwing bouquets at anyone, but we would be able to speak more constructively with one who has shown a feeling for education.  Anyone who omits the primary sector lacks a basic feeling for education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of <Col N="1052" /> the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Total additional expenditure over that provided for in the Estimates comes to £1,860,000 but taking into account additional receipts of £134,990 and savings on some subheads totalling £1,725,000 we are left with a token provision of £10 to be met under this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The increases in staff costs shown in subhead A. over the original estimate arise from special pay increase which could not be provided for and increases in travelling and subsistence rates which are amended from time to time in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>However, the major item of additional expenditure is under subhead D.1. which is the provision for payment of a grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in respect of administration and current development.  Of the additional expenditure of £1,664,000 involved here, £400,000 is to restore the interest subsidy to purchasers of fishing boats to the level obtaining in previous years.  The previous Government, prior to the Budget last February, specifically reduced Bord Iascaigh Mhara's allocation for interest subsidisation to fishermen for this year by this amount, which would have had the effect of increasing the interest rates payable by skippers in respect of loans from BIM.  Having regard to the depressed state of the industry at the time the previous administration retracted this decision on 15 April last and decided to restore the cut £400,000 in due time but did not ask the House to vote the necessary money.  In effect they took it out before the Budget, restored it afterwards but did not provide the money to pay for it.  The present Government are happy to be in a position, despite the current difficulties, to make these funds available.</P>
    <P>A further £1.2 million is in respect of the aid package approved by this Government as a temporary measure to meet current difficulties prevailing in the industry, specifically in respect of additional interest subvention on boat loans which is being operated so as to: (a) eliminate all interest in respect of BIM <Col N="1053" /> loan accounts for virtually the whole of this year; (b) provide an extra 5 per cent subsidy on interest payments on loans made available by banks to purchasers of fishing vessels up to a maximum of £15,000 per boat; and (c) provide a subvention of 5 per cent on interest payments on vessels purchased outside BIM's marine credit plan.</P>
    <P>I should mention that a further £400,000 in aid is being made available by way of rebate of duty on fuel used in fishing boats through the Revenue Commissioners. This, of course, is not taken into account in framing this Supplementary Estimate.  The balance of £64,000 under D.1. is in respect of special pay awards to BIM staff which have been sanctioned by the Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead E.1. &mdash; Inland Fisheries Development &mdash; the bulk of the £136,000 excess is due to an estimated shortfall of about £100,000 in receipts from the salmon levy and from registration fees which did not reach expectation. The excess also covers the cost of holding the first elections of members to the seven regional fisheries boards which was not provided for and of increased PRSI contributions which came into effect on 1 April, 1981.  It was, of course, quite obvious to the previous Government that elections would be held this year and that they would cost money but no provision was made for them.  Similarly PRSI contributions were increased by the previous Government but no provision was made to pay for them.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, these excesses on the Vote are now being met by savings under other heads and increased receipts. These savings arise under the headings of harbour works &mdash; subhead C.2. &mdash; construction of an exploratory fishing vessel &mdash; subhead C.4. &mdash; and the capital grant to BIM &mdash; subhead D.2. Estimation of the cost of harbour works is difficult and the expected savings of £126,000 on subhead C.2. represents less than 3 per cent of the total amount voted.</P>
    <P>A sum of £999,990 is saved under subhead C.4. which provided for expenditure on the construction of a new fisheries research vessel for the Department.  The <Col N="1054" /> cost of this is now to be met under a leasing arrangement and capital expenditure by the Department will not arise. Negotiations on the contract price on the vessel are at an advanced stage and I hope to be shortly in a position to announce the placing of the building contract.</P>
    <P>The savings of £600,010 on subhead D.2. arise mainly as a result of grants for boats, gear and maricultural projects not being fully taken up in the current year.</P>
    <P>The increased receipts under subhead I. are attributable to the imposition by the courts in recent cases of illegal fishing of severe financial penalties in line with those provided for in the Fisheries Amendment Act, 1978.  Several cases were pending legal procedures of one kind or another, but these and some new cases have been disposed of with considerable success and profit for the State.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister did not deal with the fishing industry in a little more detail.  I am not surprised that he should use this opportunity as a springboard on which to make political points.  On three occasions he mentioned that expenses arose during the year for which his predecessor did not make provision.  I shall deal with that during the course of my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry in general is aware that anything we promised we did and we would have been prepared to pay for that but for a quirk of fate that sees the Minister in the position he is now in.  Any supplementary estimate for fisheries today can be introduced only with a great sense of insecurity and uncertainty about the whole future of the fishing industry in Ireland.  Whatever we plan to do must be overshadowed by the continuing failure of the member states to agree on a common fisheries policy.  I am not blaming the Minister or any of his predecessors and I feel that I am not to blame for any failure to decide on a common fisheries policy.  It is my experience, and the Minister will agree, that Ireland has been a good European member since we joined the EEC.  We have abided by the rules, <Col N="1055" /> but by the end of 1981 the ordinary Irish fisherman can say that as far as he is concerned the EEC is a farce and can be seen only as a very cynical exercise in international political window-dressing, and Ireland's fishing industry and its future are very much pawns in that game.</P>
    <P>It is high time for the fishery Ministers in all the member states to stand back and have a look at themselves and at the record for many years.  I know that people will point to the benefits that fishing is supposed to have gained and say that because of the Hague agreement we were allowed to double our catch in 1980. It was a target which we achieved and great credit is due to everyone concerned for that, but our percentage of the total catch is very small, even when it is doubled. There is not a great difference between 2 per cent and 4 per cent and when you think of the other 96 per cent and 98 per cent it is not significant in the total European context.  We got some price supports and some funding for fishery protection, but my experience leads me to believe that some states are not serious about achieving a common fisheries policy.  We spent monthly meeting after monthly meeting haggling over total allowable catches and quotas.  We spent a lot of time also talking about a breakdown in the quota species, give a little here, take a little there, and how it should be divvied up.  There was a very big debate about that.  Did it really mean anything?</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce a system of monitoring catches was hailed as a big breakthrough.  There was talk of a logbook to be introduced to enable catches to be monitored and we wondered what type of people would go aboard these other vessels to check them and how they would go down into the hold and recognise frozen blocks of fish for what they were.  To me that is farcical.  Will it ever become a reality or is all this talk of a logbook and monitoring catches like the paper fish which appear in statistics but which have no bearing whatever on the catches we talk about?</P>
    <P>We have worked towards a solution to the common fisheries policy.  We waded <Col N="1056" /> through lengthy negotiations with our nearest neighbours, Britain and France. We talked at length about our traditional rights and how to reconcile divergent opinions and wishes in this regard.  To give Britain, Peter Walker and Alec Buchanan-Smith their due, they were serious about it and made constructive attempts to reach satisfactory conclusions. However, at that time we saw how ineffective we were because third countries' imports destroyed our prices at home and it took us a year to have curbs imposed on them because the multinationals who had a vested interest in Canadian waters wanted their pound of flesh &mdash; tons of fish would be a better phrase &mdash; first.  This time last year it appeared that many of our problems had been solved and that the only major problem standing in the way of a common fisheries policy was that of access.</P>
    <P>I was naïve enough to think that that was the last hurdle.  Then it appeared an election was coming up in one of the member states and there would be no hope of reaching a solution.  Everything broke down and fishermen had to take second place to politicians.  Indeed, with all the member states there is bound to be an election in some of them every year.  The Minister himself will probably be faced with an election next year and I am not referring only to the Cavan-Monaghan by-election.  I would be prepared to bet that he will be faced with a general election, but I am sure that will not stand in his way of going ahead and endeavouring to resolve this situation once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Council meeting which was to be held this very month cannot now be held because the saga of petty jealously and ill-concealed greed continues. Some member states have raked the bottom of their own sea beds for fish not only to consume but also to turn into fish meal, and now they are trying to do the same Hoover-type exercise around our coasts.  They are very much in character with their seafaring forefathers, but, to give those old sea-robbers their due, they had the decency at least to wear horns on their helmets and thereby were recognised easily for what they were.  Today's <Col N="1057" /> generation hide behind EEC directives and mounds of EEC documentation and monthly meetings interspersed with meaningless talk.</P>
    <P>It is time now for all Ministers to grow up, face their responsibilities and forget about the Hans Christian Andersen bit. It is time for the fisheries Ministers to deal with the problems they have.  They have the duty to give existing fishermen in Europe a decent standard of living and ensure that their families in the years to come will be able to live off the sea.  Until that is done it will be impossible to get Irish fishermen to accept that the EEC has been of any real benefit to them.  We may have got an occasional lollipop but we need security for the future and we need to see Community preference honoured for what it is and what it should mean.</P>
    <P>No matter what money we pour into it here at home in supplementary estimates and annual estimates, the future for Irish fishing is very much in jeopardy, first of all because of the lack of a common fisheries policy, and secondly because of the destruction and decimation of our stocks. My information is that on 1 and 2 December, yesterday and the day before, Dutch, German and British ships were fishing illegally six miles off Tory Island. Probably they were chasing our mackerel stocks.  They are interested in a short-time gain, but they will decimate the mackerel stocks, as the herring stocks have been fished out.  I am not blaming the corvette.  Our fishery protection is inadequate.  I am told that the corvette was in Rathmullan, probably keeping an eye on freezer ships and seeing that the rules that we would like to see implemented are put into effect.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are very dependent on mackerel for our catches, and since curbs and restrictions were put on herring fishing all our eggs are in the one basket as far as mackerel is concerned.  Can the present mackerel stocks sustain the amount of fishing to which they are subjected? I know the increase in mackerel catching was a very big boon to our super-trawlers because they were in a position to avail of this catch, to go further to sea to follow the mackerel and to <Col N="1058" /> extend the mackerel fishing season from two months to possibly nine months. There was a false impression as to the value of the catch and the amount of people who benefited from the doubling of our catch and the quotas we caught. The super-trawlers served an important purpose in so far as they gave our processors continuity of supply, which enabled them to expand their processing facilities, increase their capacity and export frozen mackerel to African States where we have a lucrative and insatiable market.  I do not think the number of super-trawlers which we have would deplete our stocks of mackerel, they are probably an aid in ensuring that we catch the quota allocated to us but, if the vulture-type of fishing which now operates is allowed to continue in mackerel stocks particularly off the north western, Galway and Mayo coasts, it will destroy the stocks and eventually there will not be a living there for our own fleet.</P>
    <P>With regard to a common fisheries policy, I would ask the Minister if there is an overall political will in the EEC to formulate and implement a policy.  I have seen no great evidence of this so far and, if there is no political will to bring it about, there will be no future for Irish sea fishing.  The Minister mentioned some matters which will engage his attention during the coming year.  We should ask ourselves what our national plans are for the future.  Shortly before we left office we introduced a subsidy scheme to prop up prices.  That has been a help but only in the short-term.  We also introduced a subsidy scheme for diesel oil and a pension scheme for fishermen who could retire at 50 years.  To a landlubber that may seem early but, to a fisherman who is engaged in a very strenuous life, 50 years is about right.  Any fisherman is entitled to be ashore at that age.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say that because of different periods when boats had been bought and loans granted, there was a great discrepancy between the interest rates paid by different skippers of different boats.  It was for the purpose of equalising the terms that were offered to them and giving equal treatment to everyone that the subsidies were changed in the <Col N="1059" /> last budget.  I am sure the Minister for Finance had cutbacks in mind also but it was one of the matters we decided to embark on and then found during the course of the year, principally because of the big drop in fish prices, that the fishing industry was in need of further propping up, and subsidies were restored.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Government are in a position to make funds available.  I assure those in the fishing industry for whom we took this measure that we would also have paid for it.  Where do we go from here?  What will our policies be in the future?  I notice the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, which has not yet been reached, proposes to raise the loan from £15 million to £40 million to BIM. I presume this money will be used to build up our fleet.  Two years ago six super-trawlers came into our fleet and the money involved was very great. Unfortunately, most of it was spent away from home.  It can be said they have proved their worth.  At the time those trawlers entered our fleet, we succeeded in Brussels in getting the total allowable catch and the species catch of 45,000 tonnes of mackerel raised to 51,000 tonnes.  Members of a certain organisation which speaks on behalf of fishermen indicated it was not enough and that we would need a quota of twice that amount. I expressed the view that we might be lucky to catch that during the course of the year and I was proved right because that was the amount of mackerel we succeeded in landing that year.  It may be all right for general secretaries or paid officials of pressure groups to make hysterical statements but Ministers have to be more realistic.  The fact that we are realistic will strengthen the Minister's hand when he goes abroad.  He proved we were capable of attaining what we had sought before.</P>
    <P>In all probability we have achieved the quota we are likely to be allowed from now on.  I hope we will get annual increments to enable us to develop our fleet because we have the least developed fleet in Europe.  That is tragic for a country which is surrounded by water but we must ask ourselves what is the likely quota we <Col N="1060" /> will be allowed to catch, what is the capacity of our existing fleet and what we should do with it?  There is a dangerous opinion that we should bring in more super-trawlers.  We have embarked on a plan where anything over 90 feet only gets a grant of 25 per cent and up to 90 feet there is a grant of 50 per cent.  That is an expression of the Departmental will to encourage smaller-type vessels.  Some people may see it as a restriction on fishermen but it is a decision that had to be made.  Do you make a few people very rich and put others out of business or do you endeavour to give traditional fishermen a reasonable livelihood?  We should now modernise our existing fleet by giving them better gear and equipment and making them more efficient.  That is where money should be spent at home rather than going abroad.</P>
    <P>I also see a big future in mariculture. If our quotas for sea fishing are limited to a certain percentage, our potential for mariculture is unlimited.  At present it is in its infancy.  Commercial propositions are now going ahead reasonably well in the cage-rearing of shellfish with the emphasis on oysters, mussels and scallops.</P>
    <P>I hope that local co-operatives around our coasts will get more encouragement. They have been reasonably well encouraged. More smallholders and part-time fishermen should be in a position to supplement their incomes by engaging in these activities with the co-operatives.  I have expressed the opinion, with which the Minister concurs, that it should be our policy to help the smallholders rather than bigger combines, as far as mariculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>The freezer-ships in Rathmullen are necessary until we have the capacity on shore of processing our catches.  They are necessary during this transition period, and I hope that the quantity taken on board will be closely monitored and that all catches will still have to be offered for auction on shore.  Irish fishermen have now proved their ability to catch fish in quantities which will give processors the confidence to invest in more concrete buildings on shore.  I do not confine this to Killybegs or the other Donegal ports, <Col N="1061" /> but see the joint venture which we have entered into with a Spanish company in Castletownbere as having marvellous potential.  The expansion in Donegal is, possibly, a headline for the rest of the country.  Local processors are doing very good work there.  I would like to see the day when the maximum amount of added value is given to our catch here in Ireland and fully processed at home.  Rossaveal will eventually prove to be the proper location for a fishing centre.  I happened to visit it for the first time this summer and am confident that the right decision was made to site the centre there.  It has a great future and has an ideal location on the west coast.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my thanks to the committee who have been of great assistance to the Department, giving their work voluntarily in the planning which is entailed.  It is important that in any harbour development there should be a considerable amount of planning and much more liaison than obtains at present. Much work has been done in Killybegs &mdash; the auction hall, the ice plant and other extensions.  Anyone would have to express a certain amount of disappointment at the failure to provide an overall plan and to finish the shore road to allow traffic to flow freely there.  There is a need for greater liaison between the Department of Fisheries, the Department of the Environment &mdash; with the involvement of the local county council &mdash; and the Department of Finance.  For instance, two years ago when the fleet of super-trawlers arrived in Killybegs, there was no provision for berthage and landing of fish.  At that time, one could be assured of 17 feet or 18 feet of water, when the requirement for a boat coming in was at least 22 feet.  That created problems and immediately made it imperative for the Government of the day to find sufficient money to dredge and to provide space for the boats to utilise the port and land their catches.  It is important that haphazard planning such as that should not happen.  We should have a complete infrastructural package catering for every aspect of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Howth scheme will go ahead and that the present progress and <Col N="1062" /> amicable relations with all concerned will continue.  I would like a revitalisation in Dunmore East and Kilmore.  I hope that the herring stocks will continue to improve and that the Celtic Sea will be opened to further fishing during the coming year.  Fishermen should appreciate that it was only because of intense pressure that the limited opening of 1,000 lbs which we succeeded in getting earlier this year is available.  It is either that or nothing. It would appear that some greedy people, in expressing disappointment at the decision, would have preferred nothing. It was a limited opening which will benefit small boats and will, it is hoped, allow consistent monitoring which will prove that the herring stock is there, to enable bigger boats to fish and make a greater catch available next year.</P>
    <P>The fact that I have mentioned only bigger fishery harbours should not be taken to mean that we should confine our activities to these centres.  We had a programme of improvements of small ports around our coast.  Any small port which has proved that it warrants improvement because of its landings and has a potential to expand deserves to be also included in a programme of improvements.  I am thinking particularly of areas like Dingle, possibly Ballydavid, and Clogher Head.</P>
    <P>In relation to inshore fishermen, the Minister mentioned the elections which will be held this year.  Whatever about the problems of sea fishing, inshore fishermen and salmon fishing are the most emotive facets of the fishing industry.  It was necessary to bring a certain degree of uniformity to the fishing industry. There was not much uniformity in the Kerry and West Cork areas, with six salmon-fishing licences in Kerry and many more in West Cork.  The man who can claim credit for the licences in West Cork is no longer with us.  I hope that he is enjoying his retirement.  He continually gave me the works from this side of the House when I was Minister, by referring to the fact that I lived in a landlocked constituency.  I hope that nobody will make a similar reference to the present Minister.  He has a lot more water around him than we have in Kildare.</P>

      <P>Elections to the new regional board are due.  The people appointed have finished a year in office since the foundation.  They have, in the main, taken their job seriously and laid the groundwork for future improvements and development.  It should be the job of the regional boards to accommodate all types of fishermen and give everybody equal rights.  That is a difficult thing to do when certain privileged people feel that they, and only they, have a divine right to fish.</P>
      <P>If the boards are properly set up everyone's viewpoint will be listened to.  When the plans are formulated by the different boards there will be requests for money and budgets will have to be met.  This will ensure that plans for the betterment of the fishing industry will not be stifled.  I know some of the members of these new boards and they have a certain idealism and zeal.  Nothing would be more likely to frustrate that than lack of money and seeing plans set up for the general good of the industry shelved.  It is to be hoped that the different regions will submit their plans to the central board to be examined and monitored and that the best of what is happening can be used to formulate an overall policy for the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> One matter, which is possibly much nearer home to the Minister, is the question of pollution.  This affects all boards. We will have to seriously get down to solving this problem to ensure that we have clean water for our fish in the future. If we are to do this the question of planning of farm buildings and effluent will have to be tackled.  The Departments involved will have to get together and formulate a policy to ensure that the work being done by the Minister's Department will not be undermined by haphazard planning and work done in another Department.  The plan that we set in train at Lough Sheelin should be looked on as a pilot project.  It was a very good effort to overcome the problems at Lough Sheelin.  I would hope that the momentum will not be lost.  It is important for county councils to realise that the new legislation is serious and that we intend to do away with pollution in Ireland. Money must be provided to administer this, and therefore penalties will be imposed if the legislation is flouted.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the salmon levy.  It is to be hoped that the money from that will go towards implementing plans in the various regions.  I hope that the programme of restocking our rivers will be embarked upon.  One of the projects we had concerned cross-Border co-operation and I hope that this will be continued.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that our present fish stocks are maintained.  We are fortunate to have fish in our rivers which are still relatively clean in comparison with those of other countries.  This is possibly due to our delay in being part of the industrial revolution rather than to any innate cleanliness on the part of the Irish people.  But we have a duty to be serious about this and to retain the fish population of our rivers and the abundant fish stocks around our coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate on the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I regret that the time allowed is so short, as I am sure a <Col N="1065" /> number of other Deputies wished to contribute.</P>
      <P>First I want to sound a note of warning about the serious threat to the mackerel stocks around the coast.  There is provision for £900,000 for a new research vessel. This is badly needed because we do not really know what quantities we have around our coast and depend on very hazy forecasts or assessments of various international bodies to tell us what the exact stocks are.</P>
      <P>In the middle sixties, late sixties and early seventies the main fishery here was the herring fishery in the Celtic Sea and the main fishing port was Dunmore East. But heavy over-fishing of this stock almost exterminated it.  I do not want to see the same thing happening to the mackerel stocks.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that this is going to be the case unless stringent measures are taken by the Minister and by the EEC.  I am not convinced that those measures are being taken at present.  The catches are above an acceptable level.  I would point to some statistics produced by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which is the authority on these matters.  In 1973 the mackerel stock of the West European coast &mdash; I refer to the area from the Faroe Islands down to Cornwall &mdash; was estimated at 3.5 million tonnes; in 1981 that stock had been reduced to 1.7 million tonnes, by more than half.  We are told by the fishery experts here that some years the catches made are more than twice what is advised should be made.  I am also told that the number of under-sized mackerel which are being caught gives cause for alarm. We are doing to our mackerel fisheries what we did to our herring stocks in years gone by.  I do not want to see Killybegs become as redundant as Dunmore East. Ten or 15 years ago Dunmore East was a thriving port.  It was not unusual to see up to 100 trawlers there landing herring. Nowadays there is not one boat landing herring.  It is almost a ghost port.  The same will happen to Killybegs unless we are careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have emphasised in this House on several occasions, and wish to do so again today, that the use of purse seine nets for <Col N="1066" /> fishing mackerel is ill advised and merits serious consideration by the experts in the Minister's Department.  This is a deadly method of fishing, and the stocks will not be sustained if it is allowed to continue.  This method of fishing has been banned in a number of other countries because it is regarded as being unfair and responsible for the extermination of stocks; the whole shoal is encircled and trapped and it is wiped out.  I would like to voice my concern about what I consider to be over-fishing of mackerel stocks in this general area, off the West coast of Europe and particularly around the Irish coast.  Nobody can be absolutely sure of the amount of stocks involved because the method of assessing these stocks is quite amateurish.  A research boat, such as is provided for in this Estimate, is badly needed, but it was alarming to read about the size of mackerel stocks.  In 1970 the amount of mackerel caught off the west European coast was 100,000 tonnes.  Last year the catch was 600,000 tonnes.  When one appreciates that the estimated total stock of mackerel is only 1.8 million tonnes one can see how dangerous the situation has become.  If mackerel fishing of that range is allowed to continue it will not take long to wipe out completely a tremendous asset to our fishermen.  Donegal fishermen, and others with large boats, are largely dependent on mackerel catches and it is imperative that mackerel stocks be protected.</P>
    <P>It is alarming to note that over-fishing of our waters is not entirely by EEC countries but from outside the EEC.  Is the Minister aware, for instance, that many of the boats fishing inside our 200 mile zone are Danish and British and that because of the circumstances we are not enabled to even assess the size of the catches?  Is there a monitoring system of the mackerel catches outside our 200 mile zone?  I am afraid we are not able to assess mackerel catches even inside our limits.</P>
    <P>Another dangerous tendency is the EEC licensing of third country boats to fish inside our coastal waters.  Some months ago boats registered in Guernsey were arrested off the west of Ireland and my amazement is understandable when <Col N="1067" /> I say that the boats did not come from any Community country but from Spain, who are not yet an EEC member.  I believe those boats are also being registered in Britain.  In other words, we have fleets of boats from outside the EEC not registered with the EEC catching huge quantities of protected fish in our coastal waters.  To say the least of it, this is sharp practice, and I hope the Minister will take it up within the EEC so that this type of bogus registration will be eliminated.  Of course we know that the Guernsey registered boats were anxious to get at our stock of hake, a diminishing and a precious species and in respect of which EEC licences had been drastically restricted. They were able to circumvent this by registering in Guernsey.</P>
    <P>Parts of the Estimate make good reading but some parts do not.  For instance, a sum of £620,000 in grants was not taken up.  In 1980 this would have been understandable because there was lack of confidence by the fishermen due to low prices for fish.  I am glad to see that a stop has been put to fish imports from third countries. Deputy Power, when he was Minister, set matters in motion to ensure that unfair dumping by third countries would be limited.  Prices have improved as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Our revenue from fishery fines has increased, and I should like to think that most of that revenue came from outside the country.  The owners of some Spanish boats have been fined heavily for fishing within our limits.  I notice that under Sub-head I there are additional receipts of £134,000.  It is good to see that we are catching poachers and collecting a reasonable amount as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power referred to the shortfall from the salmon levy.  I am not too unhappy about that because it is my opinion that the salmon levy should not have been introduced.  There are more salmon caught illegally around our coasts than legally and the levy was penalising the people with licences while thousands of people without licences were paying neither fines nor levies because of their strategies to circumvent the regulations.  As I have said, the levy should not have been <Col N="1068" /> imposed because it was impossible to implement and to administer.  The drop in receipts bears out that contention.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to expenditure on fishery harbours.  The amount estimated was not spent although there is not any industry needing more expenditure on expansion than fisheries.  When people are talking about job creation and new industries they should be giving serious consideration to fish processing.  Every year hundreds of thousands of tonnes of mackerel are caught in our waters, but how much of it is processed here?  I would refer particularly to Rathmullen, which has become merely a transit depot for our mackerel catches.  I suggest that the Government should see to it that at least a portion of that fish will be processed here.  It is known that up to September this year 37,000 tonnes of unprocessed mackerel went abroad and I would not be surprised to learn that the quantity of unprocessed mackerel exported since September has exceeded that.  We read daily of Russian factory ships taking our mackerel away unprocessed.  This is a matter we must look at seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,300,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and for certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Professor Dooge) James C.I. Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Professor Dooge)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take the Supplementary Estimates for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Foreign Affairs is required mainly because <Col N="1069" /> of deliberate under-estimation when the Estimate for the Vote was being prepared by the previous Government.  Altogether, over £1.1 million was deducted, apparently arbitrarily, at a time when it was clear that ongoing commitments could not be met from the amount of money proposed.  Excesses appear on five subheads of the Vote &mdash; salaries, travel and communications, office machinery, post office services and repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens abroad.  The total of the additional sums required is £1,700,000 but this is partly offset by savings elsewhere in the Vote amounting to £100,000 and by an additional anticipated increase of £300,000 in appropriations-in-aid.  The net additional sum required is therefore £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>The anticipated increase of £800,000 arises on the salaries subhead mainly because of a deduction of £477,000 at Estimates time. It was clear at the outset that the original provision would not be sufficient, and the inevitable shortfall was further compounded by the fact that serious fluctuations in some currencies, notably the US dollar and the British £, occurred during the year.</P>
    <P>Similarly, an unrealistic deduction of £588,000 was made in the travel subhead. Currency devaluations also affected expenditure on this subhead.  Despite the strictest economy in the use of the services that this subhead provides for, there are unavoidable commitments which have to be met.  The additional sum of £555,000 now sought is the minimum required to enable these commitments to be adequately catered for in the current year.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.2, which provides for office machinery and related supplies, is yet another example of deliberate under-provision. My Department have paid £40,000 for computer soft-ware which will be utilised by the civil service as a whole.  When this is taken into account, ongoing departmental expenditure is actually less in this subhead than it was last year.  Nevertheless, I am obliged to seek approval for an additional sum of £121,000 by way of Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> The additional £180,000 required for post office services is due to increasing charges which have to be met if essential services are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The provision for repatriation and maintenance of distressed Irish citizens abroad was also unrealistically curtailed. In 1980, a sum of £79,000 was paid out by way of repatriation and other advances.  For this year also it was clear that demands were running at a level of about £70,000 and yet only £26,000 was provided by the previous Government. Most of the moneys advanced from this subhead are recovered in any event and this is reflected in increased receipts in appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The total of the sums required for the five subheads will, as I have said, be offset to some extent by savings on other subheads. These savings have been achieved mainly by curtailment or deferral of activities. The anticipated increase in appropriations-in-aid of £300,000 arises because of the increase in consular fees as part of the July budget.</P>
    <P>With regard to the vote for international co-operation the additional sum required is £60,000.  Increased provisions are necessary for two of the subheads to enable us to pay mandatory contributions to international organisations and to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  In addition, because of a saving in the current year in our contributions to the European Development Funds established under the Lomé Conventions, it is proposed to redistribute this saving among other elements of Official Development Assistance in the Vote.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead A of the Vote, an additional sum of £48,000 is required to enable us to pay our contributions for membership of the international organisations of which we are a member.  The original provision was not sufficient to meet these obligations, and currency fluctuations also contributed to the increase.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that Subhead G of the Vote concerns payments for the benefit of developing countries arising from our membership of the European Economic Community.  In the original <Col N="1071" /> Estimate, £4.017 million was provided under this heading for the purpose of meeting Ireland's contribution to the Fourth and Fifth European Development Funds established under the Lomé Conventions, and to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), in addition to providing for any contingencies in the matter of exchange rate fluctuations which might arise in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>In the event, the Council of the European Communities decided not to call up member states' contributions to the Fifth European Development Fund.  The callup from Ireland under the Fourth EDF amounted to £2,299,500.  Negotiations on the replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development have suffered setbacks because of, among other things, the failure to agree on the relative contributions of OECD countries as compared with OPEC countries. While the remaining problems regarding the replenishment may yet be settled before the end of the year, payments to IFAD will not now become due before 1982.  These developments mean that we have some £1,717,500 available under Subhead G for re-allocation to other areas of aid expenditure.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to transfer an amount of £692,500 to Subhead B &mdash; contributions to UN voluntary agencies. This will bring the total figure under this subhead to £1,486,500 as compared with the original allocation of £794,000.  Thus the reduction suffered by agencies such as UNICEF and the UNDP in the initial allocation for 1981 will be offset.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, I propose to allocate an additional £150,000 to enable the agency to eliminate once and for all its accrued deficit and, in addition, to finance some further assignments overseas before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The disaster relief subhead received only a token sum of £50,000 in the original budget.  This does not reflect the importance of this mechanism of distributing aid at the critical time of the immediate aftermath of a disaster.  Accordingly, I propose to allocate an additional <Col N="1072" /> £300,000 to this heading.  Of this £100,000 will be allocated to the relief of distress in EI Salvador; £50,000 will be channelled through Trocaire; and a further £50,000 through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
    <P>I also propose to allocate an additional sum of £7,500 to the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation to meet the cost of increases in the council's administrative expenses.</P>
    <P>The balance of £567,500 will go to the Bilateral Aid Fund.  Of this, £100,000 will be allocated to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. A grant of £100,000 was made to this group in 1980 but it was not maintained in the initial allocation in 1981.  However, the present re-allocation will restore our contribution to its 1980 level.  A further £250,000 will be reserved for co-financing projects with non-governmental organisations and the balance will be allocated to other areas of the Bilateral Aid Programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to Subhead I, the contribution towards the expenses of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, it was not possible to forecast accurately the likely duration of the Conference in 1981 nor our estimated contribution thereto.  We are obliged to pay our share of the expenses of the conference, and the additional sum of £12,000 now sought will enable us to pay the contributions so far levied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his comprehensive resumé of the reasons the additional sum of £1,300,000 should now be sought.  This time last year I had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate also involving readjustments.  The basic point involved here is that we have £1,717,000 available for readjustment within the aid programme area.  Because of the fact that the European Economic Community is rather tardy in actually allocating funds for which we budget at the start of our budgetary year a reallocation took place under this heading last year on my initiative and is now being taken today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> I want to take up one point with the Minister on this aspect, that is that last year I took the view that a greater proportion of that re-allocation should go to the bilateral aid programme than is envisaged in what the Minister is now doing. Of the £1,700,000 odd £567,000, or £500,000 only is being allocated to the bilateral aid programme.  Therefore in round figures, of the £1,500,000 being taken from the contribution to the Community Aid Programme &mdash; by reason of the Community not taking up these moneys &mdash; £500,000 only goes to the bilateral aid programme.  One million pounds have been distributed through various international agencies and so on.  Last year I took the view that this money should almost entirely go to the bilateral aid programme.  In my view it is the bilateral aid programme, as administered by Ireland in various countries, plus the APSO programme &mdash; and I am glad to note that APSO are also getting an increase, even if not a very substantial one, of £150,000 only &mdash; it is in these areas where Irish people are involved, where Ireland is directly involved, that the greatest practical gain in the real meaning of that work is obtained.  Too often what tends to happen is that in regard to the money contributed by way of international aid through international agencies &mdash; while we must preserve minimum obligations we do not get sufficient credit as a country from them &mdash; there is not sufficient involvement by Irish personnel. I feel very strongly that it is through agencies such as the bilateral aid programme, the various voluntary agencies participating in overseas help and through the APSO personal service aspect &mdash; which again is an Irish contribution &mdash; the greatest positive contribution can be made, not just gain in the narrow sense of the word but in the broader sense, in that Irish people are involved; again, in appreciation of the needs of overseas areas and which generates greater public awareness and consciousness here at home of the need to be involved in such programmes.  Generally, in so far as one can weight &mdash; and here I want to balance it against the necessity of maintaining minimum obligations <Col N="1074" /> to international agencies &mdash; what we can do within our limited resources. I would suggest to the Minister &mdash; and I am sure he would agree with this sentiment &mdash; we should concentrate on those areas where Irish personnel are involved, where the Irish interest involved is identified and where there is therefore the greatest benefit accruing both to the recipient areas and the donor country involved.  This applies particularly in African countries with which we are associated in this capacity.  I am thinking of countries like Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, the Sudan and so on &mdash; just to mention a few &mdash; generally very strong in that area of east Africa where we are involved personally through such agencies, particularly where we can give the expertise as well as the money, where there is a link between expertise and money.  I am thinking here of An Foras Talúntais in agricultural expertise, of Aer Lingus who have made a contribution there &mdash; although strictly outside the scope of this Estimate &mdash; in regard to training personnel for airways; I am thinking of Bord na Móna who are making a positive contribution in Ruanda and Burundi, two countries with peat resources rather on a parallel with ours. Therefore, the combination of our expertise, plus finance, plus the high regard in which we are held in these countries, by reason of historical factors, adds up to a situation in which our international aid of this kind, within our limited budget, should be concentrated in areas in which Irish inputs can gain to the maximum extent out of the moneys being given and where Irish expertise can be involved. There is, of course, in the long run a very definite gain to Ireland as a whole in building up the economies of these countries and establishing a goodwill that will bear fruit not next year or the following year but many years to come.  Of course, that is a follow-on to the sort of build-up done by Irish missionaries, Irish teachers, Irish professional people, Irish business people in many parts of Africa over so many years.</P>
    <P>That is why I should like an explanation as to why a greater percentage of the savings I have mentioned in regard to the <Col N="1075" /> European Community contribution did not go in the direction of bilateral aid and in the direction of APSO.  In that area we could have utilised the moneys to a greater extent rather than merely fulfilling contribution obligations to various United Nations agencies that, frankly, have been disappointing in regard to the benefit accruing to Irish personnel and to Ireland in regard to their expenditure.  I say that advisedly because it is important that we maintain our obligation in regard to contributions to the various United Nations agencies.  During my period as Minister for Foreign Affairs frankly I was disappointed at the lack of response or involvement as far as Irish personnel and Irish interest were concerned in the various areas to which the United Nations contributed.</P>
    <P>Having said that I should like to go on to the broader aspect of the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs as a whole and to make the point that there is one aspect I feel is not sufficiently mentioned as far as public awareness is concerned, that is the practical contribution made by the Department, through its embassies, towards the generation of investment interest in Ireland via the Industrial Development Authority and the generation of exports as far as Ireland is concerned via Córas Tráchtála Teo. The Department maintain an excellent system of liaison and co-operation with these State bodies directly involved in investment in Ireland and in the generation of exports.  I saw a recent newspaper report &mdash; I would hope there is little truth in it &mdash; that is, that consideration was being given to a closure of embassies.  I should like to hear the Minister on that question.  In my view what we need in this context are more, not less, embassies in strategic areas.  Essentially foreign policy should follow along a path of enlightened self-interest.  For a small exporting and trading country that means having embassies in strategic places where our immediate interests are involved.</P>
    <P>I am very glad my decision to establish diplomatic relations with Venezuela has gone ahead because I regard the North. South and Central American areas as <Col N="1076" /> very important.  Our enlightened policy on the Middle East has borne fruit by way of excellent trading and investment relations and in the supply of essential oil resources.  If our foreign policy was not in tune with our industrial, economic and export industries in the Middle East we would not succeed.  With the development of very substantial oil resources in the Americas it behoves us to increase our diplomatic representation there.</P>
    <P>The African continent is developing and a large consumer market is opening up.  In the more developed countries like Japan and China, our embassy representation has to be more sophisticated, bearing in mind investment and trade opportunities in Ireland, and there must be emphasis on investment and trade.</P>
    <P>The interests of a small trading country like Ireland are linked with an efficient foreign service that works with the trade and economic agencies of the State, and ensures that, in key strategic areas, there are an increased number of embassies. Our foreign policy structure must be geared to the economic requirements of a country that is generating exports.  In an otherwise bleak economic scene, the only area in which there has been positive progress is in exports.  Two out of three people now employed in manufacturing industry depend on exports for their jobs. This year's export target was £4,800 million and we appear to be on target; last year we were on target with a figure of £4,150 million.  Ten years ago we had an export market of £400 million.  This year our target of £4,800 million is 12 times the figure of ten years ago.</P>
    <P>This brings the Department of Foreign Affairs into perspective and our foreign policy must be seen in this context.  When we take an independent and realistically neutral stance in world affairs, whether it be in the EEC or the United Nations, that is appreciated and understood by the countries with whom we trade and countries from whom we seek investment. When Minister for Foreign Affairs I never found any difficulty in establishing Ireland's position as a country with a positive contribution to make, a country which was not attached to any movement within the various blocs, eastern, western <Col N="1077" /> or non-aligned.  We were always neutral &mdash; there are few other countries who managed to maintain their neutrality &mdash; and that suits the role of a small country. As Minister for Foreign Affairs I was never pressured to get involved in any defence commitment within or outside the Community.  Far from it.  As a small country our role enabled us to act as an honest broker.</P>
    <P>Last autumn the Madrid conference on co-operation and security did not appear to be getting off the ground.  The then German Foreign Minister came to me and said Ireland, with Austria and Sweden, could play a real role in negotiations with eastern European countries to get the conference off the ground.  Because the conference dealt with <i>detente</i>, Germany, as a member of NATO, could not get involved directly in such negotiations. That is the sort of honest, straightforward role we can play, which is respected by the various blocs and does not involve us in any military or security entanglements.</P>

      <P>I want to address myself to three points.  It does not do a government any good to underestimate in two important fields &mdash; foreign affairs and international co-operation.  We do not only little justice to ourselves but we do not do justice to the many voluntary organisations which have done tremendous work over the years.  We do little justice to the public who contribute about £6 million a year by way of voluntary contributions and donations to voluntary organisations for co-operation abroad. This raises the hoary chestnut of our involvement in international co-operation and our bilateral aid programme which should be taken out of the political arena altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no wonder the voluntary organisations continue to raise this question when we see foreign affairs and international co-operation underestimated as they have been in recent years.  That question would not arise if the Government made up their minds to adhere to the United Nations target.  The sooner <Col N="1078" /> this is done the quicker the voluntary organisations will have little criticism to level at us.  That target is low enough and we should try to reach it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the personnel of all the voluntary organisations who have continued the work done by missionaries and others down the years.  In the coming year this insulting situation should not arise&mdash;we are providing only a token sum of £50,000 for the emergency disaster relief fund when we all know such a small sum is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>Work on the provision of a permanent microwave link between Galway and Tuam is in progress and it is expected that it will be completed in the second quarter of 1982.  The aim had been to have the link in service this year but delay in completion of the tower at the Galway terminal has prevented this.</P>

      <P>Now that the provision of the micro-wave link has been postponed until mid-1982 I should like to know if in the interim a mast could be put on the microwave link?  Is it technically possible to link it directly to Athlone because it serves most of Mayo, all the 093 area, all the 094 area and all the 092 area?  If that was possible it would give tremendous relief to those areas.  Is it possible to introduce that interim arrangement pending the final installation of the telecommunication exchange in Galway?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured by the engineers concerned that the radio link serves equally as well as the microwave link and that the only difference would be that the microwave link would be a permanent <Col N="1080" /> construction unlike the radio link.  The Deputy may take credit for having that installed, but it is serving equally as well as the microwavelink.  There would be no advantage in changing the present arrangements.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about an area outside the 093 area which the radio link now serves.  I should like to inform the Minister that there is an 092 area operating in Tuam which the radio link does not serve.  He should also consider the 094 area, which serves Castlebar and most parts of Mayo.  My question is a simple one.  Technically speaking, is it possible to readjust the microwave link to connect directly to Athlone and then on to the national grid rather than waiting for the connection to Galway city, the permanent and proper way to do it eventually?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

Has the Minister changed the philosophy and the policy that existed in the Department when he took it over and, if so, what is the change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no change in policy.  Again, if the Deputy had asked that question originally he would have been given a reply to it.  I should like to point out that there are no residents on this island and that the Deputy is concerned about providing a telephone service for a temporary resident who wrote to the Deputy when he was Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from an address in Germany. That person wrote on a number of occasions asking that a telephone line be provided for his summer residence on the island but he is the only person who has put in an application in respect of the island.  In view of the fact that it would cost about £8,000 to do this, I am sure the Deputy will agree that there are areas in his constituency where such an amount of money would provide more telephones.</P>

      <P>That statement is not correct. The Minister is referring to a person who wrote to me from Hamburg in Germany, but he wrote since the last general election when I was not in the Department. Is the Minister aware that three other people who wish to retire to the island have applied?  What has happened to their applications?  Have they been lost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarrieAcheson" hpid="Mrs. Acheson Mrs. Acheson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Acheson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if there are proposals in his Department to transfer part of the 052 area to Waterford exchange 051; if so, if this will result in a reduction of exchange staff in all grades at Clonmel exchange; and the proposals he has in relation to the existing staff in this district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that under fully automatic conditions operator services for the 052 area will be provided at Waterford exchange.  The manual exchange at Clonmel will, however, be retained for some time although there will be a gradual reduction in staffing there according as manual exchanges served by Clonmel exchange are converted to automatic working and the volume of operator-assisted calls declines.</P>
      <P>Employment at other exchanges will be available for full-time day staff who opt to transfer.  Arrangements which will apply to to other staff have been agreed on a national basis with the staff organisations concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarrieAcheson" hpid="Mrs Acheson Mrs Acheson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs Acheson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  I do not like the idea of other exchanges.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that there are 80 people involved.  What is the Minister's intention in regard to the placing of <Col N="1083" /> the 80 people who do not wish to go to Waterford, the exchange mentioned? Those people do not wish to be discommoded. Yesterday we heard of the people in Dublin who wish to go home and today I am telling the Minister about the people in Clonmel who wish to stay in that town rather than be sent to Waterford. There are 35 people involved and I should like to know what employment the Minister intends to provide for those who do not wish to go to Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the Deputy's point of view but the fact is that, as we go automatic, operators will be made redundant.  That is a fact we cannot run away from.  In an attempt to overcome the grave personal difficulties which many operators find themselves in, such as those outlined by the Deputy, the Department have agreed with the unions representing the staff to give very generous redundancy payments, far in excess of anything ever dreamed of before on this island because it is a once-off situation. I should like to assure the House and the Deputy that any reasonable request put forward by those operators will be sympathetically considered by the Minister and the Department.  There is no easy answer to this problem and I appreciate the Deputy's concern, but there is not anything the Deputy or I can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is time for a new approach to the whole question of redundancies in relation to the introduction of new automatic exchanges?  If he does agree is the time not ripe to devolve more work to the regions where much of the work being conducted in Dublin in relation to accounts and many other areas could be done?  With the introduction of computerisation it is only a question of a datalink service.  In this way jobs could be preserved in many parts of rural Ireland. I had taken the first step along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with the Deputy and I am prepared to accommodate him in every way possible.  However, <Col N="1084" /> I should like him to put forward something more positive than merely asking whether I agree with him.  I assure him that if he wishes to speak to me in any detail about this problem, he will find my door open.  I assure him also that any proposal he may put before me will be considered sympathetically and, if found practical, put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be happy to discuss the matter with the Minister but is he not aware that I had taken the first step along this road by way of a decision to appoint district managers in the various regions in so far as telecommunications were concerned.  The intention was then to build a regional structure within that framework so that all the work that needs to be done in a district, including information on accounts and sales, could be done in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that step taken by the Deputy but I, too, am particulalry sympathetic to the concept of decentralisation.  Since taking over responsibility in this area I have had talks on many occasions, very often into the early hours of the morning, with the unions concerned in an effort to find a way of overcoming the demarcation line and that commonsense might prevail. The Deputy will understand that with both services being separated in 1982 there is a good deal of suspicion on the part of many unions involved that some of their work will be eroded.  Therefore, it is not opportune at this time to try to get the agreement of the unions or to expect them to be ambitious about doing something that they would not normally do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are difficulties and I am well aware of the situation so far as the unions are concerned but surely the day of reckoning has come and action must be taken now, not when redundancies have taken place? The Minister should pursue this problem actively with a view to removing the demarcation line.  Is it not in the long term interest of all the employees and <Col N="1085" /> trade unions concerned that a solution be found?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only reassure the Deputy that he is welcome to come and talk with me about this problem.  Since my appointment I have had talks with the personnel at a number of exchanges and have put to them the points that the Deputy is putting to me.  They know the services that the public need and if they come forward with any reasonable proposal it will be considered.  I assure the House that there is deep sympathy on the part of the Department regarding the position obtaining in telephone exchanges.  In relation to decentralisation in general I was in contact with the district managers only a week ago and I propose having further discussions with them.  If I may be parochial for a moment, I see no reason for people in Donegal having to contact Sligo who in turn contact Dublin about the telephone service in Donegal.  That is the procedure under the machinery that has been operated since the foundation of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarrieAcheson" hpid="Mrs. Acheson Mrs. Acheson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Acheson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to give special consideration to Clonmel and perhaps start a retraining programme for some of the staff at that exchange who may become redundant? We all know that redundancy money is soul-destroying.  Would the Minister be prepared to make every effort to ensure that when there is the change to the new automatic exchange at Waterford, the personnel at Clonmel can be absorbed into some other type of Posts and Telegraphs employment?</P>

As I have said, I cannot contemplate giving special treatment to Clonmel but I can assure Deputy Acheson that if the local unions involved will agree to telephonists being given duties other than those for which they are trained now, there will be a willingness on the part of the Department to accommodate them.  We would be very generous in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said that I talked to the district engineers and not district managers.  That was merely a slip of the tongue.  Regarding the question of my travelling to Bantry, arrangements have been negotiated successfully with the trade unions concerned in regard to officials at the exchange there, but there are people in Bantry who wish to put their point of view and it was in the interest of showing my concern for and my consolidation with them that I offered to go to meet them.

      <P>The Minister talked about the difficulties of the various trade unions in respect of the decentralisation programme, but is he not aware that similar difficulties arose when I put the proposal in relation to the appointment of district managers?  Is he not aware also that those difficulties were overcome at that time and that if he continues along the path followed then he should be able to find a solution to the problem now.  I admit that what is involved is a rather complex operation.  Would the Minister agree also that his first venture into this area must not be on the advice available to him in relation to the setting up of a similar-type office in Letterkenny where he drew the wrath of three or four trade unions down on his shoulders?  Surely that is not the way to go forward?  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.</P>

Any commitments made prior to 20 July were to be adhered to, but there were to be no new ones.

He asked a question and I have given him the information. If he listens to me I will give him further information, information he has not asked for but which might be enlightening to him.  The figure of 2,000 which Deputy Killilea refers to was an estimated figure put forward for consideration at an early date.  It was never a hard and fast figure.</P>

That is 129 more than forecast.  A total of 225 have been employed in Dublin, 25 more than forecast. To date the total is 554 against 400 forecast.

      <P>The Minister has said that the installation work will take longer than had been envisaged.  Is it because of the proposed cutback in the allocation of capital money for next year for the installation work on the exchanges, where some of the people doing the installation work were told their contracts will be cut by 40 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the delay of another three or four months or even longer is due to instructions from his office to staff on the ground that in future they should be back in their depots by 5 p.m.?  This means they are only working until 3.45 p.m. each day, that their working day has been cut by one and a quarter hours in order to save a few pounds.

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will retain Mallow telephone exchange, County Cork as the 10 centre for exchanges due for automation in order to provide a better service for local telephone users and thereby avoid a situation whereby thousands of extra new signals would be competing for attention at the already overloaded Cork exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Operator services for telephone subscribers in the Mallow area with automatic service are provided at Cork.  The manual exchange in Mallow provides service for manual exchanges in the Kanturk charge group and limited services for a number of exchanges in the Rathluirc group.  Automatic service will be provided at all of these exchanges during the period 1982-83 and any operator services then required will be provided at Cork or Limerick as appropriate. There will be adequate facilities at these two exchanges to ensure a good operator service and there are not sufficient grounds for retaining Mallow as an operator centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Mallow has an exceptionally good case in that in the northern Cork area 11 exchanges are going automatic and will be competing for attention at the 10 centre in Cork, which is totally unsatisfactory? Would the Minister agree that to close this exchange, which has 14 switchboards and 37 operators, would represent a considerable loss to the business, social and financial life of the town? Redundancies would be inevitable and the post office would be downgraded in a town with an expanding population and industry.</P>

      <P>On 7 July 1981 Deputy Killilea, speaking in this House about the need for a telephone kiosk on an island in Lough Corrib said:</P>
      <P>I made an order for a postbox on Aranmore.  It is an absolute necessity and I made my decision as a result of representations from all sides of the House.  It is my hope that the Minister will back my decision.</P>
      <P>However, in a letter to Deputy Andrews a few weeks earlier the Minister said it was not considered that the amount of correspondence likely to be posted in a letterbox at Mr. Gallagher's shop would justify its provision and servicing.  He said there were other letterboxes within a reasonable distance which are considered to cater adequately for local needs.  In addition, a delivery postman carries a stock of stamps and accepts items for posting. These facilities compare reasonably well with those provided in similar areas throughout the country.  Can Deputy Killilea explain the discrepancy between what he said in the House and in the letter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1981, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary partly to meet increases in the cost of some of the existing services rendered by the Office of Public Works and partly to enable money to be provided under a new subhead for a service not provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
      <P>The gross additional amount required, £6,253,000, is offset by estimated savings on other subheads of the Vote, leaving a net requirement of £4,000,000.</P>
      <P>I give hereunder, for the information of Deputies, details of the subheads for which the additional sums are required.</P>
      <P>An additional amount of £775,000 is required for subhead A1 to meet the cost of salaries, wages and allowances of the staff of the office, including pay increases granted during the year and not provided for in the original Estimate.  Sums totalling £95,000 are required to meet the cost of essential items of office equipment and the increased cost of telephone services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure under subhead E covers a large number of building and construction works on hands and at all stages of progress.  The additional money is needed to ensure that the ongoing building programme, which contributes significantly <Col N="1125" /> towards maintaining employment levels in the building industry, is not retarded.</P>
    <P>Subheads F1, F2, F3 and F4 relate to the maintenance, furnishing, leasing, heating and lighting of State-owned and rented property and the additional sums now sought are needed to enable the Office of Public Works to meet increased costs, wages and demands and to discharge its obligations in these matters.</P>
    <P>A new subhead, F6, is being introduced and the ambit of the Vote extended to cover the cost of works to the King's Inns building, which is the headquarters of the Honourable Society of the King's Inns and is under the same roof as the State-owned Registry of Deeds.  The entire structure is of major architectural importance and is scheduled for preservation under the Dublin City Development Plan.  It is, however, in a poor state of repair and, as the Commissioners of Public Works are carrying out major repairs to the Registry of Deeds, the Government have decided that they should also carry out essential repairs to the King's Inns building, the major part of the expenditure to be met from the Funds of Suitors subject to the necessary legislation being passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>£1.5 million is needed to meet commitments incurred under subhead G.2, Drainage Construction.  This is due entirely to the inadequate provision made for this service in the current year by the previous Administration.  The amount sought for drainage construction by the Office of Public Works this time last year was £9.4 million.  This amount was needed to carry on the three major schemes which then were, and still are, at the construction stage.  It included a small amount for a start to be made on the Boyle and the Bonet schemes in the Sligo/Leitrim area.  The amount sought was reduced to £7.5 million, a cut of £1.9 million.  This not only precluded a start being made on the two new schemes but it also meant that progress on the three major schemes was less than the full potential.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £100,000 is sought for subhead G3 due to extra <Col N="1126" /> maintenance works found necessary on the Cashen Estuary in the Feale catchment.</P>
    <P>A sum of £45,000 extra is required in respect of subhead I to cover the cost of coast protection works at Enniscrone, Youghal and Rosslare.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £300,000 is sought for subhead J1.  The extra amount is required to cover the cost of some excavations which arose during the year and were not provided for in the original estimate and also to cover the cost of wage increases and workmen's compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>We have hardly an hour to deal with the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works and many speakers are anxious to contribute to the debate.  A Supplementary Estimate of £4 million is completely inadequate for the requirements of that big Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to arterial drainage, the Office of Public Works are at present dredging the rivers Boyne, Maigue and Corrib-Mask-Robe.  The Corrib-Mask-Robe is 50 per cent funded by the EEC. Fianna Fáil, when in power, made arrangements for the preliminary work on the drainage of the Boyle and the Bonet to be started at the end of this year.  This would involve dredging through the counties of Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo.  The Boyle and the Bonet work is also 50 per cent EEC funded.  No money has been earmarked in the Supplementary Estimate for work to be started this year on those two rivers. I am very disappointed and am sure that the people living in those counties, who are anxious to have this work started, will also be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the survey of the River Shannon, we were offered a 50 per cent grant.  The Shannon is a very important river, flowing through Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath, Offaly and Tipperary.  All those counties would benefit from a dredging operation on the River Shannon. As we were offered £400,000 by the EEC for this survey, the Office of Public Works should have provided, in this Supplementary <Col N="1127" /> Estimate, money to start the survey.  In case the Minister might say that this work should have been provided for by the previous Government, when the Estimates were being prepared early this year we had not been notified that that grant was available.  It is a disgrace that that survey has not been started and also the work on the Boyle and the Bonet.  The people in Brussels will be asking why, when they have allocated grants of 50 per cent for these three important rivers, these allocations have not been availed of.  They may be reluctant in the future to allocate grants for arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Two years ago Fianna Fáil initiated consultations with the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Finance, the ESB, An Foras Talúntais and other interested bodies regarding a survey of the Shannon.  Everything was on stream for the present Minister of State to start the survey at the end of this year and I am very disappointed that it has not started.  Fianna Fáil had done the preliminary work for a cost-analysis on the Dunkellin river which was scheduled to start and if the Minister of State looks at the records in his Department, he will find that an order was made to start a cost-analysis benefit on the Dunkellin river in October of this year.  No money is provided in the Supplementary Estimate for this work.</P>
    <P>I come now to the River Lee in Tralee, County Kerry, which is my own county. A survey was started on this river early this year but nothing has been done for the past six months.  The Minister of State, when replying, might give me the up-to-date position regarding the River Lee which flows from Castleisland into Tralee.  Many acres of land are being flooded in this area.  It is important for the people in the catchment area of Ballymacelligott and Tralee to have the river dredged.  As the survey has been done and money spent on it, it is time that the design was put on display, with a view to having dredging started next year.</P>
    <P>As regards the drainage and dredging of rivers, 15 per cent of the allocation of money for arterial drainage should go to <Col N="1128" /> the dredging of small rivers.  When the Minister of State is replying he will say that this is not included in the present arterial drainage legislation, but many areas suffer very much from flooding of small rivers.  In addition to the present legislation, there should be a supplement allowing small rivers to be dredged, thus ensuring that emergency jobs could be done on the small rivers which are causing extensive flooding in many counties.</P>
    <P>Regarding decentralisation, when Fianna Fáil were in power, teams were appointed to design the Government offices in 12 different centres for our decentralisation programme.  In the Estimates prepared earlier this year, £1.6 million was allocated for this work, and £½ million for the purchase of sites for the decentralisation buildings.  I notice that there is no provision to carry out that decentralisation.  Indeed there was a thorough discussion on that in the House last night.  As far as I can see the Government are not going to carry that out as quickly as the previous Government were.  It is important as many of our civil servants working in Dublin will get the opportunity to work in their own counties. It would be a boost to the towns where the buildings needed would be erected.  It would also give a great boost to the building industry which is very depressed at the moment because, with the transfer of civil servants to a town, there would eventually be a need for housing for them.  Decentralisation would generate a lot of building in addition to the necessary office blocks.</P>
    <P>Under the decentralisation programme the Office of Public Works were preparing plans for a Government office building in Tralee.  A site had been purchased in the town and indeed the building had been designed to house the different civil service Departments in the town.  At the moment offices of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and of the Revenue Commissioners are fragmented in different parts of the town.  As a matter of fact, the agricultural office is one mile outside Tralee town and it is very difficult for many farmers, who travel by bus into Tralee, to get out to this office.  The site <Col N="1129" /> for the new office was in a central place in Tralee which would have enabled many of our citizens in Tralee and in Kerry to get at our civil service offices much more easily.  I wonder why there is no allocation of money to build this office in Tralee.  When will the Government ask for tenders for this building and have it erected in Tralee?</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are responsible for building and maintaining Garda barracks all over the country.  Some of them are in very poor condition.  When Fianna Fáil were in power they had extensive plans to improve, modernise and build many new Garda barracks.  I would like to know what the up-to-date position is in regard to new Garda barracks for Tramore and Carrick-on-Shannon. What is the up-to-date position in regard to Monaghan, Oughterard, Tipperary town and Wicklow town?  They were provided for in our plans and I do not see them mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate here.  Has the money been provided by the Department of Justice to the Office of Public works to have those buildings erected?</P>
    <P>We also had plans for a training centre at Templemore for the training of officers above the rank of inspector in the Garda Síochána.  I would like to know what is the position in regard to that as well.</P>
    <P>Coast protection has been very much neglected.  Only £45,000 has been provided. I would like to draw attention to the very important area of the Maharees in Castlegregory, County Kerry.  There were plans to start coast protection in this area but there is nothing in the Supplementary Estimate for this.  The same position obtains in regard to Ballyvoile, County Waterford.  Perhaps the Government would interest themselves in those areas as they were the two most pressing areas when Fianna Fáil left office and they were the next to be tackled.  Also, when Fianna Fáil were in power we made a request to Brussels, which was taken up by our European parliamentarians, for a grant for coast protection work.  I would like the Minister of State to pursue that further and to let me know if they received any reply from Brussels and if any grant will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> We are very lucky here to have such tremendous national parks.  We have one in Connemara at Letterfrack, Glenveagh in Donegal and in the Burren in County Clare.  We did a lot of work to develop our national parks.  I hope the Minister of State will carry on that programme of development, especially in the Burren where we were purchasing a lot of land for the national park there.  When Fianna Fáil left power we had bought about 100,000 acres.  We were on the point of developing Glenveagh in Donegal.  The Minister of State answered the question about that quite recently and, as far as I can see, the Office of Public Works are carrying out work in Glenveagh.  I hope the Minister will ensure that our national parks are properly developed because they are great recreational centres for our own people and for visitors.  On that point I notice that in Canada and in America the number of visitors visiting their national parks is greater than the number of people visiting our national parks here. In the next five years there will be great emphasis on our national parks and our people will be demanding more development of our national parks so that they can visit them.  In the next couple of years many more people will visit our parks and there will be more demand for them.</P>
    <P>I would like to know also the position in regard to the navigation of the Shannon, the new harbour at Dromad and the dry docks at Rooskey and the additional facilities that were to be provided at Drumsna and Hodson Bay and at Shannon Bridge.  I would like to know also the up-to-date position on the development of Dromaneer harbour in Tipperary which was taken over some time recently from Tipperary County Council by the Office of Public Works with a view to having that harbour repaired and improved.  I do not see any provision for it in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>We have had a discussion already about the security system being installed in Leinster House.  I notice that the contract was placed on 9 August and that the date of finish was supposed to be 9 October. It is now 3 December, but the job has not been completed.  There is great <Col N="1131" /> dissatisfaction with the performance of the English company who took over the contract.  The plans went out of the country, if we consider Belfast as being out of the country, and I hope the Minister will be able to explain why the job has not been completed.</P>
    <P>I submit that £4 million is grossly inadequate as a supplementary sum for this important Department.  Three rivers &mdash; the Boyne, the Bonet and the Shannon &mdash; are subject to 50 per cent subvention from EEC funds and I am dissatisfied that more money has not been provided for the completion of the drainage of these rivers.</P>
    <P>Last year we had a Supplementary Estimate for the OPW of £6½ million. This year it has been cut to £4 million, a completely inadequate sum for the work that has to be done.  The Minister of State is lucky because he has such an excellent staff.  There has been criticism of them but, knowing them, I completely disagree with it.  The Minister has an excellent staff and I suggest that if he provides them with enough money to do the job they will do it.</P>

Surely it is his own fault if there is need for a Supplementary Estimate at all.  Was it not his job to see that at the end of the year the Estimate he had presented at the beginning would have sufficed?  I should like to mention first of all the proposed repairs to this House.  You would want to be a very patient man to understand why the job has taken so long.  That is all I will say about it.

      <P>I am complaining about this.  I work on the third floor where one day the left hand side is heated, the next day the right hand side is heated and some days the temperature on both sides is tropical.  One cannot work in that sort of heat.  Perhaps I am wasting my time talking about it, but the Minister is listening to me and so are his officials and I hope they will go and do something about it: they have heard my criticism and I am sure it is not the first time they have heard criticism about this.  I hope they will take note of it and do something about the heating system and the massive waste of energy particularly on the third floor where the heat is almost unbearable.</P>
      <P>I have heard Deputy McEllistrim speak about decentralisation of Government offices.  I would draw his attention to Tralee and ask him why did he not decentralise ACOT and put them in Tralee instead of housing them in an office block in Dublin?  While he was Minister of State he would have done that if he had had a genuine interest in decentralisation.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate covers a wide range, but my main concern is with arterial drainage, apart from the points I have made.  I must give the benefit of the doubt to the present occupant, Deputy Bermingham, but I cannot extend that to his predecessor or the previous Government, and I hope Deputy McEllistrim does not take these remarks as personal.  One cannot prejudge this Government, but if they do not show an improvement in the commitment towards arterial drainage I will say the same thing of them as I have said about their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important jobs that could be done for the people of rural Ireland is to get the surplus water away from the land, but successive Governments have failed to do that.  The original Estimate for the OPW was £67.971 million which has now been added to by £4 million, a total of £72 million, but the amount spent on arterial drainage was £9 million, £7.5 million from the original <Col N="1133" /> Estimate and £1.5 million from this Supplementary Estimate.  I said earlier this year, and if I did not say it earlier this year I said it last year, that the Office of Public Works or some other body should deal totally with arterial drainage.  We should create a Department to deal with it and be totally responsible for it.  It should get a decent allocation of money annually.</P>
    <P>There is talk about £400,000 being given to us by the EEC to carry out a survey or a cost-benefit analysis on the river Shannon.  About a year or a year-and-a-half ago Deputy Reynolds thought the time was right to start this work.  The money was granted.  I hope the Minister of State will tell us what happened to it. Was it a sum of money picked out of the sky to impress people living on the banks of the Shannon and in the midlands and to give the impression that something would be done about that waterway?</P>
    <P>A great deal of money is spent by the Office of Public Works along the banks of the Shannon for the benefit of tourists, fishermen and people like that.  It is money down the drain.  Have the Government any intention of spending money on the drainage of the Shannon? The Minister or the Government should say whether or not they intend to do this work.  We do not want any more of the claptrap we have been hearing over the years.  Money is spent to accommodate foreign tourists.  I know that is important from the point of view of the economy. The previous Government had no plans to drain the Shannon.  I do not know whether this Government have, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  They have been in office for five months only. I will give them more time to see what they will do about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to get back to a few hardy annuals.  Last week two other Deputies from the west and I raised the question of the drainage of the Dunkellin in County Galway.  Has there been a cost-benefit analysis of what has happened in relation to the Dunkellin?  Promises were made that something would be done.  As far back as 1971 the late Deputy Lemass was foolish enough to write a letter saying he hoped work would start in 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> The different factions in Fianna Fáil were in evidence in Galway during the election campaign.  Deputy McEllistrim, Deputy Killilea and Councillor Fahey made a special trip along the banks of the Dunkellin prior to the election.  I do not think they invited Deputy Callanan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Other interested parties were not on that walk with the dignified Kerryman who was there to drain the Dunkellin.  Promises were made at that time and published locally to the effect that the money would be made available and that a survey had started. As far as I am aware, nothing has happened since.  We were told it was under way and I suppose in December 1991, we will be in the same position as we are in December 1981.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may be able to tell me whether the promises made by Deputy Killilea, Deputy McEllistrim and Councillor Fahey about the Dunkellin were honoured.  I know they have no interest in it except a political one.  I should like to know what the Minister of State proposes to do.  At this time of the year Minister gathered in places like Barrettstown House to divide the kitty for the coming year.  They put a couple of pence on the pint and so on.  They take nothing off the price of anything.  I should like the Minister of State to tell the Minister for Finance that he wants a decent allocation for arterial drainage in 1982.</P>
      <P>Assuming he gets the necessary allocation, are the necessary plans ready for work on the Dunkellin, or the river in Kerry to which Deputy McEllistrim referred, or the Suck, or the Shannon, or the part of the Corrib to which I referred the other day where work stopped in 1964 and has not been restarted since.  Have the Office of Public Works drawn up the necessary programme so that we can go ahead and carry out some of these drainage schemes if money is available from the local authorities and if by some miracle we get money from the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have a separate office to deal with drainage and take total responsibility for it.  They should draw up the <Col N="1135" /> proper priorities so that when money becomes available it can be spent for the benefit of farmers.  I am aware that people who have an interest in shooting or in wildlife prevent some of this work. I will say no more about that.  If the Minister gets a chance to reply I hope he will answer some of the points I have raised.  If not, I suggest that he should write to me and give me an answer to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak for four or five minutes only because I promised another Deputy five minutes, but Deputy Donnellan spoke for longer than expected.  However, he has said most of what I had intended saying and I shall not repeat it.</P>
      <P>Over the years when an Estimate for the Office of Public Works was debated the question of arterial drainage has arisen. I contend that there was not sufficient money provided for this purpose by any Government.  There is a lot of talk at present about EEC aid.  Deputy McEllistrim made it clear that the 50 per cent supposed to come for the survey of the Shannon was not notified to them at the time the Estimates were being drawn up for the Office of Public Works this year. As Deputy Donnellan said, the small amount being provided for arterial drainage each year is a joke if we really mean to drain the land.</P>
      <P>I agree with practically everything Deputy Donnellan had to say, except that he blamed the previous Government.  It must be remembered that the previous Coalition were in power for four years when nothing was done about a cost-benefit analysis with regard to the Dunkellin river.  At least Deputy McEllistrim came to Galway and, I understand, left an order that the survey would commence in October.  Indeed, I made a mistake in putting down a question to the present Minister contending that the survey had started already.  I made a mistake in that respect &mdash; it was to start in October; that is what Deputy McEllistrim told us. Therefore Deputy Donnellan was wrong in that respect.  I am very much interested in the drainage of that river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> Also with regard to the survey on the Shannon why in the name of goodness can we not put up the money here rather than relying on funds from the EEC? Indeed I discovered that the Office of Public Works had not the staff to carry out a survey on the Shannon in conjunction with the Dunkellin.</P>
    <P>No Government took seriously enough the whole question of arterial drainage. Indeed there is something to be said for Deputy Donnellan's suggestion of splitting up the Office of Public Works and for having a special section deal with arterial drainage.  There is no point in talking about manuring land or doing anything else with it until it has been drained.  This whole question is of vital importance to us in the west and I shall say no more about it at present.</P>
    <P>I want to make one comment, however, on the Office of Public Works in general.  They are doing an excellent job, particularly on ancient monuments. However, I have a crib with them, that is that when they take over ancient monuments or abbeys invariably there are people there who have a traditional right to buried there.  My family is a case in point and I have said before that I intend to be buried in such a place.  My crib with the Office of Public Works is that they take it upon themselves not exactly to put on a closure but to make it so difficult for people that they cannot actually get into such places.  I made representations to the Minister, he promised me certain concessions, we were to meet officials of the Office of Public Works and discuss the matter.  Yet before a particular burial took place we were told we had to ring the local office in Athenry and wait for a man to come out.  Who, in the name of God, with a relative dead, would want to take upon themselves the task of telephoning an office and awaiting the arrival of somebody to show them where to bury their dead?  I object strenuously to this practice.  I grant that they are doing an excellent job on ancient monuments but I stress that they cannot take away the God given right of the people who laid all belonging to them to rest in such places and intend continuing that practice. I want to make that quite clear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> There are many things I should like to say on the whole aspect of the activities of the Office of Public Works but time does not permit.  I wish the Minister well in his tough task.  He has not got the adequate money or staff with which to carry out the arterial drainage needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will get to the kernel of what I have to say straightaway. This is a vast Estimate covering many activities of the Office of Public Works.  I shall refer immediately to the situation as it affects my constituency and particularly that of the drainage of the Boyne in County Meath.  I have always welcomed and been a supporter of arterial drainage.  After ten years working on the Rivers Boyne and Blackwater there are other areas about to be drained by the Office of Public Works which could benefit by or learn from their mistakes in that area.  With the drainage of those two rivers now reaching completion I would urge the Minister to order an objective study of the advantages and disadvantages of these costly drainage schemes.  If the Minister agrees with my proposal then an evaluation should be undertaken by an agency other than the Office of Public Works who have been responsible for arterial drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With public finance so scarce it is now more important than ever to ensure that <Col N="1139" /> the work carried out on the drainage of rivers is worthwhile and done in a commonsense manner.  There is no doubt that such works are beneficial and give tremendous employment.  We would all dearly love to have our land drained but it must be done to the benefit of the community at large.  In Meath the once beautiful, meandering rivers, the Boyne and Blackwater, have been gutted, rendered characterless, mature trees having been hacked out, river banks bulldozed into sharp straight lines, undergrowth dragged away, wild life driven off and fish life seriously destroyed.  It is clear that more thought should have been given to the complex question of the benefits of the scheme.  Nobody can question a farmer's entitlement to have his land properly drained but it must be remembered that other people have rights also. Those people with no agricultural land have as much claim to our rivers as anybody else.  It must be said that the people of Navan have lost certain important amenities since the drainage of the Boyne.  No consideration was given to the wishes of the townspeople when the Office of Public Works wiped out the weirs which were on the Boyne for centuries and where the local people learned to swim.  If the Office of Public Works attempted to do the same now, ten years later, there would be a hue and cry and the people would not allow this to be done.</P>
    <P>Excellent efforts have been made to preserve houses which have stood for two or three centuries.  How much more valuable than a house is the last river of its kind which God took ages to create?  The Blackwater was one of the last great limestone streams in its natural state.  All that has now been changed for the want of thought.  The Office of Public Works should restore some of the beauty of the Boyne and Blackwater.  They should immediately start planting trees to replace the mature timber which was sacrificed. Fast growing trees should be selected for the river banks.  Any community agreeing in the future to the drainage of their local rivers should first come to Meath and see some of the <Col N="1140" /> destruction of the environment that can follow.  I believe there should be a system of monitoring drainage work done by the Office of Public Works.  A river should not be raped simply to make it possible for farmers to use fields when the river is in spate.</P>
    <P>More consideration should be given to the wishes of the urban dweller, the cottager and those without any land.  In some parts of County Meath where drainage has been carried out local residents subsequently found that their wells had gone dry.  While the Office of Public Works would not admit liability in this matter, they frequently come to some arrangement&mdash;I believe they should come to a full arrangement&mdash;to ensure that people who suffered financial loss through their wells running dry should be compensated.</P>

You called three Fianna Fáil speakers for one Government speaker. This is an absolute disgrace.</P>

      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £296,000 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Nollaig, 1981, le haghaidh tuarastail agus costais Roinn na Gaeltachta, maille le deontais le haghaidh tithe agus ildeontais-i-gcabhair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an cuspóir atá leis an meastachán forlíontach seo ná suimeanna breise mar seo a leanas a chur ar fáil lena gcaitheamh ag mo Roinnse: &mdash; £175,000 do thithe Gaeltachta; £75,000 do scéimeanna <Col N="1144" /> feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht; £46,000 do thuarastail, pá agus liúntais; agus £20,000 do chostais taistil agus chostais theagmhasacha. Tágann na suimeanna sin go dtí £316,000 san iomlán ach sábhálfar £20,000 ar scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha, rud a fhágann go bhfuil aontú na Dála a lorg agam do ghlaniomlán £296,000.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú suntasach tagtha ar obair thithíochta ar fud na Gaeltachta agus éileamh dá réir ar dheontais faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) i gcaoi nach leor an tsuim airgid a cuireadh ar fáil dóibh i dtús na bliana seo sa mheastachán bunaidh ina ndearnadh soláthar £950,000 i gcomparáid leis an £916,000 a caitheadh sa bhliain 1980 agus an £706,000 a caitheadh sa bhliain 1979.</P>
    <P>Is iad na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil soláthar breise á chur ar fáil dóibh ná scéimeanna uisce a mbeidh deontais le fáil ó FEOGA ina leith faoi &ldquo;Phacáiste an Iarthair&rdquo; agus deontais chaipitil 10 faoin gcéad le híoc ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, agus scéimeanna do chomharchumainn a bhfuil innealra breise á cheannach acu i dtreo go bhféadfar an leas is fearr a bhaint as &ldquo;Pacáiste an Iarthair&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh méaduithe pá a cheadaíodh i rith na bliana do ghráid áirithe sa státseirbhís san áireamh sa mheastachán bunaidh i dtús na bliana agus is iad atá i gceist anois sa tsuim bhreise atá ag teastáil d'fho-mhírcheann A.  Maidir le costais taistil agus costais theagmhasacha, is amhlaidh atá gá le soláthar breise do mhéaduithe a ceadaíodh i rith na bliana i rátaí míleáiste agus liúntais chothaithe agus ar chostais theagmhasacha áirithe a thit ar Vóta na bliana seo &mdash; seachas ar Vóta na bliana seo caite amhail mar a bhíothas ag súil leis.</P>
    <P>Is í seo an chéad uair domsa ag lorg airgid do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus tá áthas orm gur airgead do thithe Gaeltachta is mó atá i gceist.  Is maith an comhartha é go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bhíonn glaoch mór ar na deontais tithíochta: is comhartha é go bhfuil deiseanna fostaíochta á gcur ar fáil i gcaoi go bhfuil fonn ar dhaoine fanacht sa Ghaeltacht agus a gclann a thógáil ansin.  Ina <Col N="1145" /> theannta sin cuidíonn tithe maithe le muintir na Gaeltachta ó thaobh na tuarasóireachta: bíonn deis acu cur lena dteacht isteach trí chuairteoirí a choinneáil.</P>
    <P>Aithnítear go forleathan gurb í an Ghaeltacht foinse agus tobar ár dteanga agus ár gcultúir agus táimid faoi chomaoin ag na daoine a chaomhnaigh an chuid is luachmhaire dár n-oidhreacht dúinn.  Ba mhaith liomsa go gcuirfí go mór le líon na gcuairteoirí a bhfuil fíor spéis acu sa Ghaeilge a bhíonn ag tarraingt ar an nGaeltacht mar táim cinnte go bhfuil sé sin ar cheann de na bealaí is fearr chun an teanga a chaomhnú agus a chur chun cinn.  Is mian liom glacadh leis an deis seo lena dhearbhú go ndéanfaidh mé féin mo dhícheall ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge araon.</P>

      <P>Seo é an chéad ócáid oifigiúil sa Dáil seo go raibh deis agam comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht a thoghadh nó a ainmniú mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus guím chuile rath air cé chomh fada agus a bheidh sé mar Aire.  Is cosúil le cuid againn nach ró-fhada a leanas sé sin.  Níl sé i gceist agam cur i gcoinne an Mheastacháin Fhorlíontach ach amháin a rá go gcreidim gurb é seo an chéad Aire a tháinig isteach sa Dáil agus nár chuir an locht ar an té a chuaigh roimhe de bharr drochbhainistíochta ins an rannog Stáit.  Tá áthas orm gur mar sin atá an cás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cé nach bhfuil sé i gceist agam cur in a choinne tá roinnt mhaith pointí gur mhaith liom a luadh agus gur mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire fúthu.  Ar dtús tá £175,000 san Meastachán Forlíontach seo do thithe Gaeltachta agus sílim go gcruthaíonn sé sin go bhfuil an-chall ar dheontais do thithe nua, ach cuireann sé aníontas orm nach bhfuil, cuir i gcás, an t-ardú níos mó go mór mhór nuair a chuireann tú i gcomórtas é leis na rudaí a ghealladh roimh an toghachán.  Cuir i gcás, gealladh ag an am sin go mbeadh £1,000 de ardú ar an deontas atá ann faoi láthair.  Gealladh freisin go n-ardófaí deontas Ghaeltachta go £6,000 dóibh siúd a bhí ag ceannach teach don chéad <Col N="1146" /> uair agus dúradh freisin ag an am go mbeadh an deontas do thithe móra &mdash; is é sin tithe a bheadh níos mó ná é sin a bheadh ceaduithe faoi scéim an £1,000 atá ag an Roinn Comhshaoil go mbeadh sé níos so-lúbtha dóibh siúd a d'fhág an Ghaeltacht agus a d'fhill ar an nGaeltacht ó thíortha thar lear agus atá anois pósta le duine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a thoil aige nó aice.  Cuireann sé iontas orm mar sin nach bhfuil ach £175,000 ins an Meastachán Forlíontach seo agus tuigim as sin nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire ná ag an Rialtas na gealltanais sin a chomhlíonadh.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach an mbeidh sé i gceist acu iad sin a chomhlíonadh san ath-bhliain.  Creidim féin de bharr an ghanntanas airgid a deirtear linn atá ann agus go mbeidh sé níos measa an chéad bliain eile ná mar atá faoi láthair, nach gcomhlíonfar na gealltanais sin.</P>
    <P>Anois faoi scéimeanna, tá sé luaite ag an Aire anseo gur mhaith leis tithe na Gaeltachta a bheith réidh do chuairteoirí agus do dhuine a bheadh ag tarraingt isteach ar an nGaeltacht agus suim acu san Ghaeilge féin.  Tá mé cinnte anois go bhfuil oiread measa ag an Aire ar mhná tí na Gaeltachta a choinníonn scoláirí Ghaeltachta agus atá agam féin.  Cuireann sé iontas orm nach bhfuil méadú deontas ins an mheastachán forlíontach seo le haghaidh an deontais do mhná tí a ardú go £3 bunaithe ar chostais 1981 mar a gealladh, arís roimh an toghachán. Fuair mise go leor íde béil ó mhná na Gaeltachta agus go háirithe ó mhná tí Chonamara de bharr nár thug mé ach ardú, mar thug siad air, suarach ag an am dóibhsean ach ba ardú é.  Nuair a fuair siad gealltanas, ní ón Aire atá ann faoi láthair ach ó chuid dá chuid comrádaithe i nGaillimh Thiar go n-ardófaí an deontas sin go £3 tar éis don Chomhrialtas teacht i gcumhacht, tá mé cinnte go bhfuil andíomá ar na mná tí céanna sin nach bhfuil an gealltanas sin á chomhlíonadh.  Luadhadh freisin roimh an toghachán go n-ardófaí deontas scoil do pháistí scoile ó £10 go scór punt agus go gcuirfí an bhéim ar líofacht teanga.  An dara chuid den abairt sin &ldquo;cuirfear an bhéim ar líofacht teanga&rdquo;, cuireann sé sin an-iontas orm mar ba mhaith liom a fháil amach <Col N="1147" /> ón Aire an gcreideann sé féin faoi láthair nach gcuireann oifigigh de chuid Roinn na Gaeltachta a théann thart ag cur scrúdú ar pháistí scoile cé acu an ar scoil a chuireann siad an scrúdú nó ina mbaile féin, an creideann sé nach gcuireann na h-oifigigh sin go leor béime ar líofacht teanga, mar nuair a bhí mise mar Aire do b'shin ceann des na rudaí a chur mé béim aír leis an hoifigigh ná gur ceart béim a chur ar líofacht na teanga féin ag na páistí.  Tá a fhios agam nuair a bhí mise ann gur déanadh é sin, agus ba mhaith liom tuairim an Aire a fháil faoi anois.</P>
    <P>Deireann an tAire go bhfuil na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil soláthar breise á chur ar fáil dóibh ar dtús in a scéimeanna uisce a mbeidh deontais ar fáil dóibh ó FEOGA agus ansin in a scéimeanna do chomharchumainn. D'fhéadfaimid labhairt anseo ar feadh seachtaine ar chúrsaí chomharchumannachais san nGaeltacht agus tá go leor ráite ina thaobh cheana agus tá mé cinnte go ndeirfear go leor amach anseo. Nuair a bhí mise mar Aire chuir mé ar bun comhchoiste eadar-rannóg le cúrsaí comharchumann na Gaeltachta ar fad a scrúdú.  Cuireadh an coiste ar bun, chuaigh an coiste thart agus chasadar le bainistíocht agus le coistí na gcomharchumann ar fud na tíre ar fad.  Tuigim go raibh tuairisc an choiste sin ar fáil don Aire díreach tar éis dó theacht isteach mar Aire Ghaeltachta.  Níl tada cloiste agamsa nó ag aon bhainisteoir d'aon chomharchumann nó ag pobal na Gaeltachta ná ag aon duine eile ó shin faoi ceard a tharla do thuarascáil na gcomharchumann seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire an bhfuil sé i gceist aige an tuarascáil seo a fhoilsiú go hoifigiúil.  Má tá, nach gceapfá go bhfuil sé ag tógáil an-achar ó mhí Meithimh nó tús mí Iúil seo caite go dtí inniu beagnach an Nollaig anois, an tuarascáil a fhoilsiú.  An bhfuil sé i gceist aige é a fhoilsiú go hoifigiúil.  An bhfuil sé i gceist aige rud níos tábhachtaí a dhéanamh, é a phlé le bainisteoirí na gcomharchumann ar fud na tíre, mar siad san ar ndóigh an dream a bhéas thíos nó thuas leis an tuarascáil sin agus leis na moltaí atá sa tuarascáil féin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Tuigeann an tAire, tá mé cinnte, cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá comharchumainn in aon cheanntar Ghaeltachta.  I mo thuairimse de, tá níos mó tábhachta go minic ag baint leis an gcomharchumann má tá sé á rith go maith agus á bhainistiú go maith tá níos mó tábhachta ag baint leis ó thaobh pobal na Gaeltachta de agus dul chun chinn cheantair beag Gaeltachta, ná mar atá le haon mhonarcha is cuma an mhonarcha eachtrannach atá ann nó monarcha áitiúil. Creidim mar sin gur ceart béim i bhfad níos mó a chur ar bhun-chloch tábhachta agus bun-chloch a leanas a chur faoi na gcomharchumainn atá againn ar fud na Gaeltachta ar fad.  Creidim féin, mar shampla, go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go rachadh Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta i gcomhairle le, cur i gcás an Chomhairle Oiliúna, AnCO, le cúrsaí oiliúna feiliúnacha a leagan amach agus a chur ar siúl do Chomharchumainn na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhfuil sé sin fíor-thábhachtach agus d'fhéadfaí é sin a rá b'fhéidir faoi níos mó ná Comharchumainn na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe faoi Chomharchumainn na Gaeltachta féin.  Ceapaim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach agus b'fhéidir gurb é sin an áit a bhfuil an briseadh síos ag tarlú faoi láthair, nach bhfuil oiliúint mar ba chóir á cur ar fáil d'ofigigh na gComharchumann seo.</P>
    <P>Creidim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh cineál éigin infheistíocht nó coiste infheistíochta nua ann, chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis na comharchumainn, mar sílim gurb é an deacracht is mó atá ag Comharchumainn na Gaeltachta&mdash;b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in áiteanna eile taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht freisin, ach go háirithe táimid ag caint ar na Gaeltachtaí&mdash;ná nach mbíonn siad in ann oiread scair-shealbhóirí a fháil agus ba mhaith leo taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht féin. Tá sé i bhfad ró éasca ag scair shealbhóir a rá le bainisteoir nó le coiste comharchumainn: &ldquo;tá tú ag fáil deontas ón Rialtas, ó Roinn na Gaeltachta, ar an lámh amháin, agus ar an lámh eile tá tú ag fáil deontas ó Údarás na Gaeltachta; cen fáth go gcuirfinnse mo lámh i mo phóca agus go dtabharfainn tuilleadh airgid duit?&rdquo; Credim gurb b'shin an áit go <Col N="1149" /> bhfuil an briseadh síos is mó faoi láthair agus go gcaithfimid comhlacht infheistíochta do na chomharchumainn a bheadh bunaithe idir an Roinn Airgeadais, Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, comhlacht infheistíochta de shaghas éigin, a chuirfeadh an córas airgid do na comharchumainn ar bhun-chloch seasta.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin faoi láthair tá na comharchumainn, mar a déarfá, ag titim idir dhá stól.  Tá cuid amháin de obair na gComharchumann a thagann go díreach faoi obair Roinn na Gaeltachta féin, agus caitheann siad plé agus déileáil le Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Ansin, tá cuid eile de obair na gComharchumann a thagann go díreach faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta. Mar a deirim, tá siad ag titim idir dhá stól.  Ní dóigh liom i ndáiríre, agus ceapaim go bhféadfainn é seo a rá go fírinneach, go mbíonn aon bhainisteoir chomharchumainn nó aon choiste fiú amháin ag troid le Roinn na Gaeltachta féin ach bíonn troid seasta fíochmhar idir iad féin agus Údarás na Gaeltachta go minic.  Sílimse go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá bhféadfá a rá anseo amach faoi na comharchumainn, bídís faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta go hiomlán nó bídis faoin Údarás go hiomlán, ach ná bíodh sé mar atá sé faoi láthair nach bhfuil a fhios acu cá bhfuil siad.  Sílim go mbeadh sé tábhachtach dá bhféadfaimid eárnach de chineál éigin a dhéanamh ar an údarás pé acu gurb é ag Údarás na Gaeltachta a bheadh an t-údarás sin no ag Roinn na Gaeltachta féin, mar a dúirt mé.</P>
    <P>Maidir le comhchoiste na gComharchumann, sílim mar gheall ar an deacrachtaí a bhí ag na comharchumainn ar fud na tíre, gur chuireadar go leor dá gcuid pointí i láthair an chomhchoiste seo ar an tuiscint go bhfeicfidís féin céard a bheadh sa tuarascáil, go bhfeicfeadh an pobal ceard a bhí sa tuarascáil, go mbeadh fhios acu cén áit a raibh siad ag titim síos, más ó thaobh bainistíochta dhe nó ó aon taobh eile agus go gcuirfí ar bhun-chloch seasta airgead uainn do na comharchumainn ar an gcéad dul síos agus ansin bainistíocht agus oiliúint an dream a bheadh i bhfeighil na gcomharchumann féin.</P>
    <P>Níl aon tagairt in óráid an Aire do <Col N="1150" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta agus níl aon tagairt ach oiread ins an Mheastachán Forlíontach do Údarás na Gaeltachta, ach tá tagairt san óráid faoi dheiseanna fostaíochta atá á gcur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta le fonn a chur orthu fanacht sa Ghaeltacht agus a gclann a thógáil ansin.  Cinnte is de bharr go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ann agus go raibh Gaeltarra ann le blianta roimhe sin go bhfuil na deiseanna fostaíochta seo anois ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta ina gceantair féin.  Níl a fhios agam cén mheas atá ag an Aire atá ann faoi láthair ar Údarás na Gaeltachta nó an bhfuil sé sásta go bhfuil a gcuid oibre á déanamh acu mar ba chóir, ach sílim go bhfuil sé scannalach go mbeadh cinnlínte á dtabhairt do Theachta Dála a bhaineann ní le páirtí an Aire ach leis an bpáirtí atá i gcumhacht leis, ar cheann de pháipéir áitiúla na Gaeltachta <i>Amárach,</i> tá seachtain nó coicís ó shin ann, agus an teideal a bhí air ná &ldquo;Caimiléireacht san Údarás&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Déarfaidh daoine nach bhfuil éinne ag léamh an pháipéir sin ach pobal na Gaeltachta. Tá i bhfad níos mó ná sin á léamh. Tá i bhfad níos mó de iriseorí na tíre ag léamh an pháipeir Ghaeltachta sin, agus creidimse go bhfuil sé scannalach go ndéarfadh aon duine atá ina bhall den Teach seo go bhfuil caimiléireacht ar bun in eagras Stáit, eagras a tháinig as chomhchoiste na n-eagras sa Teach seo, eagras a bhfuil an tAire, Aire na Gaeltachta féin freagrach as, eagras atá ag dul amach ar fud an domhain agus ag iarraidh an tír seo a dhíol agus ag iarraidh tionsclóirí domhanda a mhealladh isteach le cur fúthu sa Ghaeltacht, agus eagras atá ag iarraidh tionsclóirí maithe de chuid na hÉireann féin a mhealladh go dtí na Gaeltachtaí le tionscail agus fostaíocht a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith scannalach go leigfí don cheannlíne sin dul ar fud na tíre agus ar fud an domhain, tá mé cinnte, freisin.  Chuir sé iontas oraimse nár léigh mé in aon áit gur shéan Aire na Gaeltachta an ceannlíne seo.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé séanta ag an Údarás féin ach sílim, ó tharla gurb é an tAire an duine a bhfuil freagracht air sa Dáil don Údarás sin, gur ceart dó é a shéanadh nó a rá go bhfuil an fhírinne ann.  Bheadh <Col N="1151" /> an-imní oraimse mar dhuine Ghaeltachta agus mar dhuine a bhí mar Aire na Gaeltachta cheana go mbeadh aon fhírinne san ráiteas sin.  Ba mhaith liom tuairimí an Aire a fháil agus mura mbeadh deis aige freagra a thabhairt air ins an Dáil tráthnóna, tá súil agam go nglacfaidh sé leis an deis go poiblí in áit éigin leis an ceannlíne sin a shéanadh go láidir. Rachadh sé chun donais agus chun dochair do phobal na Gaeltachta dá ligfí leanúint do sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí go leor pointí agus ní bheidh deis agam plé leo súid ar theastaigh uaim a ardú, ach ceann amháin acu ná an gheallúint a tugadh roimh an toghchán go gcuirfí coiste faoi leith ar bun chun an réim ghríosaithe atá le fáil ag tionscloirí faoi láthair a scrúdú agus go ndéanfaí na deontais seo níos so-lúbtha len iad a chur in oiriúint do fhorbairt úsáid achmhainní nádúrtha na Gaeltachta.  Má táimid ag caint ar chúrsaí tionsclaíochta sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;agus tá sé ráite agamsa le fada agus ag go leor daoine eile freisin sa Teach seo ba cheart dúinn bheith ag díriú aire tionsclóirí agus aire an Údaráis ar thionscail a mbéadh baint díreach acu le achmhainní nádúrtha.  Ach i láthair na huaire séard atá ar bun ag an Údarás ná go bhfuil siad ag cur in aghaidh dul chun cinn achmhainní nádúrtha i gceantair áirithe Ghaeltachta, agus sin i gceantar Chonamara.  An bhfuil sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas gearradh siar ar an méid airgid atá ann do chúrsaí taighde i leith achmhainní nádúrtha agus i leith tionscail a bhfuil baint acu go díreach le hachmhainní nádúrtha?  Agus má tá sé mar pholasaí, sílim gur cheart don Aire cur i gcionne an cinéal sin polasaí go láidir agus go bhfuil sé tábhachtabh go ndéanfadh sé é sin anois.</P>
    <P>Ghlac páirtí Fhine Gael roimh an toghchán go raibh titim i dtarraingt na ngríosuithe tionsclaíochta a bhí ag an Údarás ag an am le hais eagrais fhorbartha eile, agus dúirt siad ag an am go gceadófaí griosuithe breise don eagraíocht sin.  Bhí go leor a bhí luaite ag an am&mdash;cuir i gcás deontais úis a chur ar fáil ar iasachtaí airgid a bheadh riachtanach le tionscail a bhunú nó a fhorbairt. <Col N="1152" /> Bhí scéimeanna deontais a bhí ar fáil ag an am, iad sin a dhéanamh níos so-lúbtha, agus mar a dúirt mé cheana go gcuirfí in oiriúint iad do fhorbairt achmhainní nádúrtha.  Ní fheicim gur tharla aon cheann acu sin.  Bhí sé ráite freisin go mbeadh scéimeanna agus deontais oiliúna agus tréanála á leathnú sa gcaoi go gcuirfí ar chumas pobal na Gaeltachta postanna ard-bhainistíochta a bhaint amach.  Sin deacracht eile atá ag pobal na Gaeltachta faoi láthair, ná i go leor de na tionscail seo atá suite ar fud na Gaeltachta nach iad pobal na Gaeltachta féin atá i mbun ard-bhainistíochta sna comhlachtaí. Sin deacracht atá ann le blianta, mar nach raibh deis ag pobal na Gaeltachta féin an oiliúint a bheadh riachtanach do phostanna ard-bhainistíochta a fháil.  Tá sé tábhachtach go leanfadh an tÚdarás nó Roinn na Gaeltachta nó rannóg Stáit eigin eile lena chinntiú go mbeifí in ann cúrsaí oiliúna a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta agus tá go leor lads óga agus cailíní óga ar fud na Gaeltachta a bheadh go maith in ann postanna ard bhainistíochta a bhaint amach dá gcuirfí an oiliúint ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Sula gcríochnóidh mé, bhí rud amháin i bpáipéar laethúil&mdash;sílim gur i <i>Scéala Éireann</i> a bhí sé&mdash;an tseachtain seo caite faoi chóras Radio na Gaeltachta.  Chuir sé an-imní oraimse agus ar go leor daoine eile sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá a fhios agam nach Aire na Gaeltachta atá freagrach as Radio na Gaeltachta, ach cloisimid ar fad chuile lá san nuacht go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra airgid ag Radio Teilifís Éireann, agus do bhí sé mar pholasaí, cosúil leis an eagraíocht sin i gcónai nuair a bhí deacrachtaí airgid acu, Radio na Gaeltachta a cheannsú agus airgead a bhí curtha ar fáil nó a bhí le cur ar fáil dó, a ghearradh siar.  Tá sé ráite ag duine éigin i Radio Teilifís Éireann go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfaidís Radio na Gaeltachta a bhrú amach as an eagraíocht lárnach agus é a thabhairt do eagraíocht éigin eile Stáit. Níl a fhios agam an rachadh sin chun socair nó chun dochair do Radio na Gaeltachta.

      <P>I have given Deputy Eileen Lemass permission to raise a matter on the Adjournment.  The Deputy has 20 minutes and the Minister has ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House most sincerely for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I would not do so if I was not of the opinion that it is a matter of grave urgency.  Coming up to Christmas seems to be the time <Col N="1154" /> when the problem of battered wives is seen to be more important than at any other time of the year.  As we are coming up to the Christmas season I would like the Minister, in her capacity as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, to do what she can for the women and the children who find themselves in this situation.  This time last year there were 28 women and 90 children staying in the refuge.  It is a sad fact that Christmas time seems to bring an increase in the number of women and children who suffer from violence in their homes.  That is why I am so concerned about this and I regard it as a matter of grave urgency.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to a question of mine on 17 November 1981, said:</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the current problems which Women's Aid is experiencing in finding alternative premises to the refuge at Harcourt Terrace which is no longer suitable for use as a refuge for battered wives and their children.  I am anxious to provide whatever assistance and support I can for the victims of family violence.  In relation to this particular issue, my Department have been in continuous contact with the Eastern Health Board in regard to their efforts to secure a suitable premises for the Women's Aid organisation.  A number of premises have already been under consideration but none has been found suitable so far.</P>
      <P>The Women's Aid group have informed me that in recent times they have found four premises which in their opinion were suitable, the last one being about a week ago when a premises went for auction on 27 November.  The Women's Aid group went to the trouble of getting an architect to look at these premises and inspect them.  They got an architect's report which stated that these premises were in good repair, structurally sound in every way.  The Women's Aid group maintain these premises would have been ideal for them, so I cannot see how the Minister can state that no suitable premises have become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Women's Aid group were unable to get involved in bidding for these premises <Col N="1155" /> because they had no commitment from the Minister that any funds were available to them.  They find themselves in the situation where time and again they are finding a suitable premises, sending an architect to inspect it, but when it comes up for auction they cannot get involved in bidding because they have no commitment from the Department to say they can do so.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a very serious situation and her Department will have to make a decision very quickly.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that those women have alternative ways of solving their problems because they can apply to the courts for barring orders.  Apparently this does not work, because a husband who is barred from the family home can come back at any time and he can kick the door down and got into the house.  The majority of those women are alone in their homes with their children with violent husbands on their doorsteps and no way of contacting the Garda.  What do they do in that situation?  Do they run out into the street?  The majority of those people have not a telephone in their homes. Some of them are living in rural areas and have no telephone or any contact with anybody.  They have to put up with this abuse time and time again.  Even when the Garda are contacted they are very reluctant to interfere.  Even though a woman has gone to the courts and got a barring order, she finds it is not working and she still has the problem of a violent husband in her home.</P>
    <P>I do not like bringing up this subject again because as far as I am concerned it has been debated to death over the last few weeks.  The £9.60 which women at home looking after their children are supposed to get cannot ever be got by any of those women.  None of them will ever be in the situation where they can avail of that money.  I suggest that some of the money it will cost to implement that scheme would be much better used trying to help those women and give the Women's Aid organisation some money to find a refuge for these people.</P>
    <P>Some people might think that this particular topic is not a very serious one and <Col N="1156" /> a lot of men in the community will say that those women deserve it.  It is a very serious problem in our society.  The men who batter their wives are the people who should be treated in time because they are suffering from an ailment.  They may be suffering from alcoholism or something else and they should be treated by psychiatrists.  I believe there should be some law that insists they go for treatment. Women who are battered by their husbands invariably suffer from a nervous breakdown and end up in some mental institution.  They are the people who are seen to be mentally sick.  But in fact it is because of the problems they have had to put up with in their homes that they have had to go in there.  The husbands are never regarded as being mentally sick and nobody ever insists that they go for treatment.  It is a sad state of affairs that a woman who might have to put up with this treatment for all her married life might eventually end up in a mental hospital, where she is the person who is regarded as being unstable, when all the time her husband was the cause of all the problems.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was spokesperson for the Department of Justice she pressed for an improvement in the lot of battered wives and their children.  I sympathise with her dilemma at the moment.  I know she is doing her best, but she will have to try to get a commitment from the Government to do something constructive and quickly for the people in the situation I refer to.  Before I came down to the House I rang the Women's Aid group and I asked them: &ldquo;What is your situation at this particular moment?  Tell me what it is like in your house where you have people staying there during the day but who go to night shelters at night time?&rdquo; Those people have to leave the Women's Aid house in the evenings, because it is a dangerous building since the fire on 7 September.  The women and the children are being farmed out every night to various houses around the city.  They leave the shelters in the morning and they come back to the Women's Aid house during the day.  They sit around in a cold, dilapidated building.</P>
    <P>This is the situation that exists as we <Col N="1157" /> enter the Christmas season.  I asked what was the situation now and I was told that a woman had just arrived from the south with seven children, the eldest of whom was eight years.  I was told they had no place to send her but they were working on it.  She cannot be kept on the premises because the building is dangerous.  The Minister has to do something about this kind of situation.  In this instance a woman travelled 100 miles to Dublin with her seven children.  She had to run from a situation she could not cope with and now she is looking for some place to stay tonight.  Hopefully, somewhere will be found for her before 9 p.m.  The woman in question must have a baby of several months old.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do her best to resolve the situation as soon as possible. We are supposed to be a Christian country but yet we have a situation where mothers are looking for a place for themselves and their children.  I realise I must not become too emotional about this, I must keep the matter in perspective.  I know I must consider the situation rationally. However, when I rang the Womens' Aid organisation this evening and realised the situation that exists now it convinced me that this is an urgent matter that must be resolved immediately.  I ask the Minister to do what she can as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Lemass in her plea that something be done for the unfortunate victims of family violence.  It is very sad for us to hear a Deputy tell us of a situation where a lady with seven children had to come from the south of Ireland to Dublin to find somewhere away from the misery of a violent husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many of us some of the things Deputy Lemass said may come as a surprise. Many of us live in our suburban dwellings, away from the troubles and the trauma of having to live with a violent husband.  From my experience as a Deputy in County Dublin, I know that every day of the week many women are the victims of an alcoholic husband or of a man who brings out his violence not only on his wife but also on his children. <Col N="1158" /> There are many children in this city and throughout the country who are woken and beaten in the middle of the night by a violent father.  As Members of Dáil Éireann, as politicians who are here to legislate and to handle the problems of the people we represent, we cannot close our eyes to the reality of the situation.  As Deputy Lemass said, we cannot let another Christmas come when this problem gets worse because of increased drinking.  We cannot let another Christmas come and go and have these unfortunate women and children with nowhere to stay.</P>
    <P>The women currently running Women's Aid are a group of dedicated people.  Some of them are professional women, many of them are social workers and there are many voluntary workers. They are doing the job that we as politicians, and particularly the Government, should be doing.  We should have somewhere for these unfortunate women and children to go during the day or night whenever they are thrown out of their homes.  Unfortunately at the moment we have no such premises.  All of this is because as a country and as a Legislature we have not faced up realistically and compassionately to the problem of marriage breakdown.  This is part of the tragedy of what happens in a very unhappy marriage situation.</P>
    <P>Recently I met some of the women from Women's Aid and they described to me some of the scenes Deputy Lemass described to the House.  I was horrified to think that following the fire in September these women have to be taken away from the dangerous building at night. That building may cause as many deaths as occurred in the Stardust tragedy. Then, there may well be another outcry and people may say there should not have been anybody in the building, but there is nowhere else for the unfortunate women to go.  All that the workers in Women's Aid want is to get a commitment from the Minister that she will provide a fund of £200,000 should Women's Aid find a suitable premises.  Deputy Lemass has said that a number of premises have come on the market.  The architects working for Women's Aid have <Col N="1159" /> indicated that the premises are suitable and could be refurbished.  All that is required is a commitment in writing from the Minister and her Department to say that if the Women's Aid people go to an auction and buy a building the Department will stand over the transaction and pay for it.</P>
    <P>We have received many oral commitments. I know the Minister is very concerned about the situation but it is little use merely to wax eloquent about our concern.  There is no point in saying something should be done.  All the Minister has to do is to allocate approximately £200,000 of State funds.  That is not a lot to ask for out of a current budget.  This money is needed for the unfortunate victims of family violence.  If these unfortunate people are not looked after the problem will get worse.  The women will end up in psychiatric hospitals and the children will have to be taken into care.  It will cost the State far more money if we do not give a commitment here today to allocate the £200,000 which the Women's Aid group have requested.</P>
    <P>The Women's Aid group told me of the hundreds of married women who have passed through their premises in the past eight years and of the thousands of children who have gone through their hands, far more than would go through the average primary school.  It is sad to think that in a so-called Christian caring society where we spend so much time trying to prove to our friends in Northern Ireland that we have an understanding of their problems, that here we have many married women, some of them younger than me, who have to leave their homes and have literally to beg on the streets for somewhere to stay.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to give a commitment in writing this evening or tomorrow morning to the dedicated women, many of them voluntary workers, currently running Women's Aid and who are providing a service the State should provide. They are doing a wonderful job and we must give them some reason to carry on. If they have to knock on a closed door all the time they will give up.  I wonder then <Col N="1160" /> what will happen to the unfortunate women and children.</P>
    <P>It is a traumatic experience for any woman to be beaten by a man, particularly her husband.  It is even more traumatic when young children are beaten. When that woman has to pack her bags and leave home it adds to the problem and it is even worse when she has nowhere to go.  If she is well off she can afford to rent a flat or at least go into rented accommodation for a few nights but most women do not have their own sources of income.  When they are beaten up and thrown out of their homes in many cases they literally do not have a penny in their pockets.  Many of them have to borrow the fare to get to the Women's Aid centre in Harcourt Street.  I met a taxi man who told me that last week on the south side of Dublin he met a woman and two children on the side of the road wanting to go to the Women's Aid premises. She did not know the name of the organisation.  All she knew was that somewhere in Dublin there was a place for a battered wife to go to.  The taximan took her there but if she had not met a friendly taximan she would have no-one to bring her because she did not have the fare to get to her destination.</P>
    <P>I want a commitment from the Minister that she will honour the great work done by women in Women's Aid and recognise the serious situation which many women are in as a result of family violence.  I want the Minister to prove she is a caring Minister and that the Government are committed to helping these people and will provide some help to these women and ensure they are looked after by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Lemass and Deputy Harney of my commitment in this area.  That commitment goes back through my public life, as it probably does in the case of the two Deputies opposite.  As women Members we are possibly more aware, because of approaches made to us, of the real problem that exists in this area.  It is a problem which intensifies as the season of Christmas approaches.  It is a problem which, <Col N="1161" /> while intense in Dublin, is not confined to Dublin.  I know it exists in Cork, Limerick and throughout the State.  I acknowledge that but for the work done by other women on a voluntary basis we would have a very serious problem in this area.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Lemass said, barring orders are not the answer in that they do not provide for the immediate needs of those who are victims of violence.  I am sympathetically disposed to the plea being made to me this evening by both Deputies. It is one that has been made to me by Women's Aid and by many members of my party.  It is an issue which an increasing number of Deputies are becoming aware of.  It is a pity that there are only three women in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of assistance is concerned, I am well aware of the problem, because Women's Aid have brought it to my attention.  I am dealing with it as sympathetically as possible.  Deputy Lemass mentioned that a number of houses had come on the market which were considered structurally sound.  It is my advice, and I take it, that a house which is structurally sound is not sufficient. A house must be adapted to the special needs that exist in the case of women who flee from their homes and seek a refuge in short or long-term.  One requires planning permission to adapt a house.  This can be a tedious, long drawn out process, as both the Deputies will know from their experience in other areas.  My concern is that whatever my Department do to assist in resolving the problem it will be something that can be put into operation in the immediate future.  We would solve the problem before Christmas if this were possible.</P>
      <P>Nowadays in society refuges are often objected to by people living in the area. An objection could result in a long delay if planning permission had to be applied for.  It is my advice that the houses which came on the market to date were not suitable for the immediate purpose for which they were required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a new problem.  It is one which I have been conscious of throughout my political life.  I raised this question <Col N="1162" /> with the present leader of Fianna Fáil as far back as October 1977.  There was a problem then.  It was something that neither Deputy Haughey nor his successor as Minister for Health could solve immediately. We came to office a short while ago and I object to the problem being presented to me as something that arose for the first time now and that I am expected to solve.  It is a priority with me that I should solve it, but it is a problem that has been with us for too long.  I hope to solve the problem on a national basis and in that context to relieve the immediate problem that exists in Dublin.  I want to ensure that the money will be well spent.</P>
    <P>The premises which so far have come on the market were not suitable.  We would have to apply for planning permission. This could result in long delays and would not meet the immediate problem. There is a onus on me to make sure that when I allocate funds for this they are allocated in such a way as to meet the immediate needs that exist.  We are in a year of grave financial stringency, far greater than was the situation through the years when this problem was with us. I am committed to resolve the problem because I am keenly aware of the problems of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke about the sad plight of women commuting between one refuge and another day and night.  I do not want to see this continue.  We are considering our Estimates at present. There may be other pressing issues in the minds of other people but, to me, there is no more pressing issue that the sight of a homeless woman and her children. There are other issues for which capital is scarce at present.  We will know shortly what our situation is.  I hope to be in a position to relieve the plight of people about whom we have spoken this evening. I would not be discharging my function as Minister, bearing in mind the case that has been made to me, the urgency of the situation and my knowledge of it, if I did not do something about it.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that what we do is in the best interests of the organisation providing the service for the women and children concerned.  I assure Deputies of <Col N="1163" /> my and the Department's day by day interest in this problem.  Architects in the Department have inspected some of the buildings concerned.  We are in consultation with the health boards about the problem.  This is a priority with me and, bearing in mind the great urgency of the <Col N="1164" /> problem, I hope it will be resolved in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The local authorities' proposals for these three schemes must be considered in the context of the overall amount of capital available for sanitary services schemes and the need to provide finance for the large number of fully approved schemes in progress or getting to construction throughout the country and for which adequate finance must be provided. I am not, at present, in a position to say when approval of the relevant contract documents will issue to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There are no housing schemes from Galway local authorities before my Department awaiting approval.  Under devolved procedures, local authorities may build schemes of up to 60 houses without my prior sanction, subject to agreement on unit cost figures, compliance with general recommendations as regards acquisition of sites, standards etc.; the house plans and site plans being cleared with my Department's inspector for the area; and keeping within the available capital allocation.</P>

        <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> There has been no undue delay in preparing a plan for the future development of Rossaveal Harbour.</P>
      <P>This harbour became the responsibility of my Department in June last when an order was made declaring it to be a fishery harbour centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development plan for the harbour needs careful planning in both the short and long term interests of the fishing industry in the area and must provide for onshore and offshore facilities to cater for the landing, marketing and processing of the catch as well as the servicing of the fleet.  In preparing such plan regard must be had to factors such as land and sea topography, land and sea approaches and the effect of planned development on the local community.  For these reasons comprehensive <Col N="1117" /> surveys of the area are necessary before the most satisfactory plan can be decided upon.</P>
    <P>Work on the preparation of a development plan for the harbour has been proceeding since June last but in the light of the considerations referred to earlier its finalisation will inevitably take some time.  In the meantime, some works requiring urgent attention, such as the provision of lighting, toilet and car parking facilities, have been put in hands.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been paid disability benefit by my Department from February 1967 to April 1981, when it was ascertained that he had been last insurably employed in the United Kingdom prior to the commencement of his illness.  Accordingly, his claim was transferred, from 4 April 1981, to the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Security, as, under EEC regulations, the country of last employment is responsible for payment of sickness benefit.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries the British Ministry forwarded to my Department the amount of sickness benefit due under their legislation to the claimant since 1 April 1973, the date from which the EEC regulations came into effect.
