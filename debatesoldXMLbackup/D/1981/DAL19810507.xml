      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is, as the Long Title puts it, to make further provision for the protection of a spouse and any children whose safety or welfare requires it because of the conduct of the other spouse.  It does this by making three important changes in the present law relating to barring orders.  These orders exclude a spouse from the family home, usually because of violence.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should first indicate what the three changes are.  Section 3 of the Bill will enable a spouse, while awaiting the outcome of an application for a barring order, to obtain an injunction-type order, called a protection order.  Breach of this order, like breach of a barring order, will be a criminal offence.  Second, section 7 provides a power of arrest without warrant for breach of either a barring order or protection order.  Third, if a person charged with breach of such an order is given bail and then commits one or more such breaches while on bail, any sentences of imprisonment imposed under section 8 will have to be served consecutively.</P>
      <P>Other provisions of the Bill deal with such matters as giving the courts greater flexibility in dealing with applications for barring orders and providing for expeditious hearings in barring order cases and other improvements that experience has shown to be necessary.  I shall refer to these other provisions later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The barring order procedure was first provided by section 22 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, which was welcomed on all sides of the House as providing protection for spouses and children in cases of domestic violence.  Since the passing of the 1976 Act, there has been an opportunity of reviewing its operation.  I have received various representations, mainly from some women's organisations, that their experience suggested that the system needed strengthening.  Initially, it was thought the problems might be <Col N="2385" /> solved by a more active involvement of the Garda Síochána in the issuing of summonses for breaches of barring orders, and instructions on those lines were issued to the Force by the Garda authorities. Unfortunately, while an improvement was achieved in this way, it has been found not to be enough and that is why we have this Bill now.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of the Bill, there have been consultations with the President of the District Court and district justices with experience in this area: it is, of course, the District Court that handles the bulk of the barring order applications. The Garda authorities have also been consulted and account has been taken of recent developments in England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill have emerged as a result of this review.  I think I can say that they take into account as far as reasonably possible the various helpful comments and suggestions made by the persons and bodies concerned.  I think it better not to single out any particular group or individuals for special mention, but I am grateful to all of them.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the three main provisions I have mentioned, the first of them being the protection order. This is a new type of order provided for in section 3.  It can be made in favour of a spouse who has applied for a barring order where the court is of opinion that the safety or welfare of the applicant or of any child of the family requires it.  The protection order itself is an order in the nature of an interim injunction directing the other spouse not to use or threaten to use violence against the applicant spouse or a child, or molest them or put them in fear.  The court may make an order at the time of the application for the barring order or at any time before the case is heard and whether or not the summons in relation to the application has been served on the other spouse. Once the application for the barring order is disposed of the protection order will cease to have effect but, if a barring order is made, it may contain a prohibition to the same effect as the protection order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2386" /> The point may be made that a protection order is no more than an order to observe the law or, rather, not to break it by using or threatening violence on the other partner.  The answer is that it is a very solemn warning to the spouse concerned. It creates a situation where a breach of it constitutes a criminal offence and renders the offender liable to arrest without warrant and to heavy penalties.</P>
    <P>The proposed protection order is a response &mdash; I think an effective response &mdash; to representations that a spouse who has been assaulted would remain at risk for some weeks until the court made a decision on the application for the barring order.  Experience has shown that some form of protection, some form of court intervention, is often necessary at this stage, bearing in mind that an application for a barring order is usually made only when the spouse concerned has suffered violence over a fairly long period.</P>
    <P>To grant an interim barring order in that situation would be open to most serious objection.  It would, in fact, amount to an eviction order without notice.  What the protection order will do is to direct the other spouse, as I have said, not to use or threaten to use violence or molest or put in fear.  The existence of such an order, coupled with the criminal sanctions that will attach to it, should effectively deter violent spouses from committing further acts pending the hearing of the application for the barring order and will, perhaps, help to make some of them realise the seriousness of their conduct.</P>
    <P>The second important change is the power of arrest without warrant being conferred on the Garda by section 7 for breach of either a barring order or a protection order.  This provision has often been advocated as the cure for any shortcomings in the barring order procedure. I think that by now we can say that experience has shown it to be a necessary provision but it would not, by itself, be a solution.  Indeed, without any other provision, it could make matters worse.  For one thing, arrested people can normally get bail and might very well resort to violence again.  The fact that <Col N="2387" /> they had been arrested might make them more prone to commit further acts of violence.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it was necessary to provide some deterrent against breaches of the others committed while on bail.  One possibility was to provide an increased penalty for an offence committed by a spouse while released on bail.  Another was to make a sentence for such an offence consecutive on any sentence for the original offence or, perhaps, to have both an increased penalty and consecutive sentences in these cases.  Minimum penalties were ruled out as these are open to objection on a number of grounds.  Of the two other options available, it was considered that a term of imprisonment substantially greater than the existing maximum term of six months would not be justified for breach of a barring order or protection order, even when committed while on bail, bearing in mind that if there is bodily harm a more serious charge &mdash; triable on indictment &mdash; may be brought and that that would be the correct course where the facts warranted it.  The solution adopted in section 8, that is that any sentence of imprisonment for a breach committed while on bail will be consecutive, is, I believe, the right response to the needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>Section 8(2) caters for the possibility that a spouse may commit more than one breach while on bail.  It removes the limit of twelve months on the aggregate of consecutive sentences that may be imposed by the District Court.  While I hope that the provisions of section 8 will not have to be invoked very often, if at all, I believe that their existence will be justified by the strong deterrent effect they will undoubtedly have.</P>
    <P>I realise that there will be some concern at the extension of the power of arrest without warrant to a breach of an order given in what are basically civil proceedings.  This applies also to the proposed mandatory imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed on bail.  I understand that concern, but in my considered view these provisions are essential to ensure respect for an compliance with barring orders and protection <Col N="2388" /> orders and the proper protection of spouses and children from domestic violence.</P>
    <P>I should now like to menton some of the other provisions of the Bill.  Two of them have been taken over from the Courts Bill which has now been passed by both Houses.  The more important of them is, I think, that allowing the District Court to make barring orders for a period of up to 12 months, instead of up to three months, as at present.  This provision has already been approved by this House and I do not think the House will want me to reopen the discussion.  It is a very important power but then so also is the long-established power of the District Court to impose sentences of imprisonment of up to twelve months.</P>
    <P>The other provision taken over from the Courts Bill transfers the existing High Court jurisdiction in relation to barring orders to the Circuit Court, as recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  The transfer is effected by the definitions section (section 1) which defines &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; as the Circuit Court and District Court only.  It will help applicants for barring orders to get speedy redress.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of ancillary provisions designed to improve the efficiency of the present procedures.  For example, the courts are being given greater flexibility in dealing with applications for barring orders.  Section 2 (2) provides that a barring order may be made subject to exceptions and conditions, such as those giving limited access for visits to the children in the family home or for paying a short visit for a particular purpose such as collecting personal possessions.  This flexibility is particularly necessary having regard to the extension to twelve months of the maximum period for which a barring order may be made by the District Court. Again, it is being made clear by section 2 (6) that a spouse can get a barring order even though not residing in the family home because of the conduct of the other spouse.  Moreover, section 12 ensures that proceedings must be taken in the circuit or district where the applicant spouse resides or where the family home <Col N="2389" /> is situate.  Accordingly, a spouse who has had to leave the court district where the family home is situate can apply for the barring order in whatever district that spouse has gone to live after leaving the family home.  At present the spouse can take proceedings in the new district only if ordinarily resident there, and ordinary residence might be difficult to establish for a spouse temporarily living in a refuge or with friends.  In section 13 provision is made for making rules of court to enable barring order cases to be heard expeditiously and for dispensing with the statutory requirements for service of documents in such cases.</P>
    <P>I think I should mention also the special provision made in section 4 regarding the taking effect of barring orders and protection orders.  The fact that a power of arrest without warrant is being provided makes it essential that a person liable to be arrested should be aware of the existence of the order.  In the case of barring orders, both parties will normally have been present at the hearing and no problem of notification will arise.  Sometimes a barring order is granted in the absence of the offending spouse and, of course, this will almost invariably be the case on the grant of a protection order. Section 4, therefore, provides that a barring order or protection order will take effect when the spouse against whom it is directed is notified.  It further provides that oral communication to that spouse by or on behalf of the applicant spouse of the fact that a barring order or a protection order has been made, together with production of a copy of the order, will be taken to be sufficient notification. Moreover, section 5 provides that the court shall cause a copy of the order to be given or sent as soon as practicable to both spouses and to the local Garda station but non-compliance is not to affect the validity of the order.  These provisions are all designed to ensure that the powers of arrest will be invoked only when the spouse concerned has been made personally aware of the fact that the order has been made.  A further safeguard is that the power of arrest may be exercised by the Garda only on a complaint by or on <Col N="2390" /> behalf of the applicant spouse.  This is to cover the possibility of a reconciliation having been reached in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I am dealing with these ancillary provisions, I might mention that section 6, in addition to making breaches of barring orders and protection orders an offence, also makes it an offence for a spouse to refuse to permit the applicant spouse or a child to enter and remain in the family home or to do anything to prevent them entering and remaining there.  This situation might arise where the spouse and child in question, after having had to leave the family home, would find, after a barring order had been made, that they could not enter it because the locks had been changed.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter to which I would like to draw attention.  It arises on section 14 (1) of the Bill, which provides that proceedings under the Bill shall be heard otherwise than in public.  This provision corresponds to section 25 of the 1976 Act, which applies not only to proceedings for barring orders but also to maintenance proceedings.  It has now come to notice that in some cases prosecutions for breaches of barring orders have also been heard in private and that there are differing views on whether the 1976 Act, when it speaks of proceedings under that Act being heard otherwise than in public, is referring only to proceedings relating to barring orders or maintenance orders or whether it applies to criminal proceedings for breach of barring orders as well.  Clearly, I cannot say authoritatively or in any formal sense what the intention of the previous Government was in this regard but I understand from the information available in the Department that there is nothing to suggest that it was ever the intention to introduce such a radical change in the criminal law as would be involved in having criminal proceedings under that Act heard in private.  Moreover, the Family Home Protection Act, passed later in 1976, although also creating a criminal offence, confines court hearings in private to civil proceedings under that Act to which both of the spouses are parties.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental principle that criminal cases against adults should be heard <Col N="2391" /> in open court.  The only exceptions are cases affecting national security or public morality.  The law does not make exceptions merely because of possible embarrassment to an accused person or a witness. I should make it clear, perhaps, that the matters which give rise to the making of the barring orders or protection orders in question should not ordinarily be relevant to the criminal proceedings for breach of the orders.  The only issue of fact would be whether or not a breach had occurred, that is did the defendant enter the family home in breach of the barring order or, as the case may be, contravene the protection order by using or threatening violence?  Incidentally, I also think that, quite independently of this issue of principle, the fact that criminal proceedings will be in public could itself act as a deterrent to a violent spouse.  I propose, therefore, to move an amendment on Committee Stage which will make it clear that the only proceedings that are to be heard in private under the Bill will be those related to applications for making, varying or discharging barring orders or for making or discharging protection orders.</P>
    <P>Because of the extreme complexity of human relationships and domestic situations, no legislation can be expected to deal satisfactorily with each individual case of domestic violence or discord. Nobody will pretend that the law can by anything more than a contribution to assisting in those cases which have become so serious that the safety or welfare of one of the spouses or of the children requires intervention by the court. I am fully aware that arrest can make reconciliation difficult or even impossible but I am assured by people with long experience in this field that a power of arrest will have real value, both as a deterrent and as a sanction, in many of the situations that now arise.  The hard fact is that by the time a case gets as far as the court there will have been a history of marital discord and probably, to a greater or less extent, of violence.  The court is there as a last resort and, when its jurisdiction is invoked, it has to apply the law.  I know that the courts do not <Col N="2392" /> neglect any possibility of reconciliation and often help by adjourning cases or giving sympathetic advice or admonitions or a mixture of both.  I am very conscious of the value of the marriage counselling being carried out by a number of voluntary agencies.  They are making a tremendous contribution and I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute in this House to their work, but at the end of the day situations arise, here and in every country, where the sanction of the law, even of the criminal law, has to be invoked.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that I hope the Bill will commend itself to Deputies on all sides of the House as a genuine improvement of the existing law, based on practical experience of its operation. I look forward to a constructive debate so that in this area of family law we shall continue to have legislation that is well up to &mdash; indeed in advance of &mdash; the best international standards in relation to the protection of spouses and children from domestic violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill that is before us is in some ways a little like the whole Dáil at present.  It is somehow out of its time, a little less than essentially relevant to the real problems.  But, despite the slight air of unreality which hangs around these portals these days, we will try to deal with what is in front of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let it be clearly said that the Bill is a very minor Bill.  It is a belated attempt to patch up a problem which arose years ago.  It is grandiosely named, and in fact its title is a misnomer.  To call this Bill, which in the normal course of events should be classified as a Bill designed to plug a loophole, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill, 1981, is, to put it mildly, a euphemism.  There is not a scintilla of a suggestion anywhere in the Bill about the protection of children and the essential idea is here, the essential element &mdash; and I hope I am wrong in this &mdash; will not give the protection it is designed to give.  That essential element is the ability of a spouse &mdash; more usually the wife, as we know from experience &mdash; to obtain a pre-emptive order or injunction prior to the barring order <Col N="2393" /> proceedings which in many cases come too late.  It strengthens also the powers of the Garda and removes what we might say was a certain doubt about their capacity to act in terms of arresting somebody who offended against the barring order procedures.  But if we had done a real study of the root problem here, of the problem of a spouse who is violent and abuses his wife &mdash; or indeed in some cases a spouse who abuses her husband &mdash; we would know that if the threat of court proceedings, and indeed the barring order itself, had not been effective until now in some cases, it is extremely unlikely that a timorous wife communicating at the door of her home with her children hiding behind her skirts to an enraged and deranged and irate husband that she had got a protection order would mean that he would go off with his tail between his legs and she would be protected. From that point of view it is a very naive Bill and I have no doubt whatever but that we will be back in this House again trying to deal with the real issues.</P>
    <P>The central element in the Bill is an attempt to give this legal sanction at an earlier stage, and more easily and more readily, to the spouse.  That in itself is a good thing if such legal sanctions were going to work.  However, the nature of family violence is not one that is usually amenable to such a rational, non-emotional, logical approach.  The Bill attempts to plug a loophole in legislation at present on our Statute Book and it arises because of the clear evidence from members of the Judiciary, from voluntary associations working in this field who have been calling for change for years, from individual politicians and members of society and, most of all, from beleagured and brutalised wives of the need for protection in such situations.  I do not think we should distort the overall pattern. It would be wrong if it should go forth from this House that there was a majority of marriages here in which such violence obtained.  It is of course impossible to be scientifically accurate about it, because nobody seems to be bothering to take any statistics except those voluntary agencies to whom the Minister has given credit, though I would wish that the credit <Col N="2394" /> that we all give on these occasions would be supported by a similar sympathetic response when they come to us looking for funds to do the work which they are doing and which nobody else is doing. But that does not happen to the degree that it should happen.</P>
    <P>How serious is violence here in terms of family violence?  AIM, an organisation which has a fine record in tackling this problem, explains some of the difficulties. In the context of what they are saying we should bear in mind that they are dealing only with Dublin city and parts of Dublin county, and there is no reason to believe that this problem is not a national one.  Indeed, what one might call a sociological insight into the nature of the problem might indicate that in some cases there would be reason to believe that certain aspects of the lifestyles of people living in isolation or in loneliness or alienation or in areas where community development is not at a high level would sharpen the possibility of a couple who are not getting on with each other dealing with each other by turning to violence. So this is not just an urban problem.</P>
    <P>I am also a little saddened by the fact that in our legislation to date &mdash; and I believe the Minister is making an effort to try to deal with these issues &mdash; we do not talk about the real problems.  Why is it that our task here today is to seek to give stronger powers of arrest and stronger powers to husbands and wives against each other?  While that may be necessary, the fundamental problem is to try to deal with the reason why that state of affairs has come about.  Any Bill that calls itself the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill should deal with a much wider spectrum of relevant problems than this one does.  This should have been called the Barring Order (Amendment) Bill but it is not that.  If we truly want to protect families &mdash; and I believe we all do &mdash; we should ask ourselves why is it that the counselling services referred to by the Minister in his penultimate paragraph are not better supported.  He talks about being very conscious of the value of the marriage counselling being carried out by a number of voluntary organisations which are <Col N="2395" /> making a tremendous contribution, and we would all join in the tribute paid to them in this House by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we do not analyse why this fundamental marital breakdown is becoming increasingly common?  Is it just that we are now talking more about it?  I believe that it is becoming increasingly common.  Why is that happening?  How can we help marriages in difficulty?  How can we discourage marriages which are likely to founder from taking place &mdash; for example, in the case of very young people who may not be fully aware of the rigours and the demands, emotional and financial, and all the circumstances which point towards difficulty in marriage?  Why do we not try to prevent the horrific situation arising where a wife, who on one day years before held her husband's hand on the altar and said &ldquo;I do&rdquo;, is now being forced to seek the protection of the Garda and the courts against that same man, the father of her children?  To deal with the problem only at that level is wrong.  It is to deal with it in a simplistic, reactionary manner, which of course is unfortunately the way this House works, reacting usually too late and usually with miniscule efforts which are the product of compromise, the product of talking with lobby groups and asking what is the minimum they would accept.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as well as every Deputy in the House, knows that if we really want to help the root problem in this case a much more fundamental, comprehensive and preventive approach to the problem of family violence is necessary.  If we had faced up to the overwhelming evidence and had listened to the demands of people in such families, it is conceivable that the marriage which is now likely to be sundered could be saved?  It is possible we could have listened to the problems, analysed them and answered them to the satisfaction of both parties.  We do not do that.  We rely on the voluntary agencies. Let them come looking for funds to the Government or the State agencies and they go away with pennies.  There should be a major new commitment to marriage counselling and marriage protection <Col N="2396" /> in all its aspects.  That must not be words and cheap gimmicks but must be about providing the resources and the training to do the job.  That is what family law and family protection is really about, not &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; action at the eleventh hour.</P>
    <P>The problem of violence in marriage is a serious one.  I am concerned that one does not give the impression that it happens in every house in every street.  I am sure that is not the case.  However, one cannot but be struck by the increasing evidence of violence.  That violence is of two kinds.  The first violence, and the most common one, is not physical violence. Physical violence is a development of the initial, emotional and psychological violence, the violence of hostility, anger, threat, hate, alienation and being despised, the violence of being economically starved.  It is a fact &mdash; I include myself in this &mdash; that most men have no idea what it costs to run a house and that most women run the house.  I know of many women throughout the country who have no idea what their husbands earn.  I would not wish to change that if they are satisfied and fulfilled in that situation, but there are many women who are expected to rear a family and be fulfilled on an outdated notion of what it costs to do that.  Certain provisions and certain thinking in a document, which is now party policy, produced by Senator Gemma Hussey, is designed to ensure that does not continue.</P>
    <P>The violence of being thrown a few pounds at the end of the week and told to look after the house and the children should also be considered.  Family violence is not only about a drunken husband who comes in and strikes or kicks his wife.  I noticed a case in the papers last week of a husband who, in blind rage, raped his wife.  That is also violence, but we specifically exclude the possibility of that woman taking the same kind of action as a woman who is not that man's wife could.  Let us not pretend to be doing things which we are not doing.  We will have a chance to develop some of those issues in greater depth in the Family Law Bill later today.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the protection of <Col N="2397" /> spouses and children let us not pretend that we are doing things which clearly we are not doing.  We are amending the barring order system because it has failed. Barring orders are a court procedure which in some cases can be delayed for months while the beatings can be administered daily or nightly.  We are doing it because the kind of man or, in a small minority of cases, the kind of woman who indulges in that may well be the person one has no interest in or no respect for the sanction which a barring order is supposed to afford.  Extending that protection to a protection order will not work. There may be cases where it will work, but I would not like to be in the position of the wife who is looking for a new kind of order to protect her.  The fundamental difference between this order and the barring order is that it is a kind of interim injunction.</P>
    <P>The AIM group say that, in 1980, 373 women sought refuge with them and that 26 women and 70 children were living in the refuge constantly throughout the year.  In 1980 that refuge cost £53,000 to run, of which £32,000 came from the Eastern Health Board.  The balance had to be raised by a variety of fund-raising activities.  The organisation are currently carrying a heavy bank overdraft.  So much for ministerial plaudits.  AIM say:</P>
    <P>The level of family violence in Ireland is higher and its causes more complex than is generally understood or believed.  Over the years, the refuge has sheltered women suffering from cuts, bruises, broken bones, ruptured kidneys, burns, electric shocks, miscarriages ... the details of the assaults are usually played down to avoid charges of sensationalism!</P>
    <P>They also say:</P>
    <P>Rape within marriage occurs routinely in wife-beating cases.</P>

    <P>A man who beats his wife does not automatically beat or assault his children <Col N="2398" /> but some do.  Children are more likely to suffer from the atmosphere of terror in the home, occasioned by what they see and hear their father doing to their mother, and, if she is under great stress, by her violent or negative attitude towards them.  Incest occurs in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes an attempt to recognise the imperfections of the barring order system and to extend some degree of assistance to wives.  I hope I am wrong when I say that I do not believe it will be successful.  I would like the Minister to point out to me where in the Bill the protection of children is provided for.  We are thinking of this in very simplistic, one-sided terms.  It is unusual that there would not be in a home in which a protection order or a barring order had to be sought at least an atmosphere of mutual violence and hostility.  It is fair to say that in that situation one might very well get reciprocal violence or, at least, the transferring of the violence from one party to the other, by the party who cannot respond on to the children.  I believe the children need specific protection in such circumstances.  There is strong evidence to suggest that such is the case.  I will be happy to make it available.</P>
    <P>What is our response?  How genuinely concerned are we about the children?  At least the women have organisations which have in recent times done very good work in bringing to the attention of a male-dominated Parliament the problems of women in the home and outside the home.  Little by little there is a response.  After the next general election, when presumably there will be more women in this House, their insights and perceptions will yield an even more rapid and relevant response than we have managed to produce so far.</P>
    <P>These organisations include Women's Aid, AIM and others.  Earlier I referred to battered wives being taken care of by AIM but I should have said Women's Aid.  I remember visiting their hostel in Harcourt Street in the early seventies and witnessing the beginning of the work which was to flower into a protective oasis of peace and refuge for women who had <Col N="2399" /> nowhere else to go.  I appeal to the Minister to give the necessary support to these organisations.  It will be nothing more than an investment in the future of those women and their children and it will be cheap because, if one wants to be mercenary, the alternatives are very expensive.</P>
    <P>I have tried in this House on a number of occasions to get some response on the problems of abuse of wives and children. I tried to find out how concerned we were about this and what statistics were available. The truth is there are not any which could be said to be scientific.  If anyone was doing a thesis on any subject he would have to produce an array of reasonably scientific facts which would be a lot more comprehensive and helpful than the totality available to this House from the Departments involved in relation to violence in the home and particularly in relation to children.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House once again what we are talking about, because we cannot lose sight of this.  I would like to quote from an article by Janet Martin in <i>Magill</i> magazine, January 1978, which outlined the obvious evidence that the barring order procedure was in many cases ineffective.  The writer referred to the AIM Group in Galway, who said that violence was a particular problem in respect of 70 to 75 per cent of the people they saw.  They said that a district official in the Dublin metropolitan area had, for his own information, compiled figures to show that one in three women seeking maintenance provisions through the courts cited violence.</P>
    <P>There then followed a very harrowing account of what they meant by violence, that is, evidence not only reported violence but also of unreported violence. Many women seek maintenance or separation orders, annulments or live apart from their husbands because of violence. The same article said that the Dublin Women's Aid Organisation, which offers emergency accommodation to battered wives and their children, had in three years &mdash; and this was in 1978 &mdash; seen a dramatic increase in demand for accommodation. They said that in the year to <Col N="2400" /> July 1977 they provided 19,000 bed nights for over 210 families.  Sadly, the article added sexual assaults on children was the latest contribution to the picture.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister tell us about the protection of children?  On 3 March 1981 I asked him a question in regard to the statistics available in his Department concerning the incidence of non-accidental injuries &mdash; another euphemism we use whenever we wish to avoid honest discussion of the real problem &mdash; in each of the last five years:</P>
    <P>(a) the type or description of the injuries sustained; (b) the ages of the children involved; (c) the formal nature of the relationship between the abused children and the perpetrators of their injuries; (d) the professional status of the people who first suspected the injuries prior to the official contacting of the relevant Director of Community Care or officer designated by him; (e) the number of reports about and confirmations of injury victims that (i) were hospitalised and (ii) were subject to out-patient hospital treatment and (f) the subsequent outcome in respect of those children who were confirmed as victims as non-accidental injuries.</P>
    <P>That was a comprehensive question, even if I say so myself.  The answer, however, was anything but.  The reply coldly said:</P>
    <P>The only statistics in this regard available to my Department relate to the period from 1 April 1977 to 31 December 1979 and are confined to the number of suspected and confirmed cases in that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister then gave the figures for two periods.  One can only presume that before 1977 there was open season on the question of brutality to children.  No one even bothered to keep count.  The Minister's reply went on to say that these cases were referred to the health boards mainly by doctors, public health nurses and social workers, finally, it said that, looked at in the light of the total number of children in the country under the age of ten years, the figure of 173 confirmed cases over a period of almost three years <Col N="2401" /> represented an exceedingly small percentage, that is, .00014 per cent.  The Minister then passed on to the next question apparently happy in the belief that all was right.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anyone would accept that that was the extent of the real problem. The truth is that the children in the home probably suffer most.  The wives at least have an organisation to turn to if they know the address.  They may be able to go to a solicitor, if they understand access to the law.  They may be able to get civil legal aid if they are entitled to apply for it and are willing to wait weeks until their cases are processed and if they know where to go and, in some cases, if they are literate enough to read the details of the scheme.  But the children do not have any of these advantages. They are unrepresented.  In these days of lobby politics that is the greatest weakness of all.  There are organisations who tried to draw attention to these cases but, despite the work they have done, so far they have not succeeded as they should have done.</P>
    <P>What we used to do in these cases, and we still do in respect of certain problems not unrelated to this area, was to hive the problem off to foreign shores.  Some years ago an expression used &mdash; thankfully this is no longer the case &mdash; by British social workers was PFIs, an abbreviation for &ldquo;Pregnant from Ireland&rdquo;. An unmarried girl who got pregnant would invariably become a PFI.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The New Statesman,</i> in September 1979, had an interesting and relevant case of the plight of an Irish mother, a married woman with children, who had found that to get any kind of refuge she had to leave the country.  I will not read it all.  The case was dealt with by the magistrates in Bristol with great sympathy and compassion. The article states:</P>
    <P>Mrs. Browne left her home in Tralee, Co. Kerry, Eire, together with her seven children because of her husband's violence.  After staying in a woman's aid hostel in Limerick she had to move on yet again because her husband had succeeded in tracking her down.  Her fares were paid to Bristol <Col N="2402" /> and the day after her arrival she presented herself at the housing aid centre of the local authority as a homeless person with a priority need for accommodation. No-one could suggest that she intentionally had made herself homeless, and yet because of the way the Act is drafted in Britain, Bristol was unable to throw responsibility for her on to any other local authority.</P>
    <P>Whether it is by non-admission of the problem, referral to other countries or a blinkered definition of what violence in the home means, we have not in this Bill shown that we understand the extent or the basis of the problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to children, it is clear that there is a serious problem.  I should like to pay tribute to a voluntary social worker, Mr. Paul O'Toole, who in the last four years has been systematically battering at the doors of Government Departments, local authorities and statutory agencies, and indeed individual public representatives, to bring attention to a number of the problems that exist. These problems are not general; they are not about all of us being against sin and being unable to cope.  They are simple problems involving deficiencies in administration on a day-to-day basis, a system of bureaucracy which works nine to five to deal with the problem which is a 24-hour a day, seven days a week problem.</P>
    <P>This man, Mr. Paul O'Toole, highlights this problem, and I have three or four dozen letters from him.  I will give an example.  Some time ago there was a case of a husband and wife being committed to jail for a week for an offence. During that week their family, including a six-month old baby, were undiscovered. It was as if they did not exist.  Purely by chance somebody came across two of the youngsters in a bed.</P>
    <P>Many people have tried to make progress in this regard but the Department involved responded that they would try to ensure that whenever a family are committed, whether it be a settled family or one of the itinerant community, there would be a mandatory checking system through which they could discover if that the Garda are entitled to put matters there were children.  Because of our misunderstanding  <Col N="2403" /> of the problem, the parents are being asked if they have children. Unfortunately for some children the parents do not wish to admit the children's existence, either through fear that they would be taken from them or because in some cases, not to be too brutal about it, the children are used for begging purposes and are a means of income.  That is why we find so many children these days in the streets of our cities.  They have a quota to meet and if that quota is not met the children live in fear of being beaten for failure.</P>
    <P>A checking system should be designed not just to ask parents but to provide a precaution that in any case in which there is a suggestion there might be a family somebody would be there to inspect the home, residence or abode and find out if there is a family and then ensure they are looked after.  That is the kind of problem Mr. O'Toole brought to light.  There are many others, all of them relevant to the limitations imposed or assumed by the agencies or authorities.  For example, certain agencies will say &ldquo;Child beating is not my concern, I am in the area of case work, I am in the area of counselling.&rdquo; We need in the first place an inventory of what is going on and then some sensible co-ordination and rationalisation to ensure not that any of the agencies are being hindered in doing their work but that they work in harmony and unison and that some cases will not slip through the mesh of their activities.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Toole raised all kinds of issues. His most recent one is being investigated by the Minister for Health at our request. The problem of children is highlighted by the fact that in Dublin at this moment children are sniffing glue.  We have all seen them, pale faces, undernourished, whose lungs in due course will congeal due to the inhalation of the fumes of these toxic products.  We pass them in the street and sometimes we look the other way.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible in the statutory sense for dealing with this problem. We could argue about the initial responsibility but that is academic in most cases.  I appeal to the Minister during the <Col N="2404" /> debate on a Bill entitled the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill to take on the job of investigating the problem as a matter of urgency.  It is not new.  It has been going on for the past two and a half year.  I am asking the Minister to solve this problem, first of all by providing the type of hostel necessary to wean those difficult children away from this slow, unknowing suicide, because that is what it is.  Those children are a living reminder of the way we have neglected the rights and the protection of children.</P>
    <P>There are other reminders.  In a policy document, now party policy in my case, among a variety of provisions for the protection of children we undertake to implement, if given the opportunity, what we have called an early warning system.  This is a sensitive difficult area because of the problems related to me and others by social workers show that we are unable to react to the problem until there is physical evidence of child beating.  It is too late then.  There are many concerned doctors and nurses who are aware that the injuries they treat may not be accidental.  That is why we refer to non-accidental injuries to children.  It is a nice way of referring to child abuse or child battering which has an emotive tone about it.</P>
    <P>How can we deal with this?  What is the best way to tackle it and utilise evidence that becomes available of children whose injuries may be evidence of brutality in the home.  We must be very careful because it is possible that if we were to be less than very careful serious wrong could be done and serious injury to family relationships.  I am asking the Minister to commit himself, as we have done, to the introduction of a register in which qualified people would be entitled, without threat of action for defamation or libel, to record evidence which if put together over a period of time would argue that at least there should be an inquiry.  A sensitively evolved system along those lines without question would prevent much hurt to children.  It is not a novel idea. About eight weeks ago I asked the Minister for Justice about the new Garda computer and he told me, for example, <Col N="2405" /> of opinion into that computer of cases that they come across with suspicious circumstances. If that flexibility is allowed in those cases, the extension of what I am talking about, which is a much more modest situation, surely is possible and would be relevant.  If we are really concerned about protecting children we should not wait for their bones to be broken.  I ask the Minister to kindly look at that.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to violence but the weakness of omitting reference to the root of the problem means that the woman has protection only within the home.  We should be able to develop a system which would allow her to walk freely and fearlessly in any part of a city or townland with her family, without the threat of being beaten or abused.  If this works, at best it means she is a prisoner of a kind of domestic bastille; as long as she is there she is safe.  That limitation is regrettable.  Perhaps the ideal is not possible but we should concern ourselves with trying to pre-empt and initially identify the problems and deal with them at that level, offer help and make it freely available.  We should let it be clearly known that it is not a shame for marriages and families to have difficulties.  It is something which is understandable.  A marriage without a difficulty or problem in growing together is probably dead anyway.  Unfortunately we have reached a situation where anyone who has recourse to counselling might feel they are somehow imperfect.  That is not the case.  Real growth is not achieved without some degree of pain and some degree of working towards each other.  That should be facilitated in the way I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The lack of statistical evidence in this area is depressing because it points to the fact that we have not cared enough.  I met women some time ago who were convinced their husbands were living bigamously. I do not know whether they were or not but those women believed it.  They were strongly of the view that they were not afforded any protection or any legal sanction.  They felt the Director of Public Prosecutions turned a blind eye.  Subsequent inquiries revealed that there had not been, in recent years, any prosecution <Col N="2406" /> pursued through the courts for bigamy.  I am not necessarily suggesting that that is the best approach but it is another facet of a multi-faceted problem of marital difficulty.  This morning's Bill is shortsighted from that point of view. The Bill was introduced with a view to affording a wide span of protection and taking some courageous steps, not just for people who are physically beating each other but, more importantly, to try to ensure that that problem would not arise for many marriages which might be experiencing temporary difficulties, economic difficulties or difficulties relating to the arrival of a family.  This can be a very traumatic event for many parents. We never hear about that and most of us learn the hard way.</P>
    <P>These are all matters of experience.  They are not mysteries.  I appeal for help to be given to families.  Perhaps we should consider, in the context of a reorganised Government Departmental system, in which many Departments are not arguably as relevant as they used to be, whether or not, to use a cliché, the fundamental institution of the family is deserving of a ministry, somebody who would take on himself responsibility for pursuing all those strands of law, in conjunction with the agencies already in existence, local authorities, health boards, voluntary agencies, concerned individuals and so on, and progressing in the areas of law reform and provision of support and counselling for marriage and for children.  It is at least worthy of consideration. It is at least as important surely as some of the concepts for which we have ministries.  We have them because we hold fast to certain cultural and political values from which we are afraid to move.  We are afraid to move away from traditional systems which we have inherited.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is clearly the buck-passing that goes on.  When the Minister comes in he will say that the problem of child beating is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I see it as a family problem.  The school attendance section of Dublin Corporation will tell anyone who asks that the clear correlation which exists between child abuse, <Col N="2407" /> educational deprivation, family violence, economic deprivation and joblessness are all factors which knit together.  They are not mysteries.  We should not throw our hats at this and say there is no solution. The problems are there and are clear but they always seem to be someone else's problems.  It is the Department of Justice who deal with juvenile delinquents.  They built Loughan House fairly fast because there is a clear political need to meet those who, in some cases with saliva almost coming from their lips, want these children locked up.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education deals with special schools.  This is another problem. The Minister for Health, for some mysterious reason, deals with child abuse and child beating, which of course is a criminal act or should be.  It is always somebody else's problem.  They say things like &ldquo;we do not work after 5.30, therefore you will have to ring someone else&rdquo;.  Do we genuinely mean what we say when we talk about the importance of the family in Irish society?  If we do, let us consider some fundamental way of tackling the problem.  The Family Law [Protection of Spouses and Children] Bill, 1981, will be paraded for the next two or three years as being a major step forward.  The Bill is an admission that we made a mistake. There is nothing wrong with that but let us not pretend it is something which is not.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister also to look at an article by Denis Green in the September 1980 edition of the Incorporated Law Society's gazette headed &ldquo;Legal Aspects of Non-Accidental Injuries to Children&rdquo;. He outlines clearly many of the problems relating to the question of fit person's orders, risk to children and various sections of the Children's Act, 1908.  That article provides more information than successions of questions to Ministers in this general area.</P>
    <P>I want to mention briefly also the very disappointing report of the long awaited task force on child care.  The Taoiseach promised us a Children's Bill before Christmas 1980, we were promised it again this year.  We still have not got it and have no hope of getting it before the <Col N="2408" /> Dáil is dissolved.  The reason we have not got it is that they are too busy trying to deal with the lobby groups and the vested interests and paying a few bob here and there to keep them quiet.  The report of the task force was also supposed to contain a draft Bill.  That was the excuse that was last given when I asked why it had not been brought forward.  There is no draft Bill.  Most of them could not agree on any two items.  They ducked every central issue.  That is not to say that the report is not a very useful compendium of very helpful information.  It brings it all together, which is very good, except that for a number of years Fianna Fáil ducked their responsibilities in this area by reference to that task force.  It is there now, but there is no Children's Bill and there will not be in this Dáil.  However, I give my word that there will be such a Bill during the next Dáil, that is depending on the goodwill of the people.  I will deal with the general area of family law when we get to that Bill.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Bill before this House is so slight.  I hope it will work.  At least there is the merit that it focuses attention on the problem but I do not believe that the protection order, which is the central element in the Bill, is what is required on its own.  It does not afford the woman the guaranteed protection she needs.  It is a holding operation.  The woman has still to go to the courts.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister was at pains to point out that the offender inevitably will be made aware that the order had been made and the impression conveyed was that the order would not be effective unless both parties were fully aware at the time of the making of the order or immediately afterwards that it was in effect.  The nature of the problem means that the husband or the wife will not be in the home &mdash; in most cases one of the parties will not have a fixed abode or will be in another jurisdiction.  I can see major problems in this area where people will not be aware of the making of the order. In one case in my constituency a wife is regularly sexually assaulted by her husband. He is living in another part of the city but he comes to the home whenever he likes and kicks in the door.  It is naive <Col N="2409" /> to think that the order gives sufficient protection in that instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he considered the section that clears up the powers of the Garda Síochána to arrest in such cases is good, and I agree with him.  In his speech he made the following comment:</P>
    <P>Initially, it was thought the problems might be solved by a more active involvement of the Garda Síochána in the issuing of summonses for breaches of barring orders, and instructions on those lines were issued to the force by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>There is a clear implication there, which I think is probably in accordance with the facts, that the Garda Síochána do not consider themselves the best agency to implement powers of arrest in those circumstances, as they do in some cases in relation to squatters.  To some extent I can understand their inhibitions.  Family law is not best dealt with by the full weight of the law if there is some other way of bringing the parties together and resolving their problems.  We must not forget that at one stage the people concerned declared their love for each other and joined together as man and wife.  I accept that the Garda Síochána as a protection should not necessarily be the first recourse.  There should be some other agency to whom the wife or husband could go with their problems.  There are voluntary conselling agencies, but much more thought and support is needed.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the protection order will direct the other spouse not to use or threaten to use violence or molest or put in fear.  He said that the existence of such an order, coupled with the criminal sanctions that will attach to it, should effectively deter violent spouses from committing further acts pending the hearing of the application for the barring order and will, perhaps, help to make some of them realise the seriousness of their conduct.  I have no doubt it will help in some cases, but the real worry is with regard to those who will not realise the seriousness of their conduct.</P>
    <P>The success of this Bill depends on sanctions in the event of the breaking of a barring order and it also depends on an <Col N="2410" /> openness to logic, and on a level-headed non-emotional reaction by the parties.  It will depend to a very considerable extent on the reaction of the husband.  He has problems also and his brutality to his wife is a symptom of his problems.  We are not talking of shutting out an enraged animal. We are talking about two people whose relationship has degenerated to such an extent that physical violence has occurred.  Our protection, compassion and our attempt to heal should be extended to both parties and this can only be done by taking a fundamental view of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill will meet the need although I accept it will help some people.  I hope the Minister or whoever is in his place will amend the Bill if it is found to be defective.  I hope it will not take another five years of beatings and brutality and calls for action before we have another slight amending measure such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party, I welcome the Bill.  It is a fairly minor measure having regard to the overall need for comprehensive family law reform.  However, in so far as it introduces the concept of the protection order, of giving the power of arrest without warrant for breach of the order and also provides for the concurrent serving of sentence in the event of a person committing another offence while on bail, the Bill is welcomed.  I was chairman of the Select Committee on the Family Law Bills and I remember the long hours we spent discussing these matters in Room 91.  The Fianna Fáil Party were in opposition and the Minister was the then Deputy Cooney when we tried to thresh out the 1975-76 Bill, which was enacted eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Bills are welcomed generally.  I have experience in the Dublin area of the inadequacy of the current procedures relative to barring orders.  They do not get to the root of the problem in our society. We in Ireland are magnificent at dealing with the public manifestation of symptoms, in the sense that we try to make a public response and to introduce legislation to deal with the symptoms, but we <Col N="2411" /> do not deal with the reality of the cause of the disease itself.</P>
    <P>When one meets a spouse who is in urgent need of a barring order and who is suffering from violence in family life, by the time one gets a garda to visit the family and take statements and take an interest in what is going on, and by the time one can assist that family, very frequently further violence has occurred.  By the time one gets to the District Court the situation has deteriorated further.</P>
    <P>Whereas this Bill is a response to certain deficiencies, it is no great response in terms of a State supportive agency for such families in dire need.  I will chart the type of situation which is not unknown to virtually every public representative. One is rung up at about 11.30 p.m., or even 12 midnight with 11.30 closing time, when a substantial proportion of the violence occurs because of alcoholism on the part of the husband.  The disease of alcoholism which permeates Irish society is the root cause of a good deal of family violence.  We are all well aware of that.</P>
    <P>What does one do at midnight?  One rings the Garda.  They are trying to catch somebody who has stolen a car in a teenage escapade and their radios are crackling. They are trying to man a station which has a reduced force for night duty. They say: &ldquo;We are sorry but we cannot spend all our time trying to resolve the problem of family violence.  We have no training in that area.&rdquo;  Very often I meet members of the Garda who, with the best will in the world, are not trained as family counsellors.  Most members of the Garda cannot walk into a home and say at first glance that the children appear to be suffering from physical violence.  One has to be trained in this area of the detection of family violence, which very often is not easily assessable even by a family doctor.</P>
    <P>We tend to start with the public manifestation of the problem after all the viciousness and violence has occurred. Then we suggest that we should do something about it.  Let me paint the type of society we have.  As a society we see no contradiction in spending £1,500,000 per day on booze while we will not spend <Col N="2412" /> £500,000 per day on social workers, on child care workers, on attaching to the major Garda stations family counsellors and visitors.  It is not an uncommon occurrence in this so-called Christian country for the Garda to be rung up at 1 a.m. and told that a woman is bleeding on her doorstep because her husband has assaulted her violently and the children are screaming on the street.  Rather than sending a squad car with a plain clothes detective, or a ban-gharda, what the family needs is an urgent visit by a qualified medical social worker to assess the situation on the spot and advise on the immediate needs of the family.  There should be an ongoing case study in that area.</P>
    <P>There is an element of hypocrisy in relation to these Bills, it is like saying to a person whose home has been flooded that he needs the fire brigade to take the water out of the house when what he really needs is a plumber to mend the leak.  There are many instances in which the State should say to the spouse: &ldquo;What you need is not a barring order for the next 12 months, or a legal separation, or an annulment.  What you need is permanent termination of that relationship with that spouse.&rdquo;  There may be no children involved.</P>
    <P>We all know of harrowing cases where a woman in a flat is virtually the prisoner of her husband who may be of a particularly violent or sadistic turn of mind and who terrorises her.  This may not become known for six or 12 months.  What do we offer her?  A barring order, a key and a lock on the front door.  What she needs is a civil termination of her marital relationship. There is only one way to give her that and that is a civil divorce.  Therefore, there is an element of hypocrisy in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What the woman needs is not a visit by a parish priest, or a Garda squad car at 3 a.m., or the humiliation of court proceedings in public in a District Court, if it ever gets to that level.  What she needs, and what she will get in other societies where there is less hypocrisy, is a formal civil termination of the marriage because it has ceased to exist.  We all know there are many instances in Irish society where, <Col N="2413" /> in the best interests of the children concerned and of both spouses &mdash; if one wants to use that legal term &mdash; a barring order is not what is needed, but a formal winding up of the relationship and the assets whatever they may be.  In Ireland we patch it up and keep patching it up, because we are afraid to admit that we are not different from other societies.</P>
    <P>Let me sum up the two points I have made so far.  As a society we are not prepared to pay for family supportive agencies which are necessary.  We can spend £1½ million per day on alcohol, £100 million on off-course betting annually, millions each year on entertainment. As a society we are all delighted to indulge in those occupations, but we are not prepared to pay for the neighbour down the road who does not have one shilling to her name but must wait her turn in the long queue to get civil legal aid.  Such people cannot even afford a taxi to bring their children to court and do not have any other means of transport. The Minister should be out in areas in south county Dublin where women must travel to Bray Court to try to collect a few bob, even a maintenance order.  If the Minister went to that area he would see the type of deprivation that applies there.  Of course, there are public mythologies in relation to this matter, but it cuts across all income groups from the wealthiest to the poorest in our society.  There are incidents of family violence requiring barring orders in all groups in society.</P>
    <P>It is wholly inadequate to devolve on the Garda Síochána the enforcement of barring orders and the taking of statements on alleged breaches of such orders. The Minister knows that the Garda Síochána is a predominantly male force and many of its members come from traditions and backgrounds which are somewhat removed, in the cultural sense, from urban society.  I am aware from my experience of living in an urban area that the last thing gardaí want to know about are details of such incidents.  A wife who is beaten up by a husband goes to the station the following morning, black-eyed and bruised, with her children in a shocked state, and complains; but very <Col N="2414" /> often she is told to go to see her family doctor.  The family doctor, in my experience, is not the first to rush to a garda station when he knows of family violence. Do they go to Garda stations and lodge formal complaints?  I would like to see some case work and research done on this matter.  Family doctors may tell such people to go to see the family solicitor, but the woman at this stage is beginning to do the circle.  A fortnight goes by, another fortnight goes by and the next thing is that the husband arrives home and violently assaults the woman again. In about one-third of such cases alcohol is directly related to the violence.</P>
    <P>There are people in Irish society, and a culture in it, whereby one feels one is asserting one's marital rights and one's head of the household concept if one engages in physical violence.  Many families are reared in that type of culture. Today it has practically destroyed Northern Ireland, and the culture of violence, the incapacity of thousands of Irish people to relate to one another on a verbal exchange of opinions and attitudes &mdash; that type of incapacity is not particularly unique to Ireland but has had its manifestations in many forms here &mdash; has also permeated family life.  We all know that it happens in sport here.  If two people disagree on the sports field, there and then they proceed to beat the daylights out of each other with the spectators looking on and regarding it as great gas. The players are sent off and on adjourning to the local pub beat the daylights out of each other again.  We all know of the &ldquo;hard chaw&rdquo; we met when going to school and that physical violence was the manly and approved thing to be involved in.  The harder the chaw the better the man was regarded as he grew up.  In turn he passed on this concept of physical confrontation and exchange of violence to his own children; and if there happened to be women in the house and they got the odd kick or belt that was considered to be their misfortune, because women generally were felt to be in the way when these manly cultural Irish pursuits were being engaged in.  Of course, this goes into family life.  When one has an argument with one's wife and a wife <Col N="2415" /> retaliates, in the classical Irish sense violence ensues.  With alcohol lacing the Irish culture as only alcohol can, the bravery of the Irish people begins to bubble over into great manifestations and capacity for inter-relationship.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>When it comes to politics we have to produce our cultural weapons and, instead of engaging in physical violence, we just shoot them dead.  That is what a lot of Irish people do today to resolve their religious, nationalist and personal feelings one to the other.  Yet, they are a Christian and civilised society.  I suggest to the Minister that the Bill be sent to Templemore and the young gardaí be told about the barring orders and the protection orders.  It reminds me of the fellow who when appointed a peace commissioner by the last Government, came to me and expressed the view that he thought it was his job to keep the peace between the neighbours.  Had he intervened he would have quickly learned that intervention of that type was not the job of a peace commissioner.  He also thought he was going to get paid for the job, but he quickly discovered that all he was required to do was sign summonses for bald tyres and things like that.</P>
    <P>Most new recruits to the Garda Síochána, in regard to enforcing the provisions of the Bill, will have difficulty in deciding what to do.  That is the reality of the situation and it must be borne in mind.  While I strongly welcome the changes proposed as being sane and sensible &mdash; they are entirely laudable &mdash; I should like to refer to the fact that in regard to the last two Governments, from 1973 to 1981, the parliamentary legislative programme in this area has not been very good.  We passed a number of Bills, but we have not done much in terms of providing money for the agencies which are primarily involved.  The Eastern Health Board are hardly mentioned in the Minister's speech.  In each local health centre there should be family welfare workers to maintain a register of the families who are in danger, a register of the children of such families who are liable to physical violence.  Then we <Col N="2416" /> would be talking about the one thing which is lacking in the whole concept of the Bill, preventive measures.  This is <i>post factum</i> dealing with the situation.  I do not think that the preventive measures which we all want to see here are adequate. Very often when young people get married there is no conception on the part of one spouse or the other of the fact that violence can ensue.  Personalities may be dormant at that time and it is only much later that the whole thing explodes.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in welcoming this Bill and speaking briefly to it at this stage, I urge strongly that the Department of Justice are perhaps the Department worst equipped to deal with this problem because they are basically a Department of response to committal of crime. Rather I see the Department of Health and the Department of Education as being Departments who would be preventive. It is far better to prevent one case of violence than to spend three or four years afterwards trying to chase the outcome of it through the courts, through barring orders and so on.  For these reasons I welcome the Bill with very strong reservations because of the kind of society we have and the need for us as politicians to spend far more public money in trying to change the cultural structure of society which brings violence into the family home.  I hope that this Bill will at least highlight that aspect of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I want to take the opportunity of thanking both Deputy Keating and Deputy Desmond for their contributions here this morning, even in so far as those contributions went completely outside the area we have been dealing with.  It should be recognised that this type of legislation cannot be presumed to, or drafted in such a way that it can deal with all aspects of the likelihood that violence may occur in the family. For centuries &mdash; in fact since man has come to exist as we know him on this planet &mdash; it has been accepted that marital violence, violence in the home, domestic violence as we describe it, is something which has different factors and different causations.  To prescribe a legislative <Col N="2417" /> package that could be seen to deal with all aspects of it, as the remedy for all causes of this type of violence, would be very difficult and, I think, unrealistic. In this legislation I have tried to go as far as possible to provide practical measures or steps for the protection of the spouse. Let it be the husband or wife, and the child.</P>
      <P>In the course of preparation of this legislation very serious consideration was given to the views and opinions expressed by the various agencies involved, some of them referred to by Deputy Keating, others not referred to by him, both directly and through the Council for the Status of Women.  In that connection we also had discussions with people experienced in these matters, with members of the Judiciary, Garda officers and so on. All were satisfied that this was the best approach to the handling of a situation where we know and recognise that women and children are oftentimes very much unprotected and at extreme risk in their homes where a barring order is obtained as it is at present.  As Deputy Desmond has said, you can have a situation some time later where the barring order would provide for a specific prohibition, but the threat of violence and the likelihood of that threat being manifested in a later visit clearly require something by way of an interim measure to give adequate protection to the wife and children. For that reason the Bill has gone quite a considerable distance and I am satisfied that it has gone as far as we can possibly go in this very delicate and complex area of human relationships and domestic situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that the Bill was a naive attempt to deal with the problem of domestic violence and that it is unrealistic to think that an enraged, violent and possibly deranged husband will be deterred by a protection order and by his being liable to be arrested.  I tell Deputy Keating that one can extend that illogical argument into any area of the criminal law when that type of person wants to proceed to act in such a manner that he is prepared to ignore totally his <Col N="2418" /> legal responsibility or is prepared to proceed one way or the other, knowing the law.  There are other mechanisms and methods to deal with that type of situation. But in so far as it is humanly possible and in so far as we can be realistic in our approach to this situation, the Bill has, on the advice of and in consultation with all of the people involved, clearly produced a realistic and positive solution.  I think that I made it clear in my opening speech that the problem of domestic violence is very difficult to describe.  I would say that Deputy Keating and Deputy Desmond realise that many factors can be involved, such as ill-health and the stress factor.  Simple matters like another individual in the house, or a baby crying, can get on somebody's nerves from time to time in the best regulated home.</P>
    <P>However, violence, no matter what the cause, is tragic and horrific, and the best that the law can do, the best that I would wish to do from the responsibility I have in the Department of Justice, would be to ensure that whatever is required in the law would be there in so far as it is desirable or necessary and that also it would take into account the likelihood of reconciliation and of the courts, the Garda and any other agencies involved in this area recognising the fact that situations and the circumstances might change.  In the event of such a change, it would be very important to ensure that the avenues were open and that the opportunities would be there for the restoration of a full marital relationship.  It would be desirable in this type of legislation that the necessary provisions would be made for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to children sniffing glue.  He talked about the use of computers for assessment.  What did the Deputy mean by the use of computers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anyone was concerned about the idea, what I referred to there was an early warning system where information would be put on a register which would be available to a limited range of people.  I said that we already do that in a variety of areas, for example, income tax and Garda matters and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is not a feature of this Bill, I go along with the Deputy that there is a difficulty in relation to glue sniffing that has emerged in recent years. I would be cautious not to subscribe to the idea of an early warning system which might be related to the correlation of facts about identified persons and which would come under suspicion from society generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have explained.  Let us assume that a doctor has a child brought in to him six or seven times in a period with markings or bruising which could be interpreted as burns or wounds or injuries which would not arise from a fall.  He might be entitled, in his professional capacity, to at least initiate a confidential investigation with the full knowledge of the parents.  The matter would not become a matter of public discussion but at least the evidence would be used as a basis for preventing serious injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well accepted that doctors, all of whom are well intentioned and all of whom are constantly vigilant in this area, realise the very delicate situation that they find themselves in.  It is a strange phenomenon but children can go into hospital and be discharged and taken home by the parent who was not responsible for the beating or injury caused or done and who never reveals to anybody what the cause is.  Often, for psychological or other reasons that are not explainable by me as a lay person, the parent offers protection in this area.  Apart from that, it is an area of family life where one has to have facts soundly based and be in a position to know the chemistry of the two parents particularly and to know quite a considerable amount about the relationship.  There is a lot involved in the gathering of this type of information. I do not say that we should not attempt it in so far as it is possible.  But we cannot be unrealistic and impracticable about the thing.  We must ensure that whatever is necessary in a reasonable sense will be provided.  To come back to the idea of computerisation in relation to such facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It cannot be forgotten.  I did not wish to imply that I sought computerisation of these reports.  What I said was that it would be a good idea to have an early warning system where the evidence before a doctor would be put on file and it would have no statutory basis. I suggested that that information could be gathered and that it was not novel to do this because we do that information gathering in other areas.  In that connection I referred to the Garda computer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have been much happier if Deputy Keating had been in a position to be much more expansive when making his contribution on the type of information that would be gathered.  I do not mean to misrepresent what the Deputy said but I want to be satisfied <Col N="2421" /> that whatever is said is understood in the context in which it is said and is not seen as something else.  I know Deputy Keating did not intend anything sinister by his remarks.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the Bill does not provide adequate protection to children. That is not a fair reflection of what is in the Bill.  In section 2 &ldquo;child&rdquo; is mentioned on more than one occasion.  But it must be realised as well that the argument being made in this connection by Deputy Keating was that this should be a Bill which provided for criminal law penalties where children are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the title of the Bill.  That is the point I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We have quite a considerable amount of criminal law which protects children and all people in our society. Referring specifically to children and sexual and indecent assaults on children, there is the Children Act, 1908.  There is also the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  There are a considerable number of criminal options where assaults are concerned, with very heavy penalties ranging, as the Deputy knows, to life imprisonment in some instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I will certainly find out for the Deputy.  The Bill, as I said, intends to deal with the situation where the spouse and children are put at risk and does not intend to provide the type of legislation that Deputy Keating has been speaking about.  I notice that, while Deputy Keating spoke about the type of legislation he would like to see without acknowledging that there is considerable criminal law there, he did not mention the unborn child at all in this connection.  I wonder has he any views on that in the light of recent statements <Col N="2422" /> in the media by members of his own party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be privy to that type of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was concerned about the fact that the Garda might not be the most suitable agency to deal with this type of problem or to offer the type of expertise required in this area.  When it comes to law enforcement and the enforcement of laws that protect people the Garda are the best trained and equipped.  That does not mean to say that I totally disagree with what the Deputy says.  I am satisfied that it is necessary for the Garda to have advice in other areas such as medical advice and advice from social workers and to be able to call on those types of services.  I believe that this is an area of law enforcement which only the Garda can carry out properly.  If, as Deputy Desmond stated, some husband comes back to his wife after having been barred or after she had obtained a protection order in the court and he proceeds to repeat what he was barred from doing in the first instance, there would be little point in that woman waving the barring <Col N="2423" /> order or the notice of protection order in front of him.  I accept that we are all at risk in the society we live in from time to time and the only thing one can hope for is that new provisions for the enforcement of the law and the expeditious way proceedings could be taken against such might be a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of the existence of violence in the home, savage beatings of women and children and some of the other types of violence mentioned by Deputy Keating, which can often be more cruel and psychologically damaging than the actual physical violence which can leave a mark and might heal.  The other type of psychological violence is the total breakdown of relationships in the home, where somebody is at the whim of the stronger partner or the victim of that person so far as that person can take any decision and there is no remedy or recourse.  That is a more difficult case because the visual evidence of injury is not there.  It can be very difficult in that situation to know what is going on in the home.  We all have a public duty to keep our eyes open and bring to the attention of the agencies which can help any matters which would afford protection to people at risk.</P>
    <P>The termination of marriage was referred to by Deputy Desmond.  I am sure he realises the constitutional aspect of this matter and also that the dissolution of marriage is not just a simple matter of legislation.  I know the Deputy is interested in ensuring that all the options for reconciliation and restoration of relationships are provided for and are protected. We have to recognise that this matter has constitutional implications and has no relevance to the particulars we are dealing with.</P>

      <P>Not on this side of the House.  Deputy Keating mentioned the task force which were set up in November 1974 by the then Tánaiste, Deputy Corish. They made their report in October 1980, which was recently published. Their terms of reference were: (a) to consider the services for deprived children and children at risk; (b) to recommend what changes should be made; and (c) to prepare draft legislation to effect <Col N="2426" /> these recommendations.  When the task force were set up in 1974 it was announced that they would report in a matter of months.  For three of those years the Coalition were in power and the unrealistic commitment given at that time was highlighted by the fact that the report was not published until 1980.  The report was submitted to the Minister for Health and he is preparing legislation to give effect to those recommendations. Under the terms of reference the task force were to prepare a draft Bill, but they did not do so.  If they had, the publication of the report would have been delayed even more.</P>

      <P>In page 2, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `proceedings under this Act' means proceedings for the making, variation or discharge of a barring order, or for the making or discharge of a protection order, and any related proceedings by way of appeal or case stated;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the course of my speech on the Second Stage I referred to the provision in section 14 (1) which requires that proceedings under the Bill shall be heard otherwise than in public.  As I mentioned then, this provision is intended to refer only to proceedings relating to barring orders and protection orders.  There can be no question of allowing criminal proceedings taken for contraventions of barring orders or protection orders to be held in private.  The object of these amendments is to put this matter beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 introduces a definition of &ldquo;proceedings under this Act&rdquo; which confines that term to proceedings for the making, variation of discharge of a barring order or for the making or discharge of a protection order and any subsequent appeal proceedings.  It is only those proceedings that must be heard in private under section 14.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 are consequential drafting amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 2, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purposes of any provision of this Act providing for the variation or discharge of a barring order or for the discharge of a protection order, an order made by a court on appeal from another court shall be treated as if it had been made by that other court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where, for example, a barring order is made by the High Court on appeal from a refusal by the Circuit Court to make such an order, then, in the event of either spouse subsequently seeking to have the order varied under section 2 (3) or discharged under section 11, the proceedings for such variation or discharge will be taken in the court to which the original application for the barring order was made, that is, the Circuit Court in this example.</P>
      <P>This is in accordance with the provision of the Bill transferring to the Circuit Court and the District Court the existing jurisdiction of the High Court to make barring orders.  It also follows the general policy of the Courts Bill, which was recently passed by both Houses, of conferring as wide a jurisdiction as possible on the lower courts in the interests of speedy and less costly litigation.</P>

      <P>The general provisions of this legislation rely for their efficacy on the ability of a court to give either a protection or barring order.  The Minister will know that the courts operate like schools, they tend to have longish holidays. I am not suggesting that judges somehow are inactive.  But what happens when the courts are not in session, bearing in mind that this is a problem of great urgency?  What is in these two sections to assure a woman that she can seek protection rending an application for a barring order if the application coincides with the period when the courts are not in session?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>A protection order under section 3 solves the problem the Deputy is worried about.  Any justice can give a protection order, which is in the nature of an interim injunction, to provide protection until such time as the application for the barring order could be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the section appears to do.  The section refers to an application to the court, not to somebody going to the home of a justice in the middle of the night.  The words &ldquo;the court is of opinion&rdquo; imply that the woman must apply to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are courts for special circumstances.  For instance, if a capital crime is committed a special court could be convened urgently and it has never been known that a justice was not available.  That would apply in this very serious area we are discussing.  The court could be constituted by the presence of the justice, the garda and court officers. Later the court could reconvene and deal with the hearing of a barring order application. I appreciate the Deputy's concern, but in the knowledge that special courts can be constituted for such crimes <Col N="2431" /> as murder, we should have not any difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there may not be a problem, but the Minister is being vague and confusing.  He now introduces the new concept of a special court, by which I presume he means a court set up specially by some agency or other when the normal court would not be available. Will protection be afforded by going to a justice in the same way as one would obtain an interim injunction in the court, or does it have to be a court sitting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <P>There could be a special court during holiday time.  It will be found that the requirements of the law will be met, and they have been met, by special courts.  These applications for protection would be serious matters.  There is not any doubt in my mind that this is unambiguous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The hearing of a barring order is a court procedure which would take some time and which is not available immediately.  Therefore the Bill provides for a protection order as an interim arrangement, but this interim arrangement has to be obtained by a court appearance.  I do not honestly believe the Minister is serious when he says that a woman could have the protection she needs from a court cobbled together in the middle of the night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A justice is not synonimous with a court.  You could have a judge without a court.  Any member of <Col N="2432" /> the public is entitled to seek an injunction, and an interim injunction can be had without normal court procedure. However, a protection order is not available without court procedure of some kind.  That is the weakness I am talking about.  A woman might need immediate protection. pending the presentation of both sides in a normal court hearing. There would be long periods of the year, depending on the level of the court, and long periods of a day when a protection order cannot be made available to a woman who might need it.  I do not want the Minister to fudge the line between a court and a judge.  If a court is necessary, let us be clear about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no arrangement available that I can see, barring a special court, whereby a woman can get a protection order.  It is possible to haul a judge out of bed, whatever the mechanics of that are, but is that realistic when a simple order of some kind by a responsible authority should be enough to give protection to a woman who needs it until such time as there is a possibility of a further hearing?</P>
      <P>That letter of the law, as far as I am concerned means in many cases it is needed, particularly at night when, as Deputy Desmond rightly pointed out, the question of alcohol and sexual problems arise.  At a time like that it is essential to have such a facility available.  It is not available because the courts are not in session.  A woman will have to ask for a special court to deal with the problem. That is what the section says.  That is a major weakness in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presuming that the District Court, which is a very informal place, in so far as its constitution is concerned, needs officers, policemen <Col N="2433" /> and all the regalia.  That is what the Deputy sees the court to mean in this context. That is not so.  A District Justice &mdash; his clerk is not even required&mdash;can sit at some appointed place, either of his own or the woman's choosing, and hear her application informally and privately.  I do not think that should conjure up in Deputy Keating's mind the enormous task of finding burly policemen, social workers, doctors and so on from different parts of an area and getting them all together at some unearthly hour of the night for the purpose of dealing with a personal matter relating to a woman at risk.

There is a clear conflict between what the Minister is saying and what is in the Act. Black is not white.  How does the Minister explain the definition of the court in section 1?

      <P>I have not misrepresented the Minister.  An application to a judge called out of bed at three in the morning, sitting on his own for a protection order, is probably not &mdash; the Minister should be more certain of this than I am because he has professional advice available to him &mdash; able to be heard, simply because that is not a court unless a special court is summoned. it would need at least a process of summoning to do that.  It might need the presence of other officers. At the very least it is clear that a court hearing cannot be construed and interpreted to be the hearing of an application in the same way as, for example, an application for an injunction is heard, by a judge on his own, not acting as a court. Once again we see how weak this so-called protection order is.  Even as an interim arrangement the woman still has to go to a court.</P>
      <P>I have a question on subsection 1. When I talked about the protection of children, the Minister asked a question about recent problems in the party.  I know I am falling into his trap by remarking on it but our party has a clear policy on the issue.  I presume the Minister was asked about abortion?</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister on Second Stage where the protection of children was embodied in the Bill.  He referred specifically to section 2 (1) &mdash; the court may, if it is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of that spouse or of any child so requires, and so on. Obviously the applicants is an adult.  In the normal course of events the question <Col N="2436" /> of protection would be for a mother and perhaps her children.  Does the Minister consider that there might be circumstances in which both the husband and wife were of mutually violent temperament and that it should be possible for the court to be able to consider the interest of the child, not only on the application of one or other parent, but on the application of some third party, including the child itself if he or she was old enough to apply.  If the child felt that the brutality between the parents was such that it hurt him or her, could that child apply to the court for protection?</P>

    <P>Oral communication to the respondent spouse by or on behalf of the applicant spouse of the fact that a barring order or a protection order has been made, together with production of a copy of the order, shall, without prejudice to the sufficiency of any other form of notification, be taken to be sufficient notification to the respondent spouse of the making of the order.</P>
    <P>I suggest an amendment to delete all words after the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; in line 38. This would remove the need for the woman to produce a copy of the order. Let us take the example of the court we have mentioned, the court at 3 o'clock in the morning.  Unless the district justice is exceptionally well organised he will not be able to get a copy of the court order at that hour.  My understanding is that a court order is a specific legal document that issues in the normal way some time after the court hearing.  In this connection I am referring to the protection order which is supposed to be the interim arrangement.  It is likely there will be a lapse of time between the decision of the judge to grant the order and the actual issuing of such an order.  I do not understand why it is important to include the reference to the woman being obliged to produce a copy of the order.  The threat of violence could arise immediately after the court hearing and before the court order is in the woman's possession.  On the other hand, she might merely have mislaid the order.  The reality is that when the wife opens the door her husband will be there and the effect of the order should be to debar the man from coming into the home.  To some extent we are blackening the reputation of many husbands because there are two sides to every story.  The husband may be in need of as much help as his wife.  If we are practical we will accept the point that the woman will not have the order in her hand when she goes to answer a knock on the door.</P>

      <P>I am trying to be helpful to the Deputy.  I am making the point that there is a major difference between the two.  In the case of a protection order the husband can go back to his place of abode.  The one thing the protection order prevents him from doing is threatening or subjecting his wife to any threat of violence.  It does not have to be actual physical violence, but a mere threat.  That might include his acting in a certain way or behaving in a certain way in his own home.  That is the difference.</P>

      <P>The courts we are talking about.  They said: &ldquo;You are entitled to a <Col N="2441" /> protection order and we will communicate this to the husband.

If he comes back to his own home and an order has been obtained by his wife against him which prevents him from threatening her in any way, for the protection of herself and her children, would it not be fair that some type of documentary evidence from the body who granted or made the order should be available?</P>

      <P>I should like to have a more perfect system, but this is the only one.  Take the situation where the man who is not barred comes back to his own home.  The order might be somewhere else.  There could be a row at the front door before she gets possession of the protection order from wherever it is located.  Because of the seriousness of the matter to the people involved, the husband and wife, the proofs must be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The words the Minister used are correct but they are not in the Bill.  I repeat that husbands have rights in this matter.  It would be wrong for us to obscure that fact.  A husband affected by any such order should have made available to him at the earliest possible date copies of whatever orders we are talking about.  I maintain that the protection order should not be invalidated merely because within a matter of minutes or hours of the husband appearing the order is not actually to hand.  That is the point. A copy should be forwarded to him.  He <Col N="2442" /> should be entitled to it either from the wife or somebody else.  He should get it immediately.  Indeed, he should be summoned to the court hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If by some chance nobody knows his address, or he has not given a correct address, or the court have not had time to send the order out in the post, and he turns up at the door, the protection order should not be invalidated merely because a copy of it is not to hand.  It is not the bureaucracy of the matter which is important.  It is the essential right or wrong as to whether the order should be made.  If the order is worthy of being made, it should not be invalidated by the mere fact that a slip of paper is not available immediately the man comes to the door.  The form of words in the Bill leaves it open to the interpretation that the order is invalidated if the woman is not able to produce a copy of it immediately.</P>
      <P>That is one way only of ensuring that the husband's rights are honoured.  They could be honoured in other ways.  I should like to see the husband getting a copy of the order directly from the courts, or from his wife, or from anybody else at the earliest possible moment.  The protection order should not be invalidated by the fact that he has not got a copy of it in his hand, or that it could not be produced to him immediately.  It should be given to him, but the protection of the woman should not depend on whether or not a typist sends out a letter, or whether it was a Friday, a Saturday or a Sunday when the court was held.  The section as drafted implies that if the copy of the order is not produced immediately it is invalidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that once the order is granted it is made available to the woman.  If she chances to meet him on the street and has not got it with her, it would be unreasonable to presume it would not be effective because <Col N="2443" /> she had to go back half a mile, or 200 yards, or ten miles to her home to show it to him there or elsewhere.  One of our obligations &mdash; rightly so &mdash; in the interests of the husband is to ensure that he has sufficient notice of the order, as he is liable to arrest for contravention of it.  It would be wrong if that liability to arrest existed without that person knowing that an application had been made and an order obtained against him.</P>

It would be preferable to deal with those things here rather than <Col N="2446" /> by ministerial order or a process of index-linking.  The established practice whereby such matters are dealt with here is the proper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that fines are varied only by legislation. The Bill dealing with the courts allowed the Minister to vary the fines by ministerial order, and that was perfectly sensible. We do not want a person outside the House to make rules or laws by which we are bound, but the House is supposed to be a reflection of public values.  All I am asking is that, instead of the inevitable years of delay before we have a Bill to increase or decrease fines or penalties in relation to a specific piece of legislation, the matter be dealt with by ministerial order.  It would have been right for the Minister to seek power to vary that in the context of economic criteria and perhaps with some safeguards, because he could not vary it more often than once every two or three years.  The House does not wish to discuss whether the £200 that he is going to impose in 1981 should be £583 in 1986.  That is not what we are here for, that is a matter of accountancy.  To talk about the House needing to debate that is not acceptable.  It is a question of not cluttering up the Statute Book with irrelevant legislation which does no more than take into account present day values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point strikes at the heart of the fining system generally.  For many people £200 is a lot of money while for others it is very little.  I hold the view strongly that we should take into account not just economic values but also the ability of people to pay, because the alternative is imprisonment.  I can think of people for whom £200 would not cost a thought to write a cheque and I can think of other unfortunate people for whom it would mean a lot of saving and scrimping and they may not have it.  If fines are to be just they should not merely be related to prevailing economic indicators across a wide area so that value of the punishment, so to speak, in 1981 is the same in 1986, 1996 and so on, but also the ability of people to pay those fines should be taken into account.  From that point of <Col N="2447" /> view the fine could be moderated or even increased so that you would get a sensitive and sensible yardstick based on a notion of the value of the sanction, which it is, and taking into account individual circumstances.  Then we will not need to come running back here to change every time values change.  The truth is that £200 would not be a deterrent to many people and certainly not in five years' time with inflation going as it is.  I can see that in ten years' time we will still have a fine about which the Garda will say, as they have said in other respects, that it is so much of a joke that it is costing more to collect it than it is worth.  Then the whole point of the fine is lost.  We should face up to these issues.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important section, which introduces a concept which a number of us have been asking for for a long time and which, introduced in other areas, will deal with a major problem.  Let us be clear that we are approving that, and I quote from the section:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a person charged with an offence under <i>section 6</i> of this Act is released on bail and commits an offence under that section while so released, any sentences of imprisonment passed on that person for offences under that section shall be consecutive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard much about the law on bail and we are not going to go into it today but, because this section is specifically about offences committed on bail and because it is phrased as it is, providing for consecutive sentencing, it shows at last we are beginning to understand the real root of the problem.  The problem is not that people are on bail.  The problem is that crimes committed on bail have been treated more leniently than <Col N="2448" /> the normal crime by the virtue of the inability of the court effectively to give consecutive sentences because of the maximum jurisdiction of the District Court.  Therefore, the best time to commit a crime for a criminal was while on bail, simply because the offences were taken into account or lumped together and sentences taken concurrently.  I am pleased, therefore, that it is now clear that someone who commits an offence while on bail for another offence, assuming he is convicted of the first offence, will find that the full rigour of the law applies and he will serve another sentence for the second crime.  It is interesting too, that that is mandatory under this section.  The section says:</P>
    <P>...passed on that person for offences under that section shall be consecutive.</P>
    <P>&mdash; not &ldquo;may be consecutive&rdquo;.  It should not go without comment that this is a significant innovation.  It is just, in so far as imprisonment can be the answer to these problems.  It is appropriate that the person on bail should not be treated differently from other persons.  It is no mystery to any of us why people commit crimes while on bail.  A person with criminal propensities will commit crime when free until rehabilitated, reformed or whatever the expression might be.  This, plus one or two other measures, is the answer to these problems, and the other measures can be talked about at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>This will have a sobering effect on people. It is a very significant part of the answer to the problem of crime committed on bail generally.  For that reason I welcome it.  Not alone is it just in itself, it means also that stronger measures which would not be in the best interests of our society need not be seen as the only option.  In this section we have a very large part of the answer.  That, plus speeding up of trials and one or two other issues, would deal with this problem which has raised its head recently.  We should not let section 8 (1) go without comment.</P>
    <P>I have one query.  I want to know if the adjudication of the second offence, that <Col N="2449" /> is the charging of a person with an offence committed while on bail, will be a formal charge, or does whether the person was guilty of the first crime have a bearing on it?  Let us assume that a person on bail is found to be innocent, will the crime committed while on bail still have the full rigour of the law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in so far as it would be a crime committed while on bail, it would be heard at the same time as the first offence and the penalty would be imposed at the same time, which then would run consecutively.  I want to thank Deputy Keating for recognising the merit of this section.  The provision is of significance because it anticipates a type of general provision that may be in a future Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to deter persons who commit offences while on bail by imposing increased sanctions on them for such offences.  These sanctions could be either by way of increasing the maximum penalty or provision, as is here, for consecutive sentences.  Various possibilities were examined&mdash;for example, increased penalties for breaches committed while on bail or to make sentences for such offences consecutive on any sentence for the original offence, or a combination of both.  It was considered that a term of imprisonment significantly greater than the existing maximum term of six months for breach of a barring order would not be justified for a breach committed while on bail, having regard to the fact that the assault causing actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm can be prosecuted separately under the general criminal law and is subject to severe penalties.  The conclusion reached was that the consecutive sentence approach was the better way of making people aware of the seriousness of breaches of barring orders committed while on bail as well as the seriousness of repeated flouting of the court orders.  I recognise the Deputy's concern in this area and I thank him for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable in a way that some of what we said here this morning may be to some extent overlapped by this Bill.  It would have helped if the titles of the two Bills which have come almost simultaneously to us had been more distinct. They are, of course, two separate measures.  But in terms of common understanding and acceptance of them it might have been better if we had distinguished more clearly between the two of them.</P>
      <P>The Family Law Bill is a Bill which seeks to tidy up the various outdated enactments which are on the Statute Book.  One of the main provisions of this Bill is the abolition of actions for criminal conversation, enticement and harbouring of a spouse.  I believe the Minister is doing the right thing here and I am pleased that he is accepting, in the spirit if not the letter, precisely what was contained in the Private Members' Bill moved by my own party on 4 March 1980.  On that occasion the Minister was less than forthcoming and gave as his reason for not at that time accepting our Bill the usual answer, which is that the Government have their own Bill on the stocks almost ready.  But he also made the point that the consideration of this issue by the Law Reform Commission had not yet been completed, the clear indication being that he would be guided by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say in passing that the <Col N="2455" /> Law Reform Commission have been abused regularly in this House by being referred to as an area where discussion is still going on on an issue and giving the impression that this means that we cannot enact legislation or make a decision on an issue.  The Law Reform Commission have done very good work and are doing very good work.  I have no doubt but that they must sometimes feel a little annoyed at the way we use them as an excuse for our inactivity, the same way as we used the task force on child care services for a number of years also.  We are still awaiting action there.  On 4 March 1980 the Minister, when he, the Minister of State and all his colleagues trouped through the division lobby to vote down our measure, gave us to understand that the Law Reform Commission would be a major contributor to the Government's thinking and that their findings would, in general terms, shape the Bill which was to follow.  That has not happened.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, in their document, working paper No. 5, 1978, Law Relating to Criminal Conversation and the Enticement and Harbouring of a Spouse, said they sought replacement action.  We believed, despite the collective legal wisdom of the Law Reform Commission, that those replacement actions, where they had been produced, did not suffice either and the best thing to do was to get rid of an Act which at best provided sensational copy for the prurient and did little about helping marriages in difficulty, which was at the heart of this issue and was based on an outdated concept that a man was entitled to financial recompense for the loss of the sexual services of his wife to a third party. The injustice is underlined by the fact that that possibility was not even reciprocal and a woman was not entitled to take such an action, even allowing for the possibility that that kind of area is a matter for financial assessment or for court action.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, which shows a change of heart if we are to judge by the spirit of what was said by the Minister on 4 March 1980, proposes to <Col N="2456" /> get rid of some of the clutter at present on the Statute Books.  It proposes to abolish the action of criminal conversation, enticement and harbouring a spouse.  It also accepts the proposals of the Law Reform Commission in some other areas. notably in relation to breach of promise of marriage and consequential aspects of that, gifts to engaged couples, gifts between engaged couples and the property of engaged couples.  These are very welcome measures.  The Government have taken a decision in relation to the Family Law (Protection) Bill, 1980, the draft Bill proposed by the Law Reform Commission, in conjunction with their final report, working papers Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7 of 24 February 1981, which deal with the areas relating to breach of promise of marriage, criminal conversation, enticement, harbouring of spouse, seduction, enticement and harbouring of a child and the law relating to loss of consortium and loss of services of a child and have discarded the draft Bill.  I know that, by doing that, the Government do not wish to cast any reflection on the Law Reform Commission.  It is the job of commissions to recommend and it is the job of Governments to make decisions.  If Governments were inevitably to accept all such recommendations then the job of Government would be irrelevant in some respects.</P>
    <P>This is a departure although a very modest one.  Any Bill called the Family Law Bill, 1981, immediately implies to a casual observer as did the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Bill, 1981, a virtual galaxy of possible measures designed to bring about improvements in the family law area.  We just get a few mealy-mouthed measures designed to clear up anachronisms on the Statute Books which other countries have got rid of hundreds of years ago.  I do not wish to play down the importance of the issue nor do I wish to denigrate the efforts of the Minister.  I want, however, to put the matter into perspective.</P>
    <P>This is not a new horizon for Irish families or Irish women.  It is not by any means the great panacea, the great reform, the Taoiseach spoke about at the 1980 Ard-Fheis, when he referred to the <Col N="2457" /> importance of women in our society.  It is just getting rid of the clanking of chains for women in certain categories.  At least now their sexual services will not be adjudicated on a sliding scale of costs, and one man over a drink with another man cannot decide if he will sue him for having gone to bed with his wife the previous night.  One of those measures does that and I suppose we should be thankful for small mercies.</P>
    <P>I expected much more from this Family Law Bill, so the Bill is a little too little and a little too late as well in some cases. I met one of the women who was the subject of one of those matters.  The fascination of those actions is an academic exercise because it is a very human and tragic problem.  She was outside this operation and she protested about it. Two men were having a court case about her.  She was exhibit A and she was not entitled to participate in it.  We are now doing away with that and we are not going to fall into the trap of trying to bring in some other measure which will allow people to sue each other across the courts for an area of their private lives which has implications of public morality but which is fundamentally about the quality of their relationship.  Until we take this whole area of marital difficulty, make some sense of it and produce positive and protective measures to assist and, as Deputy Desmond suggests, when there are insoluble difficulties, to have the courage to take whatever decisions are necessary, we will be dealing in a very slow way with the problems arising in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are glaring deficiencies in the whole area of family law.  It is the dying days of this Dáil and with the suggestion of unreality which prevails at the moment, from the point of view that other issues are dominating the minds of the people, it is not the best time to embark on a long exposé of the issues which could lie at the heart of essential reform in this area.  It should be said, however, that there are other measures which should be taken, which a Bill with a title of Family Law Bill, 1981, implies are under consideration.  The Bill has a good title but the Bill does not live up to <Col N="2458" /> the expectations we had in relation to it. I repeat what I said on an earlier Bill today that if we truly want to make progress here we should consider setting up a Minister for the family and children.  I have argued that the various Government Departments dealing with children and family law do so without any statutory inter-linkage and without any correlation of their efforts except on the most casual and consultative basis.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we should reconsider our departmental system, analysing, remodelling and streamlining it to meet modern demands, and to see if some of the Departments are still relevant or needed as they are now structured. To imply that the present 15 cabinet Ministers have equality of responsibility and importance in their status is obviously not true; it is unreal.  If we can have a Minister with relatively minor responsibilities, this much talked about, much praised and sanctified area of the family is one which might be worthy of consideration.  His job would not be the woolly one of presiding over occasional conventions dedicated to the family; it would be to draw together the strands of legal and other responsibilities from various Departments to ensure that our response in the family area is integrated and comprehensive.  I do not think that can be repeated too often.</P>
    <P>If we really believe what we regularly talk about &mdash; the sanctity of marriage, a phrase I respect and which sums up much of the nobility and grandeur of that status &mdash; we would do many things differently, we would do many things we are not doing and perhaps we would undo some of the things we are doing.  It is a little too trite for people to talk about the sanctity of marriage and drive home through streets which in their decay and degeneration show we have a long way to go before we live as we preach.</P>
    <P>All available evidence shows that some marriages have problems and difficulties. Our response has been miniscule, negative and to pretend that they do not exist, or if they do, that the best answer is a combination of waiting and prayer.  Perhaps both will help.  We as public representatives, have a responsibility to see to <Col N="2459" /> what extent legislation and the creation of a proper legal and social environment will help solve this major problem.  I believe the roots of the problem are very deep and imply major changes if they are to be successful.  I am not suggesting that legislation will transform this situation but I believe there could be improvements, which we have not dealt with.</P>
    <P>A major omission is a comprehensive counselling structure which should have a comprehensive investment of resources.  In a book entitled <i>Can You Stay Married?</i> written by Nuala Fennell, Deirdre McDevitt and Bernadette Quinn, they talk about the importance of counselling and the need for public education to dispel the negative image of marriage counselling.  To seek marriage counselling and public education is an admission that you have a problem, that you are willing to talk about it and that you now need some kind of aid outside your immediate experience to get an answer to your problems.</P>
    <P>Good work is being done in this area. Many groups have responded and tried to fill the gap.  Groups like AIM, the Women's Centres, ADAPT, that is, the Association for Deserted and Alone Parents, the family group of Alcoholics Anonymous &mdash; I remember attending a meeting to get an insight into the tragedies there and it showed that this is not a problem for one socio-economic grouping but is spread throughout society &mdash; ALLY, the Adult Education Centre for Women, the Association of Widows of Civil Servants, the Battered Wives Refuge in Bray, CHERISH, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, Cluan Mhuire Family Centre, Council for the Status of Women, CURA &mdash; the counselling service for single pregnant women &mdash; the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, FLAC &mdash; Free Legal Aid Centres, who have done very fine work and to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude &mdash; Gamblers Anonymous, Gingerbread Ireland, ISPCC, the Marriage Counselling Service of Grafton Street, who have been very helpful to a variety of people on a number of occasions, the National Association of Widows of Ireland, the National Social <Col N="2460" /> Service Council, the Single Women's Association, the Women's Advisory Committee of ICTU, Women's Aid and many other groups.  It is important that the role of the volunteer be recognised and not be supplanted.</P>
    <P>We should help such groups.  Where they are not able to meet a need &mdash; whether it be on the basis of areas where they do not exist or whether it be on the basis of areas in cities where the resources cannot stretch &mdash; the State has a job not just to supplement and complement but to supervise where desirable and to ensure that we get in where needed in the early stages, not in an intrusive or overbearing fashion but so that we can help and protect the marriages about which we preach so often.  We do not do that now.</P>
    <P>This Bill is fundamentally an attempt at a curative approach to certain specific problems and is to be welcomed.  I do not know who thinks up these titles or if they read the Bills, but the titles of the two Bills discussed here today do not reflect the contents of the Bills.  How serious is the problem, or are we exaggerating? With the reactive Parliament we have, we tend to get legislation and a reaction to issues that seem to be advanced as key issues of the day.  As responsible Members of Parliament and as married men, we should stress that there are many happy and fulfilled marriages in Ireland, and I hope that describes the majority of marriages.  We should not allow that picture to be obscured, slanted or in any way depressed in its significance.  We are not talking about those marriages this morning, although any marriage might develop difficulties.  We are talking principally about marriages that are in trouble for in some cases identifiable reasons.</P>
    <P>In the area of the social research we lag behind.  The ESRI have done fine work, mainly on an economic theme.  We should develop a social research agency. Whether that be a geared-up echelon of the ESRI or a separate agency I am not very concerned, so long as they undertake to produce enlightened and updated social research on which to base social legislation and economic policy.  That is what economic policy is, not a fiscal statement <Col N="2461" /> but an essential statement of our social philosophy.  Sometimes we lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>When we look around and try to glean figures in relation to marriage difficulties, marriage breakdowns or any of the areas referred to here, unfortunately we find there is not very much available.  This morning I referred to the problems in the children's area.  If we want a pen-picture of the problems of marriage, what are we talking about?  A couple of straws in the wind might help us.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Case For Divorce in the Irish Republic</i> the author, William Duncan, refers to the debate on The Social Welfare Bill, 1970, now completely out of date, and the Estimate of the then Minister, Deputy Colley, that about 1,000 wives would qualify for the deserted wife's allowance.  The book states:</P>
    <P>The scheme began operating on October 1, 1970.  Within six months the 1,000 mark had been passed and by the end of 1976 the combined figure for wives in receipt of the Allowance and the Benefit (introduced in 1973) was 4,783.  In 1976, 962 wives applied for the Allowance or Benefit, and 717 were successful.  Though some of the applicants may have been re-applying it is reasonable to assure that the annual number of fresh applications, indicating additional cases of desertion, exceeds considerably the annual increase in the overall number of recipients, which in 1976 was 459.  This is because some applicants were unsuccessful and because some wives who received the Allowance or Benefit in 1976 must have ceased to qualify in 1976.</P>
    <P>So we see that the numbers of deserted wives are increasing all the time.  Personally I regard it as a very serious problem. I am aware of many frightening cases, it is startling how many one comes across. To my knowledge there are not many cases of deserted husbands, but many wives find themselves being left literally holding the baby.</P>
    <P>In the area of applications to the civil courts for High Court remedies of various kinds, which is a barometer of marital <Col N="2462" /> difficulties, in the ten years from 1968 to 1977 there were only 202 petitions for divorce a <i>mensa et thoro</i>, and the annual rate has been dropping.  But Mr. Duncan says:</P>
    <P>These figures clearly bear no relationship to the rate of marital breakdown. They reflect rather the prohibitive expense, the complexity and to some extent the irrelevance of the remedy. For similar reasons in the ten years from 1966 to 1975 there were only 29 petitions for civil annulment, and 4 petitions for a decree for the restitution of conjugal rights....</P>
    <P>Statistics at court level are not necessarily the best barometer of the rate of marriage breakdown in Ireland.  This morning we spoke at length of violence between spouses and barring orders, and from now on we have protection orders.  Mr. Duncan's book continues:</P>
    <P>Despite the problems over the enforcement and durability of barring orders, the number of applications being made is high and, combined with the number of assault summonses taken out, indicates a still growing problem of family violence in the State. In 1976, the first year of their operation, 180 barring orders were applied for in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, and 49 were granted.  In 1978 the figures had risen to 403 and 103 respectively, and in the same year 61 summonses for common assault were taken out.</P>
    <P>If one seeks statistical help from the free legal advice centres, to whom a tribute should be paid, one finds statistics of staggering proportions.  It is clear that the single largest category of cases by whom advice is sought involves family law problems, most of them arising from marital breakdowns.  Duncan continues:</P>
    <P>In roughly the first three years of FLAC operations, 646 &ldquo;inter-personal&rdquo; cases were dealt with, representing 26 per cent of all cases.  Since then both the number and proportion of family cases have risen.  From October 1974 to October 1975 the eight centres by then operating dealt with <Col N="2463" /> 1,493 family law cases... and the total number of family cases from 1969 to 1975 was 4,069.</P>
    <P>These figures are now outdated.  New figures give us the true perspective of the seriousness of the problem.  On page 77. Duncan gives statistics from court records which show a similar pattern, a rising number of cases in this area all of which point to two things.  They point to the increasing number of such problems and to the fact that we are increasingly realising that this pattern exists.  That is a good thing &mdash; honesty can not be deemed to be bad.  What, then, should we do? What should the Bill include?  Our general approach to the problems perhaps could not be contained in one Bill.</P>
    <P>First, I deplore the absolutely inadequate education for marriage available to most couples, particularly teenagers.  It does not exist except by way of a number of voluntary pre-marriage courses.  Most young people going into marriage have very little idea of what is involved, have no education on the needs to understand the development of a relationship or the practical day-to-day problems of home economics, the advent of family, all of the events that will occur.  There is then the problem of adequate pre- and post-marriage counselling.  We plan for most things but not for that.  If you are only driving a car you get it serviced regularly. but for some reason we assume a marriage to be blessed from the first day, and if somebody happens to seek advice he or she is nearly always deemed to have failed.  It is extraordinary.  This involves not only pre-marriage but post-marriage situations.  There is rarely a human situation which cannot be enriched.  We do not want to foist ourselves on situations where people are contented and satisfied. but I urge that the State take a positive attitude to making available the counselling services that are so necessary. That is what cherishing the family means.</P>
    <P>My third suggestion involves a hard option but an essential one.  It involves realistic economic treatment of the family, income, children's allowances, the income of women in the home.  It should <Col N="2464" /> be Government policy to ensure that the economic value of women to our society, of women who remain at home, should be recognised financially.  It is desirable to prevent a situation in which either the husband or the wife feel obliged to go to work to maintain subsistence or basic living standards.  If either or both parties wish to go because they believe that is the best way to fulfil themselves, that is their full right and one respects it, but there are many couples who do not have an option.  The State should help in such circumstances.  Where a woman or a man &mdash; men are in a minority &mdash; would prefer to be with the family, particularly in the early formative years when children are young, but is obliged to go out to work to make ends meet, it would be better all round if the State were to assist in this respect.  It is possible to work out the financing of that.  We should work to arrive at a situation where there is at least a minimum family income for every family in the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out what I consider to be deficiencies in the Bill, a Bill which is entitled Family Law Bill. Such a Bill should have reference to a variety of family law issues.  The early warning systems we spoke about, whether in relation to child abuse or marriage stress or tension, should be an important stage in our consideration.  In conjunction with my earlier remarks on pre-marriage education, we should arrange some curricular change in the schools to alert people and educate them in these matters.</P>
      <P>There is then the question of legal aid. On a number of occasions today we found ourselves being vague about how a husband or wife could have access to legal aid.  We were vague about who would pay the costs, about whether a person would have to go to the District Court or to a judge, and widespread ignorance was displayed about our ability to obtain legal aid.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the increase granted for 1981-82 is 10 per cent while the rate of inflation for 1981 is expected to be in the region of 20 per cent?  In other words, the increase in the capitation grant to be applied for 1981-82 is roughly half the inflation rate. Is the Minister aware of the serious damage that will be caused in respect of maintenance and the general quality of educational services?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

The grant was £50 in 1975-76 and was £50 in 1976-77.  The amount was not increased until 1 January 1978, when I increased it to £66.50.  I started from a low base but I think I did reasonably well in increasing the grant from £66.50 to £70 and then to £77.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in this case.  It had originally been proposed to amalgamate five schools into the central school in Cootehill. After I took office in 1977, I authorised the acquisition of the old vocational school for use as the central school to cater for the amalgamation of Darley, Cootehill and Garvagh national schools. It is necessary to carry out adaptation works to the vocational school and in February 1980 I approved the sketch plans prepared by the Reverend Chairman's architect.  In July 1980 I sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have kept in close personal contact with all stages of this project and have been regularly in touch with the school authorities in the matter.  In March this year I authorised the invitation of tenders for the scheme and this is presently being dealt with by the Reverend Chairman's architect, in consultation with the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the tenders is a matter in the first instance for the Commissioners of Public Works who are my Department's technical advisers in matters relating to primary school building and they have been asked to deal with the matter as expeditiously as possible.  I can assure the Deputy, as I have assured the Reverend Chairman, that it is my firm intention that the building work will commence immediately on the completion of the planning stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

Circular Letter No. 27/80, issued following consultation with the appropriate managerial and teaching organisations, outlines the revised arrangements for Class III vocational teachers.  A copy of Circular Letter No. 27/80 is, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, being circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the requirements of the regulations for the register of secondary teachers, an applicant for registration must pass an oral test in the Irish language.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The first of these firms is a beef export factory and the second obtains much of its raw material from beef export factories. As slaughterings at all beef factories recently have been well down on the corresponding period last year supplies of raw material to the second firm have inevitably been affected.</P>
      <P>Slaughterings at meat factories are likely to be seasonally low over the next month or two but the seasonal upturn in throughput will then take place.  The supply position of the beef factories should also be helped by the elimination of the variable premium advantage enjoyed by factories in Northern Ireland, which I secured in the recent prices package.</P>
      <P>In the longer term the solution to the supply difficulties of the beef factories and related industries lies in a significant expansion in cattle production, the achievement of which is a major aim of my Department's policy and is being helped by the various measures taken by the Government and the EEC since last autumn.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Clover Meats Limited have serious financial problems and that his colleague, <Col N="2494" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Lorcan Allen, gave a commitment to the County Committee of Agriculture of Waterford recently that the finance for the running of Clover Meats Limited was secured for the next two years?  Can the Minister reiterate that commitment here and say the extent of the commitment to ensure that Clover Meats will continue to operate in Waterford, Wexford and in Tipperary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information in relation to the alleged statement of Deputy Allen but Clover Meats are like all other meat processing factories, suffering from the scarcity of supplies at present. We expect a pretty significant upturn in throughput in the next couple of months. The Government have introduced a considerable range of measures, the suckler scheme, the in-calf heifer scheme and so on and all those measures on top of the prices agreement this year should restore confidence to the point where cattle numbers will dramatically increase in the fairly near future.  There is no way in which we can have a miracle on this. Deputies know the cycle it takes to have sufficient quantities of beef and the overall picture is that factories will not be back to full production in some cases for some time to come.  In relation to Clover Meats the Deputy is aware that they have been in consultation with my Department over a considerable period and that the Government and my Department have come to their assistance on a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply to my Question No. 31 in which I asked for specific details of his intentions in the short, medium and long-term to rectify the very unsatisfactory position of the firm of Messrs. Robert Wilson and Sons of Cahir.  His reply gives no ray of hope for the continuing employment of both management and staff.  I checked with the firm less than half an hour ago and the details are that in January there were 140 employed in this firm.  That has now been reduced to 118 and ten or 12 more are facing redundancy.  They are on a three-day week and the prospects of reverting to a five-day week are very slim.  They see no hope of reverting to it for the remainder of this year.  The weekly intake at maximum peak production of raw material was 1,600 to 2,000 tonnes of raw material. This is now reduced to 650 tonnes per week.  Will the Minister outline and specify exactly what aids and subsidies, financial or otherwise, he or his Government will give to this firm to ensure the continued employment of both management and staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, at this time of year it is not abnormal to have a drop in the supplies of beef to our factories.  As the factory in which the Deputy is interested is directly involved in purchasing products from the main meat factories, they are affected by the present scarcity.  Every year at this time we have this element of seasonality. This year it is more emphasised because of the increase last year in the total slaughtering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken a number of steps, <Col N="2496" /> which I do not wish to re-emphasise as they have been included in my answer to Deputy Collins, which will significantly improve the position.  But there is no miracle by which the problem can be eradicated immediately.  If the Deputy has any proposals &mdash; and they were fairly absent in a recent debate on agriculture in this house &mdash; I would be glad to consider them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware, as the Minister is, of the element of seasonality, but this seasonality is continuing throughout the whole year.  The measures, which are very nebulous and vague and which the Minister likes to trot out before us, may perhaps in the long term at the end of a three-year term bear some fruit. However, I am worried about the immediate, the short and medium term.  What hope can the Minister give, representing the Government of all the brains and talents, to the management and staff of the firm I have mentioned of their continuing employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as concerned as the Deputy about the question of redundancies in that sector.  Because of that, as a general form of confidence, the measures I have outlined have been introduced. However, there is no way in which one can put on our fields sufficient numbers of cattle immediately to meet all those requirements.  We are determined to do all we can to ensure that the throughput is increased as quickly as possible.  I have no doubt that the measures I have outlined will do that.  It very often appears that every fine day, no matter how fine it is, is replaced by a wet day as far as Fine Gael are concerned.</P>

    <P>Under EEC rules it is not permissible to place any restriction on imports of fresh or processed vegetables from other member states.  Apart from potatoes, for which there is as yet no common organisation <Col N="2500" /> of the market, imports of vegetables from third countries are also subject to Community rules and restrictive action can only be taken by the European Commission. Such action would be taken only if it could be proved that imports were causing a serious distortion of the market. In the case of potatoes, I made an order dated 6 March 1981 entitled the Potatoes (Regulation of Import) Order, 1981, which enables me to exercise a quantitative control on imports from non-EEC countries.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> On the last occasion I had just stood up to move amendment No. 14 when I was asked to report progress but I am not surprised that there appears to be some uncertainty about the stage we were at then having regard to how extremely unruly were the Members on the other side of the House on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Section 35 provides that:</P>
      <P>Every letter written by a person in a special district or a registered psychiatric centre shall be delivered or posted unopened and the medical officer in charge of the centre shall cause the necessary facilities for writing, delivery or posting to be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All through Committee Stage and on the Report Stage so far.  I have been complaining that this Bill appears to be carelessly drafted and put together.  We have more evidence of this carelessness in section 35.  I refer to the words &ldquo;every letter written by a person.&rdquo; I want to define &ldquo;person&rdquo; because, as the section reads, <Col N="2530" /> the provision applies to everyone who is resident in the institution.  In other words, such people as the medical officer in charge, the nurses and the staff in general will be included.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to add after &ldquo;person&rdquo;, the words, in brackets, &ldquo;being a patient&rdquo;.  This would make the matter clear.  I hope that when we are referring to the posting of letters on a compulsory basis we are talking about the posting of letters written by patients in the institution. There should be no problem so far as the Minister is concerned in accepting this amendment.  There seems to be a certain urgency on his part about putting this Bill through, despite the fact that both he and his predecessor were slow enough in bringing it before the House. But that urgency, I think, has been overtaken by other events with the result that there appears not to be the same urgency now as there was only some days ago when we were last debating the Bill.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge on the Minister that he accept my amendment.  The section goes on to provide that every letter written by a person in a special, district or registered psychiatric centre shall be delivered or posted unopened and that the medical officer in charge shall ensure the provision of the necessary facilities in that respect.  In amendment No. 15 I am endeavouring to provide that, if the medical officer in charge of an institution is satisfied that a patient is so mentally deranged or mentally ill that he does not appreciate his actions and that he is simply writing letters just for the sake of writing them or for some other strange reason and that the writing of those letters will be the cause of inconvenience to all and sundry&mdash;to those within the hospital as well as to those to whom the letters are addressed &mdash; the obligation as set out in the section would be removed from the medical officer, that is, the obligation to post letters written by a patient suffering from delusions about people to whom he decided to write letters, perhaps every day in the week.</P>
    <P>Regardless of any interpretation that might be put on this section as it stands, there is no doubt but that it imposes an obligation on a medical officer in charge <Col N="2531" /> of one of these institutions to ensure that the letters of every person in that institution are posted and, apparently, posted free of charge.  In addition, the section proposes to impose on the medical officer an obligation to provide this service for people who are so mentally ill as not to understand what they are doing, or for patients who are suffering from delusions to such an extent that they are compulsive writers of letters to all and sundry or to some person against whom they have a grievance or, perhaps, some person they think they may be able to help.  Such a patient might decide that he should write to the President of the country at least every day, and under this section as drafted the medical officer would be in breach of the section if he did not provide the necessary facilities to allow those letters to be written and posted.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any other explanation for the section or if he can tell me, or any independent person, that the section as drafted does not mean what I say it does, I would like to hear it.  If the Minister can say that the section will not have the effect I say it will have I would be glad to hear it.  I do not want to send a Bill from this House containing a section which states that a medical officer will have to provide a service for posting the letters of every person in the institution whether that person is a patient or a member of the staff.  I do not want the Bill to contain a section which imposes on the medical officer in charge of an institution an obligation to co-operate with a patient who is ill, does not understand what he is doing and is making a perfect nuisance of himself.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well what is behind the section.  The object is to see to it that, if a patient wants to legitimately write a letter to friends or relations for social purposes, he is not prevented from doing so.  Even more so, the object is to provide that if a patient has a grievance and wants to write a letter to the Minister, to the CEO of the local health board, to his local TD or somebody else to draw their attention to a grievance so that it can be investigated he will have the right to do <Col N="2532" /> so.  However, the section goes further in that if the person concerned does not know what he or she is doing they can go on writing letters daily for years to everybody and those letters must be posted. Presumably the person who receives them will stop opening them but the patient is only making a nuisance of himself and is only causing trouble and inconvenience to the staff of the hospital and to the postal staff.  The postal service is bad enough without further unnecessary burdens being added to it.  My first amendment may not be as important as the second one but it is necessary to clarify the section and spell out that it only applies to patients and not to everybody in the hospital.</P>

      <P>Part IV deals with the safeguards for patients. It is reasonably obvious in the context of the Bill that section 35 refers to the correspondence of patients in psychiatric centres.  However, strictly speaking the Deputy has a valid point.  I am, therefore, willing to accept an amendment which will make it clear that section 35 refers to patients specifically.  The best way to achieve this is to substitute the word &ldquo;patient&rdquo; for &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  If that is acceptable to the Deputy I am happy to accept such an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 15 the word &ldquo;patient&rdquo; would carry forward there instead of &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  I am not prepared to accept that amendment.  I am surprised that the Deputy has persisted with it.  It would involve the creation of cumbersome machinery which at best would be wasteful of medical skills and which on the other hand could reasonably be represented as an attempt to ensure that reasonable complaints by patients could be suppressed by the medical establishment to which they were unfavourable. My principal objection to the proposed amendment arises from the fact that if I accepted the amendment I would unnecessarily and on a trivial matter be statutorily permitting a differentiation to be created between those who are being treated for psychiatric illness and those who suffer from other illnesses.  At an earlier stage in the discussion I told the <Col N="2533" /> Deputy that I appreciated the fact that there may be a certain number of letters which could be far from reasonable and be regarded as a nuisance but the good sense of those dealing with them would probably handle that situation.  I would rather have a number of those letters coming to me as Minister than to impose any form of censorship on the letters.  I am happy to accept the first amendment but would not agree to the second one.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am obliged to the Minister for accepting that amendment because it puts a bit of sense and clarity into the section.  However, I am surprised he is not prepared to accept amendment No. 15 which has the same object in view.  As it stands the section imposes an obligation on the medical officer to provide material for the writing of letters without limitation.  It provides also that letters written by mentally ill patients who may not know what they are doing to be posted without limitation.  I object strenuously to provisions being written into a Bill which we know will not be observed. We had a similar debate yesterday on the Finance Bill.  The Minister told me that a certain thing would be all right but that there would be flexibility about it.  We should not write provisions into a Bill which clearly mean one thing and then ask people to use their commonsense in the interpretation of them.  That is not good enough.  The commonsense should be used here so that we can produce a Bill which is sensible and intelligent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong if a section is to be left to the interpretation of the medical officer and it is wrong if he is to be encouraged to put an interpretation on it which <Col N="2534" /> requires an abuse of simple language.  In this section we are inviting the medical officer to interpret a direction to post all letters as a licence to post some letters. That will lead to the medical officer eventually saying, on looking at the terms of the Bill, that the whole thing was nonsense, that he was not supposed to report every little minor assault to the Minister's office.  I accept that the debate on the Bill is not part of the law but some such people on reading the Official Report will see that the Minister has said that commonsense is to be used in regard to this section and that the medical officer is to have a discretion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Does the Minister think that this would eventually lead to a devaluing of these letters?  If a responsible person whose business it is to see that patients are looked after properly and to investigate their genuine complaints, gets dozens of letters from a particular psychiatric <Col N="2535" /> centre each week and opens them for a few months and then throws them into the wastepaper basket the minute he sees the address, does the Minister not think that, instead of conferring rights on and protecting patients, this will reduce this whole system of complaints to a farce and make it meaningless?  That is what we are doing.  I cannot understand it.  The section probably could be drafted a little bit better than I would draft it, but it could not be drafted any worse than it is because that sort of crazy thing is contained in it.  I am surprised that the Minister would not have another look at this and get some sort of system for dealing with patients' complaints that would make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a category of people some percentage of whom are bound to be so unwell as not to know what they are doing.  We know from the Minister that letters are being written at present which are probably ignored, and rightly so.  Where are you going to draw the line between the ones that may be ignored and those that may not be ignored unless you have some formal consideration of it by the person in charge of the institution? Probably the person exercising the discretion now is the most junior custodian in the place.  Probably he gets a letter from Mary Ann so-and-so and he throws it into the wastepaper basket.  Where is that going to stop?  Where are you going to draw the line?  This section 35 is being written into the Bill for the alleged purpose of affording protection to patients and is going to end up as a meaningless bit of jargon that nobody could be expected to honour as it stands there. Even if the Minister said that he would make regulations and that no letter could be ignored without being put on the table of the RMS and if a person becomes too fond of writing letters he will have to look into the thing and decide whether that person's letters can be ignored, that would be a step in the right direction. This sounds grand if you just read it superficially and do not consider what it means, but certainly it is not going to be operated.  I do not know who is going to <Col N="2536" /> adjudicate on it or where the line is to be drawn.  I am disappointed at the Minister the more I think about it.  When you take it first it is a laugh that somebody could write thousands of letters &mdash; I am told that is going too far &mdash; but when you sift it a bit you will find that somebody away down the line, may be the person affected by one of the letters going out, is going to adjudicate and the whole thing is defeated.  Then it is not such a farce, not such a trivial complaint, not such an unreasonable objection; it is a well-founded complaint, and probably we would be better without this section altogether than to have it the way it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I would like to say just a few things.  I know that I am confined in my remarks to talking about what is in the Bill and that means that I can say very little because there is very little in the Bill.  It is a Bill that replaces three or four other lengthy Acts, the basic one being that of 1945.  This Bill has been a long time awaited by the medical profession and other people, but when it is looked at and studied we find that it deals largely with the admission and discharge of patients who have to be committed to psychiatric institutions, and that is about 5 per cent of the patients that we find in psychiatric institutions.  There is nothing <Col N="2537" /> in the Bill about improving the standard of care, nothing about improving the standard of treatment, nothing about imposing an obligation on the health boards to modernise the wretched places in which unfortunate people are kept, which are not fit for criminal purposes, never mind medical purposes.  There is nothing about that in the Bill; therefore I cannot say a lot about it.</P>
      <P>One thing in this Bill which I am very perturbed about is that it is provided now for the first time that voluntary patients may discharge themselves from these institutions on 24 hours' notice.  That is a slight improvement on the Bill as it was introduced, because the Bill as introduced provided that voluntary patients could discharge themselves from these institutions without any notice.  On both Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill I went to considerable trouble to try to impress on the Minister that that was dangerous, and I pointed out to him cases I knew where patients walked out of an institution, with fatal consequences for the patient's wife in one instance.  I urge on the Minister to provide that a person going into a psychiatric institution should be obliged to give 72 hours' notice of his intention to discharge himself.  That provision, which I sought to get the Minister to put into the Bill, is in accordance with the best advice available from the Association of Consultant Psychiatrists, who thought it was dangerous and unwise that a patient could discharge himself without notice and advised that a period of 72 hours was reasonable to enable the consultant in charge to observe the patient to see whether he was fit to be discharged and whether it was safe in his own interests and in the interests of other people or another person that he should be discharged.  The Minister steadfastly resisted a 72-hour notice provision and, under pressure from people other than me, he apparently agreed to provide for a 24-hour notice instead of 72 hours. When he was under pressure from me about the advice given by the Association of Consultant Psychiatrists he said that they were reasonably happy with 24 hours.  That is as far as the Minister did or could go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2538" /> I am not going to drag out this discussion. The Minister has insisted on 24 hours' notice and he refused point blank to provide a longer notice.  The basis of his argument is that he wants to encourage people to become voluntary patients. That could very well mean that many people will go in as voluntary patients who really should not be at liberty to walk in and out as they like.  But because they go in as voluntary patients they can discharge themselves on 24 hours' notice. That might not be in the interests of the patient and it might not be in the interests of other people; it might be a danger to the patient and dangerous to other people. I want to go on record as saying that I think the Minister is taking a big responsibility on himself.  I hope that he or one of his successors will not live to regret this provision.  We are not dealing with normal patients.  We are not dealing with patients who can exercise a balanced judgment as to their own welfare or about other people.  Still, the Minister proposes to treat them as if they were in a position to come to these balanced judgments.  I regret very much that the Minister will not give in to reasonable argument here. There are many other things in the Bill that I could talk about but if I were to pick out one provision of the Bill which I feel strongly about and which I think should be ventilated in public and the public warned about, it is this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity on the Final Stage to register my appreciation of the work of the individuals and the organisations who made comments and suggestions on improving measures contained in the Bill.  I have always invited and welcomed constructive criticism of the Bill and I have been particularly heartened by the thoroughness and scope of the submissions made on the Bill.  It will be found that the various groups, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the other medical associations, have expressed themselves happy, since the discussions took place in this House, with the measures I took, particularly with the compromise which the Deputy mentioned and which we agreed <Col N="2539" /> to when we met on 21 January, that is, the compromise in relation to the 24 hours notice.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides new measures in the provisions for registration and supervision of psychiatric institutions.  These are important new measures and they should not readily be lost sight of.  The Bill also provides for the matters concerned with the admission and discharge procedures in psychiatric institutions.</P>
      <P>Finally, there are provisions in the Bill which will protect patients against unnecessary detention and, indeed, we have heard of too many instances of that occurring in the past.  Overall the Bill is aimed at bringing the mental services up to the state which exists in the progress of mental health currently.  Another very important aspect is that there will be a national system of review boards and this will be a great safeguard and protection for patients.  It is welcomed by all concerned as a very worthwhile development.  In future there will only be one type of patient, the detained patient.  Others will be treated as in the general services.  This fits in with the developments that have taken place in the general hospitals where we are developing acute psychiatric units in most of our new or extended or improved general hospitals.  What is in this Bill is very much in line with what is taking place throughout the health services.</P>
      <P>Many references were made during the Second and Committee Stages of the Bill to the absence of any reference to or provisions for the mentally handicapped. I would repeat what I said earlier in this regard, that the position of the mentally handicapped will be comprehensively dealt with in the forthcoming Green Paper on the disabled.  The publication of the Green Paper will afford an excellent opportunity for Deputies to offer views on this subject if they wish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like particularly to thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for his comments and his, as usual, in-depth analysis of every aspect of the Bill.  I think he will recognise that I certainly went some of <Col N="2540" /> the way to meet him by accepting amendments. I regarded some of the other issues as of particular importance and, in that sense, I was not prepared to accept some amendments.</P>

      <P>The question of legal aid is important. We dealt in detail with family courts and family tribunals on the Courts Bill and I will not go into it again except to say we still find that marital disputes are being settled by the courts.  This is a completely inappropriate forum.  Other aspects of legislation relating to the rights of all the family and the question of income and property &mdash; I include the children here, who are not just the property of parents but are human beings in their own right &mdash; relate to family law and there is no suggestion in this Bill that we will hear any more about any of those matters at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is misnamed.  It is not a family law Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to eliminate certain aspects of family law and update others.  Many of them are largely irrelevant matters of family law. Concern for the family and understanding of the family is at the kernel of this Bill.  What exactly do we mean when we talk about the family?  What are the areas we should be looking at apart from what is in the Bill?  There are a number of valid comments one could make arising from the literature in this area that has been produced over the years.  I will refer briefly to one or two of them.  The papers in relation to a conference on the family, which was held in Kilkenny are published in <i>Social Studies</i>, volume 2. No. 6. December 1973.  Varying definitions of the family are set out in it, all of which are at the kernel of our understanding of how we can protect the family and help those in difficulty.  Father Donal Murray told that conference that the family is the setting which provided the essential sense of being accepted.  He said that home, as Robert Frost put it, is the place where, when you come home, they have to lead <Col N="2542" /> you into.  The family, said Father Murray, is a whole network of relationships.  The family is many things.  The sociology of the family and the literature on the family is very comprehensive.  The family, as a unit, is recognised in all societies, not perhaps in the strict sense of the unit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not argue on this at all.  I have given the Deputy every latitude and always do but <Col N="2543" /> he is now very remote from the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation we are looking at in relation to family law is too restrictive and too narrow, possibly because, although we stand up and pay lip service to the family we do not truly understand the social context of the family, the need for legislative reform and for change in social attitudes throughout a wide spectrum.  We are not getting anything like that under the heading of this Family Law Bill.  The Bill relates to criminal conversation, engaged couples, breach of promise and no more.  I submit that the title is wrong and should be renamed.  I propose to enter an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage so that we can at least be honest about what we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that legislation is the answer to all family or marital difficulties. It is probably one of the most difficult areas to legislate for.  I regret what I consider to be major omissions from a Bill entitled the Family Law Bill. We are dealing in this Bill with the latter end of marriages which have come to grief.  We would be much better employed earlier on in a helpful and preventive manner.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission report on this area outlines the thinking behind the legislation which exists on the Statute Book.  They suggested that there should be a replacement Act.  I am glad to see that is now happening.  I believe society will be the better for it.  I do not believe this Bill would be before us today were it not for the modest efforts of my party in introducing a Private Members' Bill in March 1980.  The Bill deals with questions which were the subject of reports of the Law Reform Commission and, in general, they will have the support of my party.  The Bill is a minor contribution to family law legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action for criminal conversation and the enticement and harbouring of a spouse are to be abolished.  I am struck by the implicit change of emphasis between the Second Stage speech of the Minister of State and the reply of the <Col N="2544" /> Minister for Justice to the debate on the Private Members' Bill in March 1980. The implication then was that what the Law Reform Commission said would probably guide the Government and would generally frame their approach to this matter.  It is significant that that has not happened.  I do not wish that to be construed as criticism of the Government. I am pleased they had the courage not to be hidebound by recommendations from either the Law Reform Commission or any other group.  This is in no way a reflection on the quality of the work of the Law Reform Commission. They have to do their job as they see it and the Minister and the Government have to do theirs as they see it and the two are not necessarily the same.</P>
    <P>The question of breach of promise and aspects of gifts to engaged couples is common sense.  If we managed our affairs properly it would hardly be necessary for us to introduce legislation and to concern ourselves with the return of property in situations where engagements break down or to worry ourselves too much about breach of promise questions.  The issues should be much more fundamental, but apparently we are not allowed to raise those in the context of a Bill which calls itself the Family Law Bill.  I find myself considerably restricted in my approach to the question.</P>
    <P>There is a volume of interesting relevant information within and outside this country which could guide us on positive, sustained and sensitive progress in relation to family law.  I would like to ask what other steps the Minister has in mind, what other legislation might be on the stocks, and when we might see it, in relation to these questions, whether they relate to family law, family courts or tribunals, nullity, marriage breakdowns, counselling and so on.</P>
    <P>As someone who had pleasure in meeting the chairman of the Law Reform Commission, I want to say that we owe the commission a debt of gratitude for the sensitive work they have done in this area.  Without their efforts this Bill probably would not be before us.  It clearly reflects, and this is different from what the Law Reform Commission suggested, <Col N="2545" /> a distinct political decision by the Government which coincides with a decision taken by this party some time ago.  I am pleased to see we are at one on that principle.  Unfortunately, there are many other areas needing attention.</P>
    <P>With a view to getting progress at the earliest possible date, I reiterate the suggestion I made today of the possibility of having a Minister for Family and Children who would be able to advance on a variety of relevant fronts the need for legislative attention to family matters and family law.  This Bill is useful because it brings to the fore this area of discussion. I do not believe, nor has the Minister claimed, that the abolition of actions for criminal conversation or a change in the law relating to aspects of gifts to engaged couples, is much more than what might be called a tidying away of anomalies which should have disappeared long ago in a civilised society.  However, better late than never.</P>
    <P>The way is now clear to deal with the central issues.  This House has dodged that responsibility up to now but the Government have not only dodged it but have vehemently slammed the door on the Fine Gael proposal to form an all-party committee to discuss the aspects of marriage which need attention.  Perhaps that suggestion, which was meant sincerely and honestly, could be reconsidered so that we can take family law out of the arena of party politics and look at what is happening in society.  If we do that we will see that the abolition of criminal conversation is a request, but it is down the list in the publication <i>AIM News</i>, from the AIM Group, who made a submission to the Law Reform Commission.  Neither is it the first item on the lists of many people involved in this area.  Are we to conclude that there are other Bills being brought forward?  The Fianna Fáil manifesto gave certain undertakings, but I suppose that document will be replaced by the up-to-date manifesto we will be reading in a few days' time.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed with the progress we have made on family law.  This may be the last opportunity I will have to pay a tribute to the Minister of State for the work he has done in introducing legislation, <Col N="2546" /> legislation which neither I nor my party would be satisfied with, by giving us the opportunity to discuss this area, by bringing to the public attention the concepts and problems of family law and by making people aware that there are issues in this area which need to be tackled.</P>
    <P>At last we have got family law in the legislation on the Dáil Order Paper.  Significant steps were taken over the last six or eight years in this area.  When the Coalition Government were in power we had the Adoption Acts, 1974 and 1976, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and the Family Home Protection Bill, 1976.  To that extent family law is not new but there is now a much greater awareness among our people of the need for dealing with the problems in this area.  It is from that point of view that I am a little disappointed our answer is along the lines of this Bill.  This is something other countries got rid of, not just years ago but decades ago and in one case at least two centuries ago.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the inequities in our legislation which this Bill seeks to deal with is based on the notion of woman being the property of man.  Anything we can do to reverse that barbaric notion is a step in the right direction.  It will help couples who have undertaken to get married to reconsider their decision, if that reconsideration is in their best interests. It will remove the pressures on such parties to proceed on a course of action about which they may have regrets, but which they are following because social or other pressures are being applied, including a possible breach of promise action.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe it is impossible to deal with these matters in isolation.  The sections of the Bill dealing with engaged couples, and the assistance this Bill will afford them, will apply largely to teenage couples and to people in their early twenties. We should look at a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and at resolution 71 in the programme on marriage of our EEC partner states.  In nearly all those countries &mdash; and this is a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&mdash;the <Col N="2547" /> minimum age for marriage is 18 years.  It is not so here.  I am not suggesting that age is the only criterion which should be considered, because I know people of 18 who are as mature and sensible as people of 48.  On balance there is a strong argument for reconsidering our casual approach and the collusion we afford to teenage marriages.  It is hypocritical and wrong that all of us, public representatives, priests and so on, should be involved in the celebration of a marriage when we know in our heart of hearts it probably is not going to succeed.  On average, statistics show that more than 50 per cent of teenage marriages do not succeed.</P>
    <P>Some sections of the Bill will help to relieve pressure on couples &mdash; many of whom I know &mdash; who may feel that because they entered into some kind of commitment in the newfound post-puberty feeling, they should proceed with it, when common sense and good counsel would have told them it was not time yet. At the same time, we do not want to discourage young people; we do not want to spoil the prospects of people who may have a chance to have a successful marriage. However, our present attitude is clearly too casual.  A simplistic change in the marital age will not make an appreciable difference to the problem, but proper pre-marital education might help to prevent some of the later problems.</P>
    <P>Family courts and such things should be dealt with comprehensively and will be if there is a change of Government. As a party we have entered into commitments in regard to legislation affecting children which, although it might not answer all the questions, at least would go a lot further than dealing with issues such as criminal conversation and other minor elements of family problems, most of which we should be ashamed to put on our Statute Book in this year of our Lord.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad the Bill has been introduced.  I wish it well, though I honestly think it is not central to the family law area.  I do not wish to be petty about it.  At least it is here, which is more than can be said for a lot of other measures that were promised, I would like to think <Col N="2548" /> that our modest effort in the form of a Private Members' Bill contributed something. I have been told by the Chair that I am not entitled to develop questions in relation to the definition of families and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have spoken for the welcome they have given this Bill.  Before dealing with the specific points that have been made I will refer to the general points made by Deputies Horgan and Mitchell on the delay in bringing forward legislation to abolish criminal conversation and the fact that last year an Opposition Private Members' Bill proposing its abolition was not accepted by the Government.  The Minister for Justice made it clear that the Private Members' Bill dealt only with the question of criminal conversation and not with the related actions for enticement and harbouring.  On a number of other occasions he emphasised that he did not propose to put proposals before the Government until he had received and considered the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  It would then be a matter for the Government to decide on the type of legislation to be introduced. As I said earlier, this Bill in so far as it deals with the area in question represents the Government's considered response to the recommendations of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now turn to the specific points made in the debate.  Deputy Horgan criticised us because it is only now that the action for criminal conversation is being abolished in Ireland.  I would point out to him that damages for adultery were available in England until 1970.  In the debate and in the public discussion we have had in this connection, that was never referred to; not that what happens elsewhere should be a yard-stick for this Government nor a reason to delay desirable or necessary legislation.  Damages for adultery were also available in New Zealand and Australia up to 1975 and are still available in jurisidictions in America and Canada.  We are not that much out of step with other countries in this area. Deputy Horgan attempted to draw a <Col N="2549" /> comparison between these actions and the rule that does not allow a husband generally to be charged with rape of his wife.  Whatever about the actions in question being expressions of what he called the long-standing right of married men to treat their wives more as chattels than human beings that is not the position in regard to the rule on rape within marriage. There is a doubt as to whether the action for criminal conversation was available to a wife.  It was never constested in the Irish courts by a woman.  The number of actions that have been taken are few.  The fact that there was provision for such action was something that the Government and most Deputies and women's organisations particularly felt should not be there.  Nevertheless, it was vitally important that whatever decision the Government took would be based on a full examination of the matter.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputies Mitchell and Horgan were not as close as Deputy Keating to the discussions in this area.  I would have been in a better position to reply to them here this evening if they had made a contribution more closely associated with this Bill.  I compliment Deputy Keating on his knowledge of what he was speaking about.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Internal Agreement amending the Internal Agreement on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid of 20 November, 1979.</P>
      <P>Before going into the details of the agreement which is the subject of this motion, I would first like to briefly explain the overall context in which it is set.</P>
      <P>The second ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé which was approved by the Dáil on 6 December 1979 came into force on 1 January this year.  This convention governs relations in trade, aid and other areas of co-operation between the European Community and 60 African, Caribbean and Pacific States.  Under the terms of the convention, a country whose economic structure and production are comparable to those of the ACP States may, with the approval of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, accede to the convention by concluding an agreement with the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Zimbabwe applied for accession immediately on achieving independence in April 1980 and on 4 November an agreement on the accession of Zimbabwe to Lomé II, together with a parallel agreement on products within the province of the European Coal and Steel Community, were signed in Luxembourg.  Under these accords Zimbabwe will be entitled to the same rights, and subject to the same obligations, as other ACP States signatory to the convention.  These agreements are now in the process of ratification by member states and copies have <Col N="2553" /> been laid before the Dáil in accordance with Constitutional procedure.</P>
    <P>At the same ceremony in Luxembourg, the Community and Zimbabwe also concluded an interim agreement which extended the trade provisions of the Lomé Convention to Zimbabwe as from 1 January 1981.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Article 186 of the convention, the accession of Zimbabwe will require the Community to increase the amount of financial and technical aid pledged to the ACP States &mdash; currently standing at 5,227 million European currency units (ECU) or IR£3,627 million. Of this figure 4,542 million ECU is to be distributed through the Fifth European Development Fund (EDF) while the remaining 685 million ECU will take the form of loans granted through the European Investment Bank (EIB).</P>
    <P>The 5th EDF was established by the Internal Agreement on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid which was signed in Brussels by the member states of the Community on 20 November 1979 and approved by the Dáil at the same time as the Second Lomé Convention. In addition to comprising the funds allocated for the ACP States, the fund also has 94 million ECU set aside for distribution to the overseas countries and territories of Community member states, under special arrangements along the lines of those established for the ACP States under the Lomé Convention.  The total volume of the 5th EDF at present, therefore, is 4,636 million ECU of which Ireland will contribute 0.6 per cent.  That is 27.8 million ECU or IR£19.3 million.</P>
    <P>The agreement before the Dáil today is an amendment to the Internal Financial Agreement of November 1979.  This amending agreement was signed in Brussels on 16 December 1980 and it is intended that it should take effect on Zimbabwe's formal accession to the Lomé Convention.  The result of this latest agreement will be to increase the size of the 5th EDF by 85 million ECU, IR£59 million, to 4,721 million ECU.  On the basis of our 0.6 per cent contribution Ireland will be due to provide 28.3 million ECU, IR£19.7 million.  This represents a net increase in our contribution of <Col N="2554" /> 510,000 ECU or IR£354,000.  It is expected that this additional contribution will be called up over a period of seven to eight years.</P>
    <P>The purpose of increasing the size of the fund by 85 million ECU is to ensure that other ACP States do not receive less assistance from the fund as a result of Zimbabwe's eligibility to EDF aid.  The size of the increase was determined in accordance with the criteria used to allocate the existing resources of the 5th EDF among the various ACP States&mdash;that is, population and gross national product <i>per capita</i>.  Attention was also given to the particular opportunity for regional development programmes on a supranational basis afforded by Zimbabwe's location in the heart of southern Africa.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that an increase in the amount of aid which the Community makes available to the ACP States was a necessary condition for Zimbabwe's accession to the Lomé Convention.  This is indeed the case but there is a more positive aspect.  As Zimbabwe moves into its second year as an independent nation it needs financial assistance to help it realise the vast potential of its human and physical resources.  Approval of the agreement before the Dáil today will represent a pledge, on behalf of the people of Ireland, to provide over IR£350,000 towards these needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I support the proposal before the House to assist this new nation.  We are happy that the proposals will do at least a little in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard about the problems of Zimbabwe and I hope that the contents of the agreement and our contribution will be adequate.  I am a little uncertain that the additional contribution we will be called upon to make &mdash; according to the Minister over a period of seven or eight years &mdash; will be adequate and will be available to Zimbabwe as speedily as it is needed.  We are aware of the economic stresses and strains of that country and of the plea of their Government not just for the formal ratification of the agreement but also for assistance to cope with the great problems encountered by <Col N="2555" /> any new country, many of which are unforeseen.  I should like to think that our efforts in encouraging this emergent nation will be designed not just to extend formally the internal agreement on the financing and administration of Community aid but will be sufficiently responsive and flexible so that if in the early years of Zimbabwe special efforts may be asked of us we will not be found wanting as a nation or as a Community.</P>
    <P>The sum we are being asked to pay over a period of years is small.  If the need arises to make available financial or other resources, particularly in the initial difficult period through which Zimbabwe is going, I hope we will have the courage and the wisdom to go beyond the call of minimum duty in terms of our membership of the EEC.  We are a relatively new nation and we experienced many economic and social difficulties during the years.  I believe there is a willingness on the part of our people to assist in this kind of undertaking.  Fine Gael are happy to support the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is a logical consequence of the final independence of black Zimbabwe, delayed for 11 years by the intransigence of the white population, regrettably with the support of the British Government.  Now that Zimbabwe has taken charge of its own nationhood, the least we can do is to give it full support and this is the net effect of the proposal before the House.  There can be no argument about agreeing with it and that is why we are co-operating with the Minister in dealing with the matter on what may be the last day of this Parliament. Perhaps the Minister will let us know if the approval of the Seanad is necessary&mdash;I suspect it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Zimbabwe has a key and critical role in the relationship of black Africa with South Africa and in regard to the ability of that part of the world to feed itself. The amount we are giving is quite small &mdash; an average of £50,000 over seven years.  I should like to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs coming to this House announcing a specific bilateral aid programme <Col N="2556" /> for the people of Zimbabwe, particularly with regard to food.</P>
    <P>In this country we are in a position to make a substantial technological exchange of expertise in the area of food processing and in primary food culture &mdash; I refer in particular to cattle and milk products.  The experience of both Zambia and Tanzania has been one of great difficulty in transferring from a peasant agricultural-based rural way of life into modern States while maintaining adequate food supplies.  We are a food exporting country and we have developed the expertise on our own.  We have comparatively clean hands in relation to Africa.  We should use all of those factors to develop the ability of the economy of Zimbabwe particularly with regard to food production.  I hope the speed with which the Minister has brought forward this proposal, particularly in view of the fact that we may be attending the last session of the present Dáil, is an indication of the commitment of his party towards the development of proposals of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Community could be deemed to be contradictory in its own attitude in that it has been moved to extend the size of the ACP Fund &mdash; Lomé V &mdash; because of the inclusion of Zimbabwe while, at the same time, it has not moved with the same degree of generosity within the Community to extend the size of the social and regional funds in relation to the accession of Greece.  However, that is a political argument for another day's discussion.  The Labour Party welcome the proposal before the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the spokesmen for Fine Gael and Labour for their support.  It is the obvious follow-on to our commitment in regard to the whole Lomé concept which we have encouraged within the EEC.  Ireland has a very good standing because of our association with many of the recipient countries who are under the ACP umbrella.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Zimbabwe is a logical country to be added to the Lomé Convention.  We propose to play our part in a direct way, as in our contribution here, and also to follow <Col N="2557" /> up with trade and diplomatic associations. This will be of practical benefit to Ireland as well as fulfilling our commitment under the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to Robert Mugabe and the political leadership in Zimbabwe.  That leadership has survived for more than a year in the difficult initial <Col N="2558" /> stage of nationhood.  All the indications are that Zimbabwe will survive and will be a nation with a real leadership role within the African community.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a distinction between peat lands&mdash;which by general definition carry at least 30 centimetres of peat over mineral soil or rock &mdash; and turbary, which comprises areas of peatland of sufficient depth &mdash; normally one metre at least &mdash; and burning quality to make it attractive for peat production.</P>
      <P>State forest development must avoid lands of agricultural quality and is confined to marginal lands which in the current situation are often of peat type.</P>
      <P>State afforestation could not continue on an acceptable scale without resort to peatland.  However, where there is existing turbary activity or evidence of local demand for it these matters are taken into consideration when lands are being acquired.  I have also made it known, in the light of the prevailing energy situation that sympathetic consideration would be given to applications from responsible bodies to have such areas made available for fuel production where this is shown to be the appropriate use.</P>
      <P>My Department has of course ongoing liaison with Bord na Móna to ensure that our acquisition needs do not conflict.</P>

      <P>A single person living with his family who claims unemployment assistance is assessed with the value of board and lodging.</P>
      <P>Each case is decided on its own particular merit and every assessment has regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.  Where the father or head of the household enjoys a steady income the assessment is in the proportion of the net family income which is estimated to be devoted to the upkeep of the single person. Further, the assessment of board and lodging of a single person does not normally exceed 12½ per cent of the net income of the household in which he or she resides.  It may, of course, be less particularly in the case of households with large numbers of dependants.</P>
      <P>A single person, being provided with board and lodgings by a parent or family may, accordingly, qualify for unemployment assistance provided that the assessment of weekly means does not exceed the appropriate maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance which now stands at £20.40 in urban or £19.75 in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that these arrangements are unfair or unjust.</P>
