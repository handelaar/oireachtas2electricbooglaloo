    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 3, 10 (resumed), 11, 12, 13 and 14.  Private Members' Business, No. 19 (resumed), will be taken between 7 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you will bear with me, Sir, if I raise with you at this stage three matters which I consider to be of considerable importance to the conduct of our business in the House, particularly with reference to our capacity and ability to discharge our parliamentary responsibility as the Opposition party.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to draw your attention to a rather minor matter which many Deputies might not regard as being of any great significance but which I think is indicative of the manner in which the business of this House is being conducted.  I refer to the Order of Business. Normally, the Opposition are entitled to receive a typewritten copy of the Order of Business in advance of the sitting of the Dáil.  In our time in Government we always endeavoured to let the Opposition have this typewritten information on the Order of Business of the day in advance. That action is of significance because it enables the Opposition, even in a somewhat hurried fashion, to arrange their programme of activity for the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> Increasingly it has become very difficult for us in Opposition to get the Order of Business from the Government.  This morning and yesterday afternoon at the time the House sat we did not have from the Government the typewritten Order of Business.  To ordinary Deputies and to commentators this may appear to be a trivial matter, but it is important to us because we cannot conduct our affairs properly as an Opposition unless we know what the Dáil is expected to deal with during the day.  This failure is indicative of the very slipshod manner in which this Government have been approaching the business of the House.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to raise with you again, as the protector in the House of the interests of Deputies, the manner in which the Taoiseach dealt with Question No. 2 on yesterday's Order Paper.  I suggest you will think that the present state of play in regard to the negotiations on a new national pay agreement is of very great importance to Deputies, to business and the commercial community and to the great body of employees, the wage earners.  I am sure you will agree it was perfectly legitimate for us on this side, in an orderly fashion, to ask the Taoiseach for his view of the situation and, if possible, to give us some indication of the Government's plans and intentions in regard to this matter.  We expected some reasonable reply, some level of information from the Taoiseach.  Instead, we were treated with grave discourtesy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his reply, referred to a Government statement.  Just before the House assembled a copy of this statement was given to me and to Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  In subsequent inquiries we ascertained that the statement had been given to the media, particularly to RTE radio, in time for the 1.30 news, before it had been placed on the Table of the House.  We have ascertained officially from the Library that that statement was placed in the Library at 2 p.m.  In advance of that it had been issued to the media. I would direct your attention first of all to the discourtesy involved in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, <Col N="1115" /> I recall that in the time of your predecessor long <i>ex parte</i> statements of this kind relating to matters not arising on the Order of Business were instantly ruled out of order.  I do not expect you will be ruling exactly like Deputy Faulkner but I think there should be some similarity in the way the Chair operates.  I say that with great respect to you and great appreciation of the leniency of your handling of such matters, but this system whereby the Leader of the Opposition can get up and make three long <i>ex parte</i> statements &mdash; we have not heard the third one yet, but I do not expect it to be any shorter than the first two&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>You have raised a point of order, but that does not involve making a statement.  I will answer your point of order.  The question being raised now is on the Order of Business and it refers to the Order of Business.  I have the power to allow this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey is complaining about the content of something the Taoiseach said yesterday and about his behaviour today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will permit Deputy Haughey to finish his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw your attention to a matter which is a breach of procedure and privileges in this House, namely that a statement was issued to the media before it was placed on the Table in this House.  Secondly, Sir, I want to ask your views as to the propriety of the Taoiseach answering a question by referring Deputies to a statement which most of us had not seen or the contents of which we were not aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter to which I wish to draw your attention and again ask for a ruling&mdash;I sought a ruling on this yesterday but failed to obtain it&mdash;is the matter of Private Members' Business today.  I trust the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism will recognise that I am perfectly within my rights in dealing with this evening's Private Members' Business <Col N="1116" /> because that is on the Order of Business. We had an unusual situation yesterday in which there appeared on the Order Paper an amendment in the name of Deputy Browne which was of a very specific import and sought to achieve a very specific objective.  It was in the form of an amendment to our Private Members' motion.  Subsequently we were circulated with a piece of white paper which was headed &ldquo;Private Members' Business&rdquo; and on which there appeared in the names of Deputies Browne and Kemmy an amendment to an amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that there are two substantial changes involved in this matter. In the first instance what we had on the Order Paper of the day was an amendment to our motion.  The second thing brought forward by the Deputy and one of his colleagues was an amendment to the Fine Gael amendment.  That was a significant difference.  In addition the terms of the matter were substantially changed.  The purpose of Deputy Browne's original amendment was clearly to set aside circular 24/81 by the Minister for Education because the amendment spoke of reintroducing that circular, clearly indicating that Deputy Browne sought by his amendment to have circular 24/81 set aside.  In the amendment to the amendment there was a completely different purpose imported and that was to tolerate the continuance of circular 24/81.  I do not want to go into the merits of either of these propositions but they are basically different.  I want to ask the Chair for a ruling on whether or not it was in order for Deputy Browne in particular to effect this last minute change both in the form of his amendment, the technical parliamentary form and, secondly, in the basic content.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that this leaves us as an Opposition party under great difficulty with regard to Private Members' Business, which is basically the time allotted to the Opposition to conduct their business, if we are to be subjected to this kind of treatment where amendments are put down on the Order Paper and, at the last <Col N="1117" /> minute, changed in substance and form. I should be grateful if the Chair would indicate the procedure to be followed in this regard in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards item No. 1, these are arrangements between the Government and Opposition.  Standing Orders merely require us to announce them to the Dáil at the commencement of business.  It is not a matter for the Chair.  On item No. 2, the Chair has no control over the form of answers given by the Taoiseach or any Minister.  On item No. 3&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair would deal with the statement and the placing of it in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an answer given by the Taoiseach and the Chair has no control over the form of any answer. If the Taoiseach or any Minister refuses to answer a question the Chair has no control over that either.  As regards item No. 3, Deputy Browne's second amendment was received very late.  Normally two days notice is required but the Chair has the power to accept an amendment at shorter notice.  Deputy Browne's second amendment was only received at 5.35 p.m.  The Government amendment was received very late and the Deputy would only have seen it yesterday.  In those circumstances I felt I should not rule out his second amendment because of the fact that the Government amendment was received so late.  I feel that the Opposition were discommoded by this and that it is a matter that should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that proper arrangements about motions and amendments can be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for those explanations.  In regard to the first, I accept that the Chair has no responsibility and unfortunately we, as the Opposition party, have to rely on the courtesy of the Government and have no alternative but to continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You did not, Sir, deal with my complaint <Col N="1118" /> about the release of the statement to the media before it was placed on the Table of the House, namely handing it in to the Library.  Perhaps you will deal with that for me.  I find it very difficult to follow your line of reasoning about the amendments.  Our motion was on the Order Paper for a long time.  The Government's amendment was on the Order Paper and Deputy Browne's amendment to our motion was on the Order Paper. All this was clearly understood and known to Deputies, the media and so on. I find it difficult to see how Deputies Browne and Kemmy should have been afforded this opportunity to make a last minute turn around.  We all know the political reason why they did it but I am not concerned with that at present.  I should like to know if the Chair would go a little further to help us in this matter and indicate to us now what is your view about the timing of the rest of Private Members' Business, in other words how do you envisage the time being allocated from now on until our motion is dealt with?  Unfortunately we had to delay the House for about ten minutes during Private Members Business yesterday on procedural matters.  It is not part of our policy to delay the House with procedural wrangles but we had to use up ten minutes yesterday evening because we failed to secure from anyone including your office, any information about the situation of Deputies Browne's and Kemmy's amendment to an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Government's amendment was received late on Monday evening, just before going to press, and Deputy Browne could not have seen it until Tuesday. That was the reason I accepted this second amendment.  As regards Private Member's Business, I am satisfied that the Opposition did not proceed to debate the motion on education and raised the question of order relative to Deputy Browne's second amendment.  I am satisfied it was a genuine procedural point and not an attempt to frustrate the proceedings of the Dáil and because of that I decided that Private Member's Business would have to be extended by 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>One further question and then I shall cease to bother the Chair any more.  If we come forward with a proposition to your office some time today about compressing the time so that our motion can be dealt with this evening by agreement with the Government would that be acceptable?</P>

      <P>As regards the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition, the third point is a matter for the Chair. It is a matter of order and I have no comment to make on it.  As regards the first point, the Leader of the Opposition has complained that he received the typed Order of Business only one or two minutes before the Dáil met.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of Order, that document was not the typed Order of Business.  It was the programme that the Taoiseach had for himself.  The typed Order of Business was handed to me five or ten minutes after I started speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Leader of the Opposition and I should be entitled to reply to the points he made. When we were in Opposition we received notice frequently only immediately before proceedings began.  We complained about this as the Leader of the Opposition is entitled to complain now. It is annoying that one should receive such short notice of the day's business but the Order of Business was transmitted by phone this morning at 9.45 and given to a messenger to pass to the Chief <Col N="1120" /> Whip of the Opposition.  That was at 9.50.  I shall inquire into the question of why it was not received 40 minutes later. I regret very much that such delay occurred.  While it was not due to any fault of ours, it should not have happened and I will ensure in so far it is in my power to do so, that it will not happen again. The problem arose in the offices of the House.</P>
      <P>Regarding yesterday, I am sorry if any discourtesy seemed to be offered to the Opposition.  There was no such intention but there seems to be some confusion of thought on the matter.  The position is that a statement was issued by the Government to the press and to RTE yesterday morning.  When replying to a question here later it seemed to me that it would be helpful to the House if as a courtesy the statement were available in the Library and made available also to the Leader of the Opposition and to the relevant spokesman.  It was not a question of telling the media what the reply in the House was to be but that is implied in what has been said.  To do so would have been a breach of privilege.  Perhaps the more appropriate procedure would have been, and I shall consider this in future, for me to have appended the press statement to be circulated with the report.  However, the procedure I adopted was one designed to facilitate Deputies opposite and the one that seemed the most appropriate at the time having regard to the fact that a press statement had been issued.  There is no obligation on us in respect of any press statement being issued to convey it to the Opposition, to put a copy in the Library or to append it to the reply to a question. It was simply as a matter of courtesy that that was done.  I am sorry that our courtesy was taken amiss but if some other procedure such as appending such a statement on certain occasions to a reply is thought to be better I am willing to do so.  There is no misunderstanding or suggestion that we communicated in advance to the press the reply given in the House. We did not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as they go, I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his replies <Col N="1121" /> and I apologise for engaging in what may appear to some people to be a procedural wrangle.  However, the matter is of some importance.  Question Time is a very important parliamentary process.  The Taoiseach is right in saying that he has no obligation to supply us with copies of his press statements and that neither is there any obligation on him to deposit such statements in the Library but a difficulty arose on this occasion in that in answer to a parliamentary question the Taoiseach relied on his press statement and that is the key factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that I may continue this serious discussion with the Taoiseach without interruption from the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism or anybody else.  The Taoiseach will accept that this was of fundamental importance both to this House and to the community generally.  It was a matter which was the subject of a great deal of press speculation beforehand.  Many of the commentators in the media indicated to us that the Taoiseach would be making an important statement in the House by way of reply to Deputy Fitzgerald's question. Our problem was that instead of answering the oral question in the normal way and thereby giving us the opportunity of teasing out the matter further with the Taoiseach, he relied on this press statement for his answer to the question. It is on that basis that, in our view, the breech of privilege arises.  If the Taoiseach had been prepared to answer the question in the normal way and then to refer to the press statement we would have no ground for complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the objections of the Leader of the Opposition are based on information that a major statement was to be made in the House but I am not aware of any intention to make a major statement in the House.  However, I am willing to consider the point he makes on the format of the reply.  It might have been better if the reply had taken <Col N="1122" /> the form of announcing the invitation to Professor Chubb and saying that a press statement had been issued containing some background.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment yesterday evening I had been referring to the situation regarding the infamous £9.60 that was promised to the women of Ireland by Fine Gael during the election campaign.  At that time Fine Gael ensured that they would not clarify the position with the result that the impression was created that most women would benefit from this provision. However, within days of the election the women knew that only the wives of PAYE workers would be in a position to benefit from this payment.  They realised also that the provision would not be implemented until 1982 and with an inflation figure of about 25 per cent the payment will be worth about £7.60 by then. The wives of farmers will not benefit from the provision, neither will the wives of men in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance or the wives of disabled persons or of those on DPMA from the health boards.  The proposal is divisive in that it differentiates between the wives of one section of the community and another.  There are serious doubts as to whether the Government will be able to implement the provision at all because of the opposition of the Inspectors of taxes who are not prepared now to implement this programme unless there is an increase in the staff which in this Bill under discussion has been banned from July 1981.  There seems to be some question as to whether this provision will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the wife of a PAYE worker goes into her local grocery store she can cash her cheque for £9.60 there for goods or she can go with it to the pharmacy for other items which would be luxury items.  The wife of the farmer, disabled or unemployed <Col N="1124" /> person would not be in a similar position of having this possible extra purchasing power.  Our society, God knows, has enough divisions without this one brought about by the incompetence of the Coalition Government.  They initiated this proposal, which is one of the most divisive proposals ever put forward by any Government.</P>
    <P>I want to refer again to the advertisements because they will be regarded as historical documents in time.  When I read the misleading statements contained in those advertisements I wonder about the credibility of the advertising agencies who were prepared to work along with the Fine Gael Party to mislead the Irish people, particularly Irish women.  One advertisement says, &ldquo;Women deserve better&rdquo; and then goes on about these benefits.  Certainly women deserve better than this £9.60 per week for some sections of the community.  Since the Government are on this course and have made this proposal they should at this stage revise and review their whole position in relation to this allowance.  In fairness and equity they must consider some provision which will permit a similar allowance to be given to the working wives of farmers and others who are staying at home.  Surely in fairness and justice these wives have a right to receive the equal of what is given to the wife of someone on PAYE.  As I stated during the election campaign, this was the greatest three-card trick ever exploited during an election campaign and surely it is seen now for what it is.  If the Government implement this scheme they should do so on an equitable basis right across the board and give women fairness and equality.  Furthermore, the £9.60 will not be worth £9.60 in 1982 but rather about £7.60 in today's value.  It should be boosted to equal the amount promised during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the most serious problem in this country today.  The Government should concentrate now on the creation of jobs.  I challenge them to state whether they have created one job anywhere in this State since they assumed office in July.  As far as I can see they have not created any employment.  In <Col N="1125" /> their campaign they promised us that they would give priority to the provision of employment for our young people and for the thousands in the State unemployed at present.  Instead we find that where the Government have direct involvement in the creation of employment they have decided to close the Tuam sugar factory in County Galway in 1982 with a loss of 280 jobs.  That is some job creation programme.  When the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, went to Tuam and met the chamber of commerce he informed them that he would not be assuming office as Taoiseach to close factories but to open factories.  But what does he do when he comes into power? With the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes, he sets about the destruction of one of the finest industries in the west, the greatest creator of employment and wealth over the years.  The Tuam factory has been giving direct employment to 280 people, part-time employment to roughly 300 people and indirect employment to 1,000 farmers in the whole region who relied on the production of beet for extra funds.  That is evidence of the Government's inability to create employment.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 24 May 1981 under a photograph of this so-called honest politician, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, in a section headed &ldquo;Jobs&rdquo; we read, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Special drive to reduce costs for manufacturing, tourism and transport will create jobs by making products competitive.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find a budget which increases VAT and petrol costs and brings back the tax on cars.  All that certainly is against the spirit of the statement in this election programme by Fine Gael. I remind the Taoiseach of the scurrilous campaign in which they attacked us from 1977 to 1981 in relation to our magnificent manifesto which we implemented to the letter, page by page, as quickly as possible after we assumed office in 1977. Never in the history of this State have so many promises been broken so quickly by any administration as by the present one.  They must have the record on that. Under the same heading they promised:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> All out attack on inflation to produce real jobs.</P>
    <P>Inflation is increasing at a rate that has not been equalled since the Coalition were in power from 1973 to 1977.  Further on the statement says:</P>
    <P>Concentrating Public investment in productive areas.</P>
    <P>We find the withdrawal of investment from semi-State organisations.  Those misleading statements were made during the campaign.  Now the chickens are coming home to roost when the Coalition Government are prepared to close a major industry in the west which is creating worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there are many other instances of cutbacks by the Government, including, unfortunately, the closure of many industries.  The Government themselves have members who are aware personally of the difficulties now being experienced by manufacturing industries as a result of the inflationary policies of the Government.  The deputy leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Peter Barry, is aware of the closure of the Kinsale textile factory in County Cork with a loss of 30 or 40 jobs and he is aware of the inflationary facts which have led to this closure.  This again is evidence of the inability of the Government to cope with the unemployment situation.  At this stage action is needed and should be taken.  The many schemes which we brought about should be expanded and brought up to present day costings.  I refer specifically to the Youth Employment Scheme which we introduced in 1977 and which created short-term employment for many young people who were unemployed then and who now have worthwhile jobs.  The work experience programme which is being operated by the National Manpower service should be increased from six months, as it operates at present, to 12 months and the actual allowance should be increased from £20 per week to £40 per week to allow for inflation.  That is the type of programme on which the Government should be concentrating, to create much needed employment.</P>
    <P>The unemployment level will be increasing because the Government are <Col N="1127" /> contributing to the wholesale loss of jobs because of the non-encouragement of investment by the private sector, who are deeply concerned about the general trend of Government policy which is unproductive. It is a poor example to the private sector to see a semi-State organisation like the Irish Sugar Company being guided, encouraged and directed by the Government to close in Tuam with a loss of much needed employment.  This is an example of the inability of the Government to cope with these problems.  The public, especially young people, are crying out for help.  The Government are concentrating on issues which have no relevance to the present day, for example, the question of the abolition or the retention of hanging.  That has no relevence for a young person seeking employment in the west.  This question was not discussed over the last 30 years so why should the Government now regard it as a priority measure and put it before the implementation of policies which would create employment.  The only reason the Government are prepared to bring in legislation to abolish hanging is to appease possibly Deputy Sherlock and, definitely, Dr. Browne and Deputy Kemmy.  They are the people who advocated policies which appealed to some of the electorate during the election campaign.  They are pressurising the Government to bring in legislation which gets media attention but does not create any employment for young people.  During the election campaign I did not receive any representations to abolish hanging.  I am sure Deputy Kelly did not receive any representations either to abolish hanging. Surely the Government should concentrate on the real issues.  If the Fine Gael Party are not prepared to do this, the so called socialists, who are Members of the Cabinet, should be concentrating on these issues.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Mr. Desmond, last night expounded views, theories and policies but he stated they were personal views.  When a man assumes the role of Minister or Minister of State he should have the conviction to proceed with his own policies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> The present dual mandate situation is a clear contradiction of socialist policies. Surely one man one job should prevail. Why are people who are members of this House allowed to be in Strasbourg today? That also applies to Members of the Fine Gael Party who allow Deputies to have a dual mandate here and in Europe.  We have 140,000 people unemployed and yet some Deputies have two lucrative jobs, one in this House and one in Europe where they are today.  I understand that Deputies are being flown back tonight for the crucial vote in relation to the school starting age.  I understand also, although I am open to contradiction on this, that they are being provided with the Government jet to take them home.  I hope that is not the case.  However they travel, I should like to know where the money is coming from to bring them home.  It is unnecessary because the dual mandate should be stopped and Members of this House should be here on a full-time basis&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope there will be a change in the direction of the Government before it is too late.  They have an opportunity to create employment.  They are destroying employment and initiative.  Why is inflation soaring?  Recipients of social welfare should have their increased benefits paid now and given an across-the-board increase of 20 per cent to allow for increases which the Government have brought about as a result of the Finance Bill, 1981.  I appeal to the Government to stop before it is too late, before the winter of discontent starts.  They must provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in Government from 1977 to 1981 we were severely criticised for borrowing but we borrowed to create employment and wealth and to get through a very severe recession, not only <Col N="1129" /> here but throughout the world.  We were on the right course.  Unfortunately the electorate were misled by propaganda during the election campaign and we were put out of office.  However, when the next election comes &mdash; some people expect it before Christmas, others expect it in May &mdash; the people will give a clear mandate to Fianna Fáil to assume office as quickly as possible.  Then we will have a progressive Government, not the situation which exists at present where the Government have ignored all appeals and are set on a course of destruction.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any theme so trite these days as the theme of the economy, what is wrong with it and what must be done to remedy the diseases that afflict it.  Essentially everything which needs to be said in support of the Finance Bill, disagreeable, difficult, unpalatable, has already been said, not once but repeatedly, by the Minister for Finance at budget time and since then whenever he has had an opportunity and by the Taoiseach and other Ministers.  I do not know if a great deal of point is to be served by rehashing, at least at any great length, the simple facts of our situation and what the virtually entire consensus of economic opinion, outside as well as inside politics, except for the geniuses on the far side, sees as the only possible course for us to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detect in speeches from the Opposition, not just in this debate but generally, an undertone that we on this side of the House are sadists with a death wish, who enjoy inflicting pain on others even though we can see that they are going to get their chance to inflict pain on us.  That is what seems to be at the back of the minds of many of the Opposition and their supporters around the country.  I assure the House that I am as fond of popularity as the next man, enjoy bringing good news just as much as the next man and dislike having to defend unpopular measures just as much as anybody else.  If people say that the Government are not going to make many friends through this or that measure, I know that <Col N="1130" /> I will feel it in the ballot box&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if I do not, my colleagues will.  I disclaim for myself, and with the assent of Deputy Creed beside me and many of my colleagues inside and outside the House, any anxiety to do unpopular things for their own sake and earn the people's vengeance at the ballot box, because that in our subconscious is what we wish to have to endure.  That is not the case, far from it.  The measures which I must defend here today, and do defend with a clear conscience, are the only ones which our limited human understanding suggest to us as possible. It may be that we are wrong, having a limited understanding, having temptations even in the midst of national and economic jeopardy to seek popularity, to do the easy thing, temptations to say yes when we should say no.  It may be that in this or that setting we yield to them, but in our limited way and as well as we can see our way through the difficulties confronting us, what we are now doing represents what ought to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must observe that I have not noticed much dissent, except in detail, from the independent economic commentators on the outside, whose vote is as secret as the next man's and whose soul is their own. No intelligent adult in this country is captive of any political party.  Most of them will change their votes back and forth in the course of a lifetime.  The economic commentators, virtually all, belong to that category.  I do not accept that there is such a thing as a devoted fanatical Fine Gael supporter among them, any more than there would have been, when the wind was blowing in our faces the last time, fanatical Fianna Fáil supporters, either.  They speak what they see as the objective truth and, in spite of the disagreeable job we must do this year in the position in which the election left us, in all the so visible parliamentary difficulties which there is no use in trying to conceal, I am comforted and strengthened that those whose job it is not to take sides politically, not because they expect anything <Col N="1131" /> from us but because it is their job to comment on the course the economy is taking, appear to think that we are doing the right thing &mdash; not perhaps in every detail, because people are urging us to slow down the implementation of our tax package.  If we did that, I have no doubt that people on the far side of the House, in spite of that advice having been given to us by independent economic commentators, would be saying that we were welching on our promises.  That is the kind of thing we would be hearing if we were to take that advice.</P>

      <P>In spite of these subordinate marginal difficulties in terms of the advice we are getting, which is sometimes conflicting advice, by and large we are supported in our unpopular course by the almost unanimous volume of independent opinion.  If there were a dissenting opinion, it is not to be found in the columns of the media, or in the economic pages of the newspapers, or in the Central Bank, or in the Economic and Social Research Institute.  As far as I can see, it is to be found only in the Opposition benches here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After listening to some of yesterday's debate and reading the rest of it from the days on which I was not present in the House, I went home somewhat dejected at the macro political picture which the discussion on the Finance Bill here reveals.  It brings home more strongly than ever before the damage this country must endure through the political division which the Civil War caused.  There are 78 men and women on the Opposition side who have no other purpose or idea in their minds than to do us down, only because we are us and they are on the other side.  If they had any other serious purpose on the economic plane, surely this is a debate in which that might surface? If there were a serious diagnosis of our economic difficulties which differed from ours and from that of all the outside commentators, surely this would be a debate in which that would surface?  If it does not surface now, when will it surface? <Col N="1132" /> But it has not surfaced; on the contrary, it is significant that those very Opposition Deputies who might perhaps most persuasively and with the greatest weight articulate a serious objective dissent have stayed clear of this debate. They have boycotted the House, except for the lobbies.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Leyden opposite will not take it amiss if I say that neither he nor any of the people from his party who preceded him could be regarded, whatever their other qualities, as big guns in economic matters.  With the permission of the Chair, I will read the list of Fianna Fáil contributors to this debate so far.  Apart from Deputy Gene Fitzgerald who, whatever one's judgment of his calibre as economic artillery, could scarcely have avoided speaking as he was the outgoing Minister for Finance and still has not been shuffled into something more modest, the other Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke in this debate are as follows, not necessarily in the sequence in which they spoke: Deputies Pádraig Flynn, Seán Keegan, Paddy Power, David Andrews, the new Deputy Lyons, whose Christian name I apologise for not knowing, Deputies Michael Woods, Ben Briscoe, Vincent Brady and Terry Leyden. These are the guns which are brought in to confront the Finance Bill which will give effect to this July budget which, according to Deputy Leyden, is the disaster which has richly earned defeat for us, were we to put ourselves before the people in the morning.</P>
    <P>What has become of the man who was Minister for Finance for many years and who, although he is not a man whom I would choose as a companion on a long walking tour, I have a certain regard for, because he often has a certain hawkish straightforwardness about him, Deputy Colley?  Where is he?  He is around the place, because I have seen him, but he has not surfaced in the Finance Bill debate.  Where is Deputy O'Malley &mdash; also a man who does not exactly radiate grace and of whom it would be difficult to be sure that one had his measure in any personal relationship, but at least a man who enjoys, even among his political opponents, a certain respect for having a <Col N="1133" /> brain of a sort and a kind of integrity? Where is Deputy O'Donoghue? It may be that he felt vicariously so wounded by Deputy Leyden's stricture, or that of some other colleague of his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For a man who ten minutes ago was talking about the dual mandate which he is able to fulminate about in comfort only because former Deputy Síle de Valera was thrown out of her seat in the constituency I have the honour to represent &mdash; I brought two Deputies along with me &mdash; he can well tolerate a few remarks by me on the way the Opposition have approached this Bill.  As the Chair has pointed out, the question of the dual mandate did not have anything to do with the Finance Bill.  The omissions of the Opposition are as significant as what they have done.  Apart from marching up all the Deputies whose names I have mentioned they have kept in the background, or permitted to remain in the background, Deputies Colley, O'Malley and O'Donoghue.  Deputy O'Donoghue was the architect of the 1977 manifesto which Deputy Leyden <Col N="1134" /> was talking about a few minutes ago, and every line and word of it was, apparently, put into effect.  Has anyone in the Deputy's constituency had a ground rent abolished in recent times or do people pay ground rents there, even in the towns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we do not pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if any ground rents were abolished in the Deputy's constituency.  I certainly did not hear of any being abolished in my constituency but I did hear of somebody being sent to prison for not paying.  In fact, I had a deputation to my house once at 11 o'clock at night in connection with that man being sent to prison.  That is a queer abolition four years later.  What about the 50-mile fishing limit?  Did we get that? Fianna Fáil were going to go to the barricades for it.  Deputy Leyden was not there at the time but Fianna Fáil were going to go to the barricades for it.  They were going to pull out of the EEC if we did not get a 50-mile exclusive fishing zone.  Those are two examples I can give off the top of my head.  Let us make a present to any Government that they are not going to succeed in implementing everything in their programme which they so light heartedly put before the electorate but, nonetheless, Deputy Leyden and his friends must believe in the 1977 manifesto but where is its architect? Why has he not shown up here?  I notice that he is back on the lunch-seminar circuit dispensing wisdom about the economy but he stays very clear of the place to which as a Minister he was answerable at a time when he was largely responsible for conducting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the noblest Roman of them all, the Mussolini of the Irish economy, the man who only has to make the well-schooled imperial gesture with the hand and everything falls into place as thousands of officials scurry off to do his bidding? Where is Deputy Haughey?  Why has he not spoken in this debate?  Surely if there was anybody with an overall grasp of the scene, surely if the Professor Moriarity of the national economy was able to control the sense on the way back the <Col N="1135" /> most remote movements in the economy and in the operation of all its branches, he would be here to contribute.  Surely Deputy Haughey would be here to show us where we were wrong in the Finance Bill, the things which have caused it and the things that are going to flow from it. How is it that all these Deputies have given this debate which is going to end in a few hours time a wide berth?</P>
    <P>I do not know about Deputy Haughey because it may be that he is going to conclude for his side this afternoon &mdash; I do not know which of them will conclude &mdash; but I will give the House my guess as to why certainly the first three I mentioned have stayed away, Deputies Colley, O'Malley and O'Donoghue.  I will throw in the name of Deputy John Wilson. It is only a hunch of my own but I suspect he would be in the same category. They have stayed away because they know that what was done in July had to be done.  Those Deputies, Colley, O'Malley and O'Donoghue, urged, as far as they were in a position to do so, on the last Government that they not go ahead with the kind of U-turn and reckless spending which Deputy Haughey initiated and brought the semi-State bodies along with him in putting into effect in the last part of his regime.  I do not think Deputy O'Malley is a man of instant charm or anything like that but he has got a certain endearing capacity or, should I say, incapacity to control his feelings which is a good thing in a politician. I do not like the cold-blooded sort who judge every word in terms of how it is going to be received by the media. Deputy O'Malley, at about this time last year when we were fighting a by-election in Donegal, in the course of a speech, not in Donegal, compared the people of this country to the inhabitants of the Easter Islands, or some of those islands, in which there is a cult called the cargo cult.  I believe the Duke of Edinburgh is one of its recently elected gods and I believe that Deputy O'Donoghue might well be another one.  Certainly, he would be instantly put up for membership of that pantheon if they knew about his existence.  Deputy O'Malley gave an <Col N="1136" /> interesting talk about the cargo cult in the Easter Islands which got a good deal of attention here.  He said that these people think that wealth falls out of the sky, that they do not have to do anything except sit around and the wealth will fall into their laps.  He said that we in this country were beginning to go on those lines.  That speech was made in September or October, 1980.  Naturally, a man who has that belief and saw the way the country was being brought in that year by the Government would find it hard to reconcile with his principles if he had to come into the House and attack a Finance Bill which is probably line by line identical with or, in principle, not very far away from the Bill which he would have sponsored had he been in charge of economy in the middle of 1981.  That is the reason why Deputies like him have stayed clear.  They have left the attack on the Finance Bill entirely to Deputies &mdash; I do not wish to offend them in this description &mdash; who in economic matters are fairly small fry.  I genuinely do not mean to be offensive and all Members know that, but I do not think that any of the Deputies who have spoken on the Fianna Fáil side regard themselves as, or ever held themselves out to be economic experts or even people who took much of an interest in how an economy works. The Fianna Fáil people who have some experience of the nuts and bolts of an economy, who have some grasp of the fact that one cannot distribute wealth until one first creates it, have stayed clear of this debate.  I am entitled to draw my own conclusions from that.</P>
    <P>The only thing that has been forthcoming from the Opposition in this debate has been a certain amount of name-calling. Naturally, I do not complain about Deputies Flynn, Keegan, Power, Briscoe, Vincent Brady or Leyden calling names because it is probably the only recourse open to them.  It is the easiest way of getting through a bit of a speech but one bit of name calling which has been common here in this debate, and in another which preceeded it, have been &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo; or &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo;.  I am surprised late in 1981 to find the word &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo; used as a term of abuse by <Col N="1137" /> a party led by Deputy Haughey who was very great with Mrs. Thatcher at a time when it suited his publicity purposes to appear so.  &ldquo;Charlie and Maggie will fix it all up.  There will be no holding the country once Deputy Haughey, got hold of Mrs. Thatcher's ear and was able to tell her a few things and talk straight to her&rdquo;.  Naturally, the aura of glory which this publicity threw off reflected in part on Mrs. Thatcher and she was head cat with Fianna Fáil for quite a long while, but now, suddently, because nothing very much seems to have emerged from the cufuffle with Mrs. Thatcher on Deputy Haughey's side, it is quite all right to use her name as a term of abuse.  The word &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo;, which I believe is imperfectly understood and which I freely confess I would not wish to lecture a class about, is thrown around here as a killing epithet which should make us wilt like salted snails when it is thrown at us.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to an article by a gentleman about whom I remember Deputy Seán Browne, when he was in the Chair, got into a fearful state of excitement because I went to such elaborate lengths to explain that he was not a member of Fine Gael.  I was only trying to give Mr. Ivor Kenny, Director of the IMI, a free pardon in that respect.  I wanted to clear him of the imputation that he might somehow be in our pockets.  I started to say that I had never seen him at one of our meetings, I did not believe that he went to them and I had never heard that he was connected with us in any way and Deputy Seán Browne thought that was an attack on Mr. Kenny.  We had an exciting few moments here until we got that one sorted out.  All I am trying to say is that Mr. Kenny is recognised as a person who is very near the action where the ecomony is concerned and a man who is personally and politically, as far as I know, independent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy was listening very carefully.  I have gone <Col N="1138" /> to elaborate lengths to make it clear that he has no connection with us, good, bad or indifferent.  So far as I am aware, he is an absolutely independent man, which is what, if the lord had made us free of the bug which drives us into politics, we would all be.  He wrote an article &mdash; or it may have been a talk which was printed &mdash; in the October issue of <i>Management</i> in which he describes the role of evasion in political debate on economic matters here.  He has a chapter in this article entitled Evasion by Rhetoric.  The first form of evasion by rhetoric is described as false labelling.  I am going to quote him now from page 30 of the October issue of <i>Management:</i></P>
      <P>Because Mrs. Thatcher believes in cutting public expenditure, a nice pejoractive tag is ready-made to attach to anyone who chooses to advocate such a policy over here.  &ldquo;Monetarist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thatcherite&rdquo; are the new terms of opprobrium.  Mr. John Bruton's concern about our national finances is acceptable &mdash; provided concern is not translated into action.</P>
      <P>I remember Deputy Gene Fitzgerald expressing concern about the public finances but he did nothing about them. To resume the quotation:</P>
      <P>If it is, the commentators worry about his &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; and wonder if he has caught the Friedmanite virus from the East wind....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This name-calling is unhelpful.  It makes us evade reality.  The reality, for example, that our balance of payments deficit will reach a staggering 15 per cent of GNP this year, to give us a third record deficit in a row.  The reality that the Government finances are in disorder. The reality that the Central Bank's private sector credit guidelines have tended to accommodate these deficits, not to stop them.  The reality that the present Government shares the view held by its predecessor that incomes, fiscal and monetary policies must move in unison.  <i>All this is light years away from a monetarist who sets a target growth rate for the money supply and then, in Senator Ken Whitaker's <Col N="1139" /> words, walks away with his fingers in his ears.</i></P>
    <P>I do not want to quote further from that article.  It will do as an example of a reaction from someone who is absolutely independent and has no political axe to grind whatsoever.  That is his reaction to the name-calling and we have had almost nothing else but name-calling in the course of this debate and before in so far as it concerns any attempt to criticise the way we are trying, with great difficulties and with great political cost to ourselves I have no doubt, to take a grip on the scruff of the neck of this economy and bring it back to the situation in which we left it in 1977.</P>
    <P>I will not rehash the stark facts which Ivor Kenny mentioned in brief outline with any rhetoric of my own.  But perhaps the House will bear with me if I just cite a couple of short paragraphs from the Central Bank report which was published last week for the autumn of 1981.  First I want to say something about the Central Bank and its reports.  I can remember that in the last Dáil the Central Bank reports were often used in debate here, but as far as I can remember never, or as good as never, by the then Government, because what the Central Bank were saying &mdash; in the course of 1979, 1980 and 1981 &mdash; and they are independent too even though they are part of the public sector and their salaries are paid out of State funds &mdash; effectively amounted to a critique of what the then Government were doing.  It was left to us in Fine Gael and Labour to use this report for our purposes because we were able to find among its sober sentences a great deal of material which bolstered up, supported and bore out what we were saying about the economy.</P>

      <P>That may be so and if it is I am sorry.  But my recollection, whether it is right or wrong, is that the Central Bank report was much more commonly a debating implement in the hands of the Opposition than in the hands of the Government. In a sense that situation has switched around because this report, issued last week, absolutely bears out in chapter and verse everything which we said about the state of the economy, not just now but before the election ever took place.  It says:</P>
      <P>The balance-of-payments deficit on current account amounts to 14 per cent of GNP, an excess of expenditure over domestically-produced output which is being financed by unsustainably high levels of official foreign borrowing.  A primary domestic cause of the balance-of-payments deficit is an imbalance in the public finances, the most striking and disturbing feature of which is the persistence of massive current budget deficits....</P>
      <P>Key elements in a strategy of adjustment, and necessary conditions for a renewal of growth on a sustainable basis over the medium-term, are: the phased elimination of current budget deficits within a few years, and measures to ensure international competitiveness through the abatement of domestic cost and price measures. Both elements are necessary.  They complement and reinforce one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How often have we said that?  How often have the House been bored to tears listening to people from my party and the Labour Party saying that same thing?  I honestly believe that the same thing was said in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms and in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet room by a few <Col N="1141" /> of the then members, the ones I have named, who took damn good care to stay clear of this debate today because they would be ashamed to take part in it on that side, Deputies Colley, O'Malley and O'Donoghue, and Deputy Haughey although I do not include him among those who sounded a note of caution.  On the same page the report says:</P>
    <P>The July Supplementary Budget represented a start to the process of budgetary correction and is to be welcomed, as is the Government's commitment to end borrowing for day-to-day purposes over a period of four years.  However, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that what has actually been accomplished so far &mdash; the ending of a process of rapid deterioration &mdash; is relatively modest.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cod the House about this.  The July budget was undoubtedly tough but it is only a start and it is the measure of the recklessness with which the country's finances were run for the last four years that even so tough a budget as that can be no more than a start in trying to get us back into the correct financial balance.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>If next year's current budget deficit is to be significantly lower than in 1981, further decisive measures will be called for.</P>
    <P>As a politician, as somebody who has to go out and cadge votes from people, I hope that will not be so.  This is the judgment of the Central Bank.  I did not write that stuff.  No one in any Government Department under a political head wrote that stuff.  On the next page the report says:</P>
    <P>The primary engine of growth in an economy such as Ireland's must be exports, and the key to increasing these is the enhancement of international competitiveness.  Export-led growth alone offers the prospect of achieving high and stable rates of growth in the medium-term without running up against severe balance-of-payments constraints.  Moreover, in the period of adjustment immediately ahead, export <Col N="1142" /> expansion must &mdash; and this is almost a truism &mdash; play a central role in order to meet very large and rapidly mounting debt service obligations.  An improvement now in our competitive position, following losses in recent years, would be particularly opportune since it would permit us to reap, to the fullest extent possible, the benefits of the upturn in the international economy when it occurs.</P>
    <P>Finally, my last quotation from this which is on the next page, page 7, is as follows:</P>
    <P>The main domestic event affecting the economic outlook was the Supplementary Budget, introduced to halt a deterioration in the public finances.</P>
    <P>I would expect an Opposition that was worth a damn, an Opposition such as we along with the Labour Party, tried to provide for four years to have met statements like this head on.  That report has been there for more than a week.  They would have said: &ldquo;These are the independent commentators.  Do we agree with them?  In what respect are they at fault?  Are they in ivory towers?  Are they a lot of academics who do not have to slog around the world and make excuses to people about the fact that there are no jobs?&rdquo; If I was still in opposition I would have got to grips with them.  If I felt the thing was unanswerable, that there was no meat in it for me as an Opposition Deputy, I would stay clear of this debate. This is exactly what Deputies Colley, O'Malley and O'Donoghue have done.</P>
    <P>What do we get instead?  We get the same old dreary, silly, snooker politics. I got a long stint of it from Deputy Leyden yesterday and from the others whose contributions I have read.  They have no suggestions about public finances.  They have nothing to offer about phasing out the deficit.  They do not want to know about the trade balance situation, which is horrifying by the standards of any other country.  They have no interest in the fact that in four years the amount of every revenue pound which has to be paid out in interest on the national debt has gone from 21p in the £ to 31p in the £ during the time of the previous Government. <Col N="1143" /> They have nothing to say about that and they have nothing to offer about that.</P>
    <P>It does not worry them that the good credit rating which the country still has has nothing whatever to do with an assessment of the way it is being run internally but is related purely to the confidence which creditors have that you will keep on paying interest.  Our creditors outside who lend us money, the people who lend us the yens, the dinars, the marks, the francs, the guilders, the pounds and the dollars do not care if our school entry age is up to 4½, 5 or 15 years. They do not care if there is not a metalled road growing between here and Belmullet. They do not care if we have no universities; they do not care if there is no telephone service in the country; they do not care if there is not another job in the country.  The only thing they care about is if there is a Government which by hook or crook will pay them their interest.  As long as that Government are able to maintain order, a certain measure of stability, pay a police force and so on we have got a good credit rating.</P>

      <P>As long as the Government are able, by keeping on borrowing, to pay the interest, we have got a good credit rating.  The idea that a good credit rating bears any relation to a judgment of how the economy is being run in terms of the benefits it provides for our people is not worth a damn.  These things do not interest the Deputies on the other side and we have not had any comments on any of these subjects from any of them. All we have had is dejected argument. We have had a depressing exhibition of the poor mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to single Deputy Leyden out as I do not consider he is any worse than the rest of them.  I was waiting to get in and I had to sit through his speech yesterday.  I find it a depressing experience.  I am fed up listening to him telling us that he comes from the west of Ireland, from Roscommon.  Half of us either come from there or our parents do.  All my people come from the west. <Col N="1144" /> I believe I know more about Roscommon than he does about Dublin South.  All this béal bochtery about the west is something we can do without.  I will tell him something about the west.  He made a meal here yesterday of a speech of mine which I made in Claremorris last August. I will tell him something about Claremorris. I remember that little town when I was a small boy in the war years.  I remember it when there was not even a car in the place.  I remember it even before the petrol went off the roads during the war, when the only form of transport was an ass and cart.  I remember it when there were people buying second hand clothes from one another, I remember it when there was not any metal on the streets.  I do not single that town out as all the towns down there were the same.</P>
    <P>When I went back in August to make the speech I am talking about, the meeting to which the Deputy referred, it took place in an establishment which would blind one by its opulence.  The Deputy gave the impression that the people in Dublin South had no worries.  He should come and talk to a few of them.  I do not believe the whole of Dublin South contains an establishment, a restaurant, bar and function complex, as opulent as the one in which that function took place.  I was only a small boy in 1941 but I remember the situation very well.  If the people who lived there in 1941 were able to see this place 40 years later &mdash; it is still in the lifetime of most of them &mdash; they would have thought they were in dreamland. There is no sign of the ass and cart and there is no sign of poverty there now.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the west came far better out of the mid-seventies recession than any other part of Ireland because of qualities which the people of the west have and also because they were given &mdash; rightly so &mdash; very favourable treatment in the establishment of new industry, which was less vulnerable than the established industries in the east and south.  Those industries tended to close down far less and suffer far less in the mid-seventies recession than industries anywhere else in the country.  If I were one of the constituents of Deputy Leyden <Col N="1145" /> and others like him I would object to the béal bocht hanging open like a liobar in this House whenever an economic topic is under discussion.  I would object to being represented, as he represents them, as a lot of helpless mendicants. They are not that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden knows of Roscommon people who have made good in their own county and outside it, in their own country and outside it and people from all the other western counties who have made fortunes for themselves and for all belonging to them, who have established businesses which are second to none in this country.  He knows they have as much enterprise and as much self reliance as the rest of us.  Why then is there all that béal bochtery?  I resent it as somebody of western descent and I believe I speak for all the people in Roscommon when I say I resent that kind of talk.  The Deputy's entire speech yesterday was &ldquo;wisha, would you grudge him a few pence to put on a horse, wisha would you grudge him a few pence for a pint, wisha, are you going to take the £3,000 grant off this incredible man who could not make up his mind if he wanted to get married or only wanted the money&rdquo;.  He was in some dilemma which must be unique.  He could not get married because he had not got the £3,000 and he could not get the £3,000 without being married.  Wisha, would the Coalition not take pity on this unfortunate man, if he actually exists, the friend of Deputy Leyden.  Wish, could we not do more for the people, stuff more money into this and more money into that.  If I was a Roscommon voter I would resent being represented in the national parliament as a mere recipient of charity. The same goes for the rest of Ireland and the whole western seaboard and every other part of Ireland about which language like that is used.</P>
    <P>I am tired of hearing Deputies on the far side of the House saying they come from a constituency in the west.  It is as if the people who voted for them were the only real votes that counted, that votes cast by people in this part of the country were not votes at all, that the people who live in my constituency do not count and their nationality is only provisional.  Most <Col N="1146" /> of my constituency organisation consists of people who were born in the country. There is no deliberate pattern about it but it happens that one of the branches in my constituency consists almost entirely of people from Cavan and Monaghan, another consists almost entirely of people from Cork and another one has a very strong Mayo representation.</P>
    <P>One border is enough in the country. There is no border between east and west.  We have all got roots all around the country. Some of the people I am talking about have brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and cousins whom they very frequently see either in Dublin or the part of the country they come from.  The béal bocht perpetually shown on behalf of the west is something which I believe the west resents.  I had better remind Deputy Leyden that he comes from a county which is a banner county in a very important respect.  It is a county in which Count Plunkett stood for the first Sinn Féin by-election in 1917.  I am sure Count Plunkett, who stood for Sinn Féin, was not showing the béal bocht on behalf of Roscommon or the other counties around there.  I am sure the message Count Plunkett gave and which the people in Roscommon wanted him to give was the message implicit in his party, Sinn Féin: &ldquo;We will stand on our own legs and we will not go begging.&rdquo;  If Deputy Leyden and other Deputies on the other side of the House have nothing better to say than to ask the Government to give another few ha'pence here and there, they would be better off staying silent.</P>
    <P>One of the suggestions he made was that a 25 per cent increase in social welfare should be given all round, and that nothing else would do us.  I should love to see that happening.  I am not an enemy of social welfare in any shape or form. Our system is gravely defective in many respects.  The levels of assistance in some areas and the sectors to which assistance is provided are not wide enough.  I should love to improve them.  If I could increase the long-term benefits of old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows or disabled <Col N="1147" /> pensioners, I would do so.  I should love to be able to go around my constituency and boast about who it was who got them an increase of 55 per cent in the old age pension.  We would all love to be able to do that.  In fact, it was this party who reduced from 70 years to 66 years, and now to 65 years, the qualifying age for the old age pension.  Oddly enough it was Fine Gael who did that.</P>
    <P>I should love to be able to produce that good news, but it has to be paid for.  The brute fact which people like the Deputy I have just mentioned&mdash;who represent such a degeneration in political terms from Count Plunkett and people of that type who came after him, and people in the old Irish party who were their opponents at the time&mdash;do not want to face is that a benefit provided for citizen X has to be paid for by citizen Y.  If it is not paid for by citizen Y, if it is borrowed from the Japanese or whoever, citizen Y's children and grandchildren will have to pay for it, and citizen X's children too, because it will represent that much of a constraint on the State's future power to invest money in what really creates wealth and self-sustaining jobs which will leave the country permanently better off.</P>
    <P>When people say: &ldquo;Could we not have a scheme for this and for that?  Surely it would be fair to give something to this 50 year old man who is in such a chronic state of indecision about his matrimony or his finances, and we are not sure which of them,&rdquo; what they are really saying is: &ldquo;Surely his neighbours should carry him for another £3,000.&rdquo;  I know it is bitter to have to speak like that, but that is the reality.  Cheap jack politics have taken us far away from that reality, cheap skate politics in which people are led to assume that it is malice only on the part of a Government which prevents them from shelling out enormous sums of money in welfare, in relief, in grants, in handouts and in tax cuts.  That is cheap skate politics and we have had enough of it.  I do not say any party have a monopoly of it. That would not be true.  What is most to blame for its continuance in a country which started nobly in the early part of this century with the principles of Sinn <Col N="1148" /> Féin is the silly snooker which the modern persistence of the civil war has enforced on us, with each side trying to outdo the other in cheap child-tailored promises.</P>
    <P>I want to end on a somewhat different note.  There is no use in talking about job creation in the sense in which that term was understood by the former Government. If a job is created in the private sector, it represents an exploitation of the earth's resources immediately or at one or two removes in such a way that there is more wealth there when the job is done.  Every day that job is continued there is more wealth at closing time than there was at opening time.  That is a real job with spin-offs.  According as the concern gets bigger, every job will require to be serviced.  It will require more components. It will require services of various kinds, a huge variety of little services.  A succession or an accumulation of concerns like that in their turn will bring service industries into being and sustain them.</P>
    <P>That is what job creation is about.  I am for that kind of job creation and everyone in this party is for it.  It can be favoured, fostered and promoted by improving our competitiveness.  The more goods the Irish exporter can sell abroad, the more wealth flows into the country.  The more he is encouraged to expand, the more jobs will be created by him in his own concern, the more wealth will be further generated among people who have these jobs, and the more capital will accumulate, and I do not care how widely it is distributed.</P>
    <P>I should love everyone in the country to have a business of his own.  I do not at all believe in trying to exploit people in the interests of capital.  In itself, capital is not sacred to me.  I do not believe in it as an end in itself.  It is the most efficient way of creating and spreading wealth. Admittedly it is not effective in distributing it so as to sustain people who need help and who are themselves helpless and, to that extent, the State must step in.  There is no question about that.  I have never disputed that, nor ever would.</P>
    <P>The way to go about job creation is to create the conditions in which people will <Col N="1149" /> go out and do business and create places for employees of their own and bring them to a state of prosperity in which they too can get into business.  That is job creation.  Whether we are long or short in office, if we succeed in developing that form of job creation, I will be very proud. What is not job creation, except in the kind of terminology of an advertising agency, is throwing up a building, putting a lot of desks into it, and having many school leavers behind those desks shoving papers around at one another.  That is not a job.</P>
    <P>That is not creating wealth.  It is consuming wealth.  It is turning what should be bees into drones.  When I say &ldquo;drones&rdquo; I do not mean that the individual is to be so described because one can wear oneself out, get exhausted and work hard doing something which is valueless just as easily as doing something which is valuable.  I do not mean that figure of speech to be interpreted as offensive to the people whom circumstances have put in that position.  It is taking what should be productive units and making them unproductive.  That is all being done at the expense of people who are productive.</P>
    <P>Jobs may be socially commendable and may be absolutely necessary such as the expansion, in regrettable conditions, of the police force, or the expansion of the personnel in the health services, more nurses, or more teachers.  They may be very desirable and necessary, but the fact is that the expansion of the public service means that every new job created is another straw which must be carried by the productive sectors of the economy. They are the ones who create the wealth and they are the ones upon whose creation of wealth the rest must be sustained.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that fact has not been understood sufficiently by Deputies on the far side of the House.  In one celebrated speech&mdash;I am not sure I am quoting him exactly; I am sorry if I am doing him an injustice but I think he said something like this&mdash;Deputy O'Donoghue said he was in favour of job creation even if it was only digging holes and filling them in again.  In a speech made not long before the 1977 election.  Deputy <Col N="1150" /> Haughey said something very similar.  He said that, in order to get us out of the recession, from which we were emerging anyway at that time and had been since late 1975 or early 1976, he believed in jobs for jobs' sake.  Jobs for jobs' sake may be fine, but they have to be paid for by your neighbours.  They have to be paid for by the people who are working productively. We are sitting around here debating gravely in the national Parliament. I hope we are doing something useful.  I hope we add something to the quality of life of the people who live around us.  We are doing the very same thing.  I do not toil or spin.  Neither does Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  We do not produce anything with our hands.  We do not visibly add to wealth, although I suppose paper has to be produced to print what we write on.  We only consume wealth.  I hope other benefits which flow from our existence may counterbalance that.  I may be wrong, in which case we too must fall under the same suspicion of consuming the wealth which others are producing.</P>
    <P>Job creation which simply takes the form of doing what the outgoing Government did, namely, expanding the civil service by 9,000 people on a base of 45,000, an expansion of 20 per cent in four years, I have no hesitation in calling damaging and, in our conditions, disastrous. If we look at the entire public service &mdash; I am talking about the complete span of the public service, not merely the non-industrial civil servants &mdash; the increase between 1977 and 1981 was in the region of 38,000 or 40,000. This is in no sense a reflection on public servants individually.  Obviously some are necessary &mdash; for instance, the expansion of the Garda Síochána.  Individually they are doing their best for themselves and their families and I wish them well. I am not making a criticism of them but I am criticising the policy that thinks we are solving our economic difficulties by creating jobs on that scale and at that rate.</P>
    <P>The financial burden we are facing, the horrible financial mess in which this country was left when the Government changed, is virtually entirely referable to that growth in the public service.  I know <Col N="1151" /> I am cutting corners when making this point but I shall try to make it graphical. If those extra 38,000 or 40,000 people were not in public employment the public wage bill would be hundreds of millions of pounds less.  It would be so much less each year as to make our deficit problem a very small one.  Jobs of a kind have been created, some of them necessary but others much less necessary, but it has been done at a deadly cost.  Paying that cost is constricting our capacity to create wealth-producing jobs.</P>
    <P>We are coming to a period when we will be discussing Estimates.  Deputy Fitzgerald knows this quite well because he has been through the same process.  Even in good times every Minister is under pressure to be economical and to prune the Estimates for his Department.  Some pruning can be done without too much damage to the economy or to the efforts of the State to help the economy, but some cannot be done without a lot of damage.  I want the House to consider that among the things we have to pay for are enterprises that create a great deal of wealth, agencies such as the IDA, Coras Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte &mdash; the last two under the aegis of my Department.  To have a situation in which such bodies are under budgetary pressure because of the burdens the State has undertaken in creating unproductive employment is crazy. It is an insane thing to do.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald knows well, more than half of the national bill goes in paying wages and salaries and more than 30 per cent goes in paying interest on our debts.  That leaves only so much for doing all the things we want to do, for paying for the material for roadworks to improve our infrastructure, for paying for telephone equipment and for the building of hospitals, schools, and even airports.  To create a situation where the Government are strapped for funds when all of these things need doing desperately and to have done so merely to fulfil an election commitment to reduce unemployment by putting people into jobs for which there was no real necessity in many cases is an insane policy.  I am probably boring Deputy <Col N="1152" /> Fitzgerald and the rest of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The situation we are in can be remedied and I hope if we get the chance we will remedy it.  I should like to make a few comments, in a sense of friendly debate, in regard to some things my friend, Deputy Desmond, Minister of State, said yesterday.  He said, and I agree with him, that we should have a socially just system of taxation.  As the House probably knows, I was personally in favour of the wealth tax, and I remain in favour of it.  I admit I am in a very small minority in my party on this matter, perhaps even a minority of one, but I believed and I still believe in it.  I am at one with Deputy Desmond in saying that we cannot expect people at the bottom of the economic barrel to make sacrifices even in the interest of cost competitiveness for industry in order to create more jobs unless they see people at the top prepared to carry an equivalent burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also said be believed in a high level of taxation.  I think what he means is the State should leave itself in a position that it can safely remove large sums in revenue to pay for the social improvements he wants to see.  I agree with that.  However, the State cannot cream off that wealth in the form of revenue, it cannot commit itself to high levels of taxation that will produce the kind of revenue Deputy Desmond and the rest of us want, unless the wealth is there to tax.  The first thing we must do is create the wealth and we can worry about distribution later.  Probably Deputy Sherlock would not agree with that but looked at from any perspective except the ground it is obvious that this is a country that has not yet experienced any large gaps between classes.  Of course there are gaps between classes, of course there are <Col N="1153" /> the very rich and the very poor, but I want to put the matter in perspective. Last Sunday I heard a parish priest make the following comment.  He said &ldquo;The poorest person in this parish&rdquo;&mdash; my own parish &mdash;&ldquo;is rich compared with the poor man in Calcutta and the richest man in this parish is poor compared with an oil sheik&rdquo;, or he might have added, &ldquo;compared with people who are really rich in France, Germany or Britain&rdquo;.  Of course there are extremes of poverty and wealth here but they disappear completely in comparison with the extremes that are visible in world terms or even in countries not far from us.  So long as these gaps have not become too great, so long as there is a certain measure of social solidarity &mdash; there is still a bit of that left &mdash; we should strive to carry people with us in an attempt to get a socially just system of taxation.  However, that is no good if there is no substance there to tax.  What we must first do is create the wealth and that means making it possible for people to do business, to create jobs and then let us by all means encourage or force them to distribute the proceeds of the enterprise. In the discharge of the task of fostering those conditions the State is gravely handicapped if its finances are in disorder and if it cannot put the money it should put into the encouragement of industry, agriculture, tourism and the service industries.  If excessive demands are made by way of excessive recruitment to the public service and excessive levels of State expenditure on things that are not productive, the State is dragging a ball and chain behind it in its efforts to reach that goal.</P>
    <P>We are scarcely out of the harbour yet. If we can survive that and turn around the processes I have been complaining about, and which have been visible over the past several years &mdash; I do not altogether blame Fianna Fáil for this, although they must take a large part of the blame &mdash; and get people to think more in terms of first sowing the seed, watering it, fertilising it and worrying afterwards about how the harvest is to be distributed, we will have a good chance of reaching that objective.</P>
    <Col N="1154" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The wealth is there, estimated conservatively at £35,000 million. If we put a 1 per cent levy on that it would yield in excess of £300 million, one-third of the deficit for which it was necessary to introduce this budget.  If the level of taxation on the professional and business people and the self-employed was at the same rate as for the PAYE workers, that would produce another £300 million.  The PAYE sector pay £17 in every £100 earned and the others pay £7 in every £100 income.  The Government could have imposed capital taxation on these areas rather than imposing direct taxation which hit the poorer sections of the community &mdash; the working people, retired people and those in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>Is there a reason why the Government did not impose capital taxation?  I think there is.  During the last general election Fianna Fáil spent, on propaganda, about £1.2 million and Fine Gael in the region of £1 million.  Is it any wonder that neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael want to impose capital taxation?  Who supplied that money?  Was it the ordinary worker?  No, it was the capitalist.  During the election the main political parties took full page advertisements in local and national newspapers to spread their propaganda.</P>
      <P>We are told the economic situation is very bad, but is it so bad?  If it is, why do the Government not impose capital taxation rather than indirect taxation which means that workers are paying tax on every £1 as well as paying PAYE?  This point must be made with the greatest emphasis and this is one reason why workers realise this is not their country. It is being run by wealthy people, supported by successive Governments.  The people are disgusted with the inability of successive Governments to solve the cancer of unemployment to build sufficient homes, to take care of our old and sick, to reduce the price of essential food, to provide a comprehensive and expanding education service, to reform our taxation system and to set about the task of improving the quality of life of all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have found a clear absence of moral and political leadership in all parties <Col N="1155" /> who have been in charge of the affairs of the State.  There is also a growing sense of despair and cynicism not only among the tens of thousands on the dole queues but among our young married couples faced with rising mortgages, our unemployed young people rejected by this society as they begin their lives and among the retired workers who have built this society and now face a harsh winter on grossly inadequate incomes.  All these groups &mdash; and they amount to a vast section of our society &mdash; are crying out for a political and moral leadership which will ease their burden and will honestly and truthfully set out with determination to build the sort of Ireland in which workers and their families can enjoy not only decent living standards but a society in which they will be valued as citizens.</P>
    <P>If the Government were to test the mood of the country at this time they would find I am speaking the truth.  They would be told to go, and to go quickly. Do not let Fianna Fáil take heart from this.  Irish people filled the emigrant ships while the ranchers and big businessmen grew fat at the expense of the workers in the towns and on the land.  This is not a history of which to be proud.  Fianna Fáil created the millionaires and talked wildly about the glories of a future republic.  I make no excuse for crime, vandalism or drug taking, but this is the society our political parties have created.  They pandered to the rich, the profit-takers, the fly-by-night businessmen and the grossest elements in our society, so that the yardstick by which all this is measured is the amount which can be stuffed into pockets by fair means or foul.</P>
    <P>During World War II we had an emergency. We have an emergency now because we have in excess of 130,000 people unemployed.  We were told at school that we were a poor country.  What a damned lie.  We have natural resources &mdash; lead, zinc, natural gas, oil, land, forests, bogs and sea.  We have a people second to none with the skills, guts and willingness to exploit this wealth in their interests and in the interests of the country. Our natural resources should be taken into State ownership and developed <Col N="1156" /> by our State companies when they have had a chance to prove their ability.</P>
    <P>When I talk about State ownership and taking these natural resources into State ownership, I mean that the people to be appointed should be competent, unlike the situation we had in the past in some of our State and semi-State bodies where the person deemed to be the best and strongest Government supporter got the job.  Then he made sure he appointed &ldquo;yes men&rdquo;, with the result that we did not have the efficiency in the State sector we might have had.</P>
    <P>The money for such massive development, for such an ambitious job creation programme, is there in unpaid taxes, in profits being made from our existing resources and in the £3,000 million in the hands of the banks.  The great financial wizard Rothschild said &ldquo;Give me control of a country's finances and I do not give a damn who makes the laws&rdquo;.  That is the situation we have at the moment.  The banks have more power than the Government. They control the whole spectrum and consequently control the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the anti-poverty plan and this must be taken into consideration.  Sister Stanislaus Kennedy has highlighted the extent of this problem.  Can the Government or the Opposition be proud of the fact that so much poverty exists in a country with such great natural resources?</P>
    <P>There is also reference to the Youth Employment Agency which will be financed in greater part through the 1 per cent contribution made by workers.  I would have thought that this money could have been used to provide a comprehensive free health service.  No PAYE worker would refuse to pay the 1 per cent contribution for such a service.  Under the GMS scheme some general medical practitioners are being paid as much as £50,000 per year.  One such doctor may give a prescription to the mother of small children whose income limit in order to qualify for full eligibility is £56 for man and wife and £6 for each child.  If her husband earns £85 or £90 per week she will not qualify for eligibility.  I am well aware that some mothers will not go to the chemists with prescriptions because <Col N="1157" /> they cannot afford to pay.  This situation cannot be tolerated.  I understand that there is an investigation in progress into the widespread abuse of the GMS scheme by doctors in some areas and I would welcome such an investigation in the Southern Health Board area where incomes range between £30,000 and £50,000.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service should be used as an agency through which people who are unemployed can register and be provided with a job, as is their right.  Nepotism is rife and as a result the sons and daughters of working class people are not getting their rights.  There is no point in going to the National Manpower Service merely to put one's name on a register.  The system should be changed to ensure that people will be given an opportunity if employment in a suitable area arises.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred in his speech to the £27.5 million which the road tax till bring in during 1982.  That money must be given to the local authorities to spend on roads.  The county road system has been deteriorating rapidly because during the past three or four years insufficient funds have been provided.  When capital is allocated to a local authority it should be spent as that local authority decide and not as specified by the Department. The local authority are aware that many roads are at present impassable and need expenditure.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said he was in favour of wealth tax but that many other members of his party were not.  I would point out that the people at present in power may not always be there.  The present Opposition decided when in power to hand back the resource tax to farmers.  I know the agricultural scene as well as anybody and at present farmers are howling for State assistance.  I am well aware of the value of agriculture when our economy is in such bad shape, but workers are taking the brunt of taxation while wealthy people are howling that the State should assist them.  These are the people who paid with bank money twice the value of the agricultural land they purchased. They erected massive buildings which they did not require and were <Col N="1158" /> badly advised to do so.  I believe that every effort should be made to keep farmers on the land because there is no alternative employment for them, but I do not see why people with 400 or 600 acres should be aided by the State when they paid £4,000 an acre for land, the agricultural value of which was only £1,800 or £2,000.</P>
    <P>The time will come when the coalition will be between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Both major parties will join hands and Sinn Fein, the Workers' Party and others who represent working class people will be either a workers' opposition or the Government.  Only then will we have an equitable system whereby there will be a fair distribution of capital. The mood of the people is an angry one at present.  They are saying &mdash; and I would agree with them lest anybody might think I do not &mdash; that the State should show that it is concerned, that it is prepared to cut expenditure at Government level.  A start would have to be made on the abolition of the provision of State cars, for which I see no need whatever. I see no need whatever for Ministers of State to be provided with State cars at present at the taxpayers' expense. That is what the people are saying and I want to say that I support them in that. Such action would show that the Government were concerned and would constitute the first steps in good government here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface my observations by reference to some of the remarks and observations made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  He went to great pains to point out that the speakers put forward on this side of the House were the lightweights of the Party.  I want to assure him that no offence was taken in that respect, that that is his opinion and he is entitled to it. But if his theorising, postulating and over-stretched analysis of the insignificant points relating to our economy are the basis for sound planning under his Government then future prospects for the country under this administration do not look very bright.  I should like the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in progress has been occasioned <Col N="1159" /> by what I can describe only as the frightening reality of economania, economic theorising gone mad; if you like, slightly flavoured by Brutonomics.  It is an over-indulgent obsession with the intricacies of economic theory, this by a man, in the person of the present Taoiseach, who was regarded hitherto by some &mdash; with some justification at the time &mdash; as an able and respected economic analyst, as a statistician of high repute and as a caring and concerned public figure.  During those halcyon days of the sixties and indeed of the traumatic seventies I never went out of my way to prove those people wrong.  However, to my regret I must now admit freely that I played my part, perhaps by virtue of over-attention to a seeming personality, perhaps by over-attention to ability at theoretical postulation, in germinating the idea that one day this man would have an important contribution to make to the future of our economy.  Unfortunately there was one vital element, perhaps the only element in this case, I unwittingly ignored and which I believe many other Deputies now on the Government side of the House ignored which contributed to our collective naivety, and that was the ability, or lack of it on the part of the Taoiseach to oversee and constructively manage the affairs of our economy.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it, the mini-budget before this House &mdash; to which the Taoiseach hopes this Finance Bill will give statutory effect &mdash; is the Taoiseach's budget even though it might be slightly flavoured by his Brutonomics assistant. It is one founded on the false premise that if he, as the present Leader of this Government, was not seen to react strongly to what he described as the state of Government finances, our international creditors and the big bad boys of the International Monetary Fund would come running, waving their truncheons and batons to call in their loans and bring us all to heel.  The Taoiseach's actions in this respect are reminiscent of a little school boy 20, 30, or 40 years ago who, having failed to do his homework, mitched from school for fear of the big, <Col N="1160" /> bad teacher.  The scene would be hilarious were it not so serious.</P>
    <P>The damage caused by the insensitive provisions of this Bill perhaps can be most appropriately captured by reference to a famous observation made in such a poignantly philosophical vein by Sir Walter Raleigh when, at his execution, rubbing his fingers along the blade of the axe about to terminate his life, he was overheard to remark, &ldquo;This is the shock treatment that cures all ills.&rdquo;  Of course, as we are all aware, poor old Sir Walter did not have to live with the consequences of that shock medicine.  But for the economy and people of Ireland the consequences of this Bill are both immediate and long-term. At this juncture let the Taoiseach and his assistant set the record straight. Anybody with any knowledge of economic affairs must surely know that creditworthiness and rating &mdash; incidentally at this point I should say that the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism was wise enough to acknowledge that we do have creditworthiness and a high credit rating even now &mdash; either domestically or internationally have confidence, and I stress the word confidence, as one of their key elements.  Yet, by one fell stroke, this administration have done far more to engender lack of confidence in the ability and potential of this economy amongst our domestic and international creditors than ever before in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to sympathise with some of the personnel in the media in their present dilemma.  They created and fuelled a stature for the present Taoiseach akin to that of a mandarin or perhaps a semi-god who would, if given half a chance, hand down his manna to the people of Ireland in the form of an economic panacea.  To the ladies and gentlemen of the media I would say, there will be many mouths hungry and many tables lean this Christmas. To many Deputies on the Government side, indeed to some Ministers, I would say that they also have my sympathy in their dilemma which is even greater.  They know that in their Leader they have a man who has no mandate whatsoever to twist their most reluctant <Col N="1161" /> arms to implement his hare-brained schemes, completely divorced from reality and the logistics of which are applicable to the realms of theoretical and intellectual postulation only.</P>
    <P>For the Tánaiste I have a special message and I also want to remind him of a very astute observation he made to some of his socialist friends, intended for the ordinary people of Ireland, some time ago regarding some of the then Fianna Fáil Ministers when he said, &ldquo;By the tracks of their Mercedes shall ye know them&rdquo;.  Let me hasten to remind the Tánaiste that the tracks of his Mercedes will have left many an indelible scar on the larders and minds of the plain people of Ireland before this winter is over. Those ordinary people, whose wages are meagre enough, who go about their daily business with an ever-conscious sense of frugality, find themselves now in a hopeless and frightening dilemma.  As a result of Government action they must now endeavour to live with a 5 per cent increase in the rate of inflation, which percentage, as we all well know, does not take into account the total multiplier effects of such impositions.</P>
    <P>This Government came into office on the basis of an anti-inflation programme, fully aware of the then level and state of Government finances.  The then Leader of Fine Gael, now the Taoiseach, was credited with many statements of calculation, mentioning a balance of payments deficit of over 14 per cent of gross national product.  Against that background he was highly critical of the level of inflation that had obtained under Fianna Fáil whilst at the same time promising to embark on a programme which would have the immediate effect of lowering the general level of price increases. Yet, without batting an eye, he immediately imposed an increase in value-added tax of 5 per cent, hitting hard almost every aspect of social life in the country. At best, all one can say is that he and his Government have been totally dishonest. But the seriousness of the situation for the poor and unemployed is such as to make present policies criminal in the extreme.  Imagine the arrogance of any Government in these inflationary times <Col N="1162" /> offering an increase of 5 per cent to long-term social welfare recipients and 3 per cent to those on short-term benefits. Those increases hardly represent the price of an additional bottle of milk per week but, in real terms and when set against Government-imposed inflation represent a net loss.  This is a terrible indictment of a Government who had professed to be caring and concerned. The recent increases granted to the ESB, of the order of 20 per cent, a company whose accounting methods are the centre of dispute anyway, and who showed a profit of more than £6 million last year, were unnecessary and unjustified.</P>
    <P>Even at the best of times the plight of the poor, the disabled and the unemployed in Ireland is a severe one, and to say that indexation of their allowances to the cost of living increases is adequate is to condemn to further deprivation and degradation those who have served their country so well all their lives and those who through misfortune or economic circumstances do not have the opportunity to make such a contribution.  Because of their plight, physically, materially and psychologically, any increase granted to them should always represent a real net gain.  Developments in national pay agreements in recent years have taken serious cognisance of this need, because of the growing awareness that to ignore the weakest in our society is not only grossly unfair but evil and damaging to society as a whole.  On the one hand it promotes the greed principle and on the other it serves to promote the view in industrial relations that might is right.</P>
    <P>Recognising these rights, the Fianna Fáil Government in their spring 1981 budget granted an increase of 25 per cent on these allowances and in the Social Welfare Bill before Christmas last year the then Minister granted a double week allowance to long-term recipients.  When you compare the Bill now before us with those provisions, and when you recall the loud voices of the Labour Party and of Mr. John Carroll of trades union fame at that time you must ask where are those voices now: is it simply a case of the 30 pieces of silver having done a fine efficient job?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> When we take a serious look at the main thrust of Government economic policy as initiated in this Bill we find a muddle of conflicting targets and a profusion of inconsistencies in their overall application.  The increases in VAT will increase the factor costs of production and inevitably seriously erode the competitiveness of our products on the domestic and international markets.  The implications here are enormous.  Our terms of trade will decline rapidly and our balance of trade will be seriously affected.</P>
    <P>In this regard I refer to a speech by the Taoiseach to Trinity College's Philosophical Society on Wednesday of last week. When expressing concern for the loss of competitiveness of our goods and services, he laid the blame simply and solely on the ground that our pay rates had risen faster than those of our competitors. Anybody with the slightest grasp or understanding of factor costs knows that wages, although significant, represent only one such factor, and for the Taoiseach to make such a statement is a gross over-simplification.  It means, at least, that he has no direct responsibility in the area of competitiveness.  It was a refusal by him to take account of the implications of this Bill in that area.  It was also an attempt to incriminate the workers in order to deflect attention from the ramifications of the budget.</P>
    <P>During the course of the same speech, the Taoiseach stated that the wholesale price index, which measures increases in the cost of goods leaving the factory gates, has been slowing down.  That would suggest the dawning of a more favourable pattern in our competitiveness and must surely be at odds with his earlier reasoning.  What he did not acknowledge is that there is always a time lag involved before the effects of any policy can be gauged, so the latter reference of the Taoiseach is a reflection of favourable trends emanating from the former Government's policies, and the former reference was on the basis of anticipating a reversal of that favourable trend because of his policies in this Bill.</P>
    <P>At this stage I will examine a very <Col N="1164" /> fundamental point in regard to our imports.  This country has a very high import content, and the price elasticity of demand is very weak and sometimes negligible. A very high proportion of the raw materials for our manufacturing industry has to be imported, and this is the area which is acknowledged by all economists as the main springboard of employment creation in the private sector.  It is the area on which tens of thousands of our young people leaving school annually will be dependent and to which thousands of other workers already facing the grim prospect of being thrust on the dole queues will be looking for alternative employment.  Yet the Bill before us does not do anything to enhance the prospects in this area.  Indeed the conditions produced by the provisions of the Bill are already creating a serious disincentive to investment plans.  Deputies on all sides must be aware, from daily media references, of the effects being felt across the whole spectrum of industry.  There has been a definite toning down and a shelving of investment decisions, plus threats and rumours of closures, with increasing regularity.</P>
    <P>There is the case of B &amp; I with their threat to trim down their operations and manpower.  In view of present conditions and distincentives, the unions within B &amp; I in the past week told me that they are inclined to agree with the decision of the company because they do not see any long-term prospects under the present administration.  Aer Lingus are in trouble, and in the past week or two we have had the ACC telling farmers, despite the serious difficulties they are experiencing, that if they do not come up with the readies immediately, readies which most farmers do not have, the ACC will consider closing their doors.</P>
    <P>Then, we have the Minister for Agriculture telling the farmers that all he is doing is talking.  In the course of a radio interview yesterday, when he was asked what he intended to do, what decisions he and the Department intended to make, he said he was in consultation with the banks and that he did not want to pre-empt any decisions that might arise from the consultations.  I say that is not <Col N="1165" /> good enough, particularly when jobs in agriculture are already being threatened, when farmers are already on the way to the dole queues, on the way to selling farms and leaving agriculture.  This is contrary to promises made by the Coalition in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The building industry, from which emanates one of the greatest multipliers of any form of investment, is already showing signs of a dangerous depression. When you superimpose on that background the present embargo on recruitment to the public service, the huge reduction of intake to teacher training &mdash; I will be dealing later with the budget provisions for education &mdash; what is there by way of employment prospects for the decades ahead?</P>
    <P>The Government have offered us a Youth Employment Agency.  Why not bolster and assist existing structures? Deputy Sherlock referred to manpower and the need to extend courses and flesh out and further develop services in that area.  Other Deputies made reference to the youth employment schemes brought in by our Government in the past.  These should be developed and additional allocations made to them.  I have no objections to the creation of a youth employment agency provided it is not just one big smokescreen and another white elephant. With 50 per cent of the population under 25 years of age and an increasing number of young people coming on to the labour market, job creation for this age group is vital.  I hope the creation of new structures and new bureaucracies will have the desired effects.</P>
    <P>The sincerity of the Government's intentions in terms of commitment to employment creation must be seriously in doubt.  Any new creations in this area, while neglecting existing ones, are merely smokescreens to divert people's attention from a ruthless, insensitive and blind monetarist pursuit.  The Minister was fascinated that people were bandying about the word &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo;.  I assure him that my view of monetarist is contrary to the fiscal policy.  A fiscal policy sees the necessity for Government intervention to help along the economy in bad times. <Col N="1166" /> This Government have chosen to pull in the reins on money.  In so doing they justifiably deserve the label &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Arising out of all this it now seems more popular and profitable to tell a redundant worker with all his acquired skills or a young graduate of college or school with State and parental investment of thousands of pounds, to head directly for his nearest labour exchange with all the indignity it confers rather than give him an opportunity to reinvest his talents, skills and experience to the benefit of his own dignity and of the economic and social well-being of the community.  There are Deputies on the Government benches trying beleaguredly to justify the measures before us in terms of the fulfilment of Fine Gael election promises.  I have heard at least one Deputy say that the pledge of £9.60 to a housewife represented the first step towards recognising the role and contribution of women in the home.  Is it out of naivety or out of a deliberate, if rather weak, attempt to mislead that such Deputies would have us believe that such a measure makes one iota of a positive and real contribution in the way suggested? For one thing, as every housewife knows, a rapidly increasing proportion of her weekly shopping basket is made up of non-food items so that the real gains to her will have been eaten up completely by way of price increases before ever she begins to receive such an allowance.  If the measure is designed for the stay-at-home wives whose husbands are reluctant to part with adequate household allowances, then all these husbands have to do in the future is to decrease their contribution to the household by the equivalent amount.  Indeed, arising out of the levy being imposed on them, some will feel justified in adopting such an attitude.</P>
    <P>It is clear that these are only some of the problems related to this aspect.  The sending out of upwards of 300,000 cheques of £9.60 a week, which will make no household better off, will bring a new administrative structure into being with extra staff requirements and in its wake will come a flood of applications to be <Col N="1167" /> processed from other housewives claiming their eligibility.  Inevitably it is a recipe for division and resentment between the haves and the have nots.  Another one of those spurious cases put forward in justification of the monetarist nature of this Bill is that it permits the Government to follow through on a reckless vote-catching gimmick of immediate tax reform.  Everybody agrees that reform in the PAYE sector is a priority since this sector carries over 86 per cent of the burden of revenue from direct taxation. Yet the implementation of this entire promise immediately will necessitate increases in indirect taxation in next January's budget to the tune of £400 million and all in the interest of this illusory thing they call &ldquo;discretionary income&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regret the day economists ever coined the term because it is giving fuel to the present administration to con the people in the short-term.  The effects of this measure on inflation, industry, employment and the quality of social life generally will be astronomical.  There was some ray of hope for reason in this area with the first public pronouncement made by the Tánaiste regarding the folly of transferring the entire burden immediately but, regrettably, with the first crack on the knuckles from above, he was not long about retiring to silent submission.  The Taoiseach and his Government should know only too well that what they are putting forward flies in the face of advice from every respected economic authority, authorities whose advice they so feverishly clung to in the past.</P>
    <P>To say this package adds to inflation is to understate the facts particularly when one takes into account the effects it will have on industrial relations and wage claims in both the public and private sectors. Yet the Government seem to have thrown in the towel on the advice of the three wise owls regarding the promotion of a new national understanding.  We saw the attitude of the Taoiseach when he was asked by Deputies O'Donoghue and Haughey yesterday what he was prepared to offer to both sides that might entice them to go forward with further arbitration. He had nothing to say except that <Col N="1168" /> what was put forward already was meaningful and negotiable.  The Government's refusal to make any determined effort to secure agreement can best be described as a deliberate act of irresponsible brinkmanship.  Already the big guns of the trade union movement are lining up to fire demand volleys in excess of 25 per cent.  Engineering workers, maintenance craftsmen, senior civil servants and many others who, in the recent past have shown their bargaining muscle, are already gearing themselves to claim what they regard as just compensation for erosion of real earnings by virtue of this Bill.  Those hardest hit in this free for all melee will be the lower paid and those employed in the vulnerable footwear and textile industries.</P>
    <P>In one respect this Government are consistent.  The strategy is the same irrespective of qualitative or quantitative differences in the factors or areas affected. The Finance Bill wantonly condemns the poor and under-privileged to a daunting winter of want.  The implicit discouragement of a national understanding adds insult to injury.  It is a kick in the teeth to those least able to fight back.</P>
    <P>Last, but by no means least, I want to deliberate briefly on an aspect of this Bill and what it subsequently spawned in the area of educational provision.  In so doing I do not want to pre-empt or prejudice anything that might be said this evening in this area.  Far from making a positive contribution to the progress of the previous administration with regard to education needs, the increase of 5 per cent VAT on the price of school books represents a savage and derisory response to the genuine difficulties being experienced by thousands of parents trying to meet the astronomical costs of books at present. I have reason to believe that sitting on the desk of the Minister for Education is a pile of petitions from principals of secondary schools on behalf of pupils whose parents are simply unable to pay. I have a copy of one such submission that was made to the Minister for Education on behalf of no fewer than 69 pupils in one school.  If that is any reflection of the national pattern&mdash;and I have good reason, from talking to various principals, to <Col N="1169" /> believe that it is&mdash;it is a clear indication of the reduction in educational estimates.</P>
    <P>The raising of the school entry age for reasons only of financial logistics with the consequent loss or redeployment of 920 jobs in the next two years, coupled with the reduction of 180 in student intake in the teacher training colleges, leaves no one in any doubt about what this administration think of the educational needs of our children.  To enable them to prepare to honour their irresponsible election pledges the Government through the provisions of this Bill have condemned 17,000 children to a year without education while at the same time telling about half that number either to make their first trudge to school in the winter months or to forfeit a further six months education. Surely this reflects a cruel, vicious and insensitive attitude.  On Sunday last in the course of a radio interview the Minister said that he and the Government must consider all cases sympathetically. Where does his sympathy lie?</P>
    <P>This Bill will best be remembered as the one that extinguished 920 existing teaching posts in two years and, arising out of the inevitably large panel created, will block the employment prospects of newly-qualified teachers in 1982 and 1983 thereby leading to widespread unemployment. Never before in the history of the State has the educational base been so narrowed out of necessity for financial provisions.  Never before have such stringent measures been taken without due consultation with the experts and the interested parties involved on the ground.  I am not too surprised in this regard because, apart from the very justified criticism that has been levelled at the Department of Finance arising out of this Bill, the people should know that the Minister for Education in an interview with the educational journal <i>Listening and Learning</i> admitted that he had never read a book on the theory of education. When asked whether he thought that Illich or any of the other debated theoreticians in this area was applicable or practical in an educational situation, he replied that he had had a corneal graft last Christmas and did not have an opportunity to check on those books, that he <Col N="1170" /> did not consult them before beginning to put forward his policies.  I resent this kind of cavalier attitude and approach towards his ministry.  As a teacher I take this opportunity of saying to him and to the people generally that on behalf of all the teachers he should either seek sound advice immediately or get out.</P>
    <P>It is said that practice without theory is blind, just as theory without practice is sterile.  If the man who coined that phrase did not have the originators of the present policies in mind he certainly was thinking of somebody closely resembling them. There is an over-weening preoccupation with financial logistics which takes no account of the educational, social, employment and economic needs of the community.  The monetarist policies embarked on by this Government, and to which this Finance Bill gives a clear and unequivocal push, have both immediate and long-term damaging affects. The plural aims of low inflation, reduction in unemployment and the sharp pruning of deficit budgeting so glowingly enunciated against a background of serious recession are clearly in conflict with each other.  The Taoiseach, in an attempt to get himself and his Government off the hook, must resort to stirring controversy and to deflecting attention elsewhere. The people will not be that easily duped and they will not forget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Rising to make a first contribution in this House is a daunting prospect for any Deputy but my job today has been made a little easier having regard to the contributions that have been made from the other side of the House by way of defence but which in effect are no defence.  Last week we had Deputy Flynn acting somewhat like the Playboy of the Western World, starting at A and going through to Z, almost as if he were told to keep going for so long as he could but that if he was not able to reach Z he could stop and somebody else would carry on. However, Deputy Flynn completed his task and today we had Deputy Liam Fitzgerald doing the same sort of thing. Today we have had what one might call a word-making process by way of endeavouring to distract the people from what <Col N="1171" /> we are discussing, that is, the need for the legislation before us.</P>
      <P>I hope that Deputy Fitzgerald who, happily, was flushed out by Deputy Kelly for a while, will be able to stay and listen to some of the situations that we find ourselves in.  It was precisely because the people decided that they would no longer take his party seriously that we are in Government.  The people had had enough and were determined to change the Government.</P>
      <P>I am helped in my task today, too, by reason of the confidence I have in the Taoiseach and in the knowledge that we have at the helm a man who can steer the country through the harsh years ahead. I am confident, too, that the people realise that.</P>
      <P>It has been said many times that we have inherited a legacy but there are people who tell us to get on with the job and stop harking back.  However, we must make the people aware of the situation we found on coming into office because otherwise they will not be able responsibly to help us set this country back on its feet.  The legacy we inherited could be likened to inheriting an old house, an old house that looks all right from the outside but which, as any tradesman worth his salt will know, must be examined from inside, from underneath the floors.  Regrettably all that has been happening to the house of which the last Government were in charge was that a coat of gloss was being put on it in an effort to prevent the people from seeing what was happening inside.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald has said, his party granted increases in social welfare payments but we might well ask where the money for these increases was coming from.  All the time we were being sucked further into the black hole.  That Government were acting as if they were in outer space.  They seemed to have no realisation of the problems of the economy.  In the sixties and seventies the growth rate in our economy was 4 per cent but that rate has not been matched in recent years.  The ESRI have predicted a 1.75 per cent growth rate for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish economy has to be looked at <Col N="1172" /> as a small open economy which is not immune from the problems of world trade in general.  The US are in recession with high interest rates.  The UK are suffering under monetary policies and our EEC partners have problems.  They are not all happy over there.  Our aim, with the support of the majority of thinking people in this country, must be prudent management of this economy in this harsh economic climate.  For years the Government were spending far more for current purposes than they had been earning.  The Fianna Fáil budget in February 1981 proposed a current account deficit of just over £500 million.  I quote from the NESC Report <i>Economic and Social Policy 1981</i> page 20, paragraph 1.34:</P>
    <P>One regrettable aspect of fiscal policies in 1979-80 is the increasing scale of error in budgetary forecasts.  Estimates in the budget statements of 1979 and 1980 suggested that the Exchequer borrowing requirement would amount to 10.5 per cent in both years, while the actual out-turns were 14.0 and 14.6 per cent of GNP, respectively.  The actual current budget deficit in 1979 was 80 per cent greater than forecast in the 1979 Budget, while the 1980 out-turn was 50 per cent greater than the forecast in the 1980 Budget.</P>
    <P>By the time this Government took office already the £500 million had been surpassed after less than half a year.  We can see where we were heading in 1981 if the last administration had continued the way they were going.  This point has to be stressed over and over again, because ostrich-like, burying-the-head-in-the-sand, irresponsible overspending conducted in the last administration was no more than an attempt to buy an election victory.  As the mother of young children, I have seen seven-year-olds manage their First Communion money better than has been evident from what we have discovered has been the practice in the last administration.  I come to this House directly from the ranks of housewives and I would like the House to consider the situation were all the housewives of Ireland to decide to troop in to <Col N="1173" /> their bank managers and ask for a loan to pay their weekly or monthly shopping bills.  I know, and I am sure the House will agree, that the outcome of those interviews would be predictable.  The bank manager would tell them that there was no way they could borrow for their day-to-day spending.  On the other hand a couple who go to a bank manager or a lending agency to seek finance to build an extension to their home or perhaps to start a small business will receive a fair hearing because that is prudent borrowing. It appalls me that, with all the supposed expertise on the Opposition benches, they continued to take the course they took.</P>
    <P>This is the background of why corrective action had to be taken swiftly after June when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, took office.  The action that this Government will have to take will be unpleasant but the people realise we have to take these measures.  The profligate, unrestrained spending of the last Fianna Fáil Government saw to this and the people realise that without such corrective action there will be a crisis of confidence of international proportions in our ability to manage our affairs.  We do not pretend that the measures taken in July are the answer to everything.  We realise that we are only starting, we are only down at the wiring under the floor-boards.  We have set out over a period of Government of, we hope, four to five years to start to eliminate the current budget deficit.  We must hope that the ordinary people out there, the people of Ireland, realise that we are only starting.</P>
    <P>As well as all the other problems that we encountered on taking office a large number of price rises had been held over for political reasons.  When we came into office it was our job to implement those price rises.  I am confident and thankful that the electorate are far too sophisticated nowadays to be taken in by this. They were taken in by various proposals made in 1977, but they learned their lesson and now they are far too sophisticated to realise that you can hide something and leave somebody else to take up the burden later.  In spite of all we found when we came into Government the <Col N="1174" /> Fianna Fáil Opposition are saying that no corrective measures are needed, never mind, there is no problem, everything will be fine, it will be sorted out.  God knows, I hesitate to think where we would have ended had we continued down this slippery slope.  Already many sectors have had to be helped out.  The Department of the Environment had to allocate extra money to the local authorities to enable their house-building programmes to continue.  The Minister for Education had to allocate extra moneys for the school transport service.  Many services would have had to stop, to close the doors &mdash; sorry, no more, that is it &mdash; if we had continued without giving some extra financial aid in these areas.  The remedial action had to be taken.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Taoiseach made timely reference to the fact that 80p out of every £1 collected in income tax goes to pay the interest on our national debt which stands now at about £8,000 million. Approximately £3,000 million of that is in foreign loans.  We must concur with the Taoiseach when he declared that we must restore balance to our public finances by moving steadily and resolutely away from a situation where nearly £1 in every £2 the Government borrows is used to defray the budget deficit expenses.  I will quote from <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 25 October 1981 something that the economics editor Sarah Hogg had to say:</P>
    <P>Both European and American banks have been dangerously happy to lend Ireland sums which to them look like small change.  But realists in Dublin know how sudden the change of creditors' mood can be, and are now acutely worried by the burden of servicing and repaying D-mark and dollar loans.</P>
    <P>I submit that the last Government were dangerously happy to borrow these moneys and they just kept going.  They did not even stop to see where they were heading.  It was just hands out and these banks were dangerously happy to give money that was a pittance in their budgets.</P>
    <P>Turning to pay increases, whether we have national understandings or not <Col N="1175" /> there is a real need to have a national consciousness for a pay policy and its cost effects on our international competitiveness. The whole question of pay in the public sector has to be looked at.  We must show the public that we are getting value for our money.  We must face fairly and squarely the reality that as a country we cannot condone or bear the burden of pay increases of the level that has been seen in previous years.  We cannot continue with this mentality of &ldquo;ask and you shall receive&rdquo;.  That is suicidal.  This Government are correct in not entertaining proposals which would involve pay increases of an enormous amount.  With our high inflation rate large pay rises could lead only to cost increases which would erode further our competitive position in the marketplace and exacerbate our already serious balance of payments. Wage restraint is essential if jobs are to be protected and created.  In the couple of months since I was elected I was very conscious of how deserving and aware the electorate are.  They are not a stupid, uncaring, heads-buried-in-the-sand electorate.  They are acutely aware of the problems facing this country.  As a Government we cannot see these corrective measures taking effect unless we have the people behind us.  That is why so many speakers from this side of the House are finding it necessary to point out how the situation was when we got into government.  We have a duty to make the people aware of the problems facing us.  We have a duty to make the people aware of the problems we encountered when taking office and of those that face us in the future.  If they can see that the measures proposed by this Government have been studied and considered from all angles, then I am confident that they will back us and will do what they have to do to help to ensure that our policies are implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government are now being encouraged from some quarters, namely, the IMF and the ESRI to postpone some of our tax reforms.  A less courageous Government might well decide to do that but most people agree that tax reforms are long overdue.  The equity of the <Col N="1176" /> income tax code is far from clear from the point of view of PAYE taxpayers. Proof of the demand for this change was seen from the thousands upon thousands of people who took to the streets of Dublin, in the last 50 or 60 years probably the biggest crowd of people to march in the streets except, perhaps, for the Eucharistic Congress and the Pope's visit in 1979.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if she will approve St. Columba's Nursing Home, Kilcolgan, County Galway, under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, for the purpose of the payment of subventions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. E. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give <Col N="1177" /> approval to this home at this time.  The problem essentially is that there are increasing numbers of nursing homes setting up in business and seeking approval to the payment of subventions.  In many instances the accommodation they provide is not essential to health services requirements.  In a situation in which financial resource is scarce it is essential that the need for the accommodation should be thoroughly assessed.  My Department have recently met with health boards in this regard and further consultations with them will be necessary before I can arrive at any decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would she agree that this home is in existence for some time and that there are old people in residence there who find that the increasing cost of paying the fees is getting beyond their capacity to pay?  If they have to leave these homes the only other option available to them is a home provided by the health board.  The cost of this would be greatly in excess of the small subvention which the health boards had been authorised to pay in previous years.  I think the present Minister is the first Minister who has not sanctioned payment of subventions to these excellent homes which have been giving wonderful care to our older citizens.  Would the Minister comment?</P>

Throughout the rest of the country, there are a further 18 nursing homes with a bed complement of 325.  In view of the large volume of applications for approval a meeting was arranged and took place on 24 September between representatives of the health boards and of my Department. <Col N="1178" /> A number of points emerged from this meeting and a further meeting will be held.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not now have the total cost but know that it is quite considerable.  There is also the question of the scarcity of capital resources.  The matters which arose at the meeting which took place between the officials of the Department and of the Health Board included a suggestion that there should be statutory registration of the homes in order to provide better control over them.  There is also the question of the assessment of patients' eligibility under section 54 of the Act, because it is confined to those patients who are receiving nursing care as opposed to welfare care only.  There are a number of questions to be looked into and cleared and there will then be a total costing.  I am not at present in a position to state the total cost.</P>

We must assess properly the situation and see what moneys are available to us.

      <P>The estimated cost of equipment is £3 million.  Consultation with regard to the equipment is proceeding at present.  Most of the problems have been resolved.  There will be about 700 additional staff and, as I have already <Col N="1183" /> said, I cannot give a further commitment on this, pending the outcome of the health capital programme which is under review by the Government at present. When I know what moneys are available to me I will tell the Deputy whether it will be possible to meet the demands.</P>

Will the Minister agree that here we have a clear case where capital expenditure is urgently desired for the benefit of a very large section of the community, that this new regional hospital for which we provided the money is a key element in the provision of the health services for the south west, a situation about which the Minister, when in opposition, was frequently vociferous?  Will the Minister endeavour to persuade her more monetarist-minded colleagues in the Government to provide the necessary funds for this essential development of our health services?</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if she is aware that the ordering process for the equipment has now been set back because this was to go on stream immediately as far as Tralee hospital is concerned?  It is a serious situation.  From the time ordering is approved it will be between eight and nine months before some of the major equipment can be delivered.  Will the Minister, therefore, recognise that any delay at this stage in a programme which was to go ahead to completion, including the provision of equipment, will mean an inordinate delay at the other end because of the time lag? Will the Minister, therefore, do her utmost with her Cabinet colleagues to get back the approval which was there for the completion of the hospital?  Is the <Col N="1185" /> Minister aware that even given no additional finance next year the Tralee hospital was covered totally for equipment and putting into operation?</P>

      <P>As far as equipment is concerned an equipping group, made up of representatives of the Southern Health Board and the Department of Health, met at intervals since October 1980 to agree lists of furniture and equipment generally.  About two-thirds of the non-specialist equipment and furniture has been agreed already, and one-third remains to be agreed.  The requirement of seven departments remains to be examined and all specialised equipment remains to be agreed with the consultants with speciality.  Suitable items for transfer from St. Catherine's Hospital, Tralee, will be listed for transfer to the new hospital at the appropriate time.  As far as the general question is concerned, I have already said I agree that this is something which is very desirable and, in the light of the finances made available to me, it certainly will receive my approval.</P>

      <P>A decision as to when a contract will be placed for the extension to the training centre for the mentally handicapped at Kilcornan will depend on the availability of capital resources.</P>
      <P>I cannot, at this time, say when I will be in a position to indicate when work on the project will begin.  The health capital programme is under review by the Government in the context of its review of public expenditure generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it is not unusual that, where a decision had been made in the Department by a Minister to invite tenders for the construction of this much needed facility for mentally handicapped people, the brakes should now be put on?  Will the Minister agree that it is unusual and strange, where tenders have been examined and the architect has informed the successful tenderer that he is to get the contract, that she should put on the brakes on a much needed project.  Surely the Department would not have agreed to put the building out to tender if provision had not already been made for the capital expenditure involved?</P>

I agree that a tender for the sum of £740,762.42p was <Col N="1187" /> the lowest and that approval has not issued so far but I hope, in the light of the resources available to me, I might be in a position to approve this tender in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Is it intended to approve this tender before the end of the year? Will the Minister agree that the capital to commence this project was provided within the capital funds given by the former Minister for Finance to the Department of Health?  Will the Minister agree that a decision not to go ahead with this project this year would mean the withdrawal of capital which is there and was voted for this project by the House?  It is not a question of additional capital because the capital has been provided.  In fact, an initial sum was to have been expended on it this year.  Will the Minister agree that the question of providing capital resources for the adult mentally handicapped, something which is involved in this contract, must be a priority and that any of the facilities which can be provided within the resources available should be provided?  Will the Minister agree that the facility in question was being provided within available resources which were voted by this House?</P>

Will the Minister further agree that this failure to proceed with this very necessary facility is a further manifestation of the cold reality of the monetarist <Col N="1188" /> policies being pursued by the Government?

      <P>As far as the unit at Carriglea is concerned, the annual running cost of the chalet is estimated to be about £230,700 in a full year, and the running costs in relation to St. Michael's training centre at Belmont Park, Waterford, is estimated at £203,300 in a full year.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the cost this year, when the Government are so concerned about their current finances, to open both of them would be only of the order of £50,000?  The Minister told us that the full year's cost would approximately be £430,000 to open both units.  Does the Minister agree that the Government plan to take, as was told to us in this House, £86 million in additional health charges next year?  How can the Government be concerned about finding the money to continue this facility for the adult mentally handicapped, which is ready to go ahead now, in next year's situation?  As far as this year is concerned would she not agree that £50,000 is a very small price to provide two excellent facilities for mentally handicapped adults?</P>

      <P>The report of the Working Party on General Nursing which was published in October 1980 contains recommendations concerning the recruitment and selection of students for nurse training.  Apart from making recommendations concerning the recruitment process the report also recommends the establishment of a central applications bureau under the auspices of An Bord Altranais which would be responsible for the processing of all applications for nurse training. The training schools would be represented on the bureau and the interviewing arrangements would result in students being interviewed at regional level to determine their suitability for nurse training thereby eliminating the need for students to be interviewed separately by each nurse training school processing its own applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if she agrees with the practice whereby (i) health boards refund the same amount of the old age pension to both contributory and non-contributory long-term patients and (ii) British pensioners are not allowed any benefit in respect of the advantage of sterling over <Col N="1197" /> the IR£; and if this practice is adopted by all health boards or only by the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of maintaining long-term patients in health board institutions is far in excess of the amounts paid to such patients by way of old age pensions from whatever source.</P>
      <P>However, all health boards generally allow long-term patients to retain certain amounts from their pensions to enable them to purchase personal items, for example, newspapers, magazines, sweets, tobacco and so forth.  The amounts allowed to be retained are increased from time to time.  In the case of the South Eastern Health Board the amount allowed to be retained are pensioners is one-quarter of the pension subject to a minimum of £8.65 per week. Patients who are not capable of handling money are provided with benefits in kind. I consider that this arrangement is fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the application of any advantage of sterling over the IR£ in respect of British pensioners, the practice varies from health board to health board. Some health boards, including the South-Eastern Health Board, do convert pensions paid in pounds sterling to IR£, others do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister she did not answer the first part of the question.  Contributory old age pensioners receive a greater allowance than non-contributory old age pensioners. The difference is about £4 or £5, but the amount that is handed back in health board institutions is identical.  The contributory old age pensioner gets no advantage whatsoever.  Would the Minister not agree that that is an unfair system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, it varies from health board to health board.  In the case of the South Eastern Health Board each pensioner receives £8.65p per week.  That represents a quarter of the old age contributory pension to those aged 80 years and over. British pensions are converted into <Col N="1198" /> punts.  If it is less than £8.65p the shortfall is made up by the board.  If it is more the patient gets the benefit of it.  Health boards vary.  The aim is to provide what is reasonable for the patient.  There is a possibility of having a unified system.  I am prepared to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely asking the Minister about the justice of the case.  If the State sees fit to give the contributory old age pensioner an extra sum of money, should that not also be the case proportionately in the institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do.  As regards the lack of parity between the Irish punt and the £ sterling, I do not agree with the Minister.  I should like her to check to see that the benefit of sterling is being given to all patients in all institutions.  I do not believe that is the case.  Does the Minister believe it is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim report on the employment of social workers issued by the National Manpower Planning Committee for Personal and Social Services considered that, taking into account the views of health boards regarding future expansion, a national ratio of one social worker to 9,000 of the population should be aimed at.  That would mean that 374 health board social workers would be required, an increase of 132 over the present number of 242. In the case of the Eastern Health Board area it would mean an increase of 129. That is to be aimed at.  I would hope that legislation dealing with child care will be introduced in the future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the number of chronic kidney patients in County Kerry at present travelling on average three times a week to Cork Regional Hospital <Col N="1203" /> and of the considerable hardship caused to these patients, she will provide the necessary finance for the provision of dialysis facilities at the new Tralee General Hospital.</P>

      <P>The provision of dialysis facilities at the new Tralee General Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board and no such proposal has been received from the board.  I understand that a deputation from the local health committee for Kerry will be received at the next board meeting on 2 November 1981 to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>I should explain that, because of the considerable expense involved, it is departmental policy to concentrate the location of maintenance dialysis units in three centres, namely, Cork, Dublin and Galway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the base figure of the scheme for assistance towards the cost of prescribed medical requisites came into effect from 1 August 1981.  It is estimated that as a result of this change expenditure under the scheme in the current year will be reduced by about £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, in addition to savings of this order being made by increasing the amount which the ordinary person pays for drugs and medicines &mdash; the figure the Minister gave was £500,000 &mdash; the time for the recoupment of the money has been extended?  I have received a number of complaints that the time to recover moneys in excess of £12 has been extended. Will the Minister look at this with a view to restoring a reasonable repayment period?  Secondly, will the Minister look at the situation that has developed for those suffering from bronchitis, arthritis, heart conditions and other chronic conditions because of the large amount of money they have to spend on medicine? Will she agree that the change that has taken place has worsened their position? Is she prepared to introduce a system of fast payment for certain people in these categories?  Examination of this matter was well under way before the Minister <Col N="1205" /> took office.  This matter is most important to the people concerned, particularly at this time.  I am asking her to consider having a quick system of payment at least as a minimum measure.  There are other things that could be done also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I spoke about the situation we found when we came to office.  I could understand how we got into that situation when I heard a Deputy ask a Minister to make an educated guess about something. Governments are not run by guesswork and I am glad the Minister in question did not give a guess, educated or otherwise. Perhaps it was this policy of guessing that got us into our present difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few months I have become very conscious of just how discerning is the general public.  People cannot be hoodwinked any longer.  They were hoodwinked in 1977 and they realised that.  Now they are beginning to see we have a Government and a leader prepared to take courageous steps to stop this terrible slide down the slippery slope. If we want the corrective measures to be put into action we must have the people behind us.  This Government propose certain tax reform measures, measures <Col N="1235" /> that people walked in their tens of thousands in the streets of Dublin to obtain. The marches attracted the largest gathering of people since the Eucharistic Congress or the Pope's visit.  The people want tax reforms.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before the Adjournment, the equity of the tax code was very unclear to most PAYE people.  Mr. Ben Carney, President of the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, who organised the marches, has said that there will be no diminution in the tax reforms they are demanding.  The Government are courageous and despite being pressed by the IMF, the ESRI and many members of the Opposition to put off the tax reforms, that nettle must be grasped firmly.  I am confident this Government have the guts to follow the old adage &ldquo;Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today&rdquo;.  The pattern in the past four or five years has been to keep on giving in the hope that somebody else would carry the burden later.  That time has come and this Government are prepared to shoulder that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Liam Fitzgerald, who spoke before the Adjournment, was critical of the Taoiseach.  The defence being put up by the Opposition is no defence.  They have been caught on the hop.  During the election campaign Fianna Fáil members &mdash;who never countenanced that they would be in opposition after the election &mdash;tried to counteract the goodwill created by the commitment of Fine Gael to recognise the work and the worth of stay-at-home wives.  This was an innovative and caring policy put forward by people who are concerned about the thousands and thousands of women who are the backbone of the country.  I regard them as unsung heroines.  I say alleluia for people such as the Taoiseach and Senator Gemma Hussey who spearheaded the movement to recognise that section of the community and to acknowledge the tremendous work carried out by them.  Without them the country could not function.  I am also pleased that this Government realise that housewives have eyes that need testing and have teeth that need dental care and that they <Col N="1236" /> will benefit under the social welfare scheme.  I accept that these measures will cost money but it is wisely spent money. The lending agencies will see that it is prudent to introduce measures that bring about a more equitable system.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with our taxation proposals which will recognise single parent families.  The tax system will give the same benefits to a single person as it gives to the chief breadwinner.  That is particularly pleasing to me as a child of a widow who had to raise a family without getting tax concessions as the chief breadwinner.</P>
    <P>This Government have an opportunity to deal with the public sector and they must be firm.  The people will accept the harsh measures that are necessary if they feel they are getting value for money and if they see discipline is being exercised from the top.  We can exercise the discipline which has been sadly lacking for a number of years.</P>
    <P>We must continue to support the Government's efforts to attract investment, foreign and domestic.  The rate of unemployment is not good but it is especially bad in the case of school leavers.  As a housewife I see as the most serious effect of unemployment the lack of an opportunity for young people to develop the habit of working, of getting up in the morning and having to go to a third level educational institution, a factory, office or whatever.  It is our responsibility to provide opportunities too for young people to work and the incentive to start their own businesses.</P>
    <P>That is why I welcome the proposed youth employment scheme.  We have a responsibility to provide the young people with the opportunity to develop skills so that they in turn can lead this country into the next century, perhaps even lead it better than it has been led for the last few years.  The habit of unemployment is dangerous and debilitating and we must do all in our power to get rid of it.  I applaud the efforts of the IDA, although in recent months many brickbats have been thrown at them.  Last week they reported over 900 small firms had started up giving an enormous amount of employment.  We must accept <Col N="1237" /> the fact that we have to learn to crawl before we can walk.</P>
    <P>We must explore every avenue open to us.  I am a member of Dublin County Council and realise local authorities have a duty to provide suitably zoned land to allow industrialists to open factories and create jobs.  If the central purse cannot pay for all the services needed to make these lands usable for industry we must introduce mechanisms and legislation to allow a coming together of the industrialists; the people who want to supply the jobs and the Government.  If we must introduce new legislation, so be it.  We have come to the stage where the public purse is straining and cannot be expected to pay for everything.  As I said, I welcome the opportunity for the local authorities, the Department of the Environment and the industrialists to get together to open up the lands needed for new industries.</P>
    <P>The people would condone these enormous budget deficits if everything was grand, but it is not.  They have not seen any benefits for these very big deficits and borrowing.  There is one area where it is possible to get value for money.  The budget for Dublin County Council is in the region of revenue £76 million and capital £20 million.  Out of that a small sum is allocated for community grant schemes.  In 1980 £121,000 was utilised by the council to help finance 122 separate small projects &mdash; scout groups, preschool groups, drama clubs and all sorts of local groups which are providing social services in their areas.  We could take a lesson from that because that is money well spent.  If we must spend large sums of money let us get value.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where vast increases in pay and social welfare payments are not on.  An area where the Government could get value for money is in financing the many excellent voluntary organisations.  I am very proud to be a member of a party who said in their policy for Government that they would recognise more the work of these voluntary groups.  There are many types of group, some of them aimed towards women, such as Women's Aid, AIM, Cherish and ADAPT.  These organisations <Col N="1238" /> do not need vast sums but the amount of work they do which could not be done by State agencies is enormous. For very little money these groups could help us fight poverty.  We cannot put a value on the voluntary work done by these groups.</P>
    <P>The ICA and the Irish Housewives Association give a different type of service. They are more socially orientated. Other groups like St. Vincent de Paul, Simon and ALONE, play an enormous part in society.  If a small sum of money can help these groups to provide a service and help combat poverty, that will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>The Government are providing the leadership needed.  They are going to stop the drift and the days of inactivity and get rid of the &ldquo;it will be all right on the night&rdquo; attitude.  Only firm leadership and prudent management will get us out of the doldrums.  Promises will not do it. If the people realise that what we are doing is being done for the benefit of this country and not for any local or sectional interest, they will be behind us.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald's Government can help put this country back on its feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Is cúis áthais agus onóir dòmsa bheith ag caint don céad uair anseo inniu.  It is a great honour and privilege for me to be here today to make my maiden speech on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  I am very conscious of all the great men who have gone before me and who have made worthwhile contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with some amusement that I listened to the Minister for Finance when he said, moving the Second Stage, that the general reaction from the public to the measures proposed in the budget was one of acceptance of the unavoidable.  He must not have spent very much time in the county in which I live.  The general reaction to the budget was one of disgust, disappointment and disbelief.  The Minister and his colleagues have overplayed the &ldquo;blame Fianna Fáil&rdquo; card.  The public are not interested in excuses; they want the action which is expected of a Government. The budget was regarded as penal in every respect and the Minister should <Col N="1239" /> have no illusions about it.  The Coalition of ultra-conservatives, socialists and the &ldquo;catch-me-if-you-can&rdquo; brigade are well aware that this Government are being hailed as the poorest, the shakiest and the most indecisive.  This has been clearly demonstrated by their refusal to test the acceptability of the budget in a by-election in Cavan-Monaghan.  When the Government sent their precursors to Cavan-Monaghan they got a fright because the message came back that Fianna Fáil would easily win.  The result is that the people of this constituency are to be denied their right because of the cowardly attitude of the Government.  If they are so satisfied with the level of acceptability of the budget, why did the Minister on so many occasions during his speech make silly excuses for its severity? This trend was continued throughout the debate by many Fine Gael speakers who spent more time making excuses than worthwhile contributions.  Other Fine Gael speakers have agreed with us that the measures imposed were ill-begotten and an insult to the people.</P>
    <P>We recall before the June election the confidence with which Fine Gael and Labour were urging the electorate to change the Government.  They had the solutions to all the problems, but where now are those solutions?  Following a hasty get together with Labour and an expensive courtship of the Independents, Fine Gael assumed office.  When power comes in the door the risk of contamination goes out the window.  This hasty marriage of Fine Gael and Labour proved difficult even on honeymoon because mother-in-law, Deputy Jim Kemmy, was sleeping in the same room with one eye open.  Then the electorate were told when the Government came down to earth that they were not aware of the state of the country's finances.  It is a poor reflection on them that they should make this suggestion, having conned the electorate into believing that they knew it all.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are opposing this Bill because of the hardships which have been imposed on all sections of the community. A brick wall has been built across the road of progress.  Let us look at the <Col N="1240" /> education scene and observe how this penny pinching policy affects it.  The education of our children must be above economics but that is not to suggest that money is ill-spent in educating our young people.  Our education system leaves a lot to be desired but we had been making significant progress.  The hardships imposed by the budget have seriously undermined and curtailed that progress. The ordinary parent, already worse off due to massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, has now to face a 15 per cent VAT charge on schoolbooks.  These books are an absolute necessity but due to this increase in VAT parents simply cannot afford them.  Let not anyone say that the free book scheme, which has operated well for some years, will solve the problem.  It will not do so because the scheme is grossly inadequate to cover normal costs.  Certainly it was never designed to cover VAT charges.  If children must do without the books necessary for their education not only will it make it more difficult for them to learn but there will also be a psychological effect.  The fact that their parents cannot afford the books will be the subject of some derisory remarks at school which may have a lasting adverse effect.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the changes in the third level education grant scheme we would point out that some of the schemes were advertised as being available to all leaving certificate holders irrespective of whether they had passed the examination in 1979, 1980 or 1981.  Recently, however, the Department of Education sent a circular to all county education officers saying that only those who had passed the leaving certificate examination in 1981 would qualify.  These are changes in mid-stream designed to save money at the expense of the nation's education. Many youngsters who had set their sights on college education, having made all their preparations and having foregone other opportunities, had their hopes dashed by the callous stroke of a pen.  It is a case of losing the ship for a penny-worth of tar.  This is not the only area of education where proposed savings will do untold damage.  The need for money to fund the election promises dictates policy. <Col N="1241" /> The raising of the school entry age will have a detrimental effect on child education, but since this is the subject of another debate I will not discuss it further now.</P>
    <P>The working man is hard hit by the jump in petrol prices from £1.80 to £2.21 per gallon.  For the average man working away from home this imposition represents a big slice of his pay packet.  The re-introduction of car tax, the VAT increases on cars and the 41p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol combine to make the cost of motoring one of the greatest burdens on the weekly pay packet.  Today the car is as essential as the kitchen table, an absolute necessity. The price of the pint, which was part of the worker's daily life, has jumped almost out of reach since this budget.  The worker, too, needs his enjoyment.</P>
    <P>The housewife is expected to make ends meet despite the inroads already made into the pay packet.  Increases in the prices of coal, gas, electricity and all essential food items make the task miserable and leave little for activities outside the home.  With the strain of modern living in this age of hectic activity, it is necessary for the housewife to be able to afford to get away from it all sometimes. Of course we will be told that the £9.60 per week will alleviate this burden but this is an election confidence trick.</P>
    <P>During the election the impression was given at every doorstep that if Fine Gael got into power cheques would flow to all and sundry. Depriving children of their proper education, this is what will pay the £9.60.  The £9.60 arrangement will have the effect of leaving the household worse off, mentally and financially, because of the interference by the State in a private family matter, a point driven home forcibly by Deputy Richie Ryan, a member of the Government party who conceived this gimmick.  Evidently the Minister for Finance and his Government believe that the breadwinner is no longer giving or capable of giving sufficient money to his spouse.  In 99 per cent of Irish homes this financial arrangement every week was an indication of love, trust and appreciation.  How dare this <Col N="1242" /> Government interfere in the intimacies of marriage.  It will cause friction in family life.  This proposal will have the effect of civil servants being paid out of taxpayers' money in order to take money out of the husband's pocket to be given to the wife, the end result being that the household will have less.</P>
    <P>The budget proposals have brought the farmers on to the streets.  Never before were farmers so hard hit.  Their declining income has hit an all-time low following this budget.  Prior to the June election we heard spokesmen of Fine Gael on agriculture declare that inflation was the farmers' greatest enemy.  In one fell swoop this Finance Bill has added 5 per cent to inflation, raising it to the impossible level of 22 per cent, and it is still rising.  Developing farmers cannot now meet their borrowing repayments because of this drastic increase and confidence has hit rock bottom.  All farmers, large and small, are now crying out for aid, a call falling on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>I should like now to quote from Farm-scene in <i>The Irish Press</i> of November 3 1981, the caption of which reads: &ldquo;Why Wexford is leading the fight&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These Wexford men cannot be taken lightly.  According to the official ACOT figures, the county now produces an impressive 10 per cent of total national agricultural output; between 1974 and 1980 in Wexford cow numbers went up 60 per cent and milk output doubled to 40 million gallons, cattle production went up 10 per cent, cereals up 11 per cent, beet up 50 per cent and sheep numbers held steady while they fell almost everywhere else...</P>
    <P>Wexford farmers borrowed heavily to invest in their land and to modernise their production and increase output. They achieved their objective, as the figures show.</P>
    <P>But they are now caught in the crippling squeeze between high interest rates and costs and low produce prices. Many of them simply cannot meet their repayments and feed their families as well.</P>
    <P>While we do not condone the actions of <Col N="1243" /> the protesters at present it is easy to understand why they are on the streets. My heart goes out to the farmers of Ireland.  Farmers will remain on the streets and they are being supported by members of the Government who fed agriculture's greatest enemy, inflation.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the nation's primary industry.  This budget suggests to me that the present Government have no intention of recognising that fact.  That was made clear by Deputy Sherlock here this morning and by some other viewpoints expressed, including those of Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Because it is our basic industry it is essential to develop its potential to the maximum.</P>
    <P>Tremendous development has taken place under the farm modernisation scheme, a scheme introduced following our entry into the EEC.  The farm modernisation scheme encourages farmers to adopt and follow through a plan to develop their particular farm in order that it may reach its full potential.  Many farmers have taken advantage of the incentives afforded under that scheme. Since July this year the numbers availing of the scheme dropped suddenly, in some instances down to 50 per cent, solely because of the lessening of grants.  Farm building grants, drainage and reclamation grants have fallen by 5 per cent and incentives for the purchase of mobile equipment, such as tractors, machinery and so on have been abolished altogether. Grants for agricultural development form but a small part of the expenditure on any given project, sometimes as low as 10 per cent, leaving the rest to be funded by the farmer himself.  The incentives under the farm modernisation scheme were sufficient to encourage farmers to embark on a development programme which in the short and long term would be of tremendous benefit to our economy.  However the lessening of grants has now upset that balance.  Farmers are now discouraged from availing of grants at their present level.  It must be remembered also that when a project today is being assessed for grant aid an out-of-date yardstick is applied, to add to the discouragement already obtaining. <Col N="1244" /> The lowering and indeed complete removal of grants mean that we shall fail to attract farmers to this scheme.  To date farmers who have been in close contact with their advisers are already taking part in the scheme.  Henceforth we shall have to concentrate on the people who have had little or no contact with ACOT and the advisory services in order to encourage them to avail of the benefits of the scheme.  County committees of agriculture had made great strides in attracting those farmers who had been slow to join. Barriers were being broken down and such farmers were contemplating entering, a desirable step in the interests of our economy overall.  This dreadful change of tactics by this penny wise, pound foolish, anti-farmer Government is now causing such farmers to have a re-think.  There is a growing lack of confidence in this Government daily becoming more evident.  Farming is taking a backward step.  It must be remembered that agricultural development to date has been considerable, the fruits of which will be seen to great advantage from now on. But this sudden falling off of farmers from the farm modernisation scheme will stunt the growth of our greatest industry. Agriculture still constitutes our basic industry and if it is not doing well the nation suffers.  It is an indictment of the Coalition Government that they willingly and knowingly contribute to a deterioration in our basic industry.</P>
    <P>The most serious burden on any economy is that of rising unemployment. The budget proposals, without the shadow of a doubt, have contributed enormously to rising unemployment. Unemployment was at an unacceptable level but this Bill has escalated it beyond imagination.  The instructions to every Department to stop spending will cost the nation dearly.  Raising the school entry age will cost 500 jobs.  The building trade which has always been a great employer has now hit hard times.  Cuts in public expenditure, housing, farming, school building, etc., will increase the numbers unemployed enormously.  The car industry, because of the adverse charges in the budget, for the most part has gone on a three day week and workers, <Col N="1245" /> salesmen, transporters, suffer.  This industry is a big one and the present setback hit hard and suddenly.</P>
    <P>Young couples who had the good fortune to be allocated local authority houses and who are in the process of buying them out, or young couples who are building their own houses, if they become unemployed will find it impossible to meet their repayments.  Those in local authority houses will have to go back to paying rent and those building their own houses may suffer the iniquity of losing their homes and find themselves on the local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>The policy of Fianna Fáil has always been to encourage people to own their own houses, a good policy because when a person owns his house much more will be thought about it and it will be looked after better.  The unemployment that this budget has caused and will cause is a thumbs down for that policy.</P>
    <P>The budget proposes that the combined total of income from the young couple be taken into account when they are being assessed for eligibility for loans. If the combined income is over £7,000 we most likely will find that because those people are so well off they will have to ask the local authority to build houses for them.  This short-sighted attitude is nothing short of stupidity.  The Coalition are not interested in giving loans for house building.  It is unjust to assess the combination of a couple's income as if the two partners would always be income earners, whereas in 90 per cent of cases the wife will work for no longer than two years and the husband is again the sole breadwinner and his income only will have to pay the repayments.  Why assess the combination of the two?</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would ask the House to reject this Bill because of its complete disregard for our economy and the Irish people.  A budget should be designed to help our economy to grow and to ensure that all sections of our community are being fairly treated.  The Finance Bill now under discussion has all the hallmarks of being hastily put together with one aim in mind, that is, to pay off election promises. From the child at national school <Col N="1246" /> down to the old age pensioner this budget is a disaster.</P>

      <P>It is with a degree of trepidation that I address this House for the first time.  I do so mindful of my responsibility to represent the aspirations and the needs of the people who have sent me here.  Having listened to a good lot of the debate I must confess that I am amazed at the gall of some of the speakers on the other side in their efforts to wash their hands of what can only be regarded as the irresponsibility of a Government that brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy.  Their live-now, pay-later policy has put in jeopardy the future of the finest generation of young people that Ireland has ever had the good fortune to have.</P>
      <P>The extent and size of our current deficit has resulted not only in corrective measures in the present restrictive Finance Bill, but it is also a statement of the inability of successive Governments to understand that the efficient use of money is our second greatest resource and that it determines how we, as a nation, treat and use our greatest resource, our people.  We have unthinkingly squandered both these resources through maladministration, incompetence and through a narrow, selfish pursuit of votes.  Successive Governments have failed, in most areas, to engage in comprehensive national planning so that an effective and efficient service infrastructure would be harnessed to the productive sector to create a sound and competitive economy which could absorb the energy and talent of a growing young population, which could provide them with housing at a mortgage level which would not enslave them for life, and so that we could develop a society which would be economically capable of being just and compassionate to its underprivileged and weaker groups such as the poor, the elderly, the handicapped and the mentally ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not learned, and the message of this Finance Bill is that we have no alternative but to learn, that we can no longer afford to spend and waste vast sums of money running incompetent, <Col N="1247" /> outdated and inefficient services when it would cost far less money to run modern and more efficient services.  This is why, in a debate on a Finance Bill, it is quite relevant to examine the way in which we have wasted our resources in the area of housing, social welfare and health.  If we are to stop wasting limited resources the message clearly is that we must be prepared to make the necessary capital investment which will enable us to obtain these modern, efficient and more economical services.  The lesson is, as the Taoiseach said recently in Trinity College in a debate on the economy, &ldquo;We must be prepared to spend money in order to save and make money.&rdquo;  Let me now illustrate this misuse of our resources and the alternative pathway towards a more effective utilisation of our resources in certain areas of the health budget, particularly the psychiatric service.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Health do not have a coherent and publicly available national policy for the development of a balanced health service, and you wish to know what their policy for the health service is, you can find the answer in the pattern of financial expenditure over a period of time.  Indeed, irrespective of what policy is stated to be, policy is where the money is spent.</P>
    <P>Examination of this area underlines the truth of everything I have said about our impoverished approach to economic planning and social development.  The misuse of our resources in the health field is such that this year's allocation for health, £700 million, represents a figure equivalent to the total yield of taxes from the PAYE sector.  This means we are using our resources in the health field in a wasteful manner.  Nowhere is this better illustrated than in our attitude and approach to our psychiatric services.  The key to understanding current expenditure on the health service is to examine the way in which capital moneys are used in health, because this represents the planning for the future.  Over the past ten years there has been an enormous growth in expenditure on general hospitals each of which, on average, costs £25 million to build and as much again annually to pay <Col N="1248" /> for their running.  Last year the Department announced a plan to build and upgrade 20 such general hospitals throughout the country at an estimated cost of £400 million.  I do not for one moment criticise a plan to make adequate provision for general hospital services throughout the country.  It, and the employment it generates, is to be welcomed. But it is counter-productive and politically immoral to do it in isolation as general hospitals do not represent the entire health service.</P>
    <P>We can contrast this approach with the situation in psychiatry where, over the past ten years, the Department of Health have spent about £1 million each year patching up holes in roofs and damp walls in decrepit mental hospital institutions and also on TV programmes.  Sorting out this service is not providing better clothes for the cinderella of the health service.  It is more fundamental.  It is a question of whether we will develop a competent service and in so doing save taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>There are between 12,000 and 13,000 people in our mental hospitals.  This institutionally based service is one more legacy of the past which we have declined to face up to.  Most patients are there for life.  If we take a large mental hospital in Dublin with 900 beds, it costs over £10 million a year to run.  This works out at about £½ million per long stay patient over a lifetime of expenditure.  In this one Department there is need for an analysis of where taxpayers' money is being spent and I am trying to equate this with what is happening throughout the nation.  We should contrast that cost with the fact that the cost of keeping 100 long stay patients in adequate group homes, hostels and rehabilitation workshops in the community is only one-tenth of that figure.</P>
    <P>Every housewife is a Minister for Finance in her own right.  We all know that it is vital that we get value for every pound we spend.  The evidence of that is made public when department stores put up their sale signs.  Housewives queue up to get the best value they can.  There is waste of money in this Department.  As a result of bad administration young <Col N="1249" /> people are shackled with the taxes we have to raise to meet the expenditure of this maladministration.  I have touched on the money that could be saved if we were to treat long stay patients in a more humane way.  Alternative community service is therapeutically more efficient and more suited to the needs of modern society.  It costs less to run than the existing institutional service and is more economical. As it is capable of preventing people being institutionalised at a crippling human and economic cost and because it can rehabilitate people to a useful and economically productive life in the community, it is ultimately less of a burden on the taxpayer than the staggering £½ million per person per lifetime cost of institutionalisation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the time for this debate is running out and that my two colleagues are anxious to speak.  In fairness to them and to allow them to speak on this I will try to be concise.</P>

      <P>Over several years I have had an opportunity to observe the Department of Health and have been involved in everything relating to our health services.  If the prudence of most women could have been given an opportunity, we might not have been looking for such vast sums of money.  I heard the Minister being questioned about providing services.  The money is not simply there to do this.  Women have always spend the nation's money.  Men have always entrusted their earnings to women <Col N="1250" /> to administer the home and family and even long term to buy a house.  For that reason we have acquired an expertise. We know there is nothing wrong with having to borrow money if we spend it on something that is an asset, but very few women will borrow money to squander money.  I ask Deputies opposite, who must know better than anyone else what the true situation is in relation to our finances, to join their expertise with people on this side of the House.  I know there is party political banter but we are all here for the same thing &mdash; the common good of the people and particularly the good of the younger generation.</P>
      <P>Arthur Griffith, one of the founder members of our party, always maintained that economic independence was a prerequisite to national independence.  That has been brought home to us clearly.  We know we are almost totally owned by the international banks in Amsterdam and New York.  Our rights and independence have been too dearly bought to allow that to happen.  We cannot let it happen.  The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance had to take stern measures in the July budget. The consequences of not doing so would have been far greater on the people than any kind of hardship they would have to endure in the short term.  Most people realise that.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the courtesy he has afforded me and I am very pleased to have completed that first hurdle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I shall concentrate my remarks on the implications of the budget for the agricultural community.  Much has been made of the so-called concessions in the Finance Bill so far as the farmers are concerned.  These concessions are the VAT refund from 1 to 1½ per cent and the contractors VAT reduction.  Taking into account the implications of the other items in the budget, these two changes are of no value whatever.  There is no <Col N="1251" /> benefit to farmers in the VAT refund change because the VAT on most of their inputs has increased by 50 per cent and the inputs represent 60 per cent of the goods bought by the farmer.  Regarding the other item &mdash; the contractors VAT reduction &mdash; there will be little if any benefit to the farmers because of the increased costs that the agricultural contractors must bear.</P>
      <P>The Government failed to realise the situation regarding the farming community when they decided on such measures as the re-imposition of car tax and the increases in petrol and diesel prices as well as the increases in farm input prices. I doubt if there is anybody in the community who needs a car as much as it is needed by the farmer and by his wife. Consequently, the implications of the increased cost of motoring are enormous for them.</P>
      <P>Another item in the budget, though not necessarily in the Finance Bill, was the cutback in finances for ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  More than any other time in the history of the State this was the wrong time to curtail the activities of either of these very important bodies.</P>
      <P>The increase in sheep subsidies has been offset by the limits in the headage payments.  That is a dangerous precedent especially in the context of the very serious incomes situation of the farming community.  However, the most important aspect of the budget from the farming point of view has been the inflationary aspect of it.  It is admitted by the Government that the measures taken in July will add 5 per cent to the annual rate of inflation. We all know that for every 1 per cent increase in inflation there is a reduction of £15 million in farm incomes. Therefore, the measures that have been taken by the Government are taking £75 million from the overall farm incomes for this year.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Farmers Journal</i> of October 17 last, the prominent economist, Professor Sheehy had this to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improved productivity in the form either of more output from the same inputs or the same output with reduced <Col N="1252" /> inputs would help in the current crisis. There is little doubt that farmers have been robbed of such productivity by the weather over the past three years.</P>
    <P>Nobody mentioned the weather when I was responsible for agriculture.  Professor Sheehy continued:</P>
    <P>If weather had been normal this year, real incomes would be increasing instead of falling and some of the modest confidence in the industry in the spring would have persisted instead of the deep gloom which is prevalent.</P>
    <P>At least we can see from that that the action we took restored farming confidence and led to a situation in which there was a prospect of an increase in farm incomes, but since the change of Government all of that has been reversed and the confidence that was there in the spring has now turned into gloom.  What concerns the farming community more than anything else is not so much what the Government have done as what they intend doing in the January budget. According to themselves and to the economists the measures to be taken then will add another 4 to 5 per cent to the inflation rate.  In other words, we are talking in terms of an additional 10 per cent in the inflation rate as a result of both the July budget and the budget to be introduced in January.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that a 1 per cent increase in inflation leads to a drop of £15 million in farm income, the Government by their actions have taken £150 million from farmer's incomes.  This is from a Government who say that they recognise that inflation is a problem and accept that something must be done about it.  It galls me to find commentators praising the Government for their anti-inflation programme.  Where is there such a programme or what is it?  I fail to understand the Minister for Agriculture or the Government in their approach to the farming crisis now being experienced. During the election campaign Fine Gael replied to an IFA questionaire about national economic policy and farm incomes by saying that the party accept <Col N="1253" /> that the farming income gap must be closed and should be restored to not less than 1978 levels in real terms with the least possible delay.  However, after the election they had something else to say. At the agricultural show in Strokestown on September 4 the Minister for Agriculture said that, given the present situation in a section of the public finances, it was not open to the Government directly to compensate farmers for the drop in income that they had experienced in the past two-and-a-half years.  He said that the cost of direct compensation was greatly in excess of any new expenditure which the Government were likely to be able to undertake.</P>
    <P>After a meeting between the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach with representatives of the ICMSA, the IFA and Macra na Feirme it was stated in the communique issued that it was agreed that a serious decline in farm incomes had occurred in recent years and that farmers currently faced great difficulty in building up the volume of their production in the short-term. The statement went on to say that it was agreed also that attempts to solve the present difficulties would have to respect two priorities &mdash; the urgent need to reduce inflation and the maintenance of the principles of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Further, the statement said that the Government had already indicated their proposals for meeting current difficulties but would be open to consider any additional suggestions which the farming organisations wished to make, and the delegations were invited to make such submissions.  All that the Government have done, as far as anybody can see, since they took office, has been to bring about an increase in inflation although they recognised that they must reduce it. At the end of the communique they said that they had already indicated their proposals for meeting the current difficulties, but where or what are those proposals? All that their proposals have achieved has been to increase the costs for farmers and the increase in inflation has taken many £ millions out of farmers' incomes.  They have failed to grasp the <Col N="1254" /> very serious situation that exists in agriculture at present which was brought about by themselves and by their actions. The Minister for Agriculture was quoted in one of the papers on 23 October last as calling for a cold-blooded economic approach to the farm income problems. Obviously the Minister is oblivious to the ruin to which Government policies based on that approach are drawing farmers. The Government's inflationary policies have removed the income improvement this year which Fianna Fáil put within the grasp of farm families and no improvement or relief is in sight.  A Minister who calls for a cold-blooded economic approach at home will be in a very weak position when he goes to Brussels to fight the Irish farmers' case because if ever he had any cold-blooded economic approach at home he will find that in Brussels it is much colder and much more difficult.</P>
    <P>I could say much more in relation to the statements made by the Government and by the Minister.  I take exception to one of them in reference to ACOT, a farming body responsible for farm development, farm planning, advice and so on. The Minister had the audacity to attack the well-known and well-respected director of that organisation, Dr. Tom Walsh. It was a disgraceful attack.  The doctor in charge of ACOT was only doing his job but, unfortunately, this Government &mdash;who themselves failed to recognise the serious situation&mdash;are now just turning around and accusing anybody who points out the facts to them.  This is the position that faces us, and who has caused it?  We have the very serious development of the farming community withholding payments from the ACC.  While I do not condone that type of approach and neither would anyone on this side of the House, I can understand fully the frustration of the farming community at present, taking into account the various statements by the Government and the Minister that I have just referred to.  I say to the farming community that there must be other ways and to the Government that they must seek with the farming community to find the other ways to correct this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> Last week in a statement here the Minister, talking about various measures and the interest subsidy from Brussels, stated, as recorded in the Official Report of 28 October 1981, column 722, volume 330:</P>
    <P>It is not my contention&mdash;it would be idle to pretend otherwise&mdash;that these schemes will solve the credit problems being encountered by farmers.  That is certainly not the case.</P>
    <P>He goes on to talk about the substantial number of farmers who are in difficulty and says that he is working on a package of measures.  If he is, he should be working in consultation and co-operation with the farming community and let them know what he is doing and what he and the Government intend to do either at home or on their behalf in Brussels.  He must do this so that the farmers will not continue in the frustrated position they are in because of the very serious difficulties that arise at present within the agricultural community.  These difficulties were there this time last year and we as a Government and I as Minister for Agriculture had to face them.  We did face up to those difficulties and took measures to correct them and, as I said earlier, even independent economists were saying prior to the general election and the change of Government that we had halted the very serious decline in farm incomes, that we had restored confidence and for the first time in three years the farming community were facing the prospect of an increase in income rather than a decline.  I will not delay the House but I will state that from August 1980 up to June this year, when the change of Government took place, the various measures, six in all, at home and abroad taken by me as Minister for Agriculture and by the Fianna Fáil Government amounted to a total of £400 million. That is the kind of money that will be needed now by this Government, wherever they find it, at home or abroad, to ensure that farming confidence is restored.  There are many difficulties in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I have not much time left.  I will conclude by saying to the Minister and the <Col N="1256" /> Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, a farmer himself, that a cold-blooded economic situation cannot be imposed on the agricultural community at present.  He as Minister and the Government will have to face up to the situation which exists now.  They will have to meet the farmers and explain to them what they can and will do at home and abroad, and they must do it now, otherwise we are faced with a very serious situation in the farming community.  I hope that that will not be allowed to develop.</P>

      <P>I will be very happy to speak until 5.45 p.m. and in that time I will endeavour to cover a fair amount of the ground that has to be covered in relation to this Bill before the House which is the statutory implementation of the budget of 21 July.  The budget is a statement in a housekeeping sort of style by the Minister for Finance of the day where he comes in and sets out the housekeeping as he sees it basically, underwrites his economic strategy and indicates how he proposes to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the budget of 21 July 1981 it is only right and proper that we look at the background to that budget.  The Government came into power as the result of a general election and against that background we will ponder for a few moments on what gave rise to some of the items that appeared in the budget which are legislated for in this Bill here before us. We fought the general election as all other parties did.  We fought it on an investment programme designed to improve the quality of life in this country, to try to tackle the major problem areas in which we found ourselves.  We intended to look at those areas, realising the difficult economic circumstances in Ireland this year, and, indeed, in the western world as well.  Against that background we intended to produce what we <Col N="1257" /> felt was a genuine assessment of the situation and what could be done for this economy to steer it through the very difficult circumstances we were going through.  I have heard many comparisons made of the state of the economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> those of our EEC partners and other countries in the western world.  One cannot compare our economy in 1981 with that of any other western developed economy because there are major differing factors involved and like should be compared with like.</P>

      <P>Like with like means we are a young, nation with a developing economy.  Almost 50 per cent of our people are under 25 years of age.  There is a very high dependency rate when one considers the earning capacity which is involved and that people must produce the goods to sell abroad and keep our economy strong.  We cannot be compared with countries in western Europe which are highly developed and industrialised, have declining populations and nothing like the dependency rate which we have.</P>
      <P>We were faced with an oil crisis which occurred in late 1979 which produced a 160 per cent increase in oil prices and with a growing population&mdash;there have been arguments about jobs which were created from 1977 to 1981&mdash;but the real cause of the problem is that the Government did not take a census in their last term of office.  Economists and politicians may differ but the fact remains that there were 80,000 more people working when the figures came out in late 1979 than had been acknowledged.  I know what the state of the economy was in 1977 and the number of people who were looking for jobs which were impossible to get.  In that period a substantial number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We had to look at the requirements of the economy and the best way to steer it forward in the aftermath of the oil recession, which was the worst recession the western world had known since the Wall Street collapse of 1929.  We steered the economy through some very difficult times and we put an investment plan into action which we believed could create the necessary economic activity to sustain as many people as possible in jobs and to create more jobs for a young and growing population.  We went into the election openly and honestly and declared our policies to the electorate.  Compare that with what the Government did.  If I had the Fine Gael document here I could <Col N="1259" /> quote some very interesting points from it.  It said that the state of the Irish economy was not one in which you set out promises, that the politics of promises had hopefully disappeared from the Irish scene, would not reappear and that realism would be brought home to Irish politics. This was not an election to face with a litany of catch phrases.  When one reads through the document it is easy to see the catches which are there.  They were based on an economic strategy, an anti-inflation programme and on the greatest catch of all, the £9.60 for the stay at home wives. It is a long time since the £9.60 was advertised in the newspapers.  I cannot figure out, and neither can the wives, when if ever they are going to get it.</P>
      <P>Against the background of the catches which were put forward, the Taoiseach said this was a time for openness and honesty, for facing the problems that were there and that he would make no election promises to them which he could not fulfil.  He forgot his own words very quickly after he put the manifesto together.  The manifesto was professionally marketed at a very high cost.  On a few occasions during the election campaign I tried to get the real cost of the proposed programme.  Nobody was prepared to tell the truth.  A figure of £242 million was mentioned.  That figure was a joke.  We said so at the time and the reality will catch up with people in January 1982.  A figure of £350 million was mentioned since that and today a figure of £460 million is being talked about.  The figure is rising all the time and nobody is laughing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it all going to be paid for?  The present Taoiseach said that everything would have to be paid for.  He talked about a 3½ per cent once off on indirect taxation to pay for this package which he said would cost £242 million.  That figure is incorrect.  Mr. Brendan Halligan, whom the Taoiseach always agreed with, mentioned a figure of 8 per cent for indirect taxation and, in the worst admission I have ever heard from a politician, said the only regret he had was that when questioned on television he did not give the true cost, as he knew it to be, of 8 per <Col N="1260" /> cent on indirect taxation.  It is a terrible admission but it is the truth.  It throws light on the situation which exists today.</P>
    <P>That was the sort of election campaign which was run by Fine Gael and Labour. After the election we had two shows, one in the Gaiety Theatre and another in the Mansion House.  The Gaiety show cobbled together a sort of programme which they would accept and, finally, behind closed doors in Sandymount or Ballsbridge, long meetings took place, cosmetic changes were made to a programme of economic policy that we all know is the Fine Gael election policy, part of which was to be introduced in the budget of 21 July 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back to the major problems of the economy which this budget was to solve.  The major problems as set out in the Coalition documents and by every commentator, economic or otherwise, are inflation, unemployment, the balance of payments and the State finances.  Let us look first at inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we left office on June 30, inflation was on the way down, at around 17 per cent &mdash; 17.1 per cent to be exact &mdash; and going in the right direction.  Policies were introduced, subsidies introduced and let me come to the price increases which the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism said were deferred until <Col N="1265" /> after the budget.  I want to nail that lie here and now.  He spoke about the CIE fare increase being postponed until after the general election, which is a complete fabrication and misrepresentation of the situation.  Back in April, the Government took a decision to freeze CIE fare increases knowing full well that those charges would contribute to inflation. Furthermore, as a businessman with a commercial approach to this situation in Dublin city, I knew that was not the time to increase fares, with the bus fleet disintegrating on the Dublin streets and with the traffic chaos.  It would have been a bad marketing exercise to drive more people away from public transport by savage price increases at a time when a genuine service could not be offered. That was a conscious decision by my Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When there was an election looming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I advocated it at Cabinet level and my colleagues backed me on it.  The CIE Chairman and General Manager were informed by me that that was the situation and that CIE would be recouped, as they were recouped, for what they lost in the first six months by the introduction of a supplementary budget passed unanimously by this House.  It is disgraceful for any Minister, and it is equally disgraceful for people in CIE &mdash; I do not mind saying that today &mdash; to try to misrepresent the situation in relation to the fare increases.  I have given the facts and I deal in facts not in fairy tales, fiction or propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the massive ESB increase.  I was aware, as a member of the last Cabinet, that the ESB had applied for an increase of 12½ per cent earlier this year.  We looked at the situation in relation to the ESB, and their accounts, and considered what was likely to happen to oil prices in 1981.  We were satisfied that the ESB, because of the prevailing situation and because there was a distinct possibility that oil would reduce in price, should not be granted the increase.  However, the Government <Col N="1266" /> on taking office not alone granted that increase but they multiplied it by two to 25 per cent to make up for the first half of the year because they said Fianna Fáil had left them short.</P>
    <P>After a short time the ESB financial statement showed that they had made £6.6 million profit.  When one examines those accounts closely one can see that £28 million, approximately, is there for depreciation and that there is another little item called amortisation listed at £28 million also.  In effect that is £56 million into their cash flow.  I ask any person who wants to make an honest assessment if this was the year and the time in view of the financial situation of the ESB and the economic problems of the country to permit the ESB to put up their charges by 25 per cent.  Was it a sensible thing to do realising the impact on inflation because transport charges are a contributor to it?  Was it sensible realising the real problems it would create for industry and agriculture where electricity is used extensively?  Was it the time to do it?  I say it was not because the ESB were capable in this period of serious economic problems to carry that for one year.  It was the Government's duty to make them do that but they did not do so because they could blame Fianna Fáil, as they thought, for it and use it as another part of the economic hysteria or disarray they say they found when they took office.  The reality is there for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>Many people will experience a very cold winter because of those increases and before long the Government will need a second Minister for Poverty with a budget much in excess of £100,000 to look after the poor people who this winter will be faced with higher ESB charges, not to talk of the savage increases in the price of gas.  We must remember that electricity and gas are the only means of heat such people have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the anti-inflation programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Following those increases the budget was introduced and <Col N="1267" /> we were made aware of the supposed anti-inflation programme.  The savage increases were imposed and the Minister for Finance, and his cohorts, said we could expect 3 per cent increase in the CPI and that prices would only go up by 3 per cent.  We are all well aware that they have gone up by 5 per cent and not even Deputies on the Government side will dispute that.  That budget, combined with the budgets which were introduced weekly thereafter, whether they were for post office charges or for other areas, were brought in because the Government felt they had the country convinced that these were the other fellow's problems, that they should put in the boot and get as much as they could out of it.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with the employment situation later, something which has a bearing on the budget statement presented by the Minister for Finance in July.</P>

I do not think it is good enough for any Minister for Finance to come to the House with a small piece of paper with the nation's finances added up on it. A financial director in a small company would produce more information to the people involved in that company than the piece of paper concerned presents to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not too bad that we can agree on something.  The first item I want to deal with is the budget deficit of £946.6 million.  I do not know where that figure came from.  The Central Bank and many others do not know where it came from.  I hope the day will not pass without the Minister for Finance telling the House how that figure is made up.  When we left office the best information available to us was that it was almost £800 million and that is in line with the ESRI who spoke about £796 million or thereabouts. Nobody could add up £956 million. I have a sneaking suspicion &mdash; I am a bit naive in ways &mdash; when I look at £148 million taken off on the other side that added on to the figure of almost £800 million were probably demands that were in the Department or were coming in from various Department for semi-State bodies and others.  I have a sneaking suspicion about that and I hope I am wrong. I hope the Minister when he gets the opportunity will clarify this matter and get rid of my suspicion.  Where did he get the figure that nobody else knew about or could figure out?  He knows the figure the ESRI put on it pre-budget and post-budget. He knows that the figure was £787 million post-budget and £790 million pre-budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the demands that were there were added on to one side and taken off the other but I hope I am wrong.  I should now like to look at the tax revenue situation.  The tax revenue as projected in the revised estimate following the financial proposals of July 21 was £3,210 million.  That is an interesting figure when one looks at it.  The figures do not add up at all.  The non-tax revenue was £655 million making a total of £3,865 million. The net tax increases were put down as £66.3 million and the projected current budget deficit was £787.2 million making a total of £4,718.5 million.  I looked at those figures and waited patiently until the Exchequer returns came out for the first quarter of the Government's term of office.  I found that the tax revenue to 30 September 1981 was £2,777 million which <Col N="1269" /> is the equivalent of 86 per cent of the tax revenue target of £3,210 million for the year as a whole.  The tax collected to the end of September as a proportion of the year as a whole in 1980 was 71.6 per cent, in 1979 it was 68.75 per cent and in 1978 it was 72.9 per cent.  Even assuming that the tax collected in 1981 to the end of September is 75 per cent of revenue for will be collected, the total revenue for 1981 would then be £3,470.25 million.</P>
    <P>Let somebody try to answer that. When we left office the tax revenue was there for everybody to see.  We know the tax buoyancy there was in that quarter. From past experience, and taking all other relevant factors into consideration, the Government should be able to make a better estimate than the estimate they made of £3,210 million.  We are giving them the benefit of the doubt and only taking into account 75 per cent tax revenue in the first three quarters although we know that, on the figure that is actually in it is 86.2 per cent.  Having given the Government the benefit of the doubt, we see what the real tax revenue would be.  I do not believe the real tax revenue was produced in the figures on 21 July 1980.  It is quite clear from past experience what the estimates should be. That is surely something that the Minister for Finance should answer in this House this evening before he leaves.  The sources for those figures are the Exchequer reports of 1979, 1980 and 1981 and the Department of Finance budget statement explanatory table.  I would like to hear a decent explanation for those figures but I do not expect it will be forthcoming. Why was there such a gap left in the presentation of these figures.</P>
    <P>Let me put it to the Minister that the tax revenue for the year was £3,470 million, giving him the benefit of the doubt and only taking into consideration 75 per cent in September and also bearing in mind that some of those increases put on in the budget, tax and VAT increases of 5 per cent, come into operation on 1 September 1981.  I know from experience, and the Minister will agree, that none of the VAT reaches the Exchequer until two or three weeks later because the returns are not made until <Col N="1270" /> the end of the month, and I am sure the Minister would not deny that.  We also know that other increases such as car taxation came in on 1 September and we are given the full benefit of the projected figures the Minister has there.  We are not taking off anything in our calculations and there are things which could validly have been taken off.  I am giving the Minister the full benefit of everything that is there and here is the picture that emerges at the end of the day.  The tax revenue at the end of the year is £3,470.25 million, minus the July budget tax increases of £66.3 million, minus the net expenditure reductions of £113.1 million, giving a total revenue of £3,290.65 million. That leaves £80.85 million in the kitty at the most conservative estimation that anyone could give on the figures.  Let the Minister come clean with this House and with the people of this country.  Let him eat his own words when he said that the cupboards were left bare and that there would be no money in the kitty to pay his nurses and gardaí and everybody throughout the country.  When the tax revenue was buoyant the money was there.  The Minister may get his figures right at the end of the year but they will be right for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the other aspect of this budget that we talked about, the figure of £148.5 million.  I ask the Minister to try to explain it to me because some people might say that I have a little naive mind.  But this Government have sat down at the back-breaking meetings in Merrion Street.  They have told everybody that public expenditure is being cut, that the Government are going to give the economic management that the country badly needs and will look at the results of the first quarter in relation to expenditure.  During the first six months of this year when we were in office expenditure was running at 25 per cent over the 1980 levels and, bearing in mind the inflation rate, that was not very excessive. Yet in the aftermath of our going out of office I heard Minister John Kelly shouting aloud from the heights that Fianna Fáil spent money like drunken sailors.  After all we were told about expenditure, we look at the result on 30 <Col N="1271" /> September 1981 to find that the figure we were running at, 25 per cent over 1980 figures, had not decreased, had not stabilised but had gone up to slightly over 30 per cent.  The expenditure figures are there.  I am sure the Minister will not deny them.  Perhaps he could explain this. I charge this Government with spending the money like drunken sailors and spending far too much and trying to convince the public that the situation is different from what it really is.  If they spent less money on all the various public relations exercises and told the people the true facts then we would all be better off; politics would be better and democracy would be better.  We all know that if this nonsense is continued people will not know whom to believe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have to spend it.  I did not have a public relations agent or even an information officer in the Department of Transport when I was there.  I would not like to compare that with the present situation, nor would I like to compare those days with what is going on at present and the acts of piracy that go on from time to time through the PR machine.  One example is the announcement of a rail coach building industry for Inchicore costing £34 million, providing 180 jobs and 127 new carriages.  I would just invite the Minister to have a look at the papers on 25 and 26 April and 11 and 12 April.  He will see the same story printed, when I announced a Government decision taken in the earlier part of this year.  But the PR fellows engaged in a little act of piracy. The also engaged in another act of piracy in relation to the express post and facsimile post to be introduced.  I would invite the Minister and his cohorts to look at the Easter Monday papers where I announced the setting up of this and put the early arrangements into practice at the sub-post master's conference in Blarney.  I am sure the Minister was watching television the other night when the television crew accompanied the <Col N="1272" /> present Minister around the Maynooth suburban line.  I presume that when the first inaugural trip takes place in three week's time the credit for this will also be claimed by the PR agency.  However, I did not introduce the subject, the Minister did.</P>
      <P>That is the situation in relation to those figures as presented in that budget statement by the Minister for Finance.  If he wants to deny those figures he is welcome to do it.  But it is time to come clean and put the record straight.  He should not put democracy in danger by giving out stories that are not true about the state of this country.  The situation is as I have said.  The Minister should have plenty of money for his gardaí and plenty of money for his teachers.  It rolled into him in the first quarter and nothing he did in the July budget helped him along the way except for a paltry few million pounds. Yet the Minister got in £970 million in that quarter and said that the country was broke weeks earlier when he was abroad. Others, like the Minister, said so too. They should be ashamed of themselves. If a man working for me in a much smaller financial institution produced that sort of estimate, forecast or target to me I would give him 24 hours to get out of the place because I would not be in business the following month if I accepted figures such as have been presented to this House.  I would tell him to find himself another job.  If the Minister cannot prove me wrong, I say to him also that he should find himself another job, because we need a better financial director in this country than we have got at this moment. The people are beginning to see through it and they will see through it more as time goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I now come to what the budget has done in relation to the problems of our economy.  The major problems facing the economy when the budget was introduced were inflation, unemployment and the State finances.  We know what effect the budget will have on the State finances for this year.  We also <Col N="1273" /> know that the Government took the opportunity to introduce the savage budget in July to get in revenue for their programme for next year because they are afraid they might not be around to bring in a third budget and might have to face the electorate next year.  The savage budget of last July was brought in for that reason alone because if the Government waited until October they could not have justified their July budget because the Exchequer returns would have been there to prove otherwise.  The Government took the opportunity of bringing in that budget when they thought they could blame somebody else.  They know their action in the budget will bring in approximately £218 million which will give them some help towards the implementation of their taxation package.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government will have second thoughts about their taxation package. I hope they will put the interests of the country first and will not foist on the community a taxation package which brings down income tax from 35 per cent to 25 per cent, that will transfer £460 million in indirect taxation, or which will be split between cutbacks in public expenditure when the end result of the exercise will be to produce a taxation package which will destroy our economy as far as inflation is concerned.  At the end of the day the household budget will not be better off in most cases and in many cases will be a lot worse off.</P>
      <P>This does not take into account the £9.60 per week for the wife who stays at home.  The taxation package is a con job on the taxpayers and the wage earners. I called it that during the election compaign and I am glad that four months later I am proved right.  We have often heard the story of robbing Peter to pay Paul but this is a question of robbing Peter to pay Peter.  The Government are taking a lot of the money in advance.  It will be a twice off payment as far as the people are concerned.  It is a twice off payment as far as the wife is concerned. It is the same as far as the taxpayer is concerned.  The Minister knows the score as well as I do.  If he wants to be honest about it he will come out and say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to refer the Minister back <Col N="1274" /> to what his views were on agriculture or what he said inflation was doing to agriculture. He is now presiding over an economic policy that has already put 5 per cent more on to inflation and will add 8 per cent more in January.  What will that do to agriculture?  He knows it will wreck it at a time when it needs all the help it can get.  Agriculture is getting very little from the Government to help it.  Farmers are being told to tighten their belts the same as everybody else.  That is the sort of attitude the Government are adopting in relation to our major industry.  The Minister knows what will happen to the business and manufacturing sectors as a result of the inflation rate.  He should get back from the precipice.  He has an albatross around his neck.  He should not introduce this taxation policy; he should put the country first.  The Fine Gael slogan was: &ldquo;Let the country win&rdquo;.  The Government should let the country win, be credible and bury their taxation package. If they have to face the electorate in the period in which they did not introduce it let them tell the truth to the people and the people will believe them.  The people have been finding out a lot about the Government during the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>I know what economists said three months ago and what they are saying today.  The Minister knows as well as I know how their figures have changed. The people cannot be conned any longer. The Government should forget about their taxation package before they do any more damage to the economy.  We have not yet been told what women will get the £9.60 per week.  Will the wife of the small farmer who is not paying tax get the £9.60 per week?  Will the wife of the unemployed man get it?  Will people have to pay taxation to get it?  This is another robbing Peter to pay Peter situation. The Government are taking the money from the husband and giving it to the wife.  They will cause problems in every household where the finances of the household are organised.  It is an invasion of the privacy of the home, as Deputy Richie Ryan said.  The Government will cause more problems and will probably be instrumental in causing more divorces if they continue with their daft <Col N="1275" /> policy.  The people were led to believe by the canvassers at the door before the election that they would receive the money in the post the following week. The postal service did not deteriorate that much.  No cheques have turned up, The Minister only got a woman for himself recently.  He should not deceive her because I can tell him if he brings the wrath of a woman on top of him he will really get it.  The greatest political sin politicians can commit in relation to the electorate is to con them with deceit.  The Government have conned the people with a programme that is deceitful in every way.</P>
    <P>The Government have a great array of economists.  If they are the people who operate the true signs of economics, who look at the problem and assess it they also assess the repercussions of the decisions the Government take.  Has any assessment been made of the repercussions of the Government's reductions in taxation policy?  Has a look been taken at the damage this £9.60 per week will do?  Has a look been taken at the damage that will be done by the Government's so-called anti-inflation policy which this year alone will produce an inflation rate of 22 per cent?</P>
    <P>I heard the Fine Gael policy enunciated all through the election campaign in relation to what they will do for jobs and for unemployment.  A lot was said about the reduction in the oil tax to the manufacturing companies, which I understand will not be introduced on 1 December.  I do not know what the administrative problems are but that was supposed to produce a great number of jobs.  That was deceiving the electorate.  The Minister knows as well as I do that when you are in an economic situation such as we are in and when you look at our biggest customer across the Irish Sea it does not matter if you put 100,000 people to work tomorrow morning producing goods if you have not somebody to sell them to. If the market on which we depend for 44 per cent of our exports is depressed nobody should try to tell the people that unemployment can be solved by a wave of the hand and a reduction in the taxation <Col N="1276" /> on oil and by all the other things the Government said they would do to make our industry competitive.  One of the major areas for making industry competitive is the inflation rate.  The Government will bring it to 22 per cent and it is even likely to be 24 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows what the tax package will be.  The principle involved in attacking the competitiveness of Irish industry which the Government are relying on to produce jobs, will not actually do this.  We are told that the employment agency is the answer to all our ills.  What is this and what will it do? I know the Government have in their minds the 1 per cent employment levy but I do not know how it will work.  It is not taking in the ability of anybody to pay.  Will the money be taken from the low paid worker who is finding it hard to make ends meet?  Is this another Exchequer revenue the Government will collect? Where will the Government put the people to work?  Is it an expansion of the work experience programme, the environmental programme and the youth employment schemes which are all there and were operated by Fianna Fáil?  Is this another bureaucratic institution to oversee the operations of the various schemes and bring them together?  It looks to me as if that is what this new thing is. Youngsters will have to wait for work longer than the Government are prepared to tell them.  Perhaps they will tell them the truth even at this late stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the collapse of the national understanding.  We have had national understandings of one kind or another for ten years.  In general terms it is fair to say they served this country well. Lower paid workers were lifted up by the boot straps, as one trade unionist might say.  In a free for all situation, the strongest do best and the weakest get least.  We are looking for equality in this society. The Government were very irresponsible in the way they handled our economic affairs.  Have they been taking decisions from day to day and from week to week <Col N="1277" /> to ensure their survival?  One begins to think they have.  When one looks at the operations of the various Ministers, and hears the criticisms which emanate from back benchers who have to face the heat in their own constituencies, one has to ask the question: are things going well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were serious about a national wage agreement and if they were serious about a moderate wage agreement, they would not have taken the decisions they took on July 21.  At that time it was plain to be seen that the necessary revenue was coming in at the end of the quarter.  They refused to accept that and tried to hang us with it, but they will hang themselves.  They were irresponsible in their approach to wage bargaining.</P>
      <P>They pushed up the inflation rate to such a degree that they knew full well there was no possibility of getting a national wage agreement and little possibility of getting a moderate wage agreement. I subscribe to the view that we need a moderate wage agreement.  The Government were totally irresponsible in their actions in July when they removed the subsidy on mortgage rates and pushed up the cost of living in other areas.  They then expected people to accept a very small national wage agreement, suggested by the three wise men as 6.5 per cent.  The report does not mention 6.5 per cent but something like 9.5 per cent. Nobody can find where the 6.5 per cent comes from.</P>

      <P>Having made Fianna Fáil the first scapegoat in their propaganda, and having failed to get any deal with their social partners on a moderate <Col N="1278" /> wage agreement, I would not like them to try to make the public sector the scapegoat for their irresponsibility in the handling of our economic affairs.  I should like to quote one statistic from the report of the three wise men, which is that for the ten years from 1970 to 1980 the real income increase in the public service was 20 per cent, compared with 30 per cent in the service industry, and 40 per cent in the manufacturing industry.  That is the reality.  If those figures are wrong, the three wise man are wrong.  I mention that figure for people to contradict it if they want to do so.  The Government should not try to make the public sector the scapegoat for the scenario they have enacted since last July.</P>
      <P>When I read the Minister's budget speech of July 21 I thought I saw a hint that the embargo would not extend to the productive sector of the public service. Unfortunately the reality is different.  It is extending into that area.  In the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the people who are spending money on the development programme will be left without jointing staff.  That means all the other investment will be wasted.  That is irresponsible economic management, and they know it as well as I do.</P>
      <P>We do not share the feelings of gloom and doom of the people on those benches with all the economic advice they get from economists.  In my view economists have one role in life and the Government and politicians of the day have a different role in life.  We must make our judgements in the best interests of society and in the best interests of our nation.  I do not share the pre-supposition that oil prices will continue to increase.  I look at the country and say we will do the job that has to be done.  We will build up our infrastructure, which is deficient in many respects.  This has an impact on the competitiveness of Irish industry.  We will borrow the money to do those jobs and offer no apology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will phase out the current deficit over a period, remembering that current deficits are about people.  As I said elsewhere if you provide the buildings and equipment and you have not got the people, you are failing in economic management. In our party we have optimism <Col N="1279" /> and confidence.  We represent the confidence of the Irish people.  Every day members of the Government speak on the radio or abroad they are trying to kill the confidence of the Irish people and reduce the people to gloom and doom. As happened on the three previous occasions when they were in office, when the right time comes, and sooner rather than later, the people will return to the party who will give them back their confidence and will help to build up this nation for all the people.  We will provide the equality and the justice needed in our society and, at the end of the day, we will not try to find scapegoats as they did for their totally irresponsible economic decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's aim in this Finance Bill, in the budget and in our general handling of the economic situation is to establish a base for progress in the direction of more jobs for the very large numbers of young people we have in our community, and in the direction of improvements in our social services particularly for the elderly members of our community.  These aims can be met now and in the future only if the revenue coming in is available for those purposes and is not being absorbed by servicing debts incurred in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present an undue share of our revenue is being absorbed in servicing our debts.  In 1980 interest payments on foreign debts amounted to £164 million. This year the figure will reach £250 million. That is dead money going out of the country to foreign bankers.  On present trends, in 1982 interest charges will reach a level of £500 million which we will have to hand over to foreign banks because we lived beyond our means in the past. When we combine interest payments with principal we find that the total cost in 1982 of servicing our foreign debt will reach the astronomical figure of £850 million. This is enough to finance the entire health services for a year, and yet we cannot use it for that purpose, or to improve the health services.  As a result of the financial irresponsibility of previous Governments this money is tied up <Col N="1280" /> to repay interest and principal on foreign debts.</P>
    <P>Nearly two-thirds of the State's revenue from income tax&mdash;and this is worth thinking about; it is our major source of revenue as a community&mdash;will have to be used next year to service foreign debt. That leaves one-third only to pay the Garda and to improve our social services, because two-thirds have been spoken for by foreign banks.  Previous Governments decided to borrow that money rather than face the difficult choices involved in governing.</P>
    <P>To govern is to choose.  Unfortunately the previous Government chose to avoid the choice by borrowing.  We are now faced with a choice.  The borrowing has to stop.  It is essential that we should have sound public finance and that we should not borrow huge sums of money to finance day to day expenses.  We need the money and we need the freedom which not having to hand over this money to foreign bankers will give us to invest in job creation and improve social services. If we allow debts to pile up, future Governments will not have the ability to maintain our social services or to give tax concessions and to develop the infrastructure of our economy because the money will be spoken for.  It will have to go abroad to foreign banks.  That is the choice we are facing as a community.</P>
    <P>When I speak of the future I am speaking of a future in which this money which we are earmarking for foreign debt will be badly needed for other purposes.  I refer here to the report published by the NESC, and which I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald has read, where a comparison is made between the situation in Ireland and in other EEC countries.  Since we entered the EEC, Irish living standards have declined <i>vis-á-vis</i> those in Germany; in other words, living standards in Germany have increased at a faster rate.  This is despite the fact that we expected to catch up with their living standards, the whole purpose of our entering the Community. However, the report further shows that our economy has to grow much faster in the next ten years than the German economy simply to maintain the present level of comparison between the <Col N="1281" /> two countries.  What is the reason for that?  It is simply that we have more young people than they have.  We will have more and more people demanding their share of our income while they will have fewer people demanding their share of the German income.  We will have to grow extremely fast as an economy, not to improve our living standards but merely to stand still.  Instead of trying, as a responsible generation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of trying as a responsible generation to set aside money for the future for this enormous challenge so that it will be there in five or ten years to meet the challenge of providing jobs for the young people, we are spending twice as much now.  We are piling up debts that those young people will have to repay.  Because of our irresponsibility they will have to repay our debts.  Those of us who survive the next ten years will not be able to do what we could have done if the present generation of Irish Governments had behaved as responsibly as they should have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental problem we face can be traced to the response by the previous Government to the Iranian oil crisis which led to a general increase in oil prices throughout the developed world. That meant that the western European countries&mdash;all of them importers of oil except Britain&mdash;were worse off because more of the money that would have been available for internal consumption had to be used to pay for oil.  Instead of trying to adjust to the fact that we were poorer because of the oil crisis, unlike practically every other European country which tried to retrench we went on as though nothing had happened.  We ignored the Iranian oil crisis and its consequences for our economy.  We ignored the fact that this had made us worse off and we went on spending as though we were as well off as we had been before the crisis.  The then Government realised this was the case because that was the significance of the broadcast by the former Taoiseach in January 1980.  When he came to office in <Col N="1282" /> December 1979, obviously he was told of the situation and, as a responsible politician, he decided to do something about it.  He went on television to prepare the people for the difficult readjustments that were necessary.  I remember seeing him on television and my thought was that he made a great speech, that he was saying the right things and what had long needed to be said.  He told the people the facts in plain language, but in the February budget he funked.  Having built up the expectation that he would take action, he did nothing.  I do not know if his nerve failed him &mdash; the Deputy opposite has a much better clue to that &mdash; but no action was taken.  The result of lack of action in 1980 has meant that we are facing enormous problems today.  Our entire problems can be traced to the period at the beginning of 1980.  If action had been taken then we would not have our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>As a community we must invest if we are to grow.  Let us reflect on what investment means.  There is much conversation about this among economists but investment can be reduced to a relatively simple proposition.  Investment means setting aside some of one's income today, not using it for one's enjoyment, and putting it aside to buy something that will yield a much greater income in the future. Yet in the past three years we have been doing precisely the opposite.  We have been engaged in what economists call disinvestment.  Far from setting aside some of today's income to produce something productive in the future we have been spending more than today's income. We have been setting aside for the future not an income but a debt to be repaid &mdash; the precise opposite of investment.</P>
    <P>The key purpose of the policy of this Government is to get us back on the path of true investment so that from a position of financial strength and of balancing our budget we will be able to set aside some money out of today's income to provide jobs for the enormous number of young people who will be looking for jobs and incomes in ten or 20 years' time.  I can understand the pressures under which the previous Government were operating and perhaps I can understand why they <Col N="1283" /> did not make the choice they should have made in 1980.  In my view, we would be betraying the young people who will be looking for jobs in ten or 20 years' time if we did not face up to the problem.  We have not dodged the issue.  We have faced it squarely in the budget.</P>
    <P>I know that details of the budget and this Finance Bill are open to criticism and I will be happy to listen to such criticism during the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not propose to go into much detail today on the individual parts of the package.  It was generally accepted it was the right course for our society to adopt. As a Government we believe, as I am sure the Opposition believe, in equity and fairness in politics.  Equity and fairness in politics arise not just between groups in society at a particular time but between one generation and the next.  I believe the present generation of Irish adults will be neither fair nor equitable to the next generation if they continue on the present policy of spending more than they are earning and piling up debts which those young people will have to repay.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about jobs, a concern which is very appropriate, but I am afraid I draw different conclusions than those drawn by Fianna Fáil speakers. Their conception of jobs seems to be a job for a month or a year, whereas the conception of most young people looking for jobs is a job for a lifetime.  We as a society are jeopardising our ability to provide them with lifetime jobs if we spend money now that will have to be repaid in the form of debts in the future. It is all right to give them jobs for a year but if you pile up debts to such an extent that in two years' time you no longer have the money to stay in that job and it collapses, you are not doing anyone a favour.  It is our conviction that if we want to provide lifetime jobs for young people we must return to a policy of financial responsibility in the management of our nation's affairs.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the report of the committee on costs and competitiveness. I found one sentence in that <Col N="1284" /> document particularly heartening.  It was speaking about the acceptance in 1982 of a moderate norm for increases in incomes and wages.  It said that if acceptance of this norm was followed by the establishment of procedures whereby cost increases in future years were also kept in line with those in competing countries &mdash; and that is what this Government are trying to achieve &mdash; then the prospects for a gradual resumption of sustained growth in the Irish economy could be much brighter than most current opinions suggest.  Those economists told us that, if we are prepared to be responsible now in what we pay ourselves, they would disagree by implication with their colleagues and would say that the prospects for our economy are far brighter than many others would suggest.  That is a challenge to our society to which we have a duty to respond.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that the Government have formulated their approach to the question of incomes in our society and in particular to the problem of achieving moderate agreements in regard to income levels in the years ahead.  We are in favour of centrally negotiated agreements in regard to wages because of the manifest stability they give to all those who are making investment decisions. Investment is a broadly defined thing which affects not just manufacturers but our entire society.  For that reason we have invited Professor Basil Chubb to discuss the possibility of achieving such an agreement in present circumstances. In issuing this invitation we have clearly indicated the serious constraints under which he and we as a Government must operate because the money is not there to pay substantial increases by the Government. We must remember the maxim-that one man's pay increase can be another man's job.  An excessive pay increase for one man may, by absorbing resources that would otherwise be available, deprive another man or woman of his or her job.  It is that contention that must be understood by everyone who is approaching the present negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could not be right because he was missing from the House for almost 25 per cent of Deputy Reynolds' speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what he said when I was here.  There has been some criticism, <Col N="1288" /> not on the other side of the House but elsewhere, of the general proposition of the Government to reduce the burden of income taxation with a view to providing a greater incentive to work.  We stated before the election that the money for this scheme would not come out of thin air but would be provided by means of increases in indirect taxes.  In other words, people would pay more in the shops but they would have more money in their pay packets.  We did not say that this proposal would invent money; we said the programme would be fully paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be some criticism of the idea that there is at present any need to relieve the burden of income tax and it is suggested that perhaps we should not continue with this programme.  The report of the committee on costs and competitiveness shows that over the years the gap between the amount paid by the employers and the take-home pay of the employee has widened.  In 1975 take-home pay amounted to 82 per cent of total labour costs but in 1981 this percentage has fallen to about 71 per cent. More than 11 per cent of take-home pay has been taken from the worker between 1975 and 1980.  It is with a view to giving him back at least some of that money that the Government proceeded with what is undoubtedly an expensive and extensive reform of our income tax system.  This scheme must be paid for by other means. We recognise that as long as the share of the pay packet taken from the worker by the State gets larger and the amount retained by the worker gets smaller there will be pressure for increases in wages because the worker will seek to maintain his real income and compensate for what is taken from him by demanding an overall increase in his gross wages.  Our present income tax code has this built-in pressure towards inflation.  Furthermore, the more the State takes out of the take-home pay of any worker the greater is the discentive to be a worker and the greater the incentive to stay at home.  We are undertaking this major reform in order to introduce a structural change in our income tax code which will act against <Col N="1289" /> inflation and provide a greater incentive to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to follow that line of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be the intention of Deputy Fitzgerald to be disorderly but the Chair must remind him that he is being so and ask him to desist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has also been reference to increases in indirect taxes and I would be entirely wrong if I were not to admit that the increases introduced in the budget were substantial and in many cases imposed serious difficulties on people.  Those in my own constituency who travel distances to work have been concerned about the increase in the price of petrol but I think they accept that these measures are necessary to put our finances right.  I know it is customary for Ministers for Finance to make excuses by referring to the past but I do not wish to make excuses of this sort or to pretend that the increases were not substantial or to minimise them.  That would not be realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to our system of excise duties, it is important to recognise that the taxes on petrol, drink and tobacco are set in fixed money terms and that in a period of rising prices the real value would decline if successive budgets did not increase excise duties.  In fact, increases in indirect taxes implemented in recent years have not been a major contributory factor to the general rate of inflation.  The prices of beer, spirits and cigarettes are between 5 and 11 per cent higher than they would have been if the share of the retail price taken in taxes had remained unchanged between June 1975 and September 1981.  There has been a real but modest increase in the share of the price of these items taken by excise duty.  Conversely, however, petrol is actually 4 per cent cheaper than it would have been if there had been a constant percentage tax on that commodity. Much less than one-twentieth of the total rise in prices since 1975 can be attributed to the immediate effects of <Col N="1290" /> higher indirect taxes.  When one compares that with the increase of 11 per cent taken by the State in the form of direct taxation, it is reasonable to seek a shift from one sort of taxation to another.  This is the case which the Government now make and which my party made during the election.  It is a case which I believe has commanded a very high level of support.</P>
    <P>Deputies Reynolds and Fitzgerald seem to be of the view that the budget was unnecessary and Deputy Fitzgerald has the quaint belief that it was a propaganda exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget was a central plank of the exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think most responsible commentators would share the view expressed by the two Deputies.</P>
      <P>I now refer to the National Economic and Social Council, which is a widely representative body comprising representatives of all strands of life in Ireland who are used to fighting their own corner and are not used to paying compliments to Governments of any colour.  The conclusions and recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council in general show that the July budget is consistent with the council's recommendations on fiscal policy.  Indeed the fact that the council goes further than the Government in advocating the elimination of the budget deficit over three years, whereas we say it should be removed over four, shows that they are even more enthusiastic supporters of our policy than we are ourselves and that they hold a very different view of the economic situation than do the people on the other side of the House who are there precisely because they hold that type of irresponsible view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the European Economic Commission.  The EEC Commission recently adopted its annual report.  This report endorses wholeheartedly the budgetary policy I am following. They do this against an analysis of the position of the Community economy as a whole and of the dangers individual member states face.  They believe that <Col N="1291" /> the presumption should be that economies with high budget deficits are prone to being gravely destabilised expecially when large budget deficits are associated, as in our case, with high inflation.  They stress that the speed and ease with which budgetary deficits have been seen to slide out of control up to enormous magnitudes &mdash; as happened in this country in the last two and a half years&mdash;underlines the priority that a number of countries, Ireland included, must give to reforming their systems of budget control.  This is an area in which I have a particular interest. I was very pleased that Deputy Reynolds criticised the type of statistics made available as a background to budgets.  He criticised the one page of statistical data provided as a back-up to my budget.  I fully endorse that criticism.  Of course I was following the tradition adopted by previous Ministers.  One may argue about the figures but the format was as heretofore. However, I agree with Deputy Reynolds that we have got to do better in the future.  I wish to tell the House that I will be publishing proposals on this matter &mdash; for which I hope I will have a wide range of support, because they are not designed to be in any sense partisan, from Deputies opposite &mdash; with a view to reforming our budget procedures, to giving the House and all parties in it, whatever their political persuasions, more information and opportunity to participate in the budget-making process in this country.  That, in a matter as important as the budget, is just basic democracy. But unfortunately our economy has become so complex in recent times that basic democratic requirements in regard to the formulation of budgets and the making of choices about budgets have been taken completely out of the purview of this House.  The proposals I will be making will be designed to bring back this House into its proper place, not just as it is, unfortunately, at present as the advocate of spending regardless of where the money emanates &mdash; unfortunately existing procedures have forced many Deputies into that position &mdash; but into its true role as the guardian of the nation's finances.  It is not the Government nor <Col N="1292" /> the Minister for Finance who are the guardians of the nation's finances.  It is not we solely who are responsible for ensuring that irresponsible debts are not passed on to future generations, it is all Members in this House.  The reform of the budget process which I intend to set in train will be designed precisely to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>If I may refer to the EEC Report, the Commission describes Ireland as a country where the budget is now massively out of line with the Community average. That sentence is worth repeating: the EEC Commission describes our budget deficit as being massively out of line with the Community average.  In their proposed guidelines for economic policy in Ireland they point out that the build-up in debt here, through the servicing it involves, is placing a heavy burden on future taxpayers &mdash; endorsing exactly what I said earlier &mdash; and is reducing the Government's room for manoeuvre in dealing with the current budget imbalance. The EEC Commission believe that a reversal in the trend to increased deficits is overdue and that it requires firm Government action.  They remark that the corrective package introduced in July by the incoming Government, after only one month in office, to prevent a further deterioration in the 1981 situation is an important step in the right direction.  The EEC say that our policy is a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I am not saying at this stage I am objecting to that but it is the first we have heard of it.  I would expect the Opposition to be informed before any such motion is moved in the House.  Certainly consultation with the Whips would be necessary before we would say yea or may to such a motion, as to whether we can or should oppose or are agreeing to it.  It is with no disrespect to the mover of the motion I say this, that we were not aware of the intention of the Government to move such a motion.

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that would not get away from the fact that if the motion has been put &mdash; and my recollection of Standing Orders is that such a motion can be put without notice &mdash; an opportunity for discussion would have to be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make the point that, again, I would have expected some prior notice of such a motion being moved.  It seems a strange move by the Government that such a motion should be moved within a few minutes of what appears to be the deadline, to judge from what the Minister for the Environment has said.  Here we have another example of the order of the House being changed and even you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, do not appear to be aware of the change proposed.  Already last evening we had an issue on the Order of Business with regard to the changing about of amendments, an amendment being allegedly withdrawn and another amendment being put down at the last minute.  We had questions raised earlier this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With no disrespect to the mover of the motion, I just was not aware of it; and, as somebody who has been sitting in the House for the last one and three quarter hours or so, I would not be likely to be aware of it.  But it is a most unusual procedure that at such short notice a motion changing what obviously was the Order of Business this morning should now be introduced.  As far as I can see, the purpose of the discussion on this motion is to decide whether a change will be made.  I have asked if there has been agreement between the Whips and I have not been told there has been any such agreement.</P>
      <P>When the Private Members' motion came before the House last night the Ceann Comhairle ruled that the 15 minutes that had been lost from the debate on the Private Member's motion would be given back and in my recollection he said the Opposition were justified in questioning the rather unusual procedure leading up to the discussion on procedure because the procedure adopted was rather unusual.  What led to all of this was a change of an amendment yesterday.  It is fairly evident why the amendment was changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details but I fail to understand why, a few minutes before 6.30 p.m. today, this motion should have been moved.  Apparently agreement has not been reached between the Whips and I cannot see my way to agree to this motion.  It is most unfair treatment of the Opposition.  It began yesterday at Question Time because of a most disrespectful approach by the Taoiseach.  It continued later in Question Time.  It occurred again at the beginning of Private Members' Business last night when 15 minutes of the time of the House was wasted.  Later the Ceann Comhairle said the Opposition were justified in questioning the procedure.  What led up to that were the shenanigans and the comings and goings yesterday.  They led to an amendment being put to the Government amendment and another amendment <Col N="1296" /> being withdrawn which had appeared on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>

The Ceann Comhairle gave them that assurance &mdash; I am speaking subject to memory because I have not got the Official Report.  This morning the Leader of the Opposition, speaking on the Order of Business, said that if the matter came before the Ceann Comhairle later, by agreement the time would be compressed.  He asked if it would be in order to do that.  The answer was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  They asked would it be in order for them to do that and the answer was &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Wilson on 3 November 1981:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to withdraw circular 24/81 and to allow Boards of Management to admit pupils to National Schools in accordance with the regulations obtaining up to 30th September 1981.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the measures taken by the Minister for Education for an improvement in the organisation of classes in National Schools by way of the arrangements for the enrolment of pupils under five years of age and the employment of 300 additional primary school teachers from the beginning of the present school year thereby reducing the pupil/teacher ratio to the most favourable level ever in the history of the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the complete distortion of the facts by the Minister of State at the Department of Education last night when he referred to talks that were held with the INTO. These talks concerned merely the age of transfer of pupils from infant schools to other classes and also referred to the age of transfer to second level education. There was no mention at that stage that entry to the national school system would be confined to people over the age of four-and-a-half.  Everybody concerned says that it would be in the best interests of children that they would spend two full years in infant education and even a longer period in the national school if possible.  This circular is an attempt to get children in and out fast to national school education.  It has no base in education at all.  The case made here is purely an economic one.  In order to illustrate public feeling in this matter Dublin Corporation showed overwhelmingly the way they felt about this circular and their Labour Party members on both sides of the divide voted with us that this circular should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>A case has been made by some that the proposals now before us would bring us into line with European standards.  Many of the countries there talk of their kindergarten or nursery school set-up.  This is well established, well founded and State aided in those countries, but we have only a very haphazard free school system here, uncontrolled, with people untrained in many cases to do this work &mdash; although some are trained &mdash; so that the system is not very suitable.  However, the presence of such a system denotes the need for this type of facility and a void which the Minister well might fill, but he has added to the problem and deprived parents of the opportunity of sending four-year-olds to school if they so wish. A properly devised free school system would take a lot of money and many years to come into operation, and this circular should not have been introduced until such a system was there to replace it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We all, educationists especially and even people over there, would agree that the crucial period in any child's life is from birth up to five years.  The child who is lucky enough to have the proper environment and stimulus will develop mentally and physically during that time.  Good parents can do wonders with children at that age and a good teacher can be of tremendous assistance also to any pupil.  The national school system which we have at present caters for that age group.  Teachers are trained to deal with that age group and where possible a degree of informality in teaching keeps pace with the individuality of the pupil.  Of course, the greater the pupil-teacher ratio the less individual assistance can be given.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants a windmill at which to tilt the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio should be a target for him. We are told that from birth to five years of age 50 per cent of the child's knowledge would be acquired.  I believe that anything which upsets the intake of knowledge at that age does irreparable harm.  I would liken the progress a child makes at this stage to a runner in a sprint, a slight push will ruin his chances.  One may overcome a stumble in a mile or a marathon but, for a four-year-old, this decision is so harmful that it will do untold damage.  The Minister for Education is the first Minister in the history of the State to deny educational access to pupils&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a slogan once <Col N="1308" />&ldquo;Change over to Bolands&rdquo;.  It will have a new meaning now.  If any change is contemplated, we should first examine the alternatives.  When you have a proper pre-school system, possibly you can then think of a change.  The present national school system is capable of expansion to cater fully for the needs of our pupils. The choice is now being taken away from parents and the Minister has decided that the earliest date at which a child can be enrolled in a national school is four years and eight months.  I am speaking of actual enrolment, he will not start school until September.  The child could possibly be five years and eight months in a school that has only one enrolment period in the year.</P>
      <P>The present junior school has much to offer, especially to the socially deprived or disadvantaged child.  We are supposed to cherish all our children equally, but that is now forgotten.  When the home environment is not helpful to the educational advancement of the pupil, the school is a distinct help or substitute. Because of the social pressures which exist today the number of married women working outside the home has doubled during the period from 1971 to 1977.  Yesterday in the Dáil a question was answered to illustrate that there are 91,000 married women working in the public service.  In the present climate it is very unlikely that there will be an improvement in the situation of the underprivileged child or that their numbers will diminish.  Some 20,000 pupils will be denied access to education.  It is obvious that many of those pupils would be better off in school than on the streets. There has been a cutback of one-sixth in the numbers of trainees and still there has been no proper reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are over 900 schools with over 40 pupils.  At a time when we all wish desperately for a national understanding and a wage agreement the Minister has shown scant understanding for the needs of teachers or for the students who opted for a three year training course but who will not now have posts available to them when they qualify.  These posts were promised on a radio programme today. <Col N="1309" /> It would be interesting to know where they will exist.  We believe that teachers do productive work, despite the fact that the Minister said a disproportionate amount of the money spent on education went on teachers' salaries.  Those are the words of an economist and an auctioneer.</P>
    <P>Youth represents our real wealth.  It is reliably estimated that 1,000 teaching posts will be extinguished within the next two years if this circular becomes law. Despite the fact that the present Minister is most unlikely to be in office when the chickens come home to roost, he will qualify for the title of the most &ldquo;extinguished&rdquo; Minister in the history of the State.  In the presence of such eminent classical scholars, I can be excused for quoting from Aristotle.  He said that all who have mediated on the act of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth.  The fate of the Government could well hings on the denial of education to our youth.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this suggestion proves an economist runs the Department.  An investment in education does not show a profit immediately as far as cold-blooded, monetary men are concerned.  They do not see an investment in youth as a real investment in the future.  This epitomises the difference in approach between Fianna Fáil policies and the policies of the present Government.  Because of this decision, 20,000 pupils will be denied access to education.  They will not be able to enrol in schools and, as the appointments and retention of teachers depends on the numbers on the roll, many teachers' posts will be lost.  They will have to go on a panel and 484 teachers will not now be able to get alternative jobs. Three-teacher schools will become two-teacher schools.  Some urban schools in deprived areas will also become two-teacher schools and it will be difficult in very small two-teacher schools to retain their second teacher.</P>
    <P>The Protestant community will be the hardest hit, as Deputy Wilson mentioned last night.  They have already indicated to the Minister their objections to the circular and have said &mdash; I am sure not lightly &mdash; that the circular is more detrimental <Col N="1310" /> to their interests than anything done by any other Government.  The Minister can feel happy knowing that he has helped in the crusade by supplying the Taoiseach with one example of how we can be classified as a sectarian State. Will our Unionist brethern be impressed with the downgrading of Church of Ireland schools?  I have experience in teaching in two-, three-, four-, five- and multi-teacher schools.  I am not thinking so much of the loss of a teacher's job but of the effect of the loss of a teacher on any school, the disruption it causes to the organisation of that school and the dilution in the quality of the teaching and subjects available to the pupils.</P>
    <P>Ballyshannon national school, County Kildare, where I taught, a three-teacher school, are now going to lose their third teacher in the next quarter.  What will happen in more remote areas?  It will cause a considerable upset in schools organisation.  In Kildare 1,366 pupils enrolled in the infants' school last year. That will drop by 4 per cent in 1982 and it will drop by 50 per cent in 1983 when 679 pupils will be enrolled in our schools.  We can assume that the Minister will deny 679 more pupils access to those schools.  It will force an immediate loss in this quarter of four teaching posts, six teaching posts in the following year and 13 in the year after that, a loss of 23 posts in Kildare.  There will be only 15 vacancies arising from retirements and so on at that time.  Perhaps the Minister is not too interested in Kildare but he may be interested in what will happen in Dublin.  Last year infant enrolment was 14,000.  In 1981-82 there will be a drop of 9 per cent and the following year there will be a decrease of 42 per cent when 8,193 pupils will be enrolled and, possibly, 7,000 denied enrolment.  Over the next three years the Minister's proposal means that there will be a loss of 330 posts in Dublin. To offset that, there will be only 113 retirements so there will be a net loss in Dublin of 217 teachers' posts because of this.</P>
    <P>In bigger schools the January intake will be disruptive to the organisation of the school.  It may sound a small thing but pupils who start for the first time in <Col N="1311" /> January possibly miss more school because of bad weather or sickness.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that argument when it was advanced here as a reason why we should not canvass in Cavan/Monaghan during the bad weather in November.  He can well understand why children aged four and a half might be excused for missing school in January, February or March. There will not be fair or equal treatment between pupils born in the first half of the year and those who are born in the latter half of the year.  The age of leaving national schools may be raised for some but it could well be lowered for others. This depends on how one interprets rule 64.  It recommends that the time spent in the national school should be increased. It could well be because of this directive that time spent in the national school could be diminished.  My own experience proves that whether a pupil comes to school at four or five years of age, he will spend considerable time getting acclimatised, getting to know his surroundings and settling in.  It is vital that this be done and got over with early.  If parents want to have their children admitted to school at four, who are we to say &ldquo;Do not bring them&rdquo;, and that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that under his system children will spend seven and a half years in primary school.  Under the present system, children spend eight full years in primary school.  There is a volume of opinion abroad that this should be increased to nine years.  It is blatantly false to say that pupils will receive an adequate infant preparation as a result of this directive.  A child of four and a half years will be admitted on 1 January and will spend only one and a half years in the infants' school and a total of seven and a half years in primary school.  A child who happens to be four years, five months and, say, 30 days, and who would not be enrolled until the following September would have the benefit of a full two years in infants' school and eight full years in primary school.</P>
    <P>A statement was made that children will be 12 years on transfer to secondary <Col N="1312" /> school.  As far as we are aware, there is no change in the Department of Education's rule which says that a child should be promoted to first class at six years, neither is any change mentioned yet with regard to the age at which a pupil should be on transfer to secondary school.  We have no firm information available on whether school authorities may refuse to enrol pupils in January, or as to how long January-enrolled pupils would spend in infants' school.  Because of this directive, unemployment will be caused and retention figures, if abolished, will eliminate 342 posts.  With regard to four-year-olds, the directive will eliminate 690 posts, which gives a total of 1,032 posts, figures which are confirmed in &ldquo;Oideas&rdquo; 17&mdash;Earrach, 1977, pages 29 to 31.  It is also possible that, because of the drawbacks presented in a January entry to schools, many schools will avoid this as long as possible and redundancies could reach a figure of 1,383.</P>
    <P>We should ask questions tonight which the Minister should be expected to answer.  If this directive is to be brought in, alternative nursery education or day care provision should have been provided. It is our belief that this cannot be provided by the Government within the next five years.  If the Minister feels that it can be provided, let him tell us here tonight how he is going to do it.</P>
    <P>We have the worst pupil-teacher ratio in Western Europe.  Why did the Minister decide, in that climate, to cut back on 180 entrants to our College of Education? We need 4,000 extra teachers in our national schools to bring the maximum class size down to an acceptable limit. Has the Minister thought about the situation in some areas which now enjoy free school transport, that the cutback on pupil intake will lead to a discontinuation of this transport?  Perhaps that is what he wants.  It could well be what the Minister for Finance wants and he showed his hand in this regard long before he ever became Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>He is probably consistent <Col N="1313" /> in what he is doing.  With regard to this circular, there was no consultation about the raising of the entry age to national schools, no consultation with teachers' unions, or management bodies.  There should also have been a consultation, not only with first level teaching but with second level, because this will have consequential effects on those schools and their pupils.</P>
      <P>Only today the question of over-manning of our vocational schools was referred to.  This is evidence of another cutback.  The pupil-teacher ratio in our vocational schools, with the emphasis on manual instruction and other practical subjects as well as academic, was needed and the weighting in the pupil-teacher ratio in favour of vocational schools was justified.  It is obvious that the academic bigots are having their say, when vocational education has been singled out for a cutback and the word &ldquo;over-manning&rdquo; has been used.</P>
      <P>The Minister might well look at his own Department and see if there is any over-manning of civil servants there and if those who are recommending him to do some pruning in our vocational schools might well look nearer home, to see how cuts could be made in the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment to the amendment of Deputies Brown and Kemmy was cobbled together in a hurry, after consultation with the Government, probably with the Minister himself.  The format decided upon was an attempt to sweeten up these two Independents for the vote and for the votes which will be needed later.  I would not be expected, at my age, to do any proof reading when we have eminent and prominent printers to do that, but it is hard for me to pass over a grammatical error in the amendment.  I refer to the phrase &ldquo;suffer significant frequently permanent emotional trauma&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;frequently permanent&rdquo; puzzle me.  I would like to know how anybody could be frequently permanent.  As an old NT, I am very tempted to cross that out. Almost always I do that, you know.  I suggest that we insert the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; between &ldquo;significant&rdquo; and &ldquo;frequently&rdquo;<Col N="1314" /> and put a comma after &ldquo;frequently&rdquo;.  It would then read &ldquo;suffer significant and frequently, permanent emotional trauma&rdquo;.  It makes some sense when one reads it in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The amendment by Fine Gael and the amendment of that by the two Deputies concerned must obviously be acceptable to Fine Gael.  They must agree with the sentiments expressed in it.  The amended amendment to replace the previous amendment on the Order Paper of 3 November is a calculated insult to the primary teachers of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Indeed, I can say that it has been seen as such.  The generally held belief of the emotional trauma inflicted by primary teachers on pupils is not deserved, but I have come to expect this from Deputy Browne, who has been consistent in this.  I must compliment him on his persistence, which has found such a ready ear with the Minister for Education, in regard to doing away with corporal punishment in schools.  Now that he has removed the stick from primary education, he will find a very sensible ally in Deputy Kemmy in his next campaign, probably to outlaw the crosier.  That is a symbol not unconnected with Dr. Browne's greatest traumatic experience. Granted that there are good and bad teachers and good and bad TDs.</P>

Nationalism should be replaced by socialism, according to these people. There was another eminent socialist here, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, now departed.  He accused Irish teachers of being guilty of producing little IRA men. What the teachers of Ireland, in fact, did was that they kept alive the belief that we could never accept, here in Ireland, that we were a province of Britain, like Scotland and Wales, but that we are a separate historic and honoured nation in our own right.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his colleagues have expressed some concern for our young children and the frightful legacy which we are leaving them.  This is all hypocrisy, when we think of the penalty which we are now imposing on them.  Does the Minister realise the extent of the problem? He should not let the Civil Service run the Government and the country.  He is dealing with the Department of Education which is probably the most hidebound, ultra-conventional and immovable Department in the State.  It is insulated with layers of incurable and impregnable prejudices and the under-manning we heard mention of today copper-fastens my opinion in that regard. The Minister should think for himself. Schools were built for pupils, teachers play a supportive role but if their role is secondary surely the role of civil servants must be less important still.  The parents pay the taxes, they have the children, they help manage the schools and if they were not consulted before this directive was issued at least they have a right to be listened to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people have always shown a love of learning.  Even when they were <Col N="1316" /> hungry and ill-clad, the hedge-schools flourished.  A foreign Government gave us an educational system in the 1830s and this week 150 years ago national education was founded in this State.  What a way we select tonight to celebrate the sesquicentennial year of the foundation of Irish national education.  Little did anybody think a century-and-a-half ago and after 60 years of self-Government that any Irish Minister would take this retrograde step.  Mo náire thú.  Níl an díoghbháil déanta go fóill.

    <P>May I remind the Minister of the words in a popular song: &ldquo;They try to tell us we're too young&rdquo; and of the final line to that song which could be very appropriate: &ldquo;Some day you may recall we were not too young at all.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Power on the aspect of entertainment he managed to introduce into this debate. &ldquo;It appeared to be generally agreed that 11 plus is too low for transfer to post-primary schools, and that children generally are too immature at that age.  Pursuing that to its logical conclusion one reached the controlling fact that children are being accepted into school at too young an age.  In fact, a number of speakers suggested that five years should be the minimum age for acceptance and that children under that age were not ready for school and still needed the protection and security of the home.&rdquo;  Those are not my words, or even the words of the former Minister.  They are taken from the official report of the record of the Irish National Teacher's Organisation Congress in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the spring of 1981 issue of <i>An Múinteoir Náisiúnta</i>, a publication not unknown to the members of the INTO, <Col N="1317" /> a sub-committee of the Dublin south city branch, a branch that has been rather vocal lately, reported on its findings on the question &ldquo;From Primary to Second Level when should transfer occur&rdquo; and it states:</P>
    <P>It is the general contention of the sub-committee that pupils in the Republic of Ireland begin formal schooling much too early.</P>
    <P>That went on to say:</P>
    <P>Given the inability of many children in primary schools to cope with the curriculum it seems that they are in the main too young at all class levels.</P>
    <P>They are not my words, nor the words of any eminent educationalist or the words of a monetarist Minister for Finance but words from a sub-committee of a Dublin south branch of the INTO earlier this year.</P>

That working party held the view that &ldquo;substantially too many pupils were too young on being promoted from infant standard to first class and that a significant number of pupils made this transition after spending an inadequate period of time in the infant standard due to enrolment late in the year in junior infants once they reached four years of age&rdquo;.

      <P>There are certain facts of the situation which were kept well hidden from the ordinary rank and file members of Fianna Fáil and from some of the other interests in the early months of 1981.

However, even if the ordinary rank and file Deputies of Fianna Fáil did not understand what was happening I am rather surprised that the membership of the INTO and, in particular, its executive, normally a perspicacious group of people who know exactly what is happening where and when, were not in a position to realise the changes in the Government estimates and the changes in the stance of the Minister in the months running up to the general election campaign. As they were not, and as the rank and file of Fianna Fáil Deputies apparently were not so aware, perhaps it is as well that we place the situation on the record of the House.  What Deputy Wilson knows well, and what most of his colleagues in Cabinet should remember, is that no financial provision was made in the Estimates for the year 1981&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As a teacher himself I am sure he would have realised that teachers do not give of their services on a voluntary, unpaid basis.  Indeed, he had the advantage of having his memory jogged by the fact that the provision had to be specifically adverted to in the discussion of costs as presented by his Department to the Department of Finance.  Deputy Wilson, and his Government, in fact decided on the deletion of the estimated required provision.  Normally &mdash; and all of us knew this, especially the executive of the INTO &mdash; improved pupil-teacher ratios were announced by the Minister and his predecessors at the Easter congress of the INTO.  But for some strange reason, this year no announcement was made.  For some equally strange reason the executive of the INTO did not express surprise or outrage as they might very well have done.</P>

      <P>One would perhaps wonder why, as they were legitimately entitled to do so.  They are a group capable of organising a well-concerted lobby and of presenting their facts to the members of the public and the Members of this House.  But they said nothing when there was no announcement about the employment or recruitment of extra teachers at the Easter congress as was usual.  Deputy Wilson may have had a reason for not doing so.  Perhaps he wanted to be especially fair to the Opposition in the weeks running up to a general election campaign. He may have thought it was not the thing to do to take unfair advantage of the Opposition.  In fact he was so inhibited in regard to the employment of these extra teachers that he did not approach the Minister for Finance for approval for the proposed improvement in the pupil-teacher <Col N="1322" /> ratio figures which I think were mentioned in the course of the recent election campaign.  He did not approach the Minister for Finance for approval for that recruitment until 22 June 1981, 11 days after the general election.</P>

      <P>I was here last night and I heard the most disgraceful attack for some time launched on public servants in this Chamber.  I heard it expressed by Deputy Wilson consistently in line with the attack launched by his Leader upon the civil servants of the Department of Finance when he underestimated the inflation rate by 50 per cent.  I heard a similar attack visited by Deputy Wilson, until recently a Member of the Cabinet, and compounded tonight by Deputy Power, the former Minister for whatever he was Minister for, on the civil servants, those who cannot answer back.  It shows the paucity of one's argument when one has to visit one's attack on the far side of the bullpen.  I reject the attack launched by Deputy Wilson and his leader on the civil servants of the Department of Finance and by the former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry on the civil servants <Col N="1324" /> of the Department of Education here this evening who, only before the summer recess, were singled out for praise by his colleague, Deputy Wilson.</P>

      <P>In relation to this collective football that Deputy Lenihan and his colleagues kicked out the door, at paragraph 4.20 of the Fianna Fáil White Paper page 33 there is outlined:</P>
      <P>Attendance at school is compulsory in this country from the age of six to fifteen.  Ireland is, however, virtually unique among European countries in that it makes provision in public primary schools for children from the age of four.  In the normal course of events children receive their primary education in a single primary school or in a group of such schools on a single site. At present a child may be enrolled in school as soon as it reaches four years of age.  Enrolments, taking place as they do at different times during the school-year, can give rise to difficulties in the organisation of classes and in the provision of an adequate programme for such pupils at junior level.  In future first enrolment of pupils under the age of five will be permitted only on two dates each year, namely the first day of the school-year and the first school day in January after they have reached their fourth birthday.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson endeavoured to wriggle out of the commitment in the Government White Paper by referring to the preamble and his reference to the fact that the Government would be anxious to have wide-ranging discussions. But the part of the preamble which he did not quote from said that the Government's view was that the document to be produced &ldquo;should not be unduly hesitant about making proposals for future development: that the expression of the views of the Minister for Education would be expected and welcomed&rdquo;.  Last night the man who was Minister for Education when this document was produced, the man who presumably had a large input into the writing of this document, the man who invited his Government to sanction this document and in whose name it was published, denied this White Paper, denied they were his views, denied they were the policy of his Government.</P>

      <P>There are a number of educational advantages which Deputy <Col N="1327" /> Wilson knows well and concurred with when the White Paper was being produced. Last night he did somersaults and handstands for the entertainment of his backbenchers and the public gallery.  The two fixed entry dates we have introduced are identical with the Fianna Fáil proposal, but we have made a requirement that children should be four-and-a-half years on that entry date, not four years as stated in the Fianna Fáil proposal. Deputy Wilson now invites the House to consider that they were not in any way increasing the age of entry, that children are still four years of age.  The INTO invited me to believe that they did not understand that the White Paper meant an increase in the age of entry.</P>
      <P>Let us take Deputy Wilson's example given last night.  A child born on 2 January in any year would not be four on 1 January.  That would mean that that child would be four years and eight months in September.  That appears to be substantially older than four years of age, yet the INTO and the former Minister are <i>ad idam</i> for some reason on this matter; &ldquo;the White Paper did not propose an increase in the age of entry.&rdquo;  The only way in which the entry age would not increase by virtue of the Fianna Fáil White Paper decision could have been if all children in the country were to be born on two specific dates in the year.  Perhaps Deputy Wilson or his colleagues had some master plan for how they would introduce that. Whatever plan they had in mind, I believe the public would find it difficult to conceive it.</P>

      <P>Let us talk about this great lack of consultation.  Sometimes there comes a stage when consensus goes out the door, when after you have rooted around for four years trying to find consensus to abolish corporal punishment, you decide it is time to make a decision. Sometimes there are harsh decisions for Governments to make and then the men will be sorted out from the boys.  I made a decision on behalf of the Government and I am now being accused of not having <Col N="1328" /> had consultations.  What did that really mean?  It meant, &ldquo;We are annoyed that you did not give us the opportunity to mount the very efficient campaign we are running now before you implemented this proposal instead of having to run it now after you implemented this proposal&rdquo;. That is exactly what it meant.</P>
      <P>Let us now have a look at the INTO figures published last Monday in relation to 3,500 primary schools in the country which, I want to stress, are concerned primarily with the effects on the enrolment regulation for teacher employment. There has been scant discussion in this entire debate regarding the position of the child, the role of the child or the needs of the child.  The first time this was discussed in public was today when I was interviewed on an RTE radio programme. No other contributor has put forward a view in relation to what is needed for the child.  I congratulate the INTO on the expedition with which they produced their figures.  However, like all surveys quickly taken, the accuracy would not appear to be very distinctive. I should mention that the INTO contend that if they had not been allowed an artificial enrolment machinery for enrolling children artificially in the last quarter of the year, and to boost the enrolment figures and thereby&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The INTO admitted in their briefing document that it is a practice which by tradition they were allowed to use and thereby boost the enrolment figures artificially.  They contend in their survey that if they had not been allowed to do that in the June quarter of this year they would have lost 249 teaching posts. That is quite extraordinary because a similar survey conducted by the Department in relation to the June quarter of the previous year &mdash; the Deputy will remember when that survey was done &mdash; reveals that 90 posts were being held artificially in this way.  Yet in the course of a year, the 90 posts have grown to 249.  I will not waste the time of the House any further in dealing with the other figures put forward <Col N="1329" /> except to say that they virtually all fall into the same category.</P>

      <P>I will quote some of them if the Deputy is disappointed.  The INTO also gave the figures in relation to the enrolments for the school year 1980-81. Those are the enrolments as at 30 September 1980, which is over a year ago. One would assume that those enrolment figures at least would have been accurate.</P>
      <P>Let us have a look at the INTO figures and the cases where they claim they have full returns.  Let us make sure to pick those counties.  In County Donegal the INTO returns show 1,769, and the actual enrolment was 2,615.  For Sligo, the INTO figure is 710 and the actual enrolment is 1,054.  For Mayo the INTO figure is 1,761 but there were actually 2,410 children in school in that year.  For Galway the INTO figure is 2,482 and the real figure is 3,406.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a statistical survey when the Deputy was quoting from it. For Kildare the INTO figure is 1,366 and the actual enrolment was twice that, 2,620.  For Kilkenny the INTO figure was 1,106 and the actual figure 1,547.  For Tipperary the INTO figure is 2,040 and the actual figure 2,761.  For Clare the INTO figure is 1,166 and the actual figure is 1,759.  I can go on and on but the House will note that the INTO figures are substantially lower than those officially returned to the Department by the principal teachers.  There are either many ghost children in the primary schools or the INTO figures are unreliable.</P>
      <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House any further in this regard except to draw attention to the fact that 11 of the other conclusions in the INTO survey are based on the premise of the enrolments in the schools, and if such enrolments are actually drastically below the actual numbers in the schools then that serves to exaggerate the number of posts supposedly &ldquo;to be lost&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> Last night Deputy Wilson spoke about the special schools and about the effect this would have on schools for the mentally and physically handicapped.  I do not know, when he introduced a similar provision into his White Paper, if he intended to impose it on the mentally and physically handicapped.  I do not intend to, and the issue of the special schools does not apply.  Perhaps when Deputy Wilson wrote his paragraph 420 he intended that this should be extended to the special schools.  I want to state clearly so that that unfair worry in the minds of parents of mentally handicapped children may now clearly be removed.</P>
    <P>Great play has also been made by various people of the position of the two-teacher schools in the country.  I want to state on behalf of the Government and on my own behalf that I am committed to the concept of the retention of the two-teacher schools.  I do not believe that one-teacher schools are educationally viable and I will take every step open to me to continue the existence of the two-teacher schools in the country, not the 1,100 two-teacher schools in the INTO figures, but the 863 remaining after Deputy Wilson had closed the other 200 odd during the last four years.  I am giving a commitment on behalf of the Government that no two-teacher school will be affected adversely as a result of the implementation of this circular.  If other people had given that guarantee four years ago there would be far more of those decent, honourable, worthwhile two-teacher schools still in operation.</P>

Of the 212 non-Catholic schools a maximum of 18 could be affected in any way by the introduction of this circular. That is a figure of less than 9 per cent. That gives the lie also to that.</P>
      <P>I want to give an undertaking on the part of the Government in the entire area of pre-schooling.  I have a personal commitment to the idea that there should be greater State involvement where it is needed in the area of pre-schooling.  I have had many discussions, not just with interested parties or individuals, but with the Members of the Labour Parliamentary Party and the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party and many other interests.  As a result, I want to announce on behalf of the Government that the Government are establishing a national registration council for pre-schooling, play groups and nursery groups.  The Government will lay down minimum physical standards. It will be mandatory that such schools shall be registered.  Operational guidelines will be laid down and inspections will be carried out by health board personnel.</P>

We hope that project may be used in conjunction with the training programmes which will be introduced on a county wide basis within the next few months.</P>
      <P>I want to give this commitment on behalf of the Government.  The Government have decided that the vast bulk of the moneys available to us for spending on pre-schooling should be channelled as a matter of deliberate bias into the areas of deprivation and disadvantage.  I do not believe middle-class people like myself and many others in this House want or need massive State aid or State intervention in the area of pre-schooling.

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pretend to be a bit surprised that the Minister for Education spent so much time dealing in red herrings.  I will try to bring the debate back to the level at which we might expect to find it in relation to a matter of very considerable importance to the children of this country.  The Minister for Education has taken a decision to debar four year old children from the primary schools in the future.  Enrolment is to be permitted only at the week ending on the last day in June and the week commencing the second Monday in January.  Every experienced teacher knows that very few children under five years of age will enter the primary schools in the future.</P>
      <P>Everybody, including the Minister, I am sure will agree that his decision is a very important one in the educational sphere.  Therefore, I find it difficult to understand how the Minister, after a few weeks in office only, could possibly have come to grips with a very large and complex Department to such an extent as to enable him to make a fundamental change and to argue, as he had been doing prior to his speech in this House, that it was taken on educational grounds mainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that many Ministers for Education were faced with the same proposal by the Department of Finance to raise the school entry age.  Much as I respect the Department of Finance, I cannot say I ever found them particularly concerned about the effects on our educational system of their proposals to cut the Education Estimates.  Minister after Minister for Education successfully resisted all the attempts by the Department of Finance to have the proposal to <Col N="1334" /> raise the school entry age adopted.  Former Ministers recognised the damage such a decision could cause to our children's education, and particularly the children in the less well off sections of the community.  However determined the efforts and pressures on them, they were determined that under no circumstances would they agree to this change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland was the first Minister for Education to succumb and to make a decision which all those who are aware of the consequences regard as a fundamental one.  From my experience in the Department of Education, and I had quite a considerable experience of that Department, I am certain that they too stoutly resisted the efforts of the Minister and the Government to effect this change.  The Department of Education were especially proud of the fact that the age of admission to our primary schools was the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>And still is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not see them easily accepting the demands of the Department of Finance in this area. Quite obviously, the Minister for Education forced their hand and we then had the circular of 12 August 1981.  The decision of the Minister for Education in this sphere was a fundamental one on quite a number of counts.  I will deal with two of them.  First it is now an accepted fact that the years from the birth of a child to the age of five years are basic to his later educational development.  In other words what is done to assist a child's development during those years is of the utmost significance in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the change now made by the Minister is a serious disruption of a system which has pertained in this country for many generations.  Such disruption, without any attempt being made to fill the void created, can do nothing but damage to the system which has served the educational needs of many generations of Irish children.  I would not regard the announcement by the Minister about some type of pre-schooling in any great light.  It is significant &mdash; and perhaps Deputy Browne and Deputy Kemmy will <Col N="1335" /> note this fact &mdash; that he waited until the last minute-and-a-half of his time to refer to it.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that the decision of the Minister and the Coalition Government to raise the age of entry to primary schools had nothing whatever to do with education.  It was simply and solely a financial measure to save money to help the Government to pay for the costly package of goodies offered by the Fine Gael Party before the election, which was added to by the Labour Party during the negotiations which led up to the formation of the Coalition Government.  Like the Government's July budget increase in VAT, the measure by the Minister will hit the weaker sections of the community who have not got the means to pay for any substitute which might possibly be available to the wealthier sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister consulted with neither the school boards, the teachers, nor the parents.  We had neither a Green Paper, nor a White Paper from him on the subject. The Minister for Finance simply cracked the whip and the Minister for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>White Papers mean nothing as of last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education accepted the dictate.  Last night the Minister of State at the Department of Education said we should be discussing this matter in relation to education and not refer to teachers being unemployed. Of course, our main thrust relates to the education of our children.  We have also got to concern ourselves about the employment of teachers and the employment of graduates who will leave the colleges of education in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that we have the earliest entry age to primary schools in Europe.  He suggested in a previous statement that children of four years of age are too young for a formal school setting. From the Minister's comments one would assume that immediately a child enters the national school it is involved in formal education.  That is not so.  The primary school curriculum introduced by me <Col N="1336" /> when I was Minister for Education allows for a very high degree of flexibility and informality at infant level.  Already great strides have been made in the development of infant education due to the flexible and informal nature of the curriculum. To enable this worthwhile work to continue what is needed is the provision of more resources to reduce further the pupil-teacher ratio, as Deputy Wilson did on a number of occasions when he was Minister for Education, and to provide more equipment and facilities, rather than closing the door on our four-year-olds as the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>When faced with a deluge of criticism and protest the Minister gave a vague promise to provide another system of infant education of unknown quality. Clearly it would take years to implement and the effect would be to abolish a well regulated system that has great potential, giving the necessary finance to develop it.  To reach full potential smaller classes at infant level are vital.  More teachers are necessary and more equipment should be made available.  If the Minister were really serious about the new system he is proposing for infants, he would have the matter researched thoroughly to see how it would fit into the Irish context.  He would provide the necessary finance and facilities for such a venture and only then, and after consultation with the various groupings involved including the parents and the teachers, should he make changes.  It is obvious the reason the Minister did not carry out the necessary research was that he wanted a short-term financial windfall for the Exchequer and the carrot of pre-schooling will remain a carrot for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>Psychological research has demonstrated that the period from the time the child is born until it is five years is critical in the development of its intellectual capacity.  It is not many years ago since it was thought that a child's IQ remained constant from the day of birth.  This is not so, as has been proved by worldwide research and as has been admirably demonstrated by the Rutland Street project which was financed by the Department of Education and the Van Leer Foundation. By providing the necessary teachers <Col N="1337" /> and the necessary back-up personnel and facilities, it was shown that children from deprived backgrounds could compete with children from more favoured backgrounds. The need to give special attention to the needs of the very young is obvious, particularly to the needs of those from deprived homes.  That should be done immediately, not in the far distant future.</P>
    <P>The only provision for children of four years, which is of general application, was the infant class in the primary school and this is now being taken away.  When Deputy Wilson was Minister for Education he had the right approach.  During his term of office, time after time he reduced class sizes thereby creating the conditions where the curriculum for infants could become fully effective.  One would have thought that the Minister, rather than raising the entry age to primary schools &mdash; incidentally, this will increase class sizes in many schools &mdash; would have reduced the number of pupils in infant classes.  If he had done this he would have improved on the provision that existed already in the area of child education.  Instead of this he is proposing to abolish the provision completely.  The degree of flexibility and informality at infant level in primary schools can be very considerable.  The aim should be to reduce class sizes and thereby provide a better opportunity for educational development rather than closing the school doors on four-year olds while promising an unknown type of pre-school education in the far distant future.  As I said earlier, from the day the child is born until it is five years of age is the critical stage in the development of its intellectual capacity. The plight of a child from a deprived home who no longer can enrol at four years will be pitiable in the future.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that Fine Gael may not be particularly interested in the deprived child but I am rather concerned to find that the Labour Party and the two Deputies whose names are on the amendment should vote to deprive these children. This is something which their supporters will find difficult to understand. May I remind the Coalition parties that <Col N="1338" /> before the election they promised positive discrimination in favour of the socially and educationally deprived? Indeed, after the election they stated that the needs of the disadvantaged would be given special attention.  The decision of the Minister and the Government to raise the entry age to primary schools runs totally contrary to these declarations.  Far from discriminating in favour of the socially and educationally deprived, they are positively discriminating against these children.</P>
    <P>Where will the socially and educationally deprived families get the money to pay for pre-school education, even if it is available?  Where will those on low incomes or the unemployed get the money for nursery schooling?  The educational needs of such children will be particularly damaged and taking account of the rapid rise in the number of unemployed it is obvious that many more children will be placed in the deprived categories.</P>
    <P>Schemes giving deprived children a push over their disadvantage at a young age were once widely criticised but now these schemes have been proved to be a good social and economic investment. Longtitudinal studies carried out in the United States have shown that pupils who get such educational assistance were far less likely to be put in special education, that is to say in remedial classes, or to be held back a grade during their subsequent school career.  Research has shown that by the age of 15 years such children scored an average of 8 per cent higher on reading, arithmetic and language tests than the control group.  That meant they were the equivalent of one academic year ahead.  Such assistance showed up outside the classroom also.  For example, delinquency was much more common among those who had not attended school.  It was calculated also that the cost of two years schooling at the young age was far less than the subsequent benefits over an average individual lifetime.  This accrued mainly from the fact that there was less need for remedial education and there was increased earnings as an adult.</P>
    <P>One might ask how this applies to our situation?  First, the study in the United <Col N="1339" /> States related to children in the four to six age group.  Secondly, it related to children coming from deprived homes. Thirdly, and very important, the only form of kindergarten schooling, the only properly controlled and regulated system of early education available generally in this country, is the primary school.</P>
    <P>From what I have said it is clear that the four-year old against whom the school door is now closed will lose out educationally both in the short and long-term and will lose out financially in the long-term as well.  This is a very shortsighted policy and it underlines the fact that it was decided on for short-term financial gain to the Exchequer rather than the long-term educational and financial advantage of the individual and the community generally.</P>
    <P>In his statement announcing the change the Minister stated it was done &ldquo;for the purpose of enabling better organisation of classes to be effected in national schools&rdquo;.  I wonder who thought that one up?  Is it not clear that it will cause much worse organisation in the national schools?  If I might give an example: where there are eight teachers in a school, there is a teacher available for each class.  The fact there will now be fewer infants enrolled means that, in many instances, eight-teacher schools will become seven-teacher schools with the organisational problems which will go with such a change.  Each teacher will now have a class and part of another class to teach and, of course, the numbers to be taught will increase considerably &mdash; eight teachers are needed to teach 260 pupils but if there are only 250 pupils, only seven teachers are employed.  If one divides 260 by eight and 250 by seven one will see what I am taking about.  Is it suggested that a teacher teaching two classes with a greater number of pupils will be able to do better work than a teacher with one class only and fewer pupils in the class?</P>
    <P>The greatest problems will arise, however, in three-teacher schools many of which will be reduced to two-teacher schools.  These schools will be reduced not at the demand of the community but <Col N="1340" /> because of the decision of the Minister. It is very important that we remember that.  The problems facing a school losing a teacher are exceptional and the Minister should recognise this.  It is clear therefore that it is not only the infants who will not be able to attend school who will be adversely affected by the Minister's decision, but it will also affect those at a higher level right through their lives.</P>
    <P>Another argument presented by the Minister in favour of change was that children were too young transferring from the primary schools to the post-primary schools.  His decision in relation to the entry age to primary schools does not change the situation one iota.  The Minister has not changed the regulations regarding the transfer to post-primary schools.  Is it not possible that we will no longer have junior infants and senior infants but simply infants and therefore children will continue to transfer at the same age?  I would be happier to see children transfer from primary schools to post-primary schools at a later age, but there are many ways in which such an objective can be achieved other than by raising the entry age to primary schools which I have shown can be detrimental to the development of the children.</P>
    <P>If the transfer age of children from primary school to post-primary school is too low, why not have a transitional year at primary school level with a curriculum especially developed by primary and post-primary teachers working in consultation? This would be satisfactory to both the primary and post-primary teachers' viewpoints and would be very beneficial to the children concerned.  Alternatively, the child could spend a longer period in infant classes so that young children could have a better opportunity to grasp the fundamental concepts necessary for further education.</P>
    <P>Let me again stress the point that where the numbers in a school fall below the figure required to retain the full complement of teachers already teaching in the school, and as a result where one teacher must seek employment elsewhere, the pupil-teacher ratio in that school will be considerably increased.  In areas where it is already too high it will <Col N="1341" /> create an even worse situation.  I have pointed to the educational disadvantages of the Minister's proposals and underline that the more deprived sector of our community will suffer most.  The Minister's decision will increase class numbers.</P>
    <P>Circular 24/81 will, of course, affect teacher employment.  The entitlement of a national school to its complement of teachers is determined by the average number of pupils enrolled in the school. As a result of the restrictions imposed by the Minister for Education, it is estimated that enrolments will be reduced very considerably. The restrictions mean that a number of teaching posts will be extinguished over three years and teachers will be required to transfer to schools up to 45 kilometers away.</P>
    <P>While it is true that teachers presently employed will not lose their jobs and that those who become redundant will go on a panel and will be guaranteed a job in another school up to 45 kilometres away, the fact is that many of those who will graduate from colleges of education in the next few years will be without any prospect of a job for a considerable time after graduating.  These graduates undertook a three-year course of study on the understanding that there would be jobs for them, and that assurance of employment has been withdrawn by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this particular aspect of the matter.  Unlike the situation in respect of other teachers in our educational system, the Department of Education control the entry of students into colleges of education.  I have always held the view that where the Department trained more teachers than they were willing to employ at a given time or where the number trained was too high because of a ministerial decision &mdash; such as the decision now taken by the Minister for Education &mdash; resulting in primary teacher unemployment, the Department have a responsibility towards those graduates and must shoulder that responsibility.  A situation such as this prevailed in the thirties and early forties where some teachers did not get permanent posts for years, with the result that many of them could not qualify for the full pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation will arise as a result of the Minister's decision on the school entry age.  He cannot claim, as might have been claimed in the thirties, that he did not appreciate the problems which would arise in respect of graduates of colleges of education.  He has been forewarned. Cutting back on the numbers entering the colleges is far from being a solution for many reasons.  First, what of the students already in these colleges?  Second, the reality is that we should continue to train as many teachers, at the very least, as heretofore if we are to continue the welcome trend of reduced pupil-teacher ratios so obvious during the term of office of Deputy Wilson.  Third, because of the Minister's decision large numbers of <Col N="1343" /> young people anxious to enter the colleges of education in the next two or three years will be unable to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that this is not a storm in a teacup.  Our motion is an attempt to ensure that our children have available to them the personnel and facilities necessary to develop their intellectual capacity, taking account of the fact that the period up to five years of age is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I would like to address myself very briefly to two sectors of the community. The first group are those who feel that five years of age is young enough to attend school.  The vital period of a child's educational development is before he reaches five years; the base for further educational development is laid down during the period up to five years of age and the consequences of ignoring this can be very serious.  The second group are <Col N="1344" /> those who are unhappy about the age children enter post-primary education.  I have already said that the Minister's decision will not alter this situation one iota but even if it did I could not accept a situation where a child would be deprived of an education in its most formative years.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that we are not speaking here of a year or a half year one way or the other.  We are concerned about the grave matter of depriving a child of the educational assistance he needs at a vital stage in his life, the effects of which can remain with him for the rest of his life.  I believe the Minister's decision is a retrograde step.</P>

      <P>The person concerned entered insurance in 1973 and had a total of 121 paid contributions to his credit when he became incapable of work on 30 August 1975.

    <P>He cannot requalify for further payment of disability benefit until at least 13 contributions, which are reckonable for disability benefit purposes, have been paid in respect of him since he exhausted his entitlement to benefit.  When he claimed disability benefit on 5 November 1980 he had only two paid contributions on his record since 1976 in respect of employment in the United Kingdom. Inquiries in that country established that <Col N="1209" /> he had a further nine paid British contributions to his credit but he still does not satisfy the requalifying condition of payment of at least 13 contributions.

Seventy of the armed robberies took place in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, six in the Louth-Meath Division, three in Kerry Division, two each in Cavan-Monaghan and Waterford-Kilkenny Divisions, and one each in Longford-Westmeath and Tipperary Divisions.  These figures are provisional.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 3 January 1981 and was paid from 7 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 12 May 1981 at the maximum appropriate rate.  Payment was disallowed after that date following his examination by a medical referee of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the decision to disallow payment of benefit and was again examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  The matter was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision of the deciding officer that the person concerned was not incapable in the period 12 May 1981 to 18 September 1981, the date of the latest medical evidence before him at that time, and was not entitled to be paid disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned indicated to the appeals officer at the oral hearing that he was attending a consultant from whom he could obtain a report of his incapacity and submit it in connection with his appeal.  In the event he failed to submit the certificate and the appeals officer decided the case on the basis of the evidence <Col N="1224" /> before him.  The onus of providing medical evidence to support his appeal rests with the claimant but if a consultant's report is provided by the claimant the question of paying a fee to the consultant will be considered.</P>

She was requested at the time to furnish particulars of her earnings in the 1978-79 tax year, which determines her entitlement to pay related benefit, but she failed to do so.  Inquiries addressed to her employer have since established her reckonable earnings in that year and a cheque in payment of the arrears of pay-related benefit due has issued.</P>
